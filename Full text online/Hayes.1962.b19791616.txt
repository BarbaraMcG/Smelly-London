Page 2 MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT Tel: HAYes 1901. Public Health Department, Springfield House, Hayes End Road, Hayes, Middlesex. May, 1963. To the Chairman and Members of the Council. Mr. Chairman, Councillor Mrs. Johnson and Gentlemen, The term "vital statistics" is now one of common rather than specialised usage and it is almost with diffidence that I offer any comment on those for the district during 1962. Although the birth rate is the sane as in 1961, the figures for the still birth, neo-natal and perinatal mortality rates are much higher and give cause for concern, especially after their improvement in 1961. The death rate is a little lower, but there is an increase in deaths from the cardiovascular group of diseases, including coronary disease. During the latter part of the year the Public Health Committee took over the responsibility for Home Safety activities in the district, and a part-time Home Safety Officer was appointed. She has given talks to various organisations in the district, and arranged demonstrations and competitions. Knowledge of her existence is spreading in the district and there is a growing demand for her services. At the Council's Delegate Conference held in November the Public Health Department again put on exhibitions. This time they were concerned with clean air, housing improvement grants, food hygiene, and home safety. Many people visited the stands and discussed the material with the officers on duty. Medical points continue to be awarded to housing applicants. The number of applicants who submit certificates is lower now than in 1960 when the scheme started. Some of the diseases cited are severe, but the majority of certificates refer to recurrent bronchitis, asthma, colds, and to behaviour disorders in children. These ailments are undramatic and occur commonly throughout the population, but it is quite certain that living 3 in cramped conditions and in close proximity to other people it is far easier for upper respiratory infections to be passed to and fro round the family. The associated feeling of being "offcolour" leads to intolerance, frayed tempers and a lack of harmony which snowballs into alpine peaks of hatred. The problem of the old person living alone, with a strong feeling of independence but insufficient physical strength to back it up, is ever present. Many kinds of help, both statutory and voluntary, are available for these people, but it is extremely difficult to persuade them to accept any. Fortunately it has been possible to avoid compulsory removal from their home of any old person during 1962. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work done in this district by the voluntary Old People's Welfare Committee which provides meals on wheels five days a week as well as visitors and recreational and other facilities. 1962 brought some interesting problems in food hygiene, about which more will be found in the text of this report. The year has been notable in that there have been no staff changes in the department so that it has been possible to widen the scope of its activities and I would like to thank all the members for their willing work. In conclusion I thank the members of the Council, and especially of the Public Health Committee for their interest and support during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Councillor Mrs. Johnson and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAH Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Polulation (census 1961) 67,912 Population (midryear 1962) Registrar General's estimate of civilian population 68,310 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1962 20,504 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1962 £1,3 23,562 Product of penny rate £5,721 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live births: M F Total Legitimate 578 593 1,171 Illegitimate 31 22 53 1,224 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 17.9 Comparability factor is 0. 96 giving a corrected birth rate of 17.2 Birth rate for England and Wales 18.0 Illegitimate live births expressed as a percentage of total live births 4.3 Still births: M F Total Legitimate 10 13 23 Illegitimate - - - 23 Rate per 1,000 live and still births 18.4 Total live and still births: M F Total 619 628 1,247 Infant mortality (deaths under 1 year) M F Total Legitimate 16 7 23 Illegitimate 1 1 2 25 5 England & Wales Total infant deaths per 1,000 live births 20.4 21.4 Legitimate infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 19.6 Illegitimate infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 37.7 Neo-natal deaths & mortality rate: M F Total Neo-natal deaths (under 4 weeks) Legitimate 14 6 20 Illegitimate - 1 1 21 Neo-natal mortality rate (deaths under 4 weeks) per 1,000 total live births 17.1 M P Total Early neo-natal deaths (under 1 week) Legitimate 11 6 17 Illegitimate - 1 1 18 Early neo-natal mortality rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births 14.7 Perinatal mortality rate (still births and deaths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) 32.9 Maternal mortality (including abortion): Number of deaths Rate per 1,000 total live and still births ..

This table was compiled from local figures and may differ from the total given by the Registrar General on page 8. 9 HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA INCLUDING CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Food Poisoning. In the summer of 1963, food poisoning engaged our attention to a greater extent than it does normally, owing to the occurrence of 2 incidents in swift succession. The first arose from cold cooked ham which was contaminated with staphylococcus aureus, a germ which is often found on the skin. This germ produces a toxin which causes an illness characterised by violent abdominal pain, acute vomiting and diarrhoea often accompanied by prostration. Fortunately the victims usually recover in about 24 hours. In this instance only 7 people are known to have suffered, but investigation of the ham itself and of others from the same supplier showed that at least 8 were heavily contaminated and a potential source of unpleasant illness. The second incident occurred in Austria, but was proved to have arisen from food prepared by and consumed aboard a plane operated by an airline in this district. The food concerned was cold chicken and ham and the bacterial agent once again was staphylococcus aureus. As a result of this occurrence and with help from Dr. Betty Kobbs, at the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, a detailed investigation was made of the methods used by various airline caterers for the preparation and storage of meals for consumption aboard aircraft. The problems involved are unique to the industry and an outline of then will be found in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector on pages 37 to 40. Immunisation and Vaccination. I am indebted to the Area Medical Officer for the figures on pages 11 and 13 which show the number of children and others vaccinated and immunised during 1962. The use of combined diphtheria/whooping cough/tetanus antigens continues to increase and the number of people newly immunised against tetanus is more than double that for the previous year. In spite of the introduction of oral poliomyelitis vaccine the number of primary vaccinations was much lower than in 1961. in fact the figure (1,500) compares with the number of births in the district in 1961 (1,215) and it is likely that future 10 figures will continue at this level as most of the adults and older children who wish it have already been vaccinated. The most remarkable set of figures in these tables are those for vaccination against smallpox. These show a tenfold increase for primary vaccination and a fiftyfold increase for re-vaccination. This was due to the panic which swept the country following the occurrence of anumber of cases of smallpox in Yorkshire and Wales, and which I commented upon in my last report. VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox Vaccination Poliomyelitis Vaccination Primary He- Vaccination Primary Re- Vaccination 1958 659 141 10,278 3,299 1959 865 177 8,050 11,403 1960 737 241 4,915 6,165 1961 959 245 4,504 5,795 1962 8,348 11,360 1,506 3,356 Maternity and Child Welfare Services etc. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council and there are numerous sessions for ante-natal and post-natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services in clinic buildings, church halls, schools and the mobile clinic. Medical Examination of Council Employees. The total number of examinations carried out during 1962 was 128. Of these 30 were for superannuation purposes alone, 24 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, 36 for Sick Pay and Superannuation, 39 for various special purposes. 11 Water Supply. Water is supplied to the district by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and the South West Suburban District Water Company. The supply is adequate and samples taken during the year have reached a satisfactory standard. The water in this district is hard and does not have plumbosolvent action. Its natural fluoride content is below 1 part per million of water and so it was a pleasure to learn of the Minister of Health's decision to accept proposals for adjusting this. Steps were taken to ensure that the County Council and neighbouring authorities were aware of this Council's wish to have the fluoride content brought to a level of 1 p.p.m. but final action rests with the local health authority. There are no dwellings supplied by standpipes, but there are approximately 135 caravans in the district and these draw their water from standpipes on various sites. Samples from these pipes have been satisfactory. One house, which has 3 occupants is still supplied by a well. The water has been unsatisfactory for some time but it seems likely that the house may be connected to a mains supply during the coming year. Meanwhile all the water used for drinking etc. should be boiled. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment. There are now 7 establishments registered under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Six of these are for chiropody and one for physiotherapy and all are of satisfactory standard. 12 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION, 1962 Born in Years NUMBER OP CHILDREN IMMUNISED Diphtheria only Whooping cough only Tetanus only Combined Diphtheria/ Whooping cough Combined Diphtheria/ Tetanus Combined Diphtheria/ Whooping cough/ Tetanus First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster 1961 - 1962 - 3 - - - 1 1 - 6 15 995 86 1958 - 1960 1 6 3 1 29 1 2 1 13 124 86 213 1953 - 1957 4 34 - - 159 1 2 4 17 258 13 92 1948 - 1952 6 41 - - 192 6 - 2 16 256 3 23 TOTAL 11 84 3 1 380 9 5 7 52 653 1097 414 13 TUBERCULOSIS New cases and mortality during the year, 1962 Age Periods New cases Mortali ty Respiratory NonRespiratory Respiratory NonRespiratory M F M F M F M F Under 5 years - - - - - - - - 5 - 14 2 2 - 1 - - - - 15 - 24 2 - - - - - - - 25 - 44 7 3 1 - - - - - 45 - 64 4 1 - 1 1 - - - 65 & over 2 1 - - - 2 - - Age unknown - - - - - - - - TOTALS 17 7 1 2 1 2 - - New cases Deaths 1957 49 8 1958 45 6 1959 43 5 1960 35 7 1961 37 5 1962 27 3 B.

Coming, as it does, after unsatisfactory reports in 1960 and 1061 it is a great pleasure to be able to report that a high standard was achieved in all branches of our work and new ground was broken in Health Education and in the control of houses in multiple occupation. No staff vacancies occurred during the year, in fact due to the return of an Inspector from military service in July the Department enjoyed (literally) the unique experience of being overstaffed for the remainder of the year. During this period all arrears of work were cleared up and great strides were made in expanding the Health Education service which was started last year. In co-operation with the Heads of local Senior Schools lectures were given by the Public Health Inspectors to pupils on food hygiene; talks on this subject were also given to groups of food handlers from provision shops, butchers shops, cafes, canteens, and restaurants in our main shopping areas whilst talks on a wider range of Public Health subjects were given to various local organisations. On these occasions fill strips and cine films were extensively used and I am indebted to the Clerk of the Council for permission to use his Department's cine projector and to the many commercial organisations that have produced and readily made available, cine films of excellent educational value. The other outstanding development during the year was in the control of houses in multiple occupation. In February the Council adopted standards under Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961, for the provision of additional amenities in houses occupied by more than one family. Subsequently Circular 16/62 from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government offered guidance to Local Authorities on the manner in which the new powers in the 1961 Act should be used. It was found that the standards already adopted by the Council were in line with the Ministry's somewhat belated suggestions. The resolute use of the new powers in conjunction with the use of Planning powers has kept under control a situation that threatened to get out of hand. The compulsory improvement and modernisation of houses, as advocated by the General Council of the Association of Public Health Inspectors, and endorsed by my Council, was brought one 17 step nearer by the Minister of Housing and Local Government's Circular 42/62, urging Local Authorities to make a determined and sustained effort to bring about a big increase in the number of houses being improved. On consideration of the Circular the Council declared its belief that good housing was one of the basic necessities for a healthy and happy life and approved in principle an all-out effort being made to provide every house in the District, where practicable, with the five standard air.enities. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following headings: I. Sanitary Administration, viz:- inspection of the district, summary of complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage and sewerage, keeping of animals, rodent control, destruction of vermin and insect pests, disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses.

As rontine inspections of this nature are the basis of sound public health administration this increase is most welcome. Complaints. The number of complaints received varies little, either in total or on specific matters, from last year:- Choked and defective drains 277 Insanitary or dilapidated condition of houses or premises 94 Offensive accumulations or deposits 20 Defective dustbins 19 Vermin or insects 62 Gypsies 6 Rat and mouse infestations 278 Unsound food 27 Nuisances from animals 6 Overcrowding 5 Dust, smoke and noise nuisances 41 Other nuisances 45 Total 880 Notices Served.

Section 93. Proceedings were taken against the landlord of two dwellings for failing to comply with Abatement Notices: He was fined £3 together with 1½ guineas costs on each of two sunanonses. Offensive Trades. There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on. In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage and Sewerage. The table below includes all premises in the district which are not on main drainage. There are now only four premises within a reasonable distance of a sewer which still retain cesspools or pail closets and one of these is likely to be dealt with in the near future. The figures in the table show a reduction of four cesspools and five pail closets as compared with last year. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging was continued. Cesspool drainage Pail closets A. Preuises within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 3 1 B. Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension - 2 C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available 13 5 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon 4 - Totals 20 8 22 Pour small private sewage disposal plants are in use. A 50% grant is available for tbe conversion of pail closets to water closets and for the abolition of cesspools. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure etc. Rodent Control. Infestation in the District is at a very low level and one assistant, with many duties in addition to rodent control is well able to cope with all the treatment necessary. At dwellings this is free but a charge is made for work carried out at business premises. The statistical report on rodent control is set out in Appendix II. Destruction of Vermin and Insect Pests. During the year the following treatments were carried out: - Ants 24 Bugs 2 Pleas 2 Cockroaches 7 Wasps 2 Disinfection. In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases. All library books, however, which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library. 23 Facilities for the steam disinfection of bedding are avail able when required at St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, but it has not been necessary to use these facilities during the year. Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses, etc. The routine inspection of these sites for rodent infestation, pollution, general nuisances and mosquitoes was carried out and remedial action taken where necessary. Their number is being gradually reduced and during the year Harlington pond was filled in. The canal feeder, which runs across the northern Part of the District, is a constant source of trouble and it would be a big improvement if this too could be filled in or culverted. 24 PART II - AIR POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas. The tea-year programme to bring the whole of the Urban District under Smoke Control continued according to schedule and By the end of the year the following progress had been made:- No. of Smoke Control Orders Acres No. of Dwellings Involved Other Buildings Involved Local Authority Private In operation 19 3,800 2.068 8,727 665 Confirmed but not yet in operation 2 265 50 1,785 73 Submitted for confirmation - - - - - Preparatory work in progress 1 76 294 576 22 Totals 22 4,141 2,412 11,088 760 These areas account for 80% of the area of the district and 66% of the dwellings in the district. The establishment of Smoke Control Areas has proceeded smoothly and is now regarded in the Department as routine work. Before a Smoke Control Order is made for any part of the District agreat deal of trouble is taken to explain to residents in the area the effect of the Order and the benefits likely to accrue. An assistant makes a personal call at every house for this purpose. Further consideration was given by the Council to the peculiar situation arising from the wording of the Clean Air Act whereby a person who already has a suitable gas or electric point to which a firelighter can be connected is not entitled to a grant on the actual gas poker or electric kindler; but if a suitable point is not available then grant may be paid on both the appliance and the cost of providing a point. The legal niceties which give rise to this situation are not readily understood by the man-in-the-street. To avoid anomalies 25 the Council decided not to make grants at all for the actual lighting appliance; this decision has found general acceptance with the public and in the very few cases where an applicant has felt aggrieved a personal chat and explanation of the Council's point of view has usually cleared the air. No exemptions to Smoke Control Orders have been granted except in the case of premises likely to be demolished in the near future. Exemptions permitting the use of sticks and paper for kindling have not been necessary as gas is readily available throughout the district and where a householder has a rooted objection to the use of gas, electricity is invariably available as an alternative. (b) Height of Oiimneys. Under Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, 1056 plans of new industrial buildings deposited for byelaw approval must be rejected if the height of any chimney shown on the plan is insufficient to prevent smoke, grit, dust or gases from becoming prejudicial to health or a nuisance. This is the only provision in the Clean Air Act for reducing the harmful effects of gases, e.g. sulphur dioxide, emitted from chimneys. Plans submitted for byelaw approval are passed to me by the Engineer and Surveyor for a decision on this particular point. It is usual for builders or architects to consult me before plans are submitted, thus ensuring that an agreed chimney height is incorporated in the plans at the time of submission. During the year eight plans were examined for this purpose and in three instances it was necessary to ask for a taller chimney than was shown on the plan. (c) New Furnaces. Thirteen notifications under Section 3(3) of the Clean Air Act were received regarding the installation of new furnaces; seven were oil-fired, three gas fired and three fired by solid fuel. One application for prior approval under Section 3(2) of the Act was received and as the furnace fully complied with the Council's requirements, was granted. 26 (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. These regulations lay down tbe maximum period for which dark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. Industrial boiler plant in the District is now operated at a very high degree of efficiency and most installetions are, for all practical purposes, entirely smokeless in operation. No contraventions were observed during the year. (e) Grit and Dust. Several complaints were received about dust emission from one particular factory where a new manufacturing process had been introduced. Dust extraction plant had been installed which was satisfactory when working properly but unfortunately proved to be unreliable. The firm concerned were co-operative and there is every reason to believe that the trouble will be cured soon. ({) New Building Byelaws re. Heating and Cooking Appliances. A new building byelaw, made under Section 24 of the Clean Air Act, has been in force in this district from the 1st September, 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating and cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, oil or solid smokeless fuel. (g) Pollution from Road Vehicles. Although the Council has no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co-operative attitude is met with. Ten letters were written to the owners of offending vehicles and in most cases an apology was received together with an undertaking that immediate steps would be taken to prevent a recurrence. During the year the police took proceedings in three cases and fines varying from £2 to £10 were imposed. 27 (h) Pollution from Railway. The main line of the Western Region of British Railways which runs through the industrial part of the district is now largely dieselised. (i) Industrial Bonfires. Section 47 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1961, which closes one of the gaps in the Clean Air Act by prohibiting dark smoke from industrial bonfires, came into operation on the 1st January and has proved a most valuable additional aid in the clean air campaign. The inclusion of this Section in the new Middlesex County Council Act was proposed and sponsored by this Authority. In addition to the usual type of factory bonfire consisting of paper, cardboard, oily waste, and general rubbish the powers have been used to put a stop to the following sources of dense black smoke: - burning car bodies, burning insulated cable for recovery of copper, burning highly inflammable waste solvents and paint. (j) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution. Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. During the year the form in which pollution is expressed was changed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research: sulphur dioxide, formerly given in parts per 100 million is now given in microgrammes per cubic metre; and smoke, formerly given in milligrammes per 100 cubic metres is now also given in microgrammes per cubic metre. In the case of sulphur dioxide the old figures can be converted to the new by multiplying by 28.6 and in the case of smoke by multiplying by 10. Phen commenting in previous reports on pollution figures, I have stressed the need to look at the trend over a fairly long period rather than to compare the figures for two consecutive years. This was to discourage any feeling of selfsatisfaction or complacency that the constantly improving figures might have given rise to. The figures shown on page 32 however, for the first time since measurements began, represent 28 an all-round set-back, due entirely, in my opinion, to the abnormal meteorological conditions during the year. The amount of pollution is directly proportional, in a given area, to the amount of fuel burned in that area and the amount of fuel burned is directly related to the atmospheric temperature; the lower the temperature and the more fuel, of all kinds, is burned. According to information supplied by the Meteorological Office, every month in 1962, except January and February, was colder than the average for the past 10 years and considerably colder than the corresponding month of 1961. Further, dense fog always has a disastrous effect on pollution figures and December saw the worst fog for 10 years. Under these circumstances therefore it is not surprising that the pollution figures last year were worse than 1961; they were, however, better than i960 or any previous year. A report was received from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on the special investigation mentioned last year into pollution in the Bath Road area a£ measured at the William Byrd School. The following extracts give the main points of the report "The two temporary sites had the same amount of smoke from both north and south, while the school had less smoke from the north, but from the south the same amount as at the other two sites. During north winds therefore a small additional source of smoke was affecting the two temporary sites which did not affect the school; this could only have been the Bath Road and the few houses beside the road at this point. During south winds this same source or sources must have affected the school; any smoke from the airport might have affected all three sites, but would chiefly affect the temporary ones. There was no difference in the average smoke values at the three sites during south winds, which suggests that any contribution from the airport was small, and of about the same order as that from the road and half-dozen or so houses." "The temporary site close to the Bath Road had more sulphur dioxide at all times than had either the school or the second temporary site farther south-west. This indicates that there was a local source of sulphur dioxide lying to the east of all three sites, but nearer to the middle site than to either of the others. The presumption is that the large factory nearby 29 was responsible, but this cannot be proved without more detailed studies." "Even the highest levels recorded were however lower than those found in central London or in the industrial towns of the north at the same time of year, and were about the same as those in several other London suburbs." "All concentrations were very low, and it is safer to rely on the consistency of relationships between results than upon the rather small differences between actual values." The two temporary sites referred to in the first line of the report were situated in the rear garden of No. 31 Bath Road (south side) and in a builder's yard adjoining the perimeter track of the Airport and very close to Runway No. 1. 30 Monthly Averages for Sulpher Dioxide, 1962 (Microgranmies per cubic metre) William Byrd Scnool, Bath Road Coldhcrbour Lane Grange Park School, Lansbury Drive January 85 144 218 February 81 52 160 March 97 230 275 April 33 85 93 May 32 70 74 June 40 33 62 July 31 51 53 August 20 42 29 September 31 51 49 October 98 149 175 November 116 141 180 December 247 406 403 Monthly Averages for Smoke, 1962 (Microgrammes per cubic metre) William byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School.

More than 10,000 leaflets were distributed in proposed and actual Smoke Control Areas. These leaflets are supplied free of charge by the Ministry, the Coal Utilisation Council, Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, the North Thames Gas Board and the Southern Electricity Board. (1) South Best Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee. Three meetings of the Committee were held during the year and the range of topics discussed included: - height of chimneys, price of solid smokeless fuel in paper bags, moisture in solid smokeless fuel, prior approval of furnaces, smoke warning systems, sale of coal in smoke control areas, clean air and fog, and solid smokeless fuel delivery difficulties. A standard set of conditions to be complied with before new furnaces are given prior approval under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act was agreed and subsequently adopted by each of the constituent authorities. The future of the Committee came under discussion and it was unanimously decided that it was serving a useful purpose and should continue in existence. All other Local Authorities who would, under the plan for London Local Government Re-organisation, become associated with the existing members, were invited to join the Committee and all but two accepted the invit ation. By the end of the year the following authorities with a Population of 654,990 and an area of 40,050 acres were represented on the revitalised Committee:- Acton Borough Council Brentford & Chiswick Borough Council Ealing Borough Council Felthara Urban District Council Hayes & Harlington Urban District Council Heston & Isleworth Borough Council Uuislip-Northwood Urban District Council Southall Borough Council 32 PART III - FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy faros and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are:- Milk Distributors 26 Dairies 2 Forty five samples of milk for bacteriological examination were taken by officers of the County Council and all were found to be satisfactory; in addition nine samples tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli were found to be satisfactory. Two licences were issued by the County Council in respect of the use of the special designation "Pasteurised" for milk processed within the district. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1959, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream. Fifteen premises are registered for the manufacture of ice cream but only two of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further 127 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream; in the majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. The methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are used by both manufacturers in the district. Forty-three samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, for bacteriological examination. The use of the special standard devised by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, has been continued and is, for convenience, set out as follows:- 33 Grade Count Faecal Coli I Below 500 Nil II 500 - 10.000 Nil III 10,000 - 100 , 000 Nil IV over 100,000 or present The grading of samples taken was as follows:- Grade I 12 or 27.90% Grade II 24 or 55.82% Grade III 2 or 4.65% Grade IV 5 or 11.63% These results, with nearly 84% of the samples falling in Grades I and II, are the best we have ever had. No attempt was made to obtain artificially good results by taking large numbers of samples from the national manufacturers, whose products are of consistently good bacteriological quality; the samples were taken almost exclusively from manufacturers and itinerant vendors whose products have been found to be unreliable in this respect. All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. Ihe Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. By Orders (S.I. Nos. 2154 and 2155 - 1960) made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under The Slaughterbouse Reports (Appointed Day) Order, 1959 the Construction Regulations contained in the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958. and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations, 1958, are in force. There are now no licensed slaughterhouses in the district. A large proportion of the meat sold in the district comes from the London wholesale markets and there does not appear to be any demand from the trade for slaughtering facilities in this district. One slaughterman's licence was issued. 34 The following foods were condemned during the year:- Meat (tinned) 4,341 lbs. Meat (offal)145 lbs. Heat (raw) 4,321 lbs. Heat (cooked) 224 lbs. Pish (tinned) 72 lbs. Pish (raw) 426 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 15,790 lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 989 lbs. Miscellaneous Pood (tinned) 717 lbs. Other Miscellaneous Pood 504 lbs. Frozen Pish 36 lbs. Frozen Fruit 7 lbs. Frozen (Miscellaneous) Food 125 lbs. Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried, under supervision, on the Council's refuse tip. Food Hygiene. The structural standard of food premises is, with very few exceptions, satisfactory. There is however no doubt that the standard of food handling still leaves much to be desired and the need for education in the basic principles of food hygiene is a most pressing need for persons engaged in the food trade. It is true, I think, that this kind of work can most effectively be done at the actual place of work of the food handler, by pointing out undesirable practices and suggesting better and safer methods. But when small groups of food handlers can be gathered together other forms of health education become practicable, i.e. the use of film strips, cine films and display material. During the year these forms were used on an increasingly large scale. Thirteen lectures were given to a total of 193 food handlers, from canteens, hotels, bakehouses, shops, restaurant kitchens etc. and, looking to the future, talks and fill" shows on the basic principles of hygienic food handling were given to 800 senior girls, in small groups, in local schools. No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, have been granted. Bye laws under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950. 35 Aircraft Catering. An outbreak of food poisoning among passengers in an aircraft showed the need for special attention to this form of catering, particularly as one firm in the district is now catering for 30 air lines operating from London Airport. Investigations were carried out by Mr. Moreland, Senior Additional Public Health Inspector in close co-operation with Dr. Betty Kobbs of the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, and his report is set out below:- "A considerable amount of catering for airline passengers is carried on within this District either directly by the AirCompanies themselves or by outside Caterers. This involves the preparation of a wide variety of foods, transport to the aircraft, loading, storage on board and eventual service to the passengers some time later. "A major proportion of the food involved is susceptible to bacterial growth and the methods employed have to ensure (a) the prevention, as far as possible, of contamination during all stages of the operations, and (b) that the susceptible foods are stored under conditions which inhibit the growth of any bacteria which may be present. "The dangers involved were emphasized by the recent occurrence of bacterial food poisoning among aircraft passengers and, as a result, it was decided to submit representative specimens of such meals for examination to the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. "This type of catering may be broadly divided into two categories. In the one instance the food is cooked and kept hot in electrically heated containers until served to the passengers. The containers are portable and are connected directly to the electrical system of the aircraft or, via a transformer, to the mains electricity supply. This method is ideal and provided the temperature does not fall below 145°F (62.7°C) presents little danger. Such a method is used when the meals can be prepared and taken to the aircraft immediately before take-off but where, due to flight schedules etc., this arrangement is not possible, the food is cooked, cooled and re-heated prior to service on the aircraft. This second method is only Possible when there is sufficient time for the aircraft ovens 36 to heat up and it ensures that the food is served in an appetizing form. In addition there are the foods which are cooked, cooled and served cold, such as meat, chicken and ham used in sandwiches and salads. "It was on the pre-cooked type of meal intended for reheating that attention was focussed and bearing in mind that the numbers of bacteria present would have increased considerably by the time the meal was consumed (dependent on the time and temperature factors) the initial results proved rather alarming. "In all cases the premises in use complied with the requirements of the Pood Hygiene Regulations and the only criticism which could be made was that the space available was rather limited. "The standard of cleanliness and personal hygiene at the catering establishments was very good and the results obtained from laboratory examination would not have been the cause for undue concern had the food been destined for immediate consumption. "The problem facing the Department was to raise the bacterial standard of the meals produced by reducing the counts to a sufficiently low level and for this purpose attention was concentrated on the following points:- 1. Education of the food handlers. 2. Methods of handling and preparation. 3. Methods of storage and transport. "A programme of Health Education was already in operation in the District which included talks on the hygiene of food handling. Talks were given to all persons engaged in aircraft catering and in this respect we were particularly fortunate in being able to borrow material from the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, in the form of illustrated charts and plates of bacterial colonies and these were used together with the Department's projector and film strips. This was followed later on with the showing of various films on the subject. These talks were well received and the numerous questions asket' showed that an intelligent interest was taken. 37 "The fact that the meals are made up individually into small casseroles and the time factor involved was the reason for the large amount of handling of the food which took place and it was not found possible to reduce this to any great extent. Following a suggestion made by Dr. Hobbs of the Central Public Health Laboratory the use of anti-bacterial hand-washing cream was recommended and this is in use at the present time on a trial basis. It is claimed to be far more effective than ordinary soap in securing the elimination of bacteria from the skin surface and its continued use is supposed to create a condition which inhibits bacterial growth. "The importance of rapid cooling to minimize bacterial growth was emphasized and failure to do this was considered to be the main cause for the high counts being obtained, as invariably it was found that insufficient supervision was being given to this particular aspect of food preparation - poultry and meat being allowed to cool down slowly prior to refrigeration with no control over temperature rises through frequent removal from the refrigerator. "This practice has now been changed. In one instance poultry and meat are being cooked and following an interval of a few minutes are put into deep freeze for a time, to allow complete cooling and then removed to another refrigerator. In a second case a cooling unit has been devised specifically for the purpose consisting of an inner chest surrounded by 'dry ice', in which poultry is cooled rapidly and then refrigerated. "It was originally the practice to place dry ice in the casserole containers leaving it there until the heating units were switched on aboard the aircraft but this was abandoned due to difficulties in practice. However, following recommendations from this Department this practice was resumed. "The first results obtained from the bacteriological examination of foodstuffs gave surface plate counts at 37°C of from 3,000,000 to 2,000 per gramme and in several cases coagulasepositive staphylococci were found on enrichment cultures. "Swabs taken from the hands, nose, throat and (where ap Plicable) lesions showed that a fairly high proportion of' food handlers carried coagulase positive staphylococci of a type which could cause food poisoning. In view of this high incidence it was decided that exclusion of the persons concerned 38 would be impracticable and that the only solution was to improve personal hygiene. An interesting fact which arose from the results of swabs from skin lesions was that while food handlers were scrupulously careful in keeping cuts etc. covered they tended to discontinue the use of dressings when the lesion was practically healed, but in several cases coagulase-positive staphylococci of a type associated with food poisoning were isolated from such lesions. "Some of the most recent results obtained are given below. They show that food can be produced with a low bacterial count and it is hoped that these standards will be maintained. Foodstuff Surface plate Count per gram at 37°C Direct Cultures Enrichment Cultures Cooked chicken less than 500 No bacterial growth Coagulasepositive staphylococci not found Cooked veal 500 Very scanty growth of aerobic sporing bacilli Coagulasepositive staphylococci not found Cooked steak less than 500 No bacterial growth Coagulasepositive staphylococci not found Hawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and, since the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, came into force, has extended to all classes of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Mobile shops from which groceries, meat, fish, ice crean, refreshments, etc. are sold, are all fitted with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. 39 It is Decommg increasingly common For these traders 10 claim that they buy their produce daily from wholesalers and that storage accommodation is not required. Provided unsold produce is kept overnight in a totally enclosed but adequately ventilated vehicle parked in a suitable place, no harm can result. But occasionally an opportunity to make a favourable purchase in excess of daily requirements might occur and under these circumstances unsuitable storage accommodation might be used. This risk is being watched. Number of hawkers registered 70 Number of hawkers' storage premises registered 9 Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) The routine sampling of miscellaneous foods was recommenced during the year. The following samples were examined: - Cream cookies etc. 11 Imitation cream 17 Shell fish 1 Cooked and tinned meats 41 70 There are no bacteriological standards for these foods but excessive bacterial growth or the presence of organisms of faecal origin are undesirable and point to the need for greater care in handling. When the bacteriologist's reports show either of these failings, special attention is paid to hygienic conditions at the shop concerned. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water etc. is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory, for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following table and supplementary information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer:- 40 Total Samples Article Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 112 1 Milk (various) 11 - Butter and margarine 26 - Cream 17 - Drugs 2 - Fish and fish products 19 Fruit (fresh and canned and dried) 28 3 Ice cream 19 Liver 10 Meat and meat products 29 Sweets 6 Vegetables 4 Vinegar 15 Miscellaneous 19 Total 317 4 "The unsatisfactory sample of milk was found to be low in milk fat, but the sample was from one churn, and the remainder of the churns sent at the same time by the farmer concerned, were satisfactory, and the quality of the bulked milk was of satisfactory standard. For this reason no action was taken in respect of the incorrect sample. Two instances were found of Clementines which were claimed by means of labels on the stacks to be "seedless". In respect of one of these stacks the greengrocer concerned was prosecuted, and fined six pounds, together with three guineas towards the costs, for selling Clementines described as seedless which were found to contain an average of twenty pips in each fruit. A letter of warning was sent to the importers of dried apricots which were found on analysis to contain sulphur dioxide (a preservative) the presence of which must be declared on the label. The quantity of sulphur dioxide was less than that permitted by the Regulations and the sample would have been satisfactory had the presence of preservative been declared. "In addition to samples purchased in the District labelled stacks and displays of fish (59), meat (127), apples (91). citrus fruit (35), vegetables (13), potatoes (20), and plums (8) were examined in 104 shops. Formal samples are selectively 41 procured from retail shops based on these examinations of labelled displays of natural foods, where there is doubt as to the accuracy of the label, or where there is need for further examination. The inspectors of the Department have over a number of years acquired aconsiderable expertise in the identification of cuts of meat and of varieties of fish and fruit. The only infringement arising in your District was in relation to the seedlees Clementines mentioned in the last paragraph. During 1962 new regulations have been introduced dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers in food, and dealing with preservatives in food. In addition there has been an amended Pood Standard relating to table jellies. The effect of the Regulations dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers and with preservatives, is to define and limit the additives which are permitted and, (in the case of preservatives), to extend the range of foods and the types of preservatives which are allowed, but nevertheless closely limiting the quantities of such preservatives. No infringement arising from the new Regulations has been reported during the year. "Merchandise Marks Act. 1887 - 19S3. Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 107 premises, and stacks and displays of meat (28), apples (86), tomatoes (48), poultry (5), butter (103), dried fruit (80), and other foods (12), were examined. Only minor breaches of the Orders which were dealt with by warnings, have been disclosed. Under the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, it is an offence to apply false trade descriptions to goods. For selling eggs under the description "small eggs" (which should weigh between one and one half ounces and one ounce ten drams), six eggs all of which were less than one ounce and one half, a firm of butchers were prosecuted, and were given absolute discharge on payment of five guineas towards the costs. "The Labelling of Food Order. 1953. This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. A total of forty five premises have been visited in connection with the 42 Order, and 182 items of food were exarined. No infringements were disclosed." Food Poisoning. Three outbreaks of food poisoning involving in all thirtythree persons occurred during the year. The causative organism in one case involving seven persons was Staphylococcus Aureus, in another involving fourteen persons was a coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, whilst in the third case, involving twelve persons the causative organism was not found. Complaints about Pood. Twenty-seven complaints were received, compared with twenty-two last year, and forty the year before, about food alleged to be contaminated, unsound or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded. Many were of a trivial nature and it was decided to take proceedings in one case only. Inspection of Food Prenises.

At the beginning of the year there were 13 known cases of overcrowding. During the year ten new cases were discoverecd but 20 cases were abated so that the number of known cases at 46 the end of the year was only three. In nine of the new cases an offence under Section 78 of the Housing Act. 1957 was committed and the Council decided to take action against the owners concerned unless the overcrowding was abated within fourteen days. In each instance Commonwealth immigrants were involved. Legal action was not necessary as abatement of the overcrowding took place within the specified time. The average number of occupants for each inhabited house in the district was 3.33, the same as last year, which was the lowest figure since 1938. Houses in Multiple Occupation. By a fortunate coincidence the Housing Act, 1961, containing powers to deal with the multiple occupation of dwellings came into force at about the same time that it was discovered that houses in the District were being occupied in this way. In February the Council adopted the following standards for houses occupied by more than one family:- Natural and Artificial Lighting: Every habitable room shall be provided with a window or windows opening directly to the external air and having, where practicable, an area equal to at least one tenth of the floor area. Adequate means of artificial lighting shall be available during hours of darkness to every habitable room, kitchen, scullery, bathroom, water closet, staircase, landing, corridor and passage, and the means of operating such lighting shall be readily available to all persons properly within the said habitable room, kitchen etc. Ventilation: Adequate means of ventilation shall be provided and maintained for every room, passage and staircase, water closet and bathroom. The windows of habitable rooms must be capable of being opened, where practicable, for an area equal to one twentieth of the floor area of the room. Water Supply: a sufficient supply of water direct from the mains shall be provided to each of the sinks installed in compliance with the requirements for the storage and preparation and cooking of food and disposal of waste water mentioned in the following paragraph. 47 Personal Washing Facilities, Facilities for the Storage, Preparation and Cooking of Food and Disposal of Waste Water: There shall be separately provided for every part of the house which is occupied as a separate dwelling a food store, sink and waste pipe, water supply and a suitable gas or electric point for use with a cooker. Such facilities shall not be installed on a common landing. In addition, adequate facilities shall be provided to enable all occupants of the bouse to carry out proper personal washing in a fixed bath or shower supplied with hot and cold water. Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences: The number of water closets shall be as follows: One water closet for every three separate lettings or one water closet for every eight persons (irrespective of age) whichever gives the higher number. To comply with this standard any water closet must be readily accessible to the person for whom it is intended. Installations for Space Heating or for the use of Space Heating Appliances: Within every habitable room which is not provided with adequate heat from an efficient central heating system there shall be provided:- (i) A proper hearth, chimney opening and flue suitable for the reception of a proper and adequate space heating appliance (for use with solid, gaseous or liquid fuel) and where the fuel to be used is gas a suitable and convenient gas supply, or (ii) An adequate and properly positioned number of suitable electric power points. Twenty-two notices were served for the provision of additional facilities in accordance with these standards and in a large majority of cases these were complied with by the person concerned substantially reducing the number of occupants of the premises. Certificates of Disrepair. The following action was taken under the Rent Act, 1957, in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:- 48 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 11 Landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 12 Undertakings given by Landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 5 Undertakings by Landlords not accepted - Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 8 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) 4 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair refused (Form R. C. 3.) 1 Certificates of Disrepair cancelled (Form B.C. 2.) .. 4 Applications by Landlord or Tenant for Certificate as to the remedying of Defects which Landlord has undertaken to remedy (Form 0) 17 Certificates issued as to the Remedying of Defects specified in a Landlord's Undertaking to remedy Defects (Form P) 15 Improvement Grants. Only nine applications for Standard Grants were received and all were granted. Two applications for Discretionary Grants were received and the maximum grant approved in each case. Consideration was given by the Council to Circular 42/62 in which the Minister of Housing and Local Government urged Local Authorities to take positive action to stimulate applications for grants, and to consider, if necessary, the use of compulsory purchase powers so that the Council could do the improvement themselves. The Council agreed in principle with the Minister's suggestions and authorised me to submit proposals for putting them into effect. Moveable Dwellings. To avoid involving both the Public Health Committee and Town Planning Committee in this matter and as planning consent is an essential preliminary to a site licence, the enforcement of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, has been entrusted to the Town Planning Committee. Consultation between the Engineer and Surveyor's Department and the Public Health Department takes place on applications for Site Licences. 49 New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and Private Developers Council: Houses 37 Old Persons' Dwellings - Plats - Maisonettes - Private Development: Dwellings 110 Housing Association: Dwellings - 50 PART V - FACTORIES, SHOPS, OFFICES, ETC. Factories. There are one hundred and sixty two factories with mechanical power and five factories without cechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including:- Aircraft, bread and confectionery, building materials, canned fruit, car accessories, caravans, carbon products, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, cold stores, electrical condensors and transformers, electronic devices, fibre glass articles, furniture, lubricating oil, meat products, optical lenses, plastics, precision tools, radar, gramophone records, rubber products, tarmacadam, steel wool and wood block floors. Pull details of the inspections carried out and notices served are set out in Appendix I to this report. Outworkers. Part VII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons carrying out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. There are 193 outworkers in the district and 347 inspections were made; in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops . All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to 672 premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 1,077 visits. As a result one informal notice was served but it was not considered necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises, is held in the Public Health Department. Offices, Workplaces, etc. The Offices Act, 1960, came into operation on the 1st January, 51 but as no Regulations had been made thereunder its effect was completely negative. Towards the end of the year the Offices, shops and Railway Premises Bill was published and if its provisions eventually become law it appears likely that most of the offices in this District will be inspected, not by the Public Health Inspectors, but by the Factory Inspectorate who are given responsibility for enforcement in offices in factories. For many years this Authority's Public Health Inspectors have made the best possible use of the meagre powers available for securing reasonable conditions in offices. All offices, whether in factories or otherwise, have been measured and full details of ventilation, lighting, number of persons employed, accommodation, washing facilities, etc. recorded. Cases of overcrowding have been remedied and ventilation improved. After these pioneering efforts it is disappointing to find that a large part of this work will now pass to other officers. 52 PART VI - MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcirn carbide. During the year 117 licences were issued in respect of:- 198,112 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures. 39,455 gallons of cellulose solutions. 896 lbs. of calcium carbide. All licences now incorporate the Model Licensing Conditions suggested by the Home Office in 1957. and the latest recommendations of the Home Office for electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps have been adopted. Electrical work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified member of the Engineer and Surveyor's staff. During the year 375 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and ten minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district the Act does not apply to any of them as the type of filling generally used is outside the scope of the Act. All premises used for upholstery and similar trades are visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and the type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas, electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted. Such appliances are sold at 42 shops in the district and all were visited by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Pour premises are licensed under the 53 Act and 9 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the Licence. Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act, relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and in this district, which is still partly rural, serve a useful purpose. Public Health Acts Auendaent Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the Local Authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises of which there are six, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. Swimming Pools. There is no public swimming pool in the district. A practice pool at a local secondary school is equipped with automatic dosing equipment and continuous filtration. There is a swimming pool at one of the new hotels in the district. Continuous filtration and automatic chlorination is carried out. Samples of water from both these pools were taken regularly and only two samples out of twelve at the school and one out of sixteen at the hotel were unsatisfactory. These results show that the arrangements for purification of the water were working satisfactorily. Official Searches^ During the year 1,517 applications for information from persons proposing to acquire premises in the district were dealt with. Each one required answers to questions about sanitary notices or orders (outstanding or contemplated), Smoke Control Orders, Certificates of Disrepair and Slum Clearance. Licensing Act, 1961. The above-mentioned legislation amended the conditions 54 governing the issue of licences for the supply of intoxicating liquor to private clubs. This Council is now informed of such applications by the Clerk to the Justices, and can object to the issue if the premises are not suitable and convenient, in view of their character and condition and the size and nature of the club. The Council appointed its Public Health Inspectors as "authorised officers" under the Act and details of the work carried out under this new duty are set out below: Applications for issue or renewal of licence investigated 21 Application withdrawn 1 Premises inspected and found satisfactory 10 Premises in course of erection in accordance with approved plans 3 Premises inspected and found to be unsatisfactory 7 Premises subsequently made satisfactory 6 The premises still remaining unsatisfactory were so considered because the sanitary accommodation was not readily accessible from the club; it was suggested that this should be rectified before the licence was again renewed and aconditional licence for twelve months was granted by the Justices. Noise Abatement. London Airport is by far the greatest source of noise in the District: aircraft however are exempt from the provisions of the Noise Abatement Act. Various bodies have made strenuous and persistent efforts to get the nuisance mitigated but with little effect. The statutory undertakings (gas, water, electricity etc.) are also substantial, if intermittent, contributors to the general noise level with their pneumatic road drills. But they too are exempt from the Act. An informal approach to them to use noise baffles, which are now available, met with a cool response. It was claimed that the use of baffles reduced the efficiency of the machines. Five complaints about noise from car-breaking, high speed grinder, radio and factory ventilation systems were dealt with informally and abated. A further complaint arising from a noisy fan was being dealt with at the end of the year. 55 56 Appendix I Part A.
