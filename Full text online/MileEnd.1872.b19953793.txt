The Vestry have the honor to lay before the ratepayers a report of their proceedings for the year which ended on the 25th March last; and in so doing hope to shew that they have been fully mindful of the many duties thrust upon them. Whilst executing works of considerable magnitude, and maintaining in efficiency those already completed, which are duties thrust upon them by statute, they have ever borne in mind their duty to those who elect them (the ratepayers), and have met all demands without increasing the rates. In pursuance of a memorial from this Vestry to the Metropolitan Board of Works, asking for an increase of the number of Vestrymen and their re-distribution among the various Wards of the Hamlet, that Board, under its statutory powers, granted the application, and the number was increased to 90, divided among the Wards as follows:— No. 1 or North Ward 18 2 „ East „ 18 3 „ West „ 15 4 „ Centre „ 21 5 „ South „ 18 During the year resolutions have been passed to carry out some most extensive and important works relating to the paving and sewerage of the Hamlet. Some of them have already been completed, whilst others arc in progress, or will be so very shortly. A full and complete description of them will be found in the Report of the Surveyor, annexed hereto, but the following may bo here mentioned as being of the greatest magnitude. 1. Paving the carriage ways of the Mile End and Commercial Roads, 2. Repaving part of the footways of the Mile End Road. 8 3. Constructing sewer in Bow Common Lane. The works mentioned under the two first heads had been for a long time accepted as a necessity, and the method of carrying them out under consideration, when a most favorable opportunity for borrowing the necessary money on advantageous terms presented itself, as hereafter set forth, which the Vestry at once accepted. Under the Metropolitan Board of Works Loans Act, 1871, that body is empowered to lend money to Vestries and District Boards for improvements of the kind above-mentioned, on the security of the rates. The Metropolitan Board being about to negociate another loan, and it being apparent that the money could be obtained from them at a less rate of interest than from any other source, application was made for a loan of £12,000, for the purpose of the paving of the Commercial Road, and the footpaths in Mile End Road. The loan has been agreed to be granted upon the terms that the principal shall be repaid by 20 equal annual instalments, with interest in the meantime on the balance remaining due, at £3 17s. 6d. per cent. A further sum will have to be borrowed to carry out the works in the Mile End Road, but it has been calculated that the saving which will be effected in horsehire, road materials, and other incidentals necessary for macadamized roads of the kind which are to be paved, will render it unnecessary to make an increase in the rates to provide for the interest or instalments; and it is confidently anticipated that the ratepayers will see that a most advantageous arrangement has been made, and will endorse favorably the proceedings of the Vestry. The tenders for paving the Commercial Road having been issued, that of Messrs. Mowlem & Co. was accepted. It is scarcely necessary to point to the very dilapidated state in which the road was, attention having been drawn to it in the report of your Surveyor last year, but it should be stated that numerous accidents are alleged to have taken place through it being so. The tenders for paving the Mile End Road will 9 shortly be invited, and it is to be hoped that all of the works contemplated will be completed by the autumn. The old stone to be removed from the two roads will, after being redressed, be used for crossings or channellings, or paving some of the streets of the Hamlet not already paved, as may be hereafter determined by the Vestry. In the autumn of last year, with a view of testing the merits of the asphalte and tar paving for footpaths, the Vestry caused the footway between Stepney Green and Jubilee Street to be paved in part with one and in part with the other of these materials. The asphalte has been found to answer admirably, and if it should be determined to use it on the other footpaths to be repaved, a great saving over what would be the cost it York pavement were used will be effected. The construction of the sewer in Bow Common Lane, mentioned under the third head, although in point of cost it will not approach near to the others, is one of very great importance, being another step in the direction of providing a complete system of drainage in the Hamlet, a consummation devoutly to be wished. During the progress of the works, some most unexpected and dangerous obstacles were met with, which necessitated the putting in of a much stronger class of work, and consequently a considerable increase over the estimated cost. The works have, however, been completed in a most efficient manner, and will, without doubt, by their utility, fully recompense for the outlay, as the want of such a sewer had long been felt in that locality. Other smaller but equally important works have been carried out, and will be found mentioned in extenso in the report of the Surveyor. During the year, the Vestry are sorry to say, there have been six applications for compensation for injuries alleged to have been sustained by defects in the carriage or foot pavements, but in all of these the Vestry have denied their liability. 10 In two of the cases the parties aggrieved issued writs, to which the Vestry duly appeared, but although some months have elapsed since so doing, no further steps have been taken, and it is not considered probable that they will be. The tramway lines in the Hamlet have been considerably increased during the year, by the opening for traffic of the Commercial Road and Limehouse and Victoria Park routes. The tramway in the Mile End Road has been a constant source of anxiety and trouble to the Vestry, by reason of its being continually undergoing repair, and yet never in the condition in which under the Act of Parliament it should be. Numerous communications have been addressed to the Company on the subject, but at present no efficient method of construction has been arrived at to obviate the nuisance complained of. It is however hoped that the paving the whole width of the road outside the tramway rails may, by reducing the traffic on the tramway, greatly mitigate the evil. The Vestry have, during the year under their statutory powers, passed the necessary resolutions for paving and making up, at the expense of the owners, the following streets in the Hamlet:— Silas Street Ashcroft Road Woodison Street Lawton Road Gardom Street Longnor Road Salmen Street Buckeridge Street Bradwell Street The Vestry are pleased to say that at present they have had in one instance only to adopt legal measures to recover the amount. The Metropolitan Board has, during the year, made orders for re-numbering and abolishing subsidiary names in the following streets in the Llamlet, viz.— Hawkins Street St. Thomas's Road St. Dunstan's Road St. Anne's Road The same authority has also made orders for re- 11 naming and re-numbering the following streets in the Hamlet in manner hereafter appearing. Name of Street to be re-named and re-numbered. Name by which same in future to be called. North Street Lindley Street Robert Street Wolsey Street Henry Street, Sidney Sq., Henry Street, Bedford Square, Rutland Street Rutland Street Bull Lane, Rhodeswell Road. Ben Jonson Road John Street, Clark Street. Clark Street The health of the Hamlet has, during the year, been as a whole remarkably good, and this may in a great measure be attributed to the improved sanitary arrangements. These receive continued and most careful attention; and any complaint as to nuisances arising from drains and other causes, is immediately investigated by the proper officers, and it is hoped that the parishioners in general will assist the Vestry to the utmost of their power in abating nuisances. A list of the old drains and cesspools abolished, and other sanitary matters immediately connected with the duties of the Sanitary Inspector, will be found in his report, appended to that of the Medical Officer. The cow-houses, slaughter-houses, and bake-houses, have from time to time been visited, and in all cases where necessary notices have been served to cleanse, &c., which have been complied with. In October last there were 39 applications for licenses for slaughterhouses and 38 for cow-houses. The Sanitary Committee having visited the premises, objected before the Magistrates to some of the licenses being granted until certain works had been carried out, and the cases so objected to were ordered to stand over 12 till an adjourned session, when, having complied with the requirements the licenses were granted. The contract for removal of dust, &c., shews a considerable increase in price, compared with previous years, being £1134 to be paid by the Vestry, but it is hoped that increased efficiency will be the result. Having regard to the known source of evil which dust-bins are, if not emptied frequently, the Vestry hope that the ratepayers generally will carefully see that this is done. Any complaint on the subject should be made at the Vestry Hall, when it will receive immediate attention. The Vestry Hall and Offices underwent a thorough cleansing during the rising of the Vestry in August. On the 10th August last the Metropolitan Board of Works formally handed over the Stepney Green Recreation Ground to the custody of the Vestry. In pursuance of the original terms agreed upon, the Vestry have entered into a deed of covenant to keep the ground in repair, and as a recreation ground in perpetuity. The proceedings of the School Board for London have received great attention from the Vestry, as they materially affect the ratepayers. A feeling that that Board were spending the money of the ratepayers very lavishly, without carrying out the objects for which they were called into existence (namely, the educating of the lowest class of children) gained, with few exceptions, general credence throughout the metropolis, and the Vestry, coinciding in those views, addressed a remonstrance to the School Board on subject. Most of the other Boards in the metropolis having also done this, and one parish having absolutely refused to pay the precept until compelled so to do, it is hoped that the School Board will give attention to the wishes of the ratepayers as thus expressed. It should bo mentioned, that the Vestry have no power to deal directly with any of the educational questions involved, but only with the expenditure of 13 the School Board; but as the latter is materially affected by the method in which the former are purposed to be worked out, the Vestry have carefully watched, and will continue to watch, all the proceedings of the School Board. In 1871 an act was passed, intituled "The Metropolis Water Act, 1871," with the view of making the companies provide a constant water supply, but they were to be compelled to do so only when certain regulations to be made, as provided for by the Act, had come into operation, and were complied with. The Companies were to propose the regulations, which were to receive the sanction of the Board of Trade, who were empowered to hear the Metropolitan Board of Works on the subject. The Companies accordingly prepared regulations to which the Metropolitan Board objected on many points before the Board of Trade ; but the latter, in some of the most important ones, as to the description of fittings, &c., adopted the views of the Companies. The result of this is that, in consequence of the enormous expense to which owners of property would be put to provide the fittings to enable the Metropolitan Board to compel the Companies to give a constant supply, that Board have refrained from so doing, and the Act has, to a great extent, become a nullity, and the public deprived of a great benefit. It should be mentioned, that the Metropolitan Board has consulted the various Vestries and District Boards on the course which, under the circumstances, they should adopt; and this Vestry and a Special Committee, having gone most carefully into the matter, entirely adopted the views of the Metropolitan Board, as beforementioned, a course also almost unanimously adopted throughout the metropolis. During the year occurred that unparalleled event, generally known as the "Gas Strike." The facts connected with it are sufficiently in the memory of every one to render any recapitulation of 14 them here unnecessary; and but for the fact that the Vestry took some steps in connection with the subject, it would be unnecessary to mention it at all. However, in November last, in consequence of some disagreement between the Gas Companies and their Avorkmen, the latter suddenly struck work, and the whole of the metropolis was in jeopardy of being without light during the long evenings and nights of that time of year. The Vestry considered that, as the representatives of the ratepayers, it was their duty to prevent if possible such a catastrophe, and the loss to life and property which must inevitably ensue therefrom; and therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the question between the parties at issue, placed at the disposal of the Gas Company which supplies the Hamlet with gas, the services of such of the men in the employ of the Vestry as could be spared. The Company expressed to the Vestry their grateful thanks for the offer, but were enabled to do without the proffered aid. The fact, however, that the Metropolis should be exposed to such a state of things, is a matter which deserves serious attention, with a view of preventing the possible recurrence of them. During the year there have been 22 vestry meetings, 93 meetings of the standing committees, and 17 meetings of special committees, a sufficient proof, it is hoped, that the members of the Vestry are not sparing of their personal attention to carry out the duties confided to them. The accounts for the year, which ended on the 25th March, 1873, were in due course laid before the auditors, and vouched and allowed. The abstract of the accounts, as certified by the auditors, and shewing the receipts and expenditure of the Vestry, with their assets and liabilities, is published with this report.

Gentlemen, It gives me much pleasure to again lay before you a statement of the various works and other matters which have been carried out by or which affect my department, during the year ending March 25th, 1873. Carriageway Paving. But little work has been done by the Vestry under this head, only 535 yards having been laid in the Burdett Road, near to the Mile End Road, but the whole of the centres of the Burdett and Commercial Roads have been paved by the North Metropolitan Tramways Company. The whole of the Grove Road has been paved by the same Company, although they were only compelled by Act of Parliament to pave the space occupied by their rails, and eighteen inches beyond each of the outer rails. The work was commenced in Grove Road, in the usual way, the Company only paving the space required by Act of Parliament. They had consented to a clause being inserted in their Act which entailed the paving of the whole width of that portion of Grove Road which is situate within the parish of Bethnal Green, and upon my representing to Mr. Hopkins, the Company's Engineer, how manifestly unfair it would be for his Company to do more work for one parish than they did for another, that gentleman confessed the force of the argument, and advised the Company to treat both parishes on the same footing, which recommendation was adopted, and the whole of the road in this parish was paved at the cost of the Tramway Company. 4 The Company have also paved the wide space lying between their rails at entrance to Burdett Road from Mile End Road. In my last report I drew attention to the advisability of paving the unpaved portions of the Mile End and Commercial Roads so soon as the Tramway works were completed, and I then referred in detail to estimated cost of maintaining the two roads in their present condition, and as paved roads. You have now determined to pave both roads, and a contract is in course of execution by Messrs. Mowlem, Burt & Freeman, for the paving of the Commercial Road, and the laying down of the old stone which is to be taken up from the side breasts, in streets of the Hamlet where the traffic is less than in the main roads. In my next annual report I hope to be able to announce the completion of these two great works, which at present prices are estimated to cost £25,000. Projected Railways. Notice was given previous to the last Session of Parliament that application would be made for an Act empowering the promoters to construct a line of railway to commence by a junction with the Metropolitan District Railway at Cannon Street, City, and to pass under the block of houses forming the corner of Eastcheap and Gracechurch Street. It was then to run to and along Fenchurch Street, Aldgate, Whitechapel, Mile End and Bow Roads, and terminate by a junction with the North London Line at or near Bow Station. Standing orders were not complied with, and the Bill was withdrawn; but although the Vestry would have had to present a petition against the Bill, in order to obtain protective clauses, in relation to their roads and sewers, it is impossible to overrate the importance and advantage which this line, if constructed, would be to this District. 5 At the present time a journey from Mile End or Bow Roads to the Bank will occupy from 25 to 35 minutes, according to the state of the traffic: this would be easily done by the proposed line in 10 minutes. The effect would be to bring the whole of the large manufacturing population of the East of London into easy communication with the City and West End, the markets of their industry. There can be but few of us who ride in omnibuses and tramway cars who have not been personally introduced to huge bundles of various goods, which are continually being taken to and brought from the City. If we only consider the saving of time which this line would effect to hundreds of poor workpeople, we should hail its construction as one of the greatest boons which this side of London has ever received. Tramways have worked wonders in this district, in the short space of time during which they have been in use, but they stop very far short of the required distance. To the Bank everyone wants to go, and the Tramways cannot take them there. I do not think I should be exceeding the bounds of correctness in saying that for every person who travelled in a vehicle to and from the Bank six years ago, there are now five; and if a good train service was provided by the proposed line, I feel confident that the present traffic would be doubled in a very short space of time. An underground railway, constructed along the centres of wide roads, with but little property to take, ought to be constructed and worked to pay investors, and I look forward to the time when such a railway shall be complete, as the commencement of a hopeful era for our district. The following roads have been added to those alreadv under my charge, viz., Bloomfield Road, Joseph Street, 6 Woolmore Street, Silas Street, Woodison Street, Gardom Street, making a total of 747 lineal yards, equal to 1¾ acres of new roads added to those of the Hamlet during the year. Unpaved Carriageways. The following list will shew the quantity of material used upon each principal thoroughfare in the Hamlet for the year ending March 25th, 1873.

Tramways. During the year the Commercial Road line from Aldgate to East India Docks, and the Burdett Road line from East India Road to Victoria Park, have been opened for traffic. The last-mentioned line the Company opened in November last, and took off their cars on the 24th of December. This improper act drew just remonstrance from the Limehouse Board of Works and this Vestry, but not before the end of the second week in March did the Company re-commence traffic on the road. The Company alleged as their reason for suspending the traffic, that the line did not pay them. I think it must be admitted by all that Tramways are more or less, according to the state of repair in which 8 they are kept, a nuisance to every man who drives a vehicle of his own; but as fifty persons ride in public conveyances to every one who keeps a vehicle of his own, the one should be inconvenienced for the sake of the fifty; but if Tramway Companies are to take their cars off the roads whenever they find that the traffic at the period of the year does not pay them, then one section of the public is being inconvenienced, and the larger section is not receiving any advantage. The Tramway in the Mile End Road is in a very bad condition; the rails are loose upon the sleepers in many places, and the paving next the rails, and especially outside them, is cut away to such an extent that it is necessary that it be replaced with new stone. Negotiation is now being carried on with the Company, with a view to effect the substantial repair of the line. I am of opinion that so long as the present form of rail is in use in the Mile End Road, that road can never be in a satisfactory state for but a very short period of time. Watering. During the year the water-carts were employed on 85 clays, at a cost of £493 for horses and drivers, and of £291 15s. for 7,052,000 gallons of water, supplied by the East London Water Works. Lighting. The lighting of the Hamlet is done by the Commercial Gas Company, who lights 787 lamps. The cost for the year has been £3395 3s. 8d. Sewers. Eighty-five houses were connected with the Sewers of the Hamlet during the year. 9 New sewers have been laid in Bow Common Lane, Regent Street South, Albion Street, Carter Street, John Street, Regent's Road, and New Street. The following table will shew the length of each size of sewer constructed within the Hamlet during the year. 3-ft. 6-in. by 2-ft. 3-in half-brick sewer 780 feet. 3-ft. 6-in. by 2-ft. 3-in. one brick „ 900 „ 12-in. pipe 1621 „ The cost to the Vestry of these works was £1910 15s.

LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY & Co., LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1873. REPORT. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Seventeenth Annual Report upon the Public Health of the Hamlet for the year ending March, 1873, as required by the Metropolis Local Government Act. It will be seen that I am in a position to congratulate the Vestry upon an unprecedentedly high birth-rate, and an exceptionally low death-rate. Births. Table I. shows the number of births of each sex for every quarter of the year, and the aggregate of the four quarters as 4085: this is 498 more than for the previous year, and exhibits a birth-rate of 43 per 1000 of the population, or a fraction over one birth to every 23.25 inhabitants of the Hamlet. The birth-rate for the whole metropolis during the same period was about 36.5 per 1000 population, and the same for the whole country, or one birth to every 27.5 inhabitants. I have estimated the average population for the year at 95,000, altheugh now probably two or three theusand more. It is difficult to account for the high birth-rate which prevails year by year in the Hamlet, except that, in addition to the normal increase of the population, there is also continual additions by immigration of youthful adults. The area of the Hamlet being 681 acres, and the population 97,500, allows one acre for every 143.25 persons; these are of course not equally distributed, the old parts of the Hamlet being the most closely built upon, as in the West Ward. 4 Deaths. The total mortality, Table I., during the four quarters was 1904, showing an excess of births over deaths of 2181, and a death rate for the year of 20 per 1000 population living. The deaths were also, with a larger population, 296 less in number than the previous year, and 175 below the average of three previous years. There has been apparently considerable difference in the mortality of the five wards, the death-rate in the West Ward being, as usual, the highest, and the South Ward, in this instance, the lowest. With reference to this point, I think the great disparity between the rates in the West and South Wards may bo partly duo to some of the deaths occurring in certain parts of the South Ward having been accredited to the West Ward, on account of the alteration in names and re-numbering of Oxford and Charles Streets, which pass through both Wards, and contain a large population. The two registration districts are not defined by Wards, and even the parish map is not now a sufficient guide for me to always accurately decide as to which Ward the number of a house in one of these long streets belongs. Whether this assumption is correct or not, it is certain there was a remarkably low death-rate in the South Ward. Zymotic Diseases. The extent of and mortality from this class of disease afford the most reliable bases upon which to found an accurate judgment of the general sanitary condition of a district containing a large population, and the probable influences exercised by such condition upon the public health. Judged by this standard, the sanitary condition of the Hamlet, and the health of its nearly 100,000 inhabitants, during the period under review, must have been remarkably good, the mortality from infectious diseases having been invariably low. 5 As upon previous occasions, I have included eleven diseases in this class, some of which might be objected to as only presumably infectious, such as croup, rheumatic fever, diarrhœa, &c. The number of deaths from these eleven diseases, during the year, was 346, or little more than half the number for the previous year, and 162 less than the average number for five previous years. The mortality from what may be termed the recognized infectious diseases—fever, small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever—exhibited a similar low rate. The total deaths from these four diseases was 108, compared with 293 for the previous year. There was not a single death from small-pox during the last of the four quarters. In all cases coming to the knowledge of the officers, where infectious diseases had occurred, notices for disinfection and cleansing were served, and, where necessary, orders to enforce the same were obtained, and carried out under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector. Deaths at Various Ages. There are no means for ascertaining the number of children that are what is called "still-born," that is, they have not presumably had a separate existence, and the law does not therefore require their advent and exit to be recorded. Of these born alive, from 15 to 25 per cent. die during the first year of age. As already stated, the number of children registered as born in this Hamlet during the year, was 4,085; there were during the same period 690 deaths (more than a third of the whole mortality) of children between birth and one year old. No doubt most of this mortality was of these born in the Hamlet during the year; at all events this must be closely approximative of the reality, and would show an infantile death-rate of 17 per cent. during the first 0 year after birth. Up to and including the fifth year of age, there were 222 more deaths, making 912 in all during the first quinquennial period, or very nearly half the total mortality of the Hamlet for the year. The 690 deaths during the first year of age, constitute alone more than one-third the total mortality. This infantile mortality is certainly a subject for reflection. Apart from congenital causes, a large majority of these young lives would, under conditions more favorable to existence, be preserved. Many causes combine to produce this excessive mortality; these may be, in many cases, through unavoidable adverse circumstances, but they are often avoidable, sometimes wilful, caused by ignorance in management, improper and insufficient food; the same with regard to clothing, exposure to cold, breathing impure air in close, overcrowded rooms. All these injurious influences, exerted upon the susceptible organism of that early period of life,—not having yet acquired sufficient vital force to resist their effects—produce the necessary results, disease and great mortality. I think the statistics and rate of mortality in children, up to 5 years of age, should be kept, and recorded separately from these for adults, the public would then learn whence the principal cause of high death-rates arises. Local autherities are comparatively powerless to remedy or even mitigate many of these evils. It is a social question of great magnitude, and, if only upon grounds of humanity, should be worked out, and as far as possible remedied. The Infant Life Protection Act is an instalment of other necessary measures. I have only been called upon to certify in respect of one applicant for the care of children under this Act. There are many and various causes affecting the public health, but which are not amenable to the powers possessed by the Health Autherity, but which are more or less injurious or dangerous to health, and the 7 cause of much mortality. I will only mention two or three of the most prominent, viz., sudden meteorological changes, "but these, although producing momentary injury to health, and increased mortality, especially among the aged and very young, are doubtless, in their ultimate effects, beneficial; in any case, they cannot he subjected to sanitary measures. Street accidents, and others of various kinds, add to the mortality. There is also a class of nuisances which, although apparently of a petty nature, may and do inflict much serious injury and annoyance, more especially to invalids. I refer to unnecessary street noises—to dog barking, cock crowing, railway whistling, noise of machinery, &c. I have seen patients dangerously ill suffer severely from these nuisances, the greatest injury being prevention of sleep; yet they, and the authorities, are powerless to suppress or remove them, complaints made to the selfish owners of such nuisances being generally treated with indifference or derision. Although these matters appear trifling, they are always more or less injurious to some, and, in many instances, not only assume dangerous proportions, but produce serious and fatal results. I have therefore not thought them unworthy of passing allusion, and hope they will obtain more definite notice in forthcoming health legislation. Rest is not only essential in disease, but for the preservation of health. How can this be secured in London, if the noises inseparable from day-time are perpetuated throughout the night in still more hideous and injurious forms? The best efforts should be directed to obtain the benefits of nocturnual rest for toiling Londoners, they would then feel less necessity for artificial stimulation during the day, enjoy better health, do more work, and have longer lives. Then there are what may be truly termed the voluntary causes of disease and injury to health. It is unnecessary to indicate them here, because, as in the 8 other cases just referred to, you have no authority to prevent them. I will only further say, that this voluntary injury to health causes great and premature mortality, and is probably the means of occupying one-half the room in our hospitals. New Buildings. Mr, Legg, the District Surveyor to the Metropolitan Board of Works, has kindly supplied me with the following return of the number and nature of the new buildings erected in the Hamlet during the year ending March, 1873. New dwelling-houses 104 School buildings, for Congregational Chapel, Burdett Road 1 Jews, Stepney Green 1 St. Paul's Road, Bow Common 1 London School Board: School, Johnson Street, Centre Ward 1 Ditto, Gloucester Street 1 Iron Chapel, Carlton Square 1 Total 110 The number of new dwellings is an increase of 7 upon that of the previous year. Most of the open spaces in the Hamlet are now built upon; but I fear this increase of the number of houses only adds to the population, without relieving the congestion in our crowded parts. One evil result is certain, the children are driven from their only play-grounds into close, ill-ventilated houses or crowded streets, and less frequently to the School Board Schools. It is a serious defect that all these Schools are not provided with ample play-grounds. If the School Board has the power to do so, it should be urged upon 9 them to exercise it with as little delay as possible. It is certain that the present generation of London children is physically degenerate. This evil will necessarily be pepetuated to future generations, and in gradually growing proportions. Of course I refer to that large majority of children who, except upon rare occasions of a few hours' or days' duration, are compelled to exist in wretchedly-constructed dwellings, deficient in every requirement necessary to the preservation of health. Even with sufficient good food these adverse conditions of deficient light, air and space, would pervert and counteract the effects of the best of feeding, and yet no provision is made in the way of play-grounds, whereby children can temporarily escape from their unwholesome homes, and obtain that exercise essential to healthy physical and mental development. Ornamental recreation grounds arc useless for this special purpose; what is required are bonafide play-grounds, where children can, under proper supervision, do as they like; how, otherwise, can they become healthy and strong men and women, either mentally or bodily. Natural exercise and play are essential to improve and check the enfeebled and unhealthy condition of the present generation of London children, otherwise these who live, or rather half live, must become the progenitors of a still more degenerate race. This is a subject which might be pursued to an indefinite extent, but I have simply theught it my duty to again refer to it, because I still consider it to be one of the greatest and most elementary questions affecting the public health. I have always referred, in my reports, to the relation between dwelling-houses and the health of their occupants. Houses still continue to be and are allowed to be erected with entire disregard to sanitary views; foundations unprepared, the ground well impregnated with the materials for malarious emanations; next, the super. 10 structure is deposited, or, more technically, "run up," and if guided by any principles at all, they are these most antagonistic to the health and comfort of the future occupants. This applies not only to the dwellings of the poorer classes, but also to these of a more pretentious character. Then the materials are often of a nature and quality which may, in various ways, endanger the health of the occupants. It is of course generally known that the contents of dust-bins are mostly used in the manufacture of bricks, &c. If this was composed of ashes only, no danger need be feared, but it is a question whether the baking process always destroys any deleterious ingredients. Again, old materials from fever dens may, with impunity, be used in the erection of new houses, and thus ensure an early outbreak of fever. All these evils are allowed witheut any attempt at prevention or supervision. It is remarkable that no advance has been made in improving the internal structure of moderate-sized houses: still the same dark and awkward passages and stairs, smoky chimneys, doors in wrong places, rheumatic ventilation; in short, everything antithetical to health and comfort.

In addition to the above, all bakehouses have been visited by me twice during the year, and, where necessary, notices were served requiring the owners thereof to limewhite and otherwise cleanse the same. 13 The whole of the slaughter and cow-houses in the Hamlet have also been frequently visited, and, where necessary, improvements effected. HENRY LESHAW. Gas. The illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Commercial Gas Company to this district has been always maintained above the standard required by Act of Parliament, which directs that the illuminating power shall be equal to that of 12 sperm candles, burning 120 grains each per hour. The average illuminating power during the past year has been about the same as for the previous year, viz., 14.30 candles, or more than 2¼ above the legal standard. The average quantity of sulpho-carbon impurities was 18 grains per 100 feet of gas, being 5 grains less than for the previous year. Sulphuretted hydrogen was never present. Average ammonia 2 grains. Considering the greatly enhanced price of coals, this is a satisfactory report, and creditable to the Company. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, M.
