ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for 1954 Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas, Surbiton. June 1955. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my thirtythird Annual Report which, as in previous years, is based on lines laid down by the Ministry of Health, and the vital statistics on figures given by the Registrar General. The report deals with the health conditions of Surbiton. For arriving at the vital statistics the population figure is 63,320 which shows an increase of 1,090. In order to compare the births and deaths in Surbiton with other towns, and for England and Wales, the Registrar General has given figures (which is the comparability factor) namely 1.00 for the former and 1.01 for the latter. The infant mortality rate is 11.02 as compared with 21.02 for the previous year. I would like to point out that this is the lowest figure in Surbiton since official records were kept and it might be the lowest in England and Wales. Surbiton is flanked by two main roads which are joined by intersecting cross roads. This leads to considerable use by vehicles, and unfortunately several severe accidents have occurred leading to some deaths. The provision of traffic lights or some other means of affording more protection both to pedestrians and motorists should be urgently provided. 2.

(d) There have been no changes or developments with regard to the hospital facilities in the district. They are as follows:- Surbiton General Hospital, Ewell Road, Surbiton. Tolworth Hospital, Red Lion Road, Tolworth. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. No action was deemed necessary under Section 47 of this Act. 11.

The fact that diphtheria is so rare now is a reason why mothers do not take their children to the immunisation clinics. This should be discouraged. In Surbiton a 75% immunisation should be aimed at. 12. INFECTIOUS DISEASES, 1954. Total Cases Notified.

This long-awaited Act became operative on 30th August 1954. It is a very important piece of legislation with far reaching effects. Its principal objective is to improve living conditions in existing properties and it is hoped to achieve this mainly in four ways:- (i) By stimulating local authorities to increased and speedier action in connection with slum clearance. Provision is made for some novel arrangements for the temporary retention of certain unfit properties until their turn for demolition arrives (ii) By easing the conditions under which improvement grants can be made. (iii) By permitting private landlords to make limited rent increases subject to houses being in good repair. (iv) By introducing new powers for dealing with houses-let-in-lodgings. With the limited experience we have had in administering this Act comment must necessarily be guarded, but a few observations may be of interest. It was anticipated that we might receive an avalanche of applications from tenants for certificates of disrepair as soon as landlords gave notice of proposed rent increases. In fact this did not happen and by 31st December 1954 only twenty-two such applications had arrived all of which justified the granting of a certificate. In the majority of these cases landlords soon began to carry out necessary repairs and to apply for revocation certificates. The Council has in the past dealt so effectively with unfit properties that apart from a few individual houses little requires to be done at present by way of demolition and certainly no slum clearance proposals are called for. There is some uneasiness over the new standard of fitness for habitation prescribed in this Act and there are those who feel that the former standard was easier to operate. Some of us are also sorry to see the abolition of the byelaws with respect to houses-let-in-lodgings without their replacement by a modern version. Already some "curious" decisions have been given in the Courts on various points and it will obviously take a long time for the whole thing to "settle down"; meanwhile there is already talk of amending legislation! 23 IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. The Housing Act, 1949 introduced a scheme to encourage property owners to modernise existing houses "which though soundly constructed and in good general repair, lack the amenities and conveniences which have come to be regarded as essential to a decent and healthy life", by providing financial assistance for works of improvement. The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, where additional accommodation was to be provided by adding rooms, and where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. Twenty-one applications for grants were received during the year. Fifteen were recommended by the Council and approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The remainder were disposed of as follows Rejected Withdrawn Consideration deferred. 2 3 1 The grants were in respect of ten works to provide hot water system, bath, internal W.C. etc., four to provide additional living accommodation and one conversion to flats. The amount of the grants was as follows:- £. s. d. 10 of 100 0. 0. 1 " 84. 15. 6 1 " 72. 10. 0 1 " 71. 4. 0 1 " 60. 0. 0 1 " 200. 0. 0 for each of two flats. During the year efforts were made by the Ministry to stimulate public interest in the scheme and to encourage Councils to be less reluctant to make grants. The publicity given brought a large number of enquiries as well as the highest number of applications so far received in any year. The figures for previous years were Applications received s approved 1953 7 6 1952 5 3 1951 3 3 1950 4 4 Unfortunately the private landlord has still not been attracted in this district and so far only three grants (one a conversion) have been made to other than owner/occupiers. 24 UNDERGROUND ROOMS. The revised model regulations of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government were adopted in lieu of those existing which had been in force since 1935 and were in need of amendment to suit modern conditions. These regulations deal with drainage, lighting, ventilation, dampness, protection against effluvia, etc. in rooms used for human habitation which have floors more than three feet below ground level. DUSTBINS. Twenty-eight dustbins were provided as a result of notices served, two such being statutory and the remainder informal. The Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins was continued, eighty bins being sold during the year. FOOD INSPECTION. Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a large variety of foods which were not so fit were surrendered by the owners and either salvaged for animal feeding or destroyed by burning. The total weight of such goods was 2 tons: 3 cwts: 2 qrs: 19 lbs. There is now no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough consequently no meat inspection is carried out except in butchers' shops. With the de-control of meat supplies discussions took place with the local butchers to see what arrangements they proposed to make to deal with the new situation and whether they would find a need for slaughtering facilities within the Borough. Eventually it became clear that adequate supplies were readily available and none of the butchers found it necessary to resume slaughtering. The number of persons holding licences granted by the Council under the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, to act as slaughtermen was two. 25. FOOD HYGIENE. Thirty-nine premises are registered under section 14 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. 1,767 visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public-houses, and food handling businesses and vehicles of all descriptions to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Council under the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation. Hot water supply provided 6 Protection of food from contamination 4 Windows repaired or renewed 1 Floors repaired or renewed 1 Chimney stacks and pots repaired 1 Food premises cleansed 97 Equipment cleansed 1 Drains cleansed, repaired or renewed 2 W.Cs.cleansed or repaired 9 WCs. lighted or ventilated 3 Cold stores repaired 1 Cold stores provided 1 Accumulations removed 1 Dustbins supplied 1 Food vans repaired 1 Miscellaneous 1 A conference at which local bakers and representatives of the baking industry met the Public Health Committee took place on 18th February 1954, to discuss the delivery of bread about which the Council was gravely concerned because of the practice of leaving unwrapped loaves on doorsteps and window cills. After a full discussion in which all aspects of the matter were thoroughly dealt with by both sides the Committee resolved as under (i) That the Committee co-operate with bakers in an endeavour to assist them in complying with the byelaws in connection with the handling, wrapping, and delivery of food by arranging the printing of suitably worded pamphlets for delivery to householders where adequate receptacles or arrangements for the reception of bread are not made. (ii) That women's organisations in the Borough be asked to publicise this matter through their members in an endeavour to persuade housewives to assist baker's roundsmen in complying with the byelaws. (iii) That the situation be reviewed in due course in the light of action now proposed to be taken. The pamphlets were duly printed and supplied to bakers 26. FOOD HYGIENE (Cont.) for issue to their customers where necessary, and there has no doubt been a very great improvement in the situation. The standard of food hygiene generally has been maintained at a satisfactory level, though constant attention to the subject is necessary. The new Food & Drugs Act which it was anticipated would introduce higher standards than those now in force received the Royal Assent on 25th November 1954, but only one section (and that not relating to hygiene) came into immediate operation. At the time of writing no other parts of the Act have been brought into use, and there is a feeling that regulations which are under consideration are likely to be disappointing to those who have been trying to deal with this problem for so long with rather inadequate powers.

The sample contained 48% of meat, including fat. Proceedings instituted. Defendants fined £5. with £8.8.0d. costs. The Magistrates expressed the opinion that pork sausages should contain not less than 65% of meat of which 80% should be pork. 1465 (informal) 1466 (formal) Confection "Sea Shell". These samples of food consisted of macaroni shells coated with sugar. The samples contained sugar, with small proportions of colouring and flavouring ... 60%. Macaroni ..40%. He was of opinion that the article was unfit for consumption as confectionery. Macaroni in the raw state is not suitable for human food and requires to be thoroughly cooked. The macaroni shells in this article were hard and tough and would be likely to cause digestive disturbance. Warning given. Wholesalers agreed to withdraw this article from sale. 1450 (informal) Lozenges, Bismuth.B.P. The current British Pharmacopoeia (1953) does not include Compound Lozenges of Bismuth and these lozenges were not correctly described as B.P. Warning given. The manufacturers subsequently stated that the Pharmaceutical Society had indicated that they would not object to the use of these labels until the end of June, 1954, and the Council concurred. 1496 (informal) Ice cream powder. This was a sample of stale, insect infested ice cream powder. Small remaining stock surrendered. 29. 1500 (formal). Sausages, pork chipolatas. Contained only 51% of meat, including fat. Severe warning given. 1502 (formal) Sausages, pork. Contained only 45% of meat, including fat. Proceedings instituted. Defendants fined £10. with 5 guineas costs. 1535 (informal) Soup, cream of (dried). mushroom, The proportion of fat in the soup prepared according to the directions on the label would amount to only 0.7% whereas cream soups of ordinary commercial quality intended for direct use without dilution contain not less than of fat. The Public Analyst stated he had objected to this labelling some time ago and manufacturers had agreed to amend the description, The manufacturers stated that earlier this year they had contemplated reprinting the labels but eventually decided to cease sale from the end of May. Thus any stocks now with retailers was old and their representative had been instructed to withdraw same. When informed of three shops in Surbiton which still had small stocks of this soup they immediately arranged for withdrawal. 1567 (formal) Soup, Cream of (dried) tomato, The proportion of fat in the soup prepared according to the directions would have amounted to only 0.5%, whereas cream soups of ordinary commercial quality intended for direct use without dilution contain not less than 3½% of edible fat, The Council decided not to take any legal action in the case of this sample but to inform the manufacturer that any further adverse reports received in respect of this article of food might result in the institution of legal proceedings The manufacturer in this case was the same as for sample No.1535. Milk Supply. (i) At the end of the year there were thirty-two entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk with premises in the Borough 14 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 9 30. MILK SUPPLY (Cont). (ii) Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk)Regulations,1949-1954. Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 - 1953. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows:- Pasteurised milk 12 Pasteurised milk (supplementary) 9 Tuberculin tested milk 11 Tuberculin tested milk (supplementary) 8 Sterilised milk 10 Sterilised milk (supplementary) 8 (iii)Two hundred and twenty-nine samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests Turbidity TB Biological Methylene Phosphatase Test Test Blue Test Test Tuberculin Tested - 11 - - Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) - - 1 - Pasteurised - - 179 177 T.T. Pasteurised - - 25 25 Pasteurised (Channel Island) - - 1 1 Sterilised 7 - - - Raw milk (Ungraded) - 5 - - The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. Complaints were received from two canteens that milk supplied by a dealer from outside the Borough was souring quickly. The milk came in churns and forty-four samples were taken to check up on it. Fifteen failed the methylene blue test and one failed the phosphatase test. The matter was taken up with the dealer concerned and with other local authorities. Further samples were taken and of these twenty-one failed the methylene blue test. The dealer only supplied these two canteens and had no retail round. The canteen which had the largest supply ceased trading with him. The other continued the supply for a time and a further nineteen samples taken over a period of three months showed only two failures on methylene blue test. Later this canteen also discontinued the supply. The report on one biological sample taken at a local farm showed that a guinea pig inoculated with the milk died and on post-mortem examination showed typical tuberculous lesions. The case was investigated by the. Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries who reported that an infected cow was found in the herd and was slaughtered under the Tuberculosis Order. Apart from the above all samples conformed to the required standard. 31. ICE CREAM. Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 14, Food & Drugs Act, 1938, as under For manufacture, storage and sale 8 For manufacture, storage and sale hut manufacture to he limited to iced lollies 16 For storage and sale, hut not manufacture 116 Certificates of Registration granted during year 27 During the year 235 visits were made to premises and vehicles and 111 samples were taken for laboratory examination for bacterial cleanliness, details being as follows:- Ice Cream Grade I Coliforms absent 87 89.1% 94.05% ,, present 3 Grade II ,, absent 3 ,, present 2 Grade III ,, absent 3 ,, present 3 5.94% 101 Iced Lollies Grade I Coliforms absent 10 111 In no case was Faecal Coli found The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that it is unwise to pay too much attention to the result of any one sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that it would be reasonable to expect about 30 per cent of samples throughout the year to fall into Grade I, 80 per cent into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. The results shewn above indicate that the satisfactory standard referred to in my last report is being maintained. Each retailer from whom a sample was taken was supplied with a copy of the laboratory report; where manufacture took place outside the Borough copies of reports whether good or otherwise were also sent to the Sanitary inspector for the District concerned for his information. No ice cream is now manufactured within the Borough. A few retailers make their own iced lollies. 32. pet animals act,_1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals''. Licences in respect of four such premises were issued during the year. Fifteen inspections were made and one minor infringement of the conditions imposed was put right. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Two hundred and sixty visits were made in the administration of this Act, and eighteen infringements were corrected. Some complaints were received that illegal sales were taking place on Sundays and whilst no evidence became available which would justify proceedings action was taken to try to prevent the development of Sunday trading which is not permitted by the Act. There are signs that such trading is beginning to take place throughout the country despite efforts by authorities to check it. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. This Act which prohibits the sale or letting of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard, together with Regulations made by the Secretary of State, became fully operative during the year. Many such appliances on sale in the Borough were examined and eight which did not pass the prescribed tests were either modified or withdrawn from sale. 33. DISINFECTION. (a) During the year disinfection was carried out at thirty-five premises in which the following diseases occurred Anterior Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 7 Mumps 1 Para-typhoid B 2 Scarlet fever 8 Tuberculosis 8 Miscellaneous 9 Disinfection was also carried out at thirty-four other premises on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was:- Disinfected Destroyed Blankets 17 6 Bolsters 3 2 Counterpanes - 1 Featherbeds - k Mattresses 17 k Mattress covers 2 1 Pillows 32 9 Pillow cases 3 3 Sheets - 2 Towels 6 - Wearing apparel 25 22 Bedspreads 2 1 Eiderdowns 1 Miscellaneous 1 40 109 95 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 97 No. of library books disinfected 165 34. dysentery, Para-Typhoid fever and food poisoning. The number of specimens collected and taken to the Laboratory for bacteriological examination in the course of investigating these illnesses was as follows:- Faeces Suspected food. 1950 1202 13 1951 694 2 1952 183 15 1953 129 12 1954 263 8 In addition 31 samples of various foods were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure. FACTORIES AND BAKEHOUSES. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 268 (218 mechanical, 38 non-mechanical, and 12 works of building construction). Three hundred and eight-five visits were made to these premises, and work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under Want of cleanliness 8 factories Insufficient sanitary conveniences 1 factory Defective, dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences 28 factories Other offences, etc. 13 factories One certificate was issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factory to which it related was provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may "be reasonably required in the circumstances. There were 84 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. 18 visits were made and one infringement attended to. MOVEABLE DELLINGS Forty-nine licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twenty-four of the caravans are standing on the Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. There is one site on which some unlicensed caravans are parked which is being dealt with. 35 DISINF'E STATION. (a) Bed Bugs. Council Houses Other Houses. Found to be infested. Disinfested Found to be infested Disinfested. Nil Nil 10 10 Methods employed for disinfestation Spraying with insecticide 10 (b) School Canteens. At the request of the County Council nine school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General. (i) Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be much appreciated. (ii) Verminous Person. An application was received from a local resident for cleansing from body lice. Section 85 of the Public Health Act, 1936, authorises a local authority to take such measures as are necessary to free such persons and their clothing from vermin without charge. As no suitable facilities are available in the Borough, arrangements were made with the Royal Borough of Kensington for the man to be dealt with at their cleansing station at a charge to this Council. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. One burial was effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body were being made otherwise than by the Council. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year sixty-eight bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. 36. RATS AMD MICE DESTRUCTION The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Grant-aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial premises, and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers or, in certain circumstances, the owners. 42 business or industrial premises, schools, etc. were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost; involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. Whilst it is the duty of occupiers of houses to keep j their premises free from rats and mice, the Council continued to carry out treatment of infestations at private dwellings without charge provided the occupiers took such steps as might from time to time be necessary and reasonably practicable for preventing their premises from becoming infested. This decision has considerably facilitated the work at private houses as treatment is able to proceed almost immediately an infestation is found. 37 The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year, and suggest that we are continuing to keep the rodent population to a low level. 1.

CONCLUSION. In preparing my report this year I have made my observations under the various subject headings where they are probably more appropriate than at the end. Two items stand out in my mind as of special significance during the year because both took up a good deal of time in trying to help the public. The first such item is the improvement grant scheme which, consequent upon the publicity given it by the Ministry, brought many enquiries though a lot of the proposals were not in accord with the scheme and could not therefore be supported. The Council did however make its highest-ever number of grants. The second item cannot be written upon at length in this report, but I feel I should mention Civil Defence, because a big effort was made in connection with the organisation of the Welfare Section which the Council has seen fit to place in my charge. Training was stepped up briskly and it was undoubtedly the most active of the post-war years. It is gratifying that there are today in this town public-spirited men and women ready and willing to be trained for a possible, if remote emergency, and should they ever be called upon to function in a crisis their duties would have a distinct influence upon the health and well-being of the people. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Yours obedient Servant, H.J. ELDRIDGS, Senior Sanitary Inspector. I wish to thank the members of my staff in the Public Health Department for their co-operation, particularly the Senior Sanitary Inspector. NEVILLE H. LINZEE, Medical Officer of Health. 41.
