Mr. Chairman Ladies and Gentlemen The vital statistics for 1953 follow the pattern of those in recent years. There has been an increase in the birth rate and a decrease in the death rate. The infant death rate has increased but the majority of these deaths were in infants aged less than 4 weeks and were due to congenital defects or prematurity. The infant death rate is usually looked upon as a measure of the standard of preventive care in a district, but it is possible that some babies who might previously have been stillborn are now being born alive, only to die within a month, i.e. care of the foetus has improved, but not sufficiently. The incidence of infectious disease during the year compares favourably with that of previous years. The number of cases of measles (339) was greater than that expected from the figures for previous years. This was due to the fact that the 1959 epidemic started some months earlier than usual in November 1958, it was unusual in that the children first affected were in the group under 5 years of age while the infant school children usually the first to succumb were infected later. Early in the year supplies of American and Canadian single tested vaccine became available for protection against poliomyelitis and there was an enormous increase in the number of people whom it was possible to protect. Children who had received two injections previously were offered a third re inforcing dose and the age limits of the scheme were thrown open to include all persons from the age of 6 months to 26 years together with expectant mothers of all ages Many employees were vaccinated at their place 3 of work and sessions were held at the Town Hall for those Council employees who were eligible The response from office staff was 100%, but from outside workers it was extremely poor The 10 year scheme for Clean Air in the district, which was launched in 1957 proceeded smoothly. An ambitious exhibition was staged at the Town Fete, when a large number of people viewed different types of fuel burning unseasonably in demonstration grates, a model showing how fog is produced and dispelled, and other objects of interests Public Health Inspectors and representatives of the out side bodies concerned with Clean Air were present to give advice and explanations as required. In 1954 a five year programme for the clearance of unfit houses in the district was begun. The legal part of the programme was completed in 1958, but there is always a delay before unfit property is actually demolished or closed and one or two houses are still occupied. There has been excellent co operation between the Estates and Public Health departments, and all families displaced during the clearance programme were offered other dwellings by the Council. During the 5 years, a few more houses have become unfit, and will be dealt with in a similar way. There have been some staff changes during the year but the work has proceeded smoothly and I should like to thank all the members of the department for their willing co operation I wish to acknowledge the work of the printing section during the year and especially in the preparation of this report and to place on record my appreciation of the support given by the members of the public Health Committee. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW. Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (census 1951) 65,608 Population (raid year 1958 Registrar General's estimate of civilian population) 67 780 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December 1958 19,700 Rateable Value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1958 £1,078,315 Product of penny rate £4,380 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births: M F Total ) Birth rate per Legitimate 572 523 1,095 ) 1,000 of the Illegitimate 14 19 33 ) estimated ) lation 16.6 Comparability Factor is 0.94 giving a corrected birth rate of 15.6 Birth rate for England and Wales 16.4 Birth rate for County of Middlesex (adjusted) 14.2 Stillbirths M F Total ) Rate per 1,000 Legitimate 9 10 19 ) total (live & Illegitimate 1 1 ) still) births 17.4 Infant Deaths M F Total Legitimate 11 6 17 Illegitimate Neo Natal deaths (under 4 weeks) 10 5 15 Death rate of infants under one year of age: (a) All infants per l 000 live births 15,1 (b) Legitimate infants per 1 000 legitimate live births 15.5 5 (c) Illegitimate infants per 1 000 illegitimate live births (d) Infants under 4 weeks per 1 000 live births 13.3 (e) All infants in the County of Middlesex 18.0 Deaths M F Total ) Death rate per 275 225 500 ) 1.000 of the ) estimated popu- ) lation 7.4 Comparability Factor is 1.62 giving a corrected death rate of 12.0 Death rate for England and Wales 11.7 Death rate for the County of Middlesex (adjusted) 11.1 Deaths from Puerperal causes Maternal Mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 total (live and still) births) Maternal Mortality rate for County of Middlesex 0.4 BIRTH AND DEATH RATES, ETC. year Live Births Stillbirths Deaths Infant Death Rate # Maternal Mortality Rate ** Total Rate * Total Bate * * Total Rate * 1953 959 14.7 18 18.4 465 7.1 25.0 1.0 1954 936 14.4 17 17.8 458 7.1 21.4 0.0 1955 976 14.9 22 22.1 481 7.4 20.5 1.1 1956 1,013 15.2 19 18.4 497 7.5 14. 8 1.0 1957 1,068 15.9 28 25.6 510 7.6 14.0 0.0 1958 1,128 16.6 20 17.4 500 7.4 15.1 0.0 * Rate per 1,000 population ** Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births # Rate per 1,000 live births 6 CAUSES OF DEATH DURING 1958.

HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA INCLUDING CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Tuberculosis. It is pleasing to note the continuation of the down ward trend in the number of new cases notified during the year and also in the deaths from this disease. In-patient treatment is provided at Harefield Hospital, while out patient treatment and observation of contacts is carried out at the Chest Clinic which is situated in Uxbridge. During the year vaccination against tuberculosis was offered to some pupils in senior schools The young adult is particularly liable to the disease when he or she first goes into working life and it is hoped that the scheme will help to decrease this susceptibility. Water Supply. The district is adequately supplied with water by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and the South West Suburban District Water Company. Samples taken during the year have reached a satisfactory standard. One house in the district is supplied by a well. The water is not of a satisfactory standard, but the property is old and situated a long way from a main source of supply. The inhabitants have been warned that all drinking water should be boiled and for the present this unsatisfactory state of affairs must be accepted. Maternity and Child "'el fare Services etc. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council and there are numerous sessions for ante-natal and postnatal care, child welfare immunisation and school health services in clinic buildings, church halls schools and the mobile clinic. Old People. General interest in the difficulties of old age is growing, discussions are being held and a hint of panic is detectable behind the statistics of some orators. The Problems are not new, but their size is increasing rapidly. 9 In this district the County Council is responsible for the provision of Homes home helps and some aspects of welfare the Urban District Council provides some housing accommodation but the supply is never equal to the demand This Council also contributes to the funds of a voluntary committee which is responsible for the provision of many useful services These cover such things as meals on wheels, chiropody, holidays Christmas parcels laundrette facilities and visitors The Medical Officer and Council representatives are members of this committee and liaison between the various authorities concerned is very good The Medical Officer has powers under the National Assistance Act to effect the removal of an old person living in insanitary circumstances and incapable of looking after himself These powers are seldom used as in most cases it is possible to persuade an old person to accept a place in a Home or a bed in a hospital It requires almost as much persuasion to obtain the bed or vacancy in the first place. Care of some sort can usually be provided during the day. but one of the biggest problems is the care by night of an old person living alone without means of communication with neighbours in case of emergency The provision of a nighttime companion service could do much to lessen the demand for hospital beds and places in homes Immunisation and Vaccination. The figures showing the number of persons immunised and vaccinated during the past 5 years are shown on page 11 They are given by courtesy of the Area Medical Officer There has been a further decrease in the number of children protected against diphtheria and smallpox in spite of unremitting persuasion on the part of the public health workers This is almost certainly because of the multiplicity of injections to which young children are now sub jected Instead of three injections ofacombined antigen they are now given protection against diphtheria and whooping cough (and tetanus if desired) separately which in volvesatotal of at least five and possibly eight injections in addition to vaccination against smallpox and poliomye litis This policy has been recommended because of the risk of paralysis in poliomyelitis. 10 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION, 1958.

The incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis following immunisation with combined antigen has been even smaller The general level of immunity to poliomyelitis has been raised a great deal by the rush for vaccination against the disease Therefore it no longer seems to me to be a wise policy to lower the community level of protection against diphtheria and smallpox in order to avoid a small risk The popularity of the triple antigen (diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus) was surprising, the demand for it still exists and it is a great pity not to return to the simplicity of a few years ago when three injections and a scratch provided protection against four dangerous diseases Work is now proceeding towards the production of a combined antigen to include protection against poliomyelitis. If this is successful it should be a big step towards the achievement of a desirable level of protection against these diseases in the community Medical Examination' of Council Employees. The total number of examinations carried out during 1958 was 132. Of these 27 were for superannuation purposes alone, 24 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, 49 for Sick Pay and Superannuation and 32 for various special purposes 12 TUBERCULOSIS New Cases and Mortality during the year, 1958 Age Periods New Cases Mortality Respiratory JVon Respiratory Respiratory NonRespiratory M F M F M F M F Under 5 years 4 1 5-14 2 2 1 15 - 24 7 2 1 25 - 44 6 9 - - - 45 - 64 7 - 1 - 3 - - - 65 & over 1 1 - 1 - - - Age Unknown - - - - 1 1 TOTALS 27 14 2 2 4 - 1 1 TUBERCULOSIS 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 New Cases 88 73 59 51 49 45 Deaths 8 11 12 5 8 6 13 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS) DURING THE YEAR, 1958 Disease Notified cases Confirmed Deaths Scarlet Fever 81 - Whooping Cough 30 - Acute Poliomyelitis & Encephalitis 5 - Measles 339 - Dysentery 11 - Meningococcal Infection 2 - Pneumonia 58 25 Erysipelas 2 - Food Poisoning 2 - Puerperal Pyrexia 2 - Ophthalmia Neonatorum 1 - INCIDENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Disease 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 Scarlet Fever 84 52 117 88 42 81 Pneumonia 101 42 60 82 68 58 Diphtheria 0 0 0 0 0 0 Meningococcal Infection 2 0 1 2 4 2 Puerperal Pyrexia 12 6 6 9 12 2 Erysipelas 7 8 6 4 5 2 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 0 0 0 0 0 1 Meajwes 938 75 1,154 77 1,324 339 Whooping Cough 257 73 59 87 148 30 Dysentery Group 1 12 0 14 66 11 Poliomyelitis and Encephalitis 7 1 22 6 4 5 Food Poisoning 0 1 8 21 14 2 14 15 ANALYSIS OF TOTAL CASES Disease AT ACES Under 1 yr. 1 2 3 4 5-9 10-14 15-24 25 & over Age unknown TOTALS Scarlet Fever - 1 3 11 13 43 6 2 2 - 81 Whooping Cough 3 3 5 1 3 13 2 - - - 30 Acute Poliomyelitis - - - - - 1 2 - 1 - 4 Measles 9 36 43 49 69 124 5 - - 4 339 Dysentery - _ 3 2 - 5 1 - - - 11 Meningococcal Infection 1 - - - - 1 - - - - 2 Disease AT AGES Under 5 yrs. 5-14 15-44 45-64 65 & over Age unknown TOTALS Pneumonia 8 10 13 14 12 1 58 Encephalitis - - 1 - - - 1 Erysipelas - - 1 1 - - 2 Food Poisoning 1 - - 1 - - 2 Puerperal Pyrexia - - 1 1 - - 2 REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR I have the honour to present my ninth annual report on the sanitary circumstances of the district Good progress can be reported in all branches of our work The smoke control programme proceeded according to plan the 5 year programme for the clearance of unfit houses was successfully completed overcrowding was reduced to pre war level the number of cesspools and pail closets was further reduced and the improvement achieved in recent years in the standard of food hygiene was fully maintained. On the subject of atmospheric pollution it is inter estingtonote that the degree of pollution in the district is now no greater than some western residential suburban areas of London a well known northern spa and a small town in the heart of Surrey Before long the comparison should be even more favourable to Hayes. There has been a tendency recently to regard an annual report as a suitable medium for all manner of things from axe grinding to mass education It has become the fashion to include photographs in reports When used to describe something unusual or outstanding illustrations can with out doubt be of great value Too often however the sub jects are commonplace and ordinary It seems to me that the primary function of an annual report is to describe what has been attempted what has been achieved what re mains to be done and to draw attention to any current health problems in the district under review Health education must surely be more effective when written or devised specially for that purpose and with the intention of reaching the man in the street This report will not attempt to be all things to all men It is intended for the knowledgeable reader It will try to show how the environmental health services in this industrial district are meeting the problems of the day. The results shown in this report would not have been possible without the help of a keen and enthusiastic staff and the encouragement of a sympathetic and considerate Public Health Committee and I wish to place on record my 16 appreciation of their support My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following six headings, I. Sanitary Administration , viz: inspection of the district,, complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent control destruction of vermin and insect pests disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses II.

The number of complaints received was appreciablyless than last year, reductions were particularly notice able in the figures for stopped drains, defective dustbins, rats and mice and overcrowding The only figure which showed a significant increase was that for housing defects. If and when the Rent Act. 1957. achieves its declared ob ject of preventing the deterioration of houses, and ensuring that they are kept in good repair one might expect this figure to become gradually smaller. Summary of Complaints.

There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage, Nine cesspools were abolished during the year, leaving cesspools still in use at 32 premises. One pail closet was abolished but since an additional one was brought into use there is no change in the total It seems absurd that in this day and age a pail closet has to be accepted under the Factories Act, as a suitable sanitary convenience Only four of the 23 pail closets shown in the table opposite are at dwelling houses the rest being at farms factories workplaces etc 20 The table shows that there is very little scope for further progress in this direction and the abolition of cesspools will depend on owners accepting the Council's offer to undertake a connection to the sewer on payment by the owner of 50% of the cost A similar grant is also made where water closets are substituted for pail closets Cesspool drainage Pail Closets A Premises within 100 ft of an existing accessible sewer 8 4 B. Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension 3 - C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available . . 21 18 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon - 1 Totals 32 23 Four small private disposal plants are in use. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer & Surveyor's Department. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge, where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging, was continued and nuisances from this cause thereby reduced to a minimum Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under Section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs horses and cattle are in force They deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept boiling of swill drainage the storage of manure etc and have proved of considerable assistance to the Public Health Inspectors in their efforts to minimise nuisances from this source The prevention of nuisances however is of less importance than the prevention of disease By preventing conditions under which flies breed the risk of diseases which they are known to spread viz dysentery, typhoid paratyphoid and epidemic diarrhoea and poliomyelitis which they are suspected of spreading can be reduced to a minimum 21 Rodent Control. Treatment at dwelling houses is carried out free but a charge based on the cost of labour and materials is made for treatment at business and industrial premises All complaints are investigated by the Public Health Inspectors before treatment is carried out in order to find out whether the infestation is the result of defective drains, accumu lations of refuse improper keeping of animals etc Ditches, undeveloped sites, rubbish dumps and other places where infestation is likely to occur, are subject to regular routine inspection, and treated when necessary During the year 189 treatments were carried out at dwelling houses and 219 at business premises Destruction of Vermin and Insoct Pests. The incidence of bugs and fleas is now very small but there is an increasing demand for the services of the Department in getting rid of ants and wasps; infestations of cockroaches also occur from time to time usually in premises such as bakehouses or restaurant kitchens. During the year the following treatments were carried out Wasps Nests 8 Ants 5 Bugs 5 Cockroaches 2 Disinfection. In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases of which tuberculosis is a typical example All library books however which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library Facilities for the steam disinfection of bedding are available when required at St John's Hospital Uxbridge. but it has not been necessary to use these facilities during the year 22 Ponds, Ditches Watercourses, Etc, These sites are regularly inspected for rodent in festation pollution general nuisances and particularly in summer, mosquitoes When adverse conditions are found remedial action is taken PART II AIU POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas Last year I reported that the Council had adopted a 10 year programme to cover the whole of the Urban District with Smoke Control Areas This programme is now well under way and at the end of the year the following progress had been achieved Area No. Area in Acres Dwellings Other Buildings Order Operative Remarks Council Others 1 240 - 3 23 1.6.58 Order confirmed. 2 350 - 10 8 1.12.58 Order confirmed. 3 235 - 55 13 1.9.58 Order confirmed. 4 440 138 9 18 1.12.58 Order confirmed. 5 376 2 90 19 1.1.59 Order confirmed. 6 252 373 556 46 Order submitted for confir mat ion. 7 357 254 102 18 1.5.59 Order confirmed. 8 413 663 214 18 Order submitted for confir nation. 9 96 114 737 74 Details submitted to Min istry for approval in principle. 10 87 2 391 41 Details submitted to Ministry for approval in principle. Total 2876 1546 2667 278 23 These areas account for 56% of the area of the District and 21% of the dwellings in the District The only objection which has so far been made to confirmation of any of the Smoke Control Orders came from the Middlesex County Council in respect of one of their schools All other interested parties have willingly accepted such consequences as having to get used to a different kind of fuel or having to spend money on the conversion of firegrates and have received the Council's proposals not only with approval but with an unexpected degree of enthusiasm. It augurs well for the future of the smoke control programme that the general public at any rate, have adopted an enlightened attitude towards it. So far all work on Smoke Control Areas has been nh sorbed into the normal routine of the Department but shortly before the end of the year an assistant with suitable building trade experience was appointed to the staff. His duties will include the detailed surveys, most of the clerical work associated with Smoke Control Areas, and to some extent, inspecting adaptations or alterations to fireplaces before the payment of grant is approved. A meeting of coal and fuel distributors was held to explain the Council's policy and to seek the co-operation of the trade Whilst approval of Smoke Control Areas was not unanimous there was an encouraging measure of support and an undertaking was given by several merchants that they would operate a trolly" service of coke in Smoke Control Areas to overcome storage difficulties arising from the greater bulk of coke as compared with coal (b) Height of Chimneys. Under Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, 1956 plans of new -undustrial buildings deposited for byelaw approval must be rejected if the height of any chimney shown on the plans is insufficient Such plans are passed to me by the Engineer & Surveyor for a decision on this particular point, although it is now becoming common for consultations to take place with builders or architects before plans are submitted 24 During the year six plans were examined for this purpose. In every instance the original proposals were un satisfactory but the proposed chimney heights were increased after consultation with the parties concerned or the method of heating was changed to one for which a low chimney was adequate or indeed no chimney at all was necessary. This section is the only control which the Clean Air Act gives over products of combustion other than smoke grit and dust if the effects of gaseous products of com bustion including sulphur dioxide are to be minimised the best possible use should be made of these powers Unfortunately, in the eyes of some Town planners and Architects factory chimneys are in an even more unfortunate position than the Victorian child who was expected to be seen but not heard, they are not even expected to he seen All clashes of interest which have yet arisen have been solved without public health interests being unduly pre judiced. (c) Mew Furnaces. Ten notifications under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act were received regarding the installation of new furnaces but no applications for prior approval were made (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations 1958. These Regulations which came into force on the 1st June lay down the maximum periods for which dark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. It appears that local industry is well equipped to comply with these requirements No contraventions were observed and no applications were received for temporary certificates of exemption which the Council nay grant in cases where they are satisfied that it has not been practicable to alter or equip a building so as to avoid contravention of the Regulations. (e) Grit and Dust. Section 5 of the Act requires that the emission of dust and grit from furnaces shall be minimised. Although 25 no complaints have been received about grit emission for a long time it is considered that two furnaces in the District do not comply with the Act in this respect and negotiations are taking place at the moment withaview to grit arresting plant being installed at both of them. (f) New Building Byelaw re Heating and Cooking Appliances. A new building byelaw made under Section 24 of the Clean Air Act has been in force in the District from the 1st September 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating or cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas electricity oil or solid smokeless fuel. (g) Pollution from Road Vehicles. Although the Council have no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co operative attitude is met with If local authorities were given powers to deal with this aspect of clean air an improvement would soon be effected (h) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. An electric reflectometer is used for assessing smoke stains and the figures obtained are therefore far more accurate than if obtained from visual comparison with a shade card The measuring station at William Byrd School is situated in fairly close proximity to the Bath Road and London Airport but is a considerable distance away from any source of smoke particularly in a southerly and south westerly direction; the station at Coldharbour Lane is in the cen tre of the town where it is likely to receive the full effect of industrial pollution and the station at Grange 26 Park School is in the middle of a modern residential area. The abnormal frequency of fog in November and December is reflected in the high pollution figures for those months. On foggy days the degree of pollution might be ten times as much as normal. Monthly Averages for Sulphur Dioxide 1958 SULPHUR (parts per 100 million) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School Lansbury Drive January 4.9 6.7 6.1 February 3.6 5.6 6.1 March 5.4 5.9 7.5 April 2.9 * 3.3 May 1.9 2.6 1.6 June 2.1 2.5 1.8 July 1.6 2.1 1.6 August 1.3 1.6 1.2 September 2.8 3.4 2.7 October 3.3 3.9 4.3 November 7.9 5.7 9.3 December 7.0 5.3 9.6 *Not in operation. 27 Monthly Averages for Smoke 1958 SMOKE (mg per 100 Cubic Metres) William Byrd School Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School Lansbury Drive January 9.6 13.1 17.9 February 7.0 11.7 13.8 March 10.6 14.0 16.7 April 6.3 * 6.1 Hay 4.0 4.0 3.0 June 3.0 3.0 3.0 July 3.0 4.0 3.0 August 2.5 3.8 2.5 September 4.3 5.0 4.7 October 8.3 11.7 12.6 November 21.7 25.0 24.1 December 21.8 27.5 30.8 *Not in operation. These figures fully support the opinions of the Beaver Committee about the relative responsibilities of industrial and domestic premises for air pollution It can be seen that during the winter months when domestic grates are in use pollution is worse in respect of both sulphur and smoke at Grange Park School (a residential area) than in the industrial area during foggy periods sulphur pollution is 60% worse in the residential area than in the industrial area (i) Publicity A clean air exhibition was held at the Town Fete in the Town Hall Park in June The mobile demonstration van of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation occupied an adjoin ing site and attracted a lot of attention with its coke fires actually in use This was the fifth time in six years that an exhibition devoted wholly or partly to clean air has been shown in the District. Considerable publicity in the local press has resulted from the Council s activities in connection with Smoke Control Areas. 28 Large numbers of pamphlets provided by the gas electricity and solid fuel manufacturers have been distributed in proposed smoke control areas (j) Co-ordinating Committee. Towards the end of the year the Council took the initiative in suggesting the formation of a Committee to co ordinate action on smoke control areas and to pool in formation and experience on all aspects of clean air Ruislip Northwood U.D C. Southall B.C. Feltham U D C. Uxbridge B.C Ealing B.C. Heston and Isleworth B.C. Yiewsl-ey & West Drayton u D C. and Staines u.D. C. were in vited to send representatives to a meeting arranged to take place early in 1959 to discuss the setting up of a Committee PART III. FOOD Milk Supply A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are Milk Distributors 21 Dairies 5 The following licences have been issued: Designation Dealers Licences Supplementary Licences Tuberculin Tested 10 10 Pasteurised 12 10 Sterilised 17 12 An order made under Section 37 of the Food and Drugs Act 1955 specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is compulsory is in force. 29 During the year five samples of pasteurised milk and one of farm bottled tuberculin tested were taken for bacteriological examination, all passed the prescribed tests. Two licences were issued by the County Council in respect of the use of the special designation "Pasteurised" for milk processed within the district. These premises were regularly inspected by officers from the County Council who took 92 samples of pasteurised milk, all of which were satisfactory. In addition eight samples of raw milk were taken in the district by officers of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli; all gave negative results. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream. Fifteen premises are registered for the manufacture of ice cream but only two of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further 100 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream in the majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. One application for registration to sell and store ice cream was refused on account of the unsuitability of the premises concerned Subsequently improvements and alterations were carried out and registration was then granted. The methods of heat treatment laid down in the ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are used by all persons manufacturing ice cream in the district. Fifty three samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, for bacteriological examination. The use of the special standard devised by the Public Health Laboratory. Ealing, has been continued and is for convenience, set out opposite:- 30 Grade Count Faecal Coli I below 500 Nil II 500-10,000 Nil III 10,000-100,000 Nil IV Over 100,000 or Present The grading of samples taken was as follows:Ice Cream Grade I 9 or 17% Grade II 25 or 47% Grade III 7 or 13% Grade IV 12 or 23% These results are not as good as last year. The proportion of samples falling in grades II and III is almost exactly the same but there is a reduction in grade I samples with a corresponding increase in grade IV It should be remembered however that the standard by which these samples are graded is a very stringent one. Of the 19 samples in grades III and IV only two were manufactured in the district. All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water soap towels and nail brushes. The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. The two licensed slaughterhouses in use are proving more than adequate for the needs of the district Details of the animals slaughtered and diseases found are set out overleaf. 31 Carcases and Offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part Cattle Excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed 139 16 — 76 59 Number inspected 139 16 — 76 59 All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci.

The following foods (other than meat) were also condemned during the year:- Fish 93 lbs. Fish (tinned) 71 lbs. Potatoes 392 lbs. Cheese 4 lbs. Cheese Spread 10 lbs Vegetables (tinned) 139 lbs Tomatoes 110 lbs Fruit (tinned) 214½ cwts Milk (tinned) 71 lbs Butter 28 lbs. Flour 280 lbs Preserves 4 lbs. Miscellaneous Food 12 lbs Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers Small quantities of condemned foods are buried on the Councils refuse tip New byelaws relating to sanitary conditions and manage ment of private slaughterhouses are in force in the district. They are based on the Model Byelaws but improve on them by making provision for (a) hanging accommodation for meat outside the slaughtering or dressing room (b) covered accommodation for the storage of manure (c) the taking of all reasonable precautions to prevent access by domestic birds or animals not intended for slaughter into the slaughterhouses. Five slaughtermen s licences were issued Food Hygiene. The improvement of food hygiene in shops cafes restaurants canteens etc has gone on in a steady and un spectacular way With the full enforcement of the Food 33 Hygiene Regulations relating to the structural condition of food premises the greatest scope now lies in improving the methods of handling food and the personal habits of those employed in this process In large canteens where meat is reheated special attention has been paid to providing means of rapid cooling and refrigerated storage until reheating takes place The all important factor of handwashing after using the toilet is stressed on every possible occasion. No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955 have been granted. Pull use has been made of the propaganda material and posters issued by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Pood and the Central Council for Health Education. Large numbers of posters have been exhibited in places where they will do most good i.e. factory canteens school kitchens civic restaurant, food factories, etc. Byelaws made under Section 15 of the Pood and Drugs Act 1938 have been in force in the district since July, 1950. Three years ago I reported that the publication by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Pood of Codes of Practice for food handling was "imminent". My use of the word was evidently not justified as they have still not been issued For the reasons set out in last year's report Codes of Practice are eagerly awaited in the expectation that they will form a basis for the revival of the Pood Hygiene Guild. Hawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and immediately after the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, came into force the Council adopted Section 11 of the Act to extend the registration of hawkers to cover all classes of foodstuffs The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Food Hygiene Regu lations. 34 Mobile shops from which groceries, meat, fish, ice cream, refreshments etc. are sold are all fitted with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nail brushes but such a high standard is not enforceable in the case of vehicles from which fruit and vegetables are sold. Number of hawkers registered 38 Number of hawkers storage premises registered 8 Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) Miscellaneous foods such as shell-fish, cream cakes and meat products are regularly sampled by the Public Health Inspectors for bacteriological examination. Although there are no recognised standards of bacteriological quality for this class of food the results are of considerable assistance to the Inspectors in their contacts with food handlers illustrating, as they often do, that the greatest care is necessary in the storage and handling of this class of food. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory, for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respec tive headings. (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer. 35 ARTICLE TOTAL SAIWLES PROCURED UNSATISFACTORY Milk (New) 87 14 Milk (Various) 54 — Butter 12 — Cakes 5 1 Cooked Heat 5 — Cream 6 — Drugs 11 — Pish & Pish products 13 2 Pruit (Fresh & Canned Etc.) 10 — Ice Cream 7 — Meat and Meat Products 5 — Preserves 6 — Sausages Etc. 5 — Spirits 5 — Vegetables (Fresh & Canned) 5 1 Vinegar 12 — Miscellaneous 25 1 TOTALS 273 19 New Milk. The 14 samples of milk which were found to be unsatisfactory were all taken from churns of new milk con signed by different farmers to milk processing depots in your district 7 samples, all from one dairy farmer, were found to be slightly deficient in milk fat A letter of caution was sent to the farmer concerned and particulars sent to the Milk Marketing Board in order that the farmer could have the benefit of that Board s Advisory Service The remaining 7 unsatisfactory samples were procured from five different dairy farmers and in each case were from one or two churns forming part of a larger consignment In each case there was a slight deficiency in milk fat but the average composition of each consignment was satisfactory and no further action was called for Cakes A sample sold as "Cream Sponge' was found to be filled with imitation cream and an official caution was addressed to the retailer. Fish Products Two purchases of salmon rolls were made from a cafe and in each case it was found that the filling consisted of 50 per cent of Tuna fish Proceedings were 36 instituted and the retailer was fined £3 and ordered to pay £4. 7. 0d costs. Veqetables. At a greengrocer's shop Majestic potatoes were displayed for sale marked "King Edwards" . This was dealt with under the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Acts and is noted below. Liver. An official caution was sent to a retailer who sold pigs' liver in response to a request for lambs' liver. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926 and which relate to the marking with an indication of origin of certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold, are complied with. Inspections were made at 106 separate premises of 1310 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes and poultry. One firm of butchers was prosecuted for applying a false trade description "Lambs' Liver" to pigs' liver and was fined £10 together with £2 2. Od. costs. An official caution was sent to the retailer who was found to be describing Majestic potatoes as "King Edwards", mentioned above. Food Poisoning. Two cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, one was due to Salmonella typhi murium; in the other instance the causative organism was not discovered. 37 Inspection of Food Premises.

HOUSING The five year programme for the clearance of unfit houses, started in 1954 was completed by the end of the year The growth of the district took place with great rapidity between the wars i.e. from a population of 6,300 in 1921 to 51,370 in 1939. Consequently the number of old houses in the district is a very small proportion of the total and the number of unfit houses to be dealt with was at the start only 128. During the course of the programme 17 Clearance Orders were made 6 of which led to enquiries being held by Inspectors of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, no modifications to the Council's proposals resulted from these enquiries and the 31 houses dealt with as individually unfit did not lead to any appeals to the County Court. A small number of houses which have become unfit since the five year programme was drawn up, will soon be reported to the Council for action. The routine inspection of houses under the Housing and Public Health Acts was carried out to a limited extent throughout the year one would like to do much more of this work but the staff have been fully occupied on more pressing matters. Inspection of Housing during the year. 1. (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 286 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 1,370 2 (a) Number of dwelling houses which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations 1925 and 1932 98 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 127 3. Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 28 39 4 Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub heading) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 211 Remedy of Defects, etc. during the year without the service of Formal Notices. (a) Number of dwelling houses rendered fit in con seauence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers 155 (b) Number of dwellings in respect of which vol untary undertakings not to re let on ter mination of present tenancy were given — (c) Number of unfit dwellings closed in pursuance of voluntary undertakings — (d) Number of unfit dwellings demolished voluntarily 2 Action under Statutory Powers during tlhe year. (1) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs — (b) Number of dwelling bouses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (i) by owners — (ii) by Local Authority in default of owners — (2) Proceedings under Public Health Act, 1936. (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 74 (b) Number of dwelling houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices: (i) by owners 56 (ii) by Local Authority in default of owners — 40 (3) Proceedings under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Demolition orders were made or undertakings given 5 (b) Number of dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders — (4) Proceedings under Section 16 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of dwellings in respect of which Closing Orders were made 2 (b) Number of dwellings in respect of which Closing Orders were determined, the dwellings having been rendered fit — (5) Proceedings under Section 44 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of Clearance Areas declared 1 (b) Number of unfit dwellings included in Clearance Areas 10 (c) Number of unfit dwellings in Clearance Areas demolished 10 Overcrowding. At the end of the year 21 dwellings were overcrowded, fourteen cases having been abated by rehousing and five new cases having been discovered during the year. This figure represents 0.11% of the total dwellings in the district showing that statutory overcrowding does not represent a serious problem in this area. For the first time since 1939 the average number of occupants for each inhabited house in the district has fallen to 3.44, the same figure as applied in 1939. It appears reasonable to assume that the average present day dwelling is not substantially less commodious than the average pre war dwelling and it seems therefore that the ill effects of the war on the standard of housing have now been overcome The number of applicants still on the waiting list is strong enough proof however that the housing Problem is far from being solved. 41 Improvement Grants. There was a marked increase of interest in Improvement Grants towards the end of the year coinciding with the introduction into Parliament of the House Purchase and Housing Bill. This Bill makes provision for a new kind of grant for improvements, to be known as a Standard Grant, and which it is proposed will be available as a right for certain specified improvements Only one application for a grant was received and this was approved in principle and detailed specifications, drawings and estimates invited. Certificates of Disrepair. The following action was taken under the Rent Act 1957 in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 85 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair not granted 3 Landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 79 Undertakings given by landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 54 Undertakings by landlords not accepted 3 Certificates of Disrepair issued 32 Applications for cancellation of Certificate of Disrepair granted 10 Applications for cancellation of Certificate of Disrepair refused 6 Certificates as to remedying of defects issued to landlords or tenants 50 Moveable Dwellings. In 1957 the Council provided a first class site for 95 caravans, which were mainly transferred from unauthorised sites in the district. As a result only two unauthorised sites remain and in one instance proposals for improvements have been submitted which will bring the site up to the standards required by the Middlesex County Council Act. 42 New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and private developers:- Council: Houses 3 Old Persons' dwellings — Plats 42 Maisonettes 24 Private Development: Dwellings 219 Housing Association: Dwellings — 43 PART V, FACTORIES AND SHOPS Factories Act, 1937. There are one hundred and seventy nine factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including:- Aircraft building materials car accessories, caravans, carbon products chocolate cocoa coffee extracts electrical transformers electronic devices furniture lubricating oil optical lenses, radar, gramophone records and gramophones, rubber, tarmacadam, steel wool and wood block floors. Inspection of Factories. Number on Register Number of Inspec tions Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted Factories with mech anical power 179 340 25 — Factories without mechanical power 5 12 — — Other premises under the Acts (including work of building and engineering construction, but not including outworkers' premises) 15 58 1 — Total 199 410 26 — Defects Found. Particulars Number of Defects Found Remedied Sanitary accommodation (Section 7): insufficient 2 1 Unsuitable or defective 24 25 Not separate for sexes — — Other offences — — Total 26 26 Outworkers. Part VIII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons to carry out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. One hundred and five notifications were received and 106 in spections made; in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops Act. All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to 643 premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 1,115 visits. In addition 22 tours of duty were undertaken outside normal office hours i.e. in the evenings and on Sundays. As a result 4 informal notices were served but in no instance was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises is held in the Public Health Department. Recent legal decisions have reduced to absurdity the provisions of the Shops Act dealing with Hours of Closing and Sunday trading and the sooner they are completely revised the better. The weakness of one part of the Act how ever should not be allowed to overshadow the good work done under other parts of the Act in connection with heating, lighting, ventilation, sanitary and welfare facilities for shop assistants. PAKT VI. MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide. During the year 110 licences were issued in respect of: 45 124,470 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures 44,495 gallons of cellulose solutions, 896 lbs. of calcium carbide. 955 gallons of other oils. All licences now incorporate the Model Licensing Conditions suggested by the Home Office in 1957 following the report of the working party into the explosion at the M. & M Mart Garage, Bristol The Council have adopted the latest recommendations of the Home office for the electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps and this work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified officer in the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. During the year 365 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and three minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district all but one, on account of the type of filling used, fall outside the scope of the Act. These premises are registered and were visited four times during the year. The other premises used for upholstery and similar trades are also visited, occasionally so that if circumstances change and a type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted. Such app liances are sold at 38 shops in the district and 14 visits were made to these premises by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are sold under conditions which do not expose them to 46 cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Three premises are licensed under the Act and 9 visits were made by Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the licence. Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act, relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and parts of the district are still sufficiently rural to provide a use for these provisions. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the local authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises, of which there are four, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. 47
