Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report of the Statistics and General Sanitary Conditions of the District during the year 1896. METEOROLOGY. The winter all through was a mild one, being in strong contrast to the first quarter of 1895, when the temperature fell to zero. In November and December of 1895 the temperature was above the average, also in each month of the first quarter of 1896, being nearly four degrees in January, 1.6 in February and 4.6 in March, the weather generally was dull. The amount of rain was below the average in January and February, but 1.48 in. above it in March. In the second quarter the temperature was also above the average in each month, being five degrees above in June; the rainfall was 51 percent. below the average, or half the usual amount. In the third quarter the temperature was a little above the average, being 3.6 above in July, 1.7 below in 4 August, 0.1 above in September; the rainfall was l.39 in. above the average. In some parts in the north of London the amount that fell was nearly 7 in. in September. The temperature in August, the time of the general holidays, was cool; the amount of rain in September made the month feel cold and ungenial. Fourth quarter: the mean temperature was 1.2 below the average for the quarter, but was 1.2 above in December, the month was dull with great variations of temperature. The amount of rain was 6.99 in., and although there seemed to have been a great deal of wet, the amount was slightly below the average for the three months, but was 1 in. above in December. THE DISTRICT AND WARDS. The District is situate on the north-western border of the Metropolis, and is somewhat triangular in outline. The southern boundary extends from Maida Vale, Edgware Road on the east to parish of Twyford on the west, a linear distance of about 4 miles. It abuts in its course the parishes of Paddington, Chelsea (detached), Kensington, Hammersmith and Acton. The north-western boundary is the River Brent and Twyford parish, a linear distance of about 3½ miles. 5 The north-eastern boundary is the main road from London to Edgware from a point nearly 300 yds. below the London and North-Western Railway, known as Kilburn Gate, to the Welsh Harp Reservoir at Hendon, a distance of over 3 miles. At the beginning of the year 1895, the Willesden Local Board of the previous twenty years had ceased to exist, and the Willesden Urban District Council commenced. With the change on January 1st, there was also a change in the number and area of the Wards, the Local Board, consisting of fifteen members and four Wards, being replaced by the District Council with twenty-one members and seven Wards. As the census of 1891 dealt with the population in the four Wards, it has not been found possible to give the population of the new areas, as they were at that time, and therefore no reference can be made indicating the increase of each, but the progress of the District generally has apparently made a greater stride than hitherto, the estimated increase of population being 5,620, nearly 900 more than the increase of the previous year. From 1881 to 1891, the average yearly increase was 3,365. 6 DESCRIPTION OF THE AREAS AND BOUNDARIES OF THE NEW WARDS. No. 1, North-West Ward.—This is bounded on the west by the River Brent, on the south by Harrow Road, Old Harrow Road, St. Mary's Road and Roundwood Ditch and Road, and by Kingsbury Road, Dudden Hill Lane, Pound Lane and Harlesden Lane on the east. This embraces Stonebridge, north of Harrow Road, Church End, and the portion of Neasden, south-west of Kingsbury Road. No. 2, South-West Ward.—This boundary on the north is conterminous with No. 1 Ward by Harrow Road, Old Harrow Road, St. Mary's Road and Roundwood Ditch and Road. It then passes through the Green Lane to the Victor Road Railway Bridge, Kensal, and is bounded on the south by Hammersmith and Acton. This includes Harlesden Green and Lower Place. No. 3, South Central Ward.—This adjoins the No. 2 boundary at the Green Lane to Victor Road Railway Bridge, Kensal. and thence passes eastward along the Harrow Road to Kilburn Lane, and following the Chelsea and Paddington boundary to Salusbury Road, West Kilburn, turning northward through the latter to the North-London Railway line, which forms the northern boundary as far as Kensal Rise Station. At this point it turns northward along the Chambers Lane Footpath, to a point from which it 7 turns westward through fields and intersects Harlesden Road at Newbery Road, nearly opposite the new Recreation Ground. This Ward includes Kensal Rise and the portion of Kilburn west of Salusbury Road. No. 4, South Kilburn Ward.—This is a somewhat triangular area south of the London and Northwestern Railway, two of the sides abut upon the Paddington district, and the north is divided from No. 5 Ward by Cambridge Avenue, Chichester Road and the western portion of Canterbury Road. No. 5, Mid Kilburn Ward.—This is located north of the last Ward, No. 4, through Cambridge Avenue, Chichester Road and the western portion of Canterbury Road. It is bounded on the west by Salusbury Road, and Kilburn High Road on the east, and on the north by No. 6 or North Kilburn Ward, through Glengall Road and rear of Paddington Cemetery. No. 6, North Kilburn Ward.—This is north of the No. 5 or Mid Kilburn Ward and conterminous at Glengall Road. It extends east and west from the Kilburn High Road to Salusbury Road, and on the north-west is bounded by Coverdale Road and Mapesbury Road to the Mill at Shoot-up Hill. No. 7, North-East Ward.—This includes Willesden Green and Cricklewood. It is bounded by the 8 Welsh Harp Reservoir and the Brent River on the north, by Edgware Main Road as far as the Mill at Shoot-up Hill and Brondesbury Park on the east, by Kingsbury Road, Dudden Hill Lane, Pound Lane and Harlesden Road on the west, and on the south by No. 3 Ward—by a course through fields from Harlesden Road, opposite the Recreation Ground, to Chambers Lane Footpath, and the North-London Railway from Kensal Station to Salusbury Road. BRENT RIVER AND SEWERAGE. During the long dry season the Canal Company sent no water down the course of the stream, so that the pools became very bad for want of cleansing by a fresh flow. The question of the river and the sewerage has been under the consideration of the Council, and extensive additions in land and works are being made to the sewage field in tanks and filtering beds. THE WATER SUPPLY. This is by the West Middlesex Water Company. No alteration in the mode of supply has been made, except in two roads in the Stonebridge District, where a constant supply has been put on. A constant supply all over the District is greatly needed. 9 TABLE No. 1. Population at Census, 1891. Houses placed on Rate - book since Census, less 5.9 per cent. for empties.

Metropolitan District 53,948 1,081 Brent District 31,473 3,302 Totals 85,421 4,383 The estimated population at Midsummer is 85,421, to which must be added 331; 200 in the Workhouse and 131 in Lunatic Asylums. The latter included 49 males and 82 females. The natural increase of births over deaths was 1,450. 11 The actual estimated increase for the year is 6,238, being the highest rate of increase of any year, and 618 more than the increase of last year; it indicates an increase of nearly 4,800 by immigration. From a return received from the Clerk to the Guardians, it appears that there are 200 inmates of the Workhouse belonging to Willesden; children 30; adults: males 60; females 110. This is equal to an average of 0.23 per cent. of the population. Last year the average was 0.20, so that there was an increase of pauperism during the year. From the same return it appears that there were 131 persons in Lunatic Asylums, 49 males, 82 females; last year there were 94, so that there is an increase of 37. This also indicates a general increase, as the average for last year was 0.11 per cent., whereas this year it is 0.15. This increase of lunacy appears to be a serious subject of consideration; in 1894 the number of persons in Asylums was 89; in 1895 it was 94, and in 1896 amounted to 131. The increase of pauperism and the increase in lunacy going on at the same time seem to point to a greater struggle on the part of the poor to obtain a livelihood. 12 TABLE No. 3. MARRIAGES.

The average rate for the last five years has been 31.6, so that this is rather an increase. The births registered in each of the last five years are as follows, viz.:— rate for the year. 1892 2,085 31.7 1893 2,252 32.5 1894 2,264 30.7 1895 2,469 31.1 1896 2,749 32.2 The birth-rate for England and Wales for the year 29.7. Illegitimate Births.—Boys, 26; girls, 33; total, 59, being 2.1 per cent. of births, the same as last year. 14 DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered in the District during the year was 1,210; males, 602; females, 608, equal to a rate of 14.16 per 1,000. In order to make the returns as complete as possible, I applied to the Registrar-General for information of the deaths occurring in public institutions in the Metropolis of people belonging to Willesden. An arrangement was made by which I was supplied with the required information for the year, and further that I should have such information at stated times for the current year by paying a small sum. The number of deaths occurring in the Metropolis were found to be 72; there were also the deaths (31) which occurred in the Workhouse of Willesden people to be added, and those (8) in Lunatic Asylums, making a total of 111, but there were also nine deaths occurring in Willesden of people not belonging to it, and which therefore have to be deducted, thus leaving a total of 102 to be added to the 1,210, the full total of deaths was consequently 1,312. This is the first time that I have been able to add the number from the Metropolis, and the death-rate is consequently higher, equal to 15.29 per 1,000, but it is of course rendered much more correct and therefore more valuable. The death-rate for England and Wales for the year was 17.0. Of the deaths in the Workhouse and Lunatic 15 Asylums there were, males, 21; females, 18. In the former there were 13 under five years of age. Infant Deaths.—The deaths under one year of age have been 460, this amount is largely owing to a severe outbreak of measles in the spring and to diarrhoea in the summer, the two diseases causing 101 deaths. Of children from one to five years of age there were 240 deaths. Measles and whooping cough causing 108. The three diseases, measles, whooping cough and diarrhoea caused together 233 deaths of children under five years of age. Neither of these diseases are required to be notified. Deaths of Illegitimate Children.—There were 46 of these deaths. Inquests were held in two cases, 39 were certified, and five were not and there was no inquest. The causes of death were returned as bronchitis, 3; convulsions, 5; debility, 15; diarrhoea, 11; measles, 1; newly born, 1; overlaying, 1; pneumonia, 4; premature birth, 2; quinsy, 1; teething 1; whooping cough, 1; total, 46. Of those not certified three were from convulsions and two debility. The verdicts in the inquests were, overlaying, 1; newly born, no evidence to show cause, 1. 16 Inquiries were made in all these cases in order to find if they were out at nurse or in charge of their mothers, and to see that the Infant Life Protection Act was complied with. The causes of the accidental were returned as: suffocation in bed, 9; shock from injury, 2; born into pan of w.c., 1; burns, 1; drowning, 1; poisoning by carbolic acid, 1; fall from height, 1. From natural causes: pneumonia, 2; heart disease, 6; apoplexy, 1; drink, 1; insufficient food and warmth (miserly), 1; rupture, 1. Suicide: killed by passing train, 2; shot, 1; cutting throat, 1. Doubtful: no evidence to show cause, 1. Total, 33. The statistics of the various Wards indicate a rapid growth of population. Inquests.—Thirty-three inquests have been held, the verdicts being no. Accidental 16 Natural causes 12 Suicide 4 Doubtful 1 Total 33 Some portions of the District have already so nearly obtained their full growth that very little in the way of increase can take place; a comparison of last year with this is the best guide. 17 WAKD.

The increase in this part is an indication of how Greater London is spreading; it has hitherto been a rural district, but is rapidly becoming a township, not by itself, but joined to the Metropolis by the long lines of houses, four miles in length, stretching out along the Edgware Road from the Marble Arch. Only a very short time ago there was a distinct gap between Cricklewood and Willesden Green, but that has now disappeared. The greatest increase of the District, however, appears to be in the area of Willesden Green proper, in the line of the Metropolitan Railway. The 18 dents of No. 4 Ward being so much more crowded together, it might be expected that the highest death-rate would occur there; measles and inflammation of the lungs were the causes of 56 deaths of children under one year in that Ward. The Ward death-rate was lowest in No. 7. 19 TABLE No. 6. SUMMARY OF DEATHS. I.—Specific Febrile, or Zymotic Diseases :— Total. 1. Miasmatic 239 2. Diarrhœl 72 3. Malarial ... 4. Zoogenous ... 5.

CHART OF NOTIFICATIONS FOR 1896. FORD & SON, LITHOS KILBURN. (23) NOTIFICATIONS. These are required under the Local Act of 1887, and came into operation in October of that year. The infectious diseases requiring to be notified are diphtheria, cholera, typhus fever, typhoid fever, relapsing, continued and puerperal fevers, scarlet fever, small pox, membranous croup and erysipelas. The total number of notifications has been more than last year, but only slightly so in poportion to the population, 815 were received, giving an average of 9.5 per 1,000, last year it was 9.3. The amount paid to medical men for certificates of notification was £94 5s. 6d., and the cost of disinfecting rooms after infectious diseases was £139 10s. 0d. During the last four years the following cases have been notified. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896.

Small Pox.—Two cases were notified, but one subsequently proved not to be small pox, so that the last case occurring in the Parish was in January. Scarlet Fever.—This disease has prevailed to a considerable extent, but not nearly so extensively as in 1893, when the average number of persons attacked was 8.5 per 1,000; in 1895 it was 4'9 per 1,000, and in 1896 rather more or 5.5. In my Report for 1891, I drew attention to the number of children who were susceptible to scarlet fever, estimating them at 4,000; these would at the present, if living, all be over five years of age, but still liable to take the disease. Since then there have been 11,820 children born, of whom 1,810 have (25) died, and 658 have had scarlet fever, leaving a total of 9,352 children under five years liable to take the disease. During these five years there have been 1,432 cases of scarlet fever notified of persons over five years of age, many of whom, however, have been over the school age; there have also been 814 deaths of children between five and ten years of age; these figures, supposing all the cases notified to have been under ten years of age, would leave 1,754 out of the above 4,000 still liable to the disease, it thus appears that there are over 11,000 children under ten years of age who are susceptible. This takes no notice of children between 10 and 13 years of age who are still attending school, nor of the number of children brought into the District by immigration. The total number of cases notified has been 475, it thus becomes a subject of interest and surprise, not that there have been so many cases, but that there should have been so few. Diphtheria.—This disease has not prevailed to such an extent as last year, and not nearly so much as in 1893, the deaths have also been less. Measles.—This disease prevailed to a lamentable extent in the spring, and caused 124 deaths, or nearly double the number of those diseases which are notified. 1 recommended that some schools should be closed, which was done with considerable advantage; it would have been necessary to have recommended others, but the holidays intervened (26) and answered the purpose. In my Report for last year, I drew attention to the fact that schools were the centres of propagation, and I would again emphasize those remarks with regard to these three diseases. I consider it essential that every head teacher in a school, whether public or private, should be required to give notice of every child who is away from the school on account of measles; with regard to scarlet fever and diphtheria, notice is sent to the school from the Sanitary Department, but at the same time if a teacher does not receive notice of a case that has come to his knowledge he should at once forward a report. If such notices were forwarded. much might be done in checking the progress of measles. Those schools where children from three to five years of age are attending are of the utmost importance. There is, however, another class of schools which urgently require to be brought under more sanitary observation, I allude to Sunday schools. Here there are a totally distinct set of teachers without any official knowledge if any disease of an infectious nature is affecting a family, the children may consequently attend, and all the good that has been effected at the day schools during the week may be quietly undone on the Sunday. I do not wish to imply that the heads of these schools are not as anxious as anyone to check the spread of disease, but they have not the information. Typhoid Fever.—There have been fewer cases of this disease, the death-rate being about the same; (27) it has not been confined to any particular part, in three Wards there were 11 cases in each, but in No. 3 Ward there was only one, and in No. 4 only two. The highest number notified in any one week was four. In the autumn when the disease is most usually prevalent there were few, only nine cases were notified during the last quarter. Diarrhœa.—This disease prevailed to a considerable extent during the hot weeks of the summer; there were 68 deaths of children under five years of age. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. This has continued in work during the year. A total of 343 cases have been admitted from our own District; of these there were 282 cases of scarlet fever and 51 of diphtheria. Owing to special circumstances I allowed three cases of erysipelas to be sent for treatment, but as a general rule I should not consider that disease as one quite suitable for admission; it requires separation, which there frequently is not sufficient accommodation for. The question of admitting puerperal fever has also arisen; this disease would require separate accommodation and nurse. Under very special conditions it might be important to remove a patient from the surroundings of her own home, in that case I should endeavour to meet the necessity, though the (28) sponsibility of sanctioning the removal would rest with the doctor requesting it. DISINFECTION. The disinfection of bedding and clothing has been carried on throughout the year and been done with care by the person in charge of the apparatus. I have not received any complaints of damage to any goods. In the case of books from the Public Libraries, if bound in leather they are sure to be injured, but cloth and paper are not affected. The cost of disinfecting during the year has been £118 2s. 1d. VACCINATION RETURNS. No. of Births for the year 1896. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible to Vacciuation. Dead unvaccinated.

This Act came into force at the beginning of the year, it now includes Laundries, which are defined as Factories or Workshops, according as to whether power or hand labour is used in the work. There are a great number of Laundries located at various parts of the District, but with the (29) tion of the London and Provincial Laundry, Kilburn Lane, Stonebridge Laundry, Barry Road, and the Steam Laundry, Dyne Road, they are not on a large scale, the largest employing not more than twenty hands for five days in the week. There were 162 inspections, and notices were given in some of them to cleanse and whitewash, amend drains, and provide additional w.c. accommodation. Other Workshops were also inspected as follows:—dressmakers, 30: tailors, 10: boot-makers, 3; coach and carriage makers, 4; dentists, 2; upholsterers, 3; smiths and tinmen, 6: bakehouses, 49. Most of these were of small dimensions, some employing only two or three hands, just bringing them within the scope of the Statute. Notices were served in some instances to amend conditions. Some of the businesses in the manufacture of wearing apparel, employ out-workers. Forms were left with the proprietors of those businesses for the entry of the names and addresses of the out-workers employed. These were duly copied and entered into Register. The Bakehouses were all required to cleanse and whitewash in accordance with the Regulations of the Council. (30) COWSHEDS, DAIRIES AND MILKSHOPS ORDER. The Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops were inspected, and notices were served where they required cleansing and whitewashing. In some instances the change of proprietors had not duly been registered, and these were called upon to register in accordance with the Privy Council Orders. SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COMMON LODGING HOUSES. These were also inspected, and the usual notices were served to cleanse and whitewash. INFANT LIFE PROTECTION ACT. There were no houses in the District registered under this Act at the commencement of the year. Applications were made, and in one instance reported on satisfactorily, and the premises were registered for three children. The person in this case had been previously registered, and removed from the London County Council area into this District, and her house was accordingly registered for three infants in November, 1896. One death occurred here at the end of November, a male five weeks old, the cause of death being certified by a Medical Practitioner as acute bronchitis, 10 days, and syncope. (31) Inquiries were made in all cases where illegitimate children had died, in order to find whether they were in charge of the mothers or placed out at nurse. The result shewed that of 46 illegitimate deaths, 28 were placed out at nurse. In no case, however, was there another child under twelve months in charge, so that no infringements of the Statute were discovered. GRANVILLE ROAD SHELTER, In my last Annual Report, I reported a nuisance from a shelter and rest for destitute men in Peel Road, Kilburn, established by the Church Extension Association. The congregation of these men outside the building formed the subject of continual complaint and the premises were finally closed by order of the Council. After an interval of a few months, other and larger premises in Granville Road, Kilburn, were taken by the same Association, and opened for the same purpose, the Peel Road premises being again utilised for the overflow. I inspected the place with the Chief Inspector at about one o'clock in the day on the 10th of March. There were then about 60 men in the building, and (32) I again visited it at night on the 11th. There were then 250 men in the place, lying asleep on the floors and on balconies, with their boots and jackets for pillows, and others resting their heads on the tables. The place was decidedly overcrowded, and the ventilation insufficient. The premises in question were quite unsuitable for the purposes to which they were put, having originally been sanctioned by the Willesden Local Board as baths and wash-houses. Proceedings were accordingly taken under section 33 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, against the Association for allowing a building to be used for the purposes of habitation, not originally sanctioned as such, and for not providing the air space required by the Bye-Laws. The Magistrate before whom the case was heard inflicted a fine of £5 and costs. Notice of appeal was given by the defendants, but was subsequently withdrawn, and the use of the premises for habitation purposes discontinued. ( 33 ) SPECIAL COMPLAINTS, 1896. no.
