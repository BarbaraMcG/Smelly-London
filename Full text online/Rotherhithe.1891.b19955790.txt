Complaints having been made as to the inefficiency of the Sewer between Neston Street and Dodds Place, into which certain houses and premises in Eotherhithe Street were drained, the Vestry instructed the Surveyor of Sewers to report as to the cost of taking up the old barrel drain and laying a 12-inch pipe Sewer in Concrete with the necessary manholes in lieu thereof. The Surveyor of Sewers subsequently submitted an estimate from Messrs. John Hoare & Son, the Vestry's Contractors, at the sum of £146, which was accepted, and the work has been carried out. The London County Council having written to the Vestry stating it had occurred to them in considering the question of Sewer ventilation, that its efforts in that direction would be greatly 15 assisted if the Vestry would, previously to sanctioning the construction of any new Sewers in this Parish, make a provision to the following effect:— That the person or persons constructing such Sewers should undertake to form in connection with them a proper number of road ventilators, as well as a sufficient number of ventilating pipes or shafts, to be carried up the buildings when erected abutting upon the streets ; And asking that the Vestry would, should it meet with their concurrence, give effect to the suggestion, the Vestry referred the letter to the Surveyor of Sewers for attention. Circular Iron Urinals have been provided and fixed in the public thoroughfares, in the following positions, viz.: Botherhithe New Road, opposite Bush Boad, to accommodate five persons, and at the junction of Hawkstone Boad and Old Boad, opposite the East London Railway Station, to accommodate five persons, at a cost of £160 0s. 1d. Lamps have been affixed to the summit thereof and lighted, and agreements entered into with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company for the supply of water thereto. The Sewers' Flushers having applied for an increase of wages and for an annual holiday, the Vestry referred the matter to the General Purposes Committee, who carefully considered the reference to them, and upon their recommendation it was resolved that no addition be made to the present rate of wages paid the Sewers' Flushers, viz.: 30s. per week, but that a week's holiday be granted annually in addition to the statute holidays.

The footway on the south side thereof has been widened on an average about one foot and on the north side reduced to a like extent and the paving relaid. The work has been carried out by Messrs.

The Paving of Suffolk Street extension has been completed by Mr. J. H. Etheridge (particulars of cost, &c., which has been paid by the owners of property abutting thereon will be found at page 8.)

The South Metropolitan Gas Company notify an increase in the price of Gas from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. per 1,000 feet, from Michaelmas, 1891, but as they believe the increase will be temporary only, they had decided to make no addition to the present charge for ordinary public lamps, viz.: £3 3d. 9d. per lamp per annum, and under those circumstances any further reduction in such charge would be delayed until the price of Gas fell below 2s. 3d. Cleansing, Watering, &c. Messrs. A. T. Hobman & Son still contract for the supply of Men, Horses, and Carts, and for the removal of the Sweepings from the whole of the roads and streets to a shoot to be provided by them, 18 Messrs.

The Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector have been appointed, with their Assistants, the Officers of the Vestry to take all such steps as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Local Government Board having called the attention of the Vestry to the necessity of taking the most energetic measures in connection with cases of small-pox, by way of securing as far as possible, the isolation of the patient, the vaccination of any persons who may have been exposed to infection, the disinfection of the premises, and any further action which the circumstances will admit of, for the purpose of checking the extension of the disease; also stating they deemed it desirable that the authority should, as regards each case, be informed precisely of the measures which had been taken by the Medical Officer of Health, and asking to be furnished with copies of the Reports made by him on the subject, the Vestry had resolved that the letter be acknowledged and referred to the Medical Officer of Health for attention. The Vestry having had under consideration the question of the provision of a yard or place for the use of the Sanitary Department, they resolved that a portion of the open shed in the stone yard be boarded in and utilised for that purpose. The necessary alterations were carried out 19 under the direction of the Surveyor of Pavements, and the keys thereof handed over to the proper officers. It was further resolved that no article of a nature likely to cause infection he taken into the same. Mr. Beasley having given Notice of Motion, as follows:— 2nd June, 1891.

On the 6th October, 1891, Notice of Motion was given by Mr. Stuart, as follows, viz.:— "I hereby give Notice that I shall, at the next Ordinary Meeting of the Board, call attention to the alterations that have taken place since the Bye-laws were framed, and that a Committee be formed to go through them and revise them accordingly." 33 The matter was referred to a Special Meeting of the General Purposes Committee, and upon their recommendation it was resolved that Bye-laws 1 to 3, 5 to 8, and 10 to 27 remain as they are, and that Nos. 4, 28, and 29, be struck out altogether; that the last clause in No. 9 be altered as follows:— That the Clerk obtain the name of the speaker appointed by the deputation in attendance and hand it to the Chairman; and that the word "agenda" be substituted for the word "business" in Bye-laws Nos. 17 and 19. The attention of the Vestry having been drawn to the fact that a few years ago when the old buildings on the site of Church Wharf, which belonged to the Trustees of the Amicable Society's School, were pulled down by the Assignees of the Lease, the new buildings erected thereon were set back on the west side to the extent of 2 feet 7½ inches, they caused a tablet to be inserted in the west wall thereof denoting the boundary of the charity property at that spot. Several of the river fronts abutting upon parish rights of way to the river have been repaired and reinstated at the cost of the Vestry during the year. The following is a list of the 25 public rights of way to the river in this Parish:— Opposite West Lane. Platform Stairs. King's Stairs. Prince's Stairs. Elephant Stairs. Church Stairs. Spread Eagle Stairs. Timothy's Wharf, east and west sides. Hanover Stairs. Surrey Dock Stairs. King and Queen Stairs. King and Queen Wharf. Globe Stairs. Horseferry Stairs. Pageants Stairs.

Mr. Francis Harker Thomas, who had been in the service of the Vestry since 8th May, 1874, a period of over 17 years, as an Assistant Clerk in the Vestry Offices, tendered his resignation upon his appointment as Registrar of Births and Deaths for Rotherhithe, which was accepted by the Vestry on the 3rd June, 1891.
