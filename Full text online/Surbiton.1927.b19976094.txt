Public Health Department, Council Offices, Eweel Road, Surbiton. June, 1928. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my sixth Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Urban District of Surbiton for the year ended December 31st, 1927. This report is for the most part mainly statistical, drawn up according to the directions contained in the Ministry of Health Circular 834, and is known as an Ordinary Report. The Birth Rate throughout England and Wales for 1927 is 16.7, while the rate for Surbiton is 14.8 per 1000 of the population, and is lower than last year; the cause for this is probably economical and housing shortage. 6 The Death Rate for England and Wales is 12.3 and that for Surbiton 12.3. The Infantile Mortality Rate for England and Wales is 45 per 1000 births and for this district it is 50.3 per 1000 births. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. H. LINZEE, Medical Officer of Health. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (in acres) 3,046 Population (Census 1921) 19,574 Population (estimated 1!)27) 21,440 Number of inhabited houses (1921) 4,372 Number of families or separate occupiers (1921) 4,767 Rateable Value £223,740 Sum represented by a penny rate £300 The district is entirely a residential one, the majority of the inhabitants are engaged in London. The figure returned by the Registrar General for the population of this district is 21,440 on which the statistics are based, is in my opinion greatly under estimated. 7 1.—EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR.

The causes and ages at death of the 17 children who died under the age of 1 year were as follows:— Premature Birth, Oedima of Lungs 15 hours. Prematurity 4 days. Acute Primary Pneumonia 4 months. Broncho Pneumonia 9 months. Acute Broncho Pneumonia, Heart Failure 2 months. 9 Premature Birth and Congenital Heart Disease with Cyonosis 2 days. Rickets, Tetany and Broncho Pneumonia 3 months.

Marasmus, Spina Bifida, Meningocele 3 weeks. Prematurity, Marasmus 3 weeks. The various rates compared with those for England and Wales (Smaller Towns) are given in the table below:— Per 1,000 Living. Per 1,000 Births. Births. Deaths. Diarrhœa under 2 years. Under 1 year. England and Wales (Smaller Towns) 16.7 12.3 6.3 69 Surbiton 14.8 12.3 Nil 50.3 INFANT MORTALITY. The Infant Mortality rate is calculated on the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 births and that rate for Surbiton is 50.3 which is favourable as regards 10 that for England and Wales, namely 69, however this is higher than the previous two years. In looking into the deaths occurring in infants under one year there are a total of 17 and out of that 12 occurred in the first month and eight in the first week, 7 of the 12 deaths were due to premature births. This shows that with further care of the expectant mother and ante-natal treatment the infantile mortality may be lowered. 3.-NOTIFIABLE DISEASES DURING THE YEAR. Disease. Total Cases Notified.
