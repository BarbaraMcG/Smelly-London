Len 89 SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1862 - MARCH, 1863 ) 34 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF KENSINGTON. Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Kensington. June, 1863. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you a brief abstract of the mortality which has taken place in your Parish during the past year, classified according to age and cause of death ; an account of nuisances removed or abated, and on other matters connected with the Sanitary Department, as required by the Act of Parliament. The Mortality Lists are made up as usual, from January to December, and the proceedings taken under the Nuisances Removal Act, from March to March. The necessity for returning the death rate in this manner is, that it will enable you to compare it with that issued by the Registrar General for the whole country. In estimating the mortality I am indebted to the kindness of the Registrar General, who continues gratuitously to forward me weekly a correct account of all the births and deaths which have taken place in the two wards of the Parish. Without this information it would be both difficult and expensive to obtain accounts of the prevalence of infectious disorders, &c., from week to week. The total number of deaths during this period has been— males. females. total. Brompton 224 218 442 Kensington 590 573 1162 814 791 1604 This shews a decrease in the Brompton Ward of 42 from last year, and in the rapidly increasing population of Kensington Ward, an increase of 199, being a total increase of 157 for the entire parish. This is 35 entirely due to the increase of death in the male population. 121 deaths occurred in the Consumption Hospital (73 males and 48 females) ; 15 deattis in the Cancer Hospital (5 males and 10 females); nearly all those being non-parishioners. 88 paupers died in your Workhouse (52 males, 36 females). This gives a total gain to the parish of 356 births in excess of deaths. The following tables point out the quarterly deaths from diseases of a zymotic or infectious character:— Brompton, 1862.

The mortality from diarrhcea has been much below the average. From diseases of the lungs there died— Phthisis Bronchitis and Asthma Pneumonia In the 1st Quarter 81 60 25 ,, 2nd 79 32 16 „ 3rd „ 67 20 13 „ 4th „ 75 38 16 302 150 70 522 therefore represents the total number of deaths from lung diseases, and includes the 121 deaths in the Consumption Hospital. This is about our annual average number. The number of infants who died under 5 years of age, amounts to 617, or 38.5 per cent, of the total deaths which occurred. I append, as usual, a list of nuisances which were reported on by me to the Sanitary Committee, with the result of the orders of the Vestry for abatement or removal. This list comprises only those nuisances brought under notice of the Committee, but gives no account of the numerous cases remedied without the necessity of official interference.

Fifty slaughter-houses were licensed at the magistrate's court, and are under the constant supervision of Mr. Lovett, the Inspector of Nuisances, as also are 49 cow-houses, for which the owners obtained permission to keep cows. I am happy to state that in only one case has it been found necessary to seize meat of a diseased or putrid character. I remain, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FRANCIS GODPICII, Medical Officer of Health.
