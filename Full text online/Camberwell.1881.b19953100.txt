The following "Local Improvements" have been carried out by the Vestry since the date of the last Annual Report:— Peckham Road, by Pelican Houses.—Ground given up to public. Footway widened and tar paved. The owner paying a moiety of the cost. Forest Hill Road (East side), from railway bridge down to Peckham rye (Stevens' Estate).— The road is being widened and the footpath set back as the building operations progress.

Queen's Road, from Burchell Road to Hollydale Road.—At the cost of the Vestry. TAR PAVED FOOTPATHS. The repairs to above continue to be executed with materials provided by the Vestry, and the labourers in the Vestry employ. The trenches opened in the public footpaths by the Gas and Water Companies are likewise so repaired, the cost thereof being charged to the respective Companies. The approximate length of tar paved footpath repaired, painted and shelled, as above, during the past year was in length about 18 miles. Do. New Works executed by Mr. Hobman under his Contract 9 „ This system of repair by the Vestry workmen and materials has effected a satisfactory state of these paths. 10 ROAD WATERING. The public roads of this parish have been watered as previously. The cost for the supply of water for the same being as follows:— Source of Water Supply for Road Watering. Length of Road watered.

The work of this department continues to be executed by means of the Vestry Plant, Horses, &c., the results are in every way satisfactory, both as to efficiency and economy, and their results are especially due to the fact that the Vestry having the entire system under its control is not subject to the fluctuations, expedients and inconveniences suffered under the former system of contracting. Slopping Appliances in hands of Vestry. The Plant in use for this Department for the past year has averaged as follows:— Horses 68 Water Vans 46 Water Carts 9 Material Carts 32 Slop Carts 40 Horse Road Brooms 4 Horse Road Roller 1 Plant, Horses, &c. During the past year a very serious epidemic took place in the metropolis which visited the stud of horses of Railway Companies, Carriers, Vestries, &c., most seriously, but your Committee has the satisfaction to report that during such epidemic of Horse Sickness, out of a total of 85 12 horses (inclusive also of the Dust Department) lost only 7 horses, this satisfactory result was principally attributable to the excellent supervision maintained at the respective stables and also to the marked care and watchfulness evinced by their Veterinary Mr. Frederick Stanley, during the prevalence of the epidemic. Excepting a few ordinary cases of illness the stud is at this time in very good condition. Health of Horses. The cost of the fodder, &c., expended in the keep of the 68 horses for watering and slopping purposes amounted to £3,489 6s. 5d., during the past twelve months, this averages about 19s. 9d. per horse, per week, being somewhat in excess of the last year's calculation, which is accounted for by the increase in the prices of horse provender, which ruled throughout the year. Cost of Fodder The consumption per horse, per week, was as follows:— Clover, Mixture, and Hay 2½ Trusses. Straw inclusive of bedding 1¾ Trusses. Oats 3 Bushels. Beans ½ Bushel. Bran 1/8 Bushel. 13 The working cost of the "Slopping and Watering Department" includes not only the wages of the Drivers, Horse Keepers, &c., but also the purchase of new vans, watering and slop carts, and other necessary additions to the plant, and the repairs of the same, also all wheelwright's work, painting, &c., and the cost of water for Road Watering purposes, repairs to pumps, hydrants, &c. It also includes the cost of the haulage of road materials on to the roads, which work is performed by the Vestry plant, and this latter work therefore ia a reduction upon the total cost charged to the Slopping and Watering department. Cost of Slopping, Watering &c. The expenditure stands thus:— Total Cost of Work under this £ s. d. Department of Works 12,758 0 0 Amount due to Cartage of Materials on to Public Roads, Road rolling, &c. &c. 3,335 0 0 Cost of Watering and Slopping £9,423 0 0 equal to £134 per mile. DISPOSAL OF ROAD SWEEPINGS. The subject of the disposal of the road sweepings continues to be a source of anxiety and 14 present uncertainty, from the fact that most of the shoots formerly available are now filled up (that of Maismore Square, which has been in use for the last two years, having been closed at Lady-day last). The debris has to be carted to more distant spots, and even these are fast failing as practicable means of disposal, and therefore ere long the Parishioners will have to bear the extra cost incident on this head of Vestry expenditure, which from the above named causes is yearly on the increase. A special Committee has this subject under their anxious consideration. Road Sweepings. disposal of PARLIAMENTARY DEPOSITATIONS. Session, 1882. The following reports upon Railways, Tramway, and other schemes were presented by your Surveyor, and was fully considered by the Vestry, with instruction to the Officers to see that all necessary clauses and conditions were introduced to protect the public rights. The Metropolitan Board of Works also have been communicated with to this purpose. 15 REPORT on Tramways, Railways, and New Lines of Roads, for the Session 1882. Tramway. PECKHAM, EAST DULWICH, and CRYSTAL PALACE TRAMWAYS. Joseph Quick & Son, Engineers, Great George Street, Westminster. Quick & Bidder, Solicitors, George Street, Mansion House. The above Tramway is intended to commence near the Lamp Pedestal in Peckham High Street, opposite to, and passing up Rye Lane to Peckham Rye, along Peckham Rye on the West Side up to the "King's Arms," P.H.—thence running in a Westerly direction along East Dulwich Road to Goose Green as far as Crystal Palace Road— thence in a Southerly direction along Crystal Palace Road to Lordship Lane—thence along Lordship Lane, (South easterly) to opposite the "Grove Tavern," known as "Bezu's Corner." 16 This proposed single line of Tramway will open up the means of Locomotion for a very extensive District, now almost wholly deprived of Public Vehicular Traffic. The locality of East Dulwich lying East of Lordship Lane is very largely built upon, and will no doubt be much extended if better means of access be afforded: also it would, no doubt, cause the present empty property in that locality to become tenanted. The Metropolitan Board of Works will of course in this as in similar cases (being the Road Authority), take care to introduce Protection Clauses, securing the full rights of the Board and also the Vestry. But it will also be necessary for the Vestry carefully to deal with this work locally, and I therefore beg to suggest a few points to which I think their attention should be directed:— First I would suggest that although this proposed Tramway will be very beneficial (as before admitted) it will (if allowed to run in the proposed direction) in no small manner interfere with the 17 present Traffic, and probably lead to inconvenience to the Shop Frontagers along its course, especially in Rye Lane. At its proposed commencement in the Peckham High Street, it is intended to form a Loop, opposite the "Kentish Drovers" P.H.—this Loop, where the constant shifting of the Horses to and from the Cars will take place, must necessarily lead to great inconvenience, and in my opinion will very largely stultify the advantages being provided by the Metropolitan Improvements now in hand in that locality—the necessity of this Loop arises from the fact of this Scheme being promoted by an independent Company, from that which now works the existing lines of Tramway. I venture to suggest that an amalgamation of interests, or at least an arrangement for the continuous working of the new and old lines would get over this difficulty; if this cannot be accomplished, I think this part of the Scheme should be opposed. The next point requiring attention is the narrow condition of Rye Lane. Commencing from Peckham High Street, the widths of the Roadivay are as follows: — c 18 opposite ft. in. Hanover Chapel 21 6 Hanover Park 24 0 Baptist Chapel 30 6 South Grove 25 0 Railway Stations 27 6 Blenheim Grove 27 11 Bournemouth Road 26 3 Parkstone Road 25 8 Atwell Road 22 4 Coombe Lodge 18 8 Fenner, Mr. (Butcher) 25 4 Sternhall Lane 39 0 It will be obvious that after allowing 7 feet for the width of the Tramway, including 12 inches on each side thereof for the overhanging of the Cars, that at a very crucial point, viz:—Hanover Chapel, there would be left on each side a standing or passing space for the General and Residential Traffic of not more than 7 feet 3 inches; from this point up to about opposite Atwell Road and Choumert Road, there would be on each side of the Tramway about 9 feet, but south of this point in the narrowest part, where the Roadway at present is 19 only 18 feet 8 inches, and where the Vestry has been making persistent efforts to widen the Road and Footways to at least 45 feet, I apprehend that nothing less than the purchase by the Company of the property necessary to such widening could for a moment be accepted. The present congested state of the Traffic at this spot in my judgment renders this alteration and widening imperative. Another vital consideration in respect to so narrow a thoroughfare as Rye Lane is the Paving of the Roadway. In my opinion it will be impossible to accept terms short of an entire Paving of this Roadway with such material as may be determined on. No Macadamized Marginal Spaces at the sides of the Tramway should be permitted for very many reasons, and which need not be gone into in this Report. Paving Roadway. The positions of the various loops on this line of Tramway may also require adjustment when the matters of detail are under consideration. Loops It will be necessary for the Vestry to secure ample means of supervision as to the Materials and c 2 20 Workmanship in the construction of these Works, and also that all costs and charges incidental thereto be borne by the Company. These, with the general Clauses to be introduced by the Metropolitan Board of Works, as well as those contained in the general and special Acts relating to Tramways already passed, will be sufficient to protect the Vestry's interests on behalf of the Public. Protecting Clauses by Vestry and Metropolitan Board of Works. It will possibly be suggested that other routes (avoiding Rye Lane) might have been proposed, but there being no alternative lines before the Public, such suggestions cannot be entertained in this Report. Alternative Routes. LONDON SOUTHERN TRAMWAYS. Thos. Floyd, Engineer, 3, Victoria Mansions, Victoria Street, S. W. Sutton & Ommaney Solicitors, 3 4, Great Winchester Street, E.C. Tramway No. 2. This is a single line of Tramway it is proposed 21 to commence at or near the Cab Shelter and Cab Stand, on the West side of Denmark Hill, adjacent to Camberwell New Road, going Southward along Denmark Hill to Cold Harbour Lane (where it leaves this Parish), and then continues in the Parish of Lambeth along Cold Harbour Lane, crossing the Brixton Road, along Acre Lane and Clapham. Park Road, terminating in High Street, Clapham. This line of Tramway (as in that referred to at Rye Lane, Peckham) will have a Block termination, very near to the junction of several Public Roads, viz.:—those of Denmark Hill, Church Street, the High Road on the West side of Ca?nberwell Green, and the Camberwell New Road. All these are roads of very considerable traffic, and the fact of Two sets of Cars, working under different Companies meeting at this spot, one of them making it a permanent terminus, will in my opinion seriously interfere with the Public traffic, and also the convenience of the Frontagers having Shops on the West side of Denmark Hill. For this reason, as in the previous case urged, I think any Tramway at this spot should be made continuous, and to connect with the existing Tramways at this place. 22 The inconvenience of a Tram Car Terminus such as above adverted to, is already apparent at times at the Blocked end of the Camberwell New Road Car traffic. With the usual Clauses being introduced, I think this line might be permitted, subject to the objection above raised. SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY. W. R. Stevens Solicitor, 6, St. Thomas Street. This is a Railway proposed to commence by a Junction with the Charing Cross Railway, at or near Gravel Lane, Southwark, and terminating by a Junction with the Bricklayer's Arms Branch Railway, near to St. James' Road, in the Parish of Bermondsey. This Railway will cross the Upper Grange Road at or near the Parish Boundary of Bermondsey and Camberwell at the West end of the Earl Road, by a Bridge proposed to be 110 feet Span, Height 16 feet, Level unaltered. Detail Plans and Sections of this Bridge and also of the Bridge to cross the Old Kent Road, North-west of the "Dun Cow" P.H. (although Road Level &c. 23 not within this Parish, but near to the Boundary) should be submitted, before sanction is given to this Work, such details, however, will no doubt be required of the Company by the Metropolitan Board of Works. PECKHAM, LEWISHAM, AND CATFORD BRIDGE ROADS. H. A. Graham, Solicitor, 27, Chancery Lane, W.C. T. Heygate Vernon, Surveyor, 21, Abingdon Street, Westminster This is a repetition of a Scheme for a New Road to pass through a portion of the Newlands Estate adjacent to the South East Boundary of Peckham Rye, and to be continued to Brockley, &c. A somewhat similar Scheme has been for several years deposited with the Vestry, but has not been proceeded with. 24 Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) PECKHAM RYE, GOOSE GREEN, NUNHEAD GREEN, and LAND near PECKHAM RYE. Reginald Ward, Solicitor. This is a depositation for the purpose of obtaining the Sanction of Parliament, vesting the above open spaces in the Metropolitan Board of Works, in order to secure the preservation thereof as Open Spaces for Public use. J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor. Vestry Hall, Camberwell, December 12th, 1881. 25 STREET NOMENCLATURE.

The Metropolitan Board of Works has consulted the Vestry upon 6 applications for sanction to the formation of 24 New Streets within this Parish. Each application having been examined into and reported upon by the Surveyor, the Vestry recommended 4, and disapproved 2. The Metropolitan Board of Works subsequently notified its approval of 3 applications, for 13 Roads. LINES OF FRONTAGE, PROJECTIONS, See. The Metropolitan Board of Works also submitted for the opinion of the Vestry 53 applications for Lines of Frontage, Projections, &c. Each case was examined and reported upon by the Surveyor; the Vestry recommended 33, and disapproved 20 of 28 these cases. The Metropolitan Board of Works subsequently notified its approval of 33, and disapproval of 20 cases. In all approved cases, upon the works being carried out, supervision has been given thereto by the Vestry Officers. RETURN OF WORKS EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY TO THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. The Metropolitan Board of Works, in anticipation of the question of Metropolitan local Government coming under the consideration of Parliament, asked for information of Works carried out by the Vestry since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to enable Parliament to judge of the efficiency with which the various local authorities have carried out their powers. This Return was compiled by your Surveyor, submitted to the Vestry, and forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works. A copy thereof is appended. 29 RETURN OF WORKS EXECUTED IN THIS PARISH, AND THE COST THEREOF, FROM 1856 to 1881, INCLUSIVE.

In connection with the before-mentioned Sewers Works, 126 new Gullies have been constructed for Road Drainage. 74 HOUSE DRAINAGE. Applications for Drainage into the Sewers of 1,295 Houses have been made, and the works, when carried out, have received the necessary supervision. DUST REMOVAL. This is still being carried out with the Plant, &c., belonging to the Vestry, under the special supervision of the Sub-Committee appointed for the purpose. The horses and carts specially employed for this work number 17, but these at times of pressure have been found insufficient to deal with the quantity of dust which accumulates in the Parish from time to time; for notwithstanding the system of house to house collection at stated days in each week, it is found that accumulations will, and do frequently occur, through the indisposition of householders to submit to a regular weekly removal. To overcome this, assistance has been obtained from the Slopping and Watering Department, the horses, &c., from which have been engaged when practicable, to supplement the dust removal. 75 The quantity of dust removed during the past year was 18,219 loads. Last Year 16,165 loads. Some portion of this collection of dust has been sold, realizing the sum of £495 5s. 9d. The remainder has been either barged or carted away at the least possible cost. Some portion has also been sifted and used for road and various other matters connected with the Vestry work. The expenditure of this department under all heads has been £3,241 19 2 Less sale of Dust, 495 9 9 £2,746 9 5 Which shows the cost of collection and disposal to be about 3s. per load. This result continues to compare most favourably as against the old system of collection through Contractors. For instance, at the last Contract letting the price was at the rate of 5s. 6d. per load. By the present system it is 3s.; the difference being 2s. 6d. per load, or, for the quantity collected, a saving in expenditure of nearly £2,300. 76 GULLY CLEANSING. This has received due attention. The number of Gullies cleansed has been 3,966 and the quantity of soil removed 2,194 loads. SEWERS. All the Sewers under the charge of the Vestry have been examined and cleansed from time to time as required, and the deposit of soil therefrom removed. The quantity of soil thus removed by carting has been 203 loads. This small quantity of soil removed proves the successful working of the system of Sewers, both public and private, as laid in this Parish, in length over 100 miles. PUBLIC URINALS. These have been regularly cleansed and repaired. Water is supplied for flushing purposes by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company at a 77 charge of £6 per annum, each. The urinals under the charge of the Vestry are in the following positions:— 1 Camberwell road. 2 Wyndham road. 3 Addington square. 4 Old Kent road. 5 Wells street. 6 Southampton street. 7 Sumner road. 8 Peckham High street. 9 Peckham rye. The Reports of your Medical Officer and Public Analyst are appended, shewing the various sanitary measures carried out in their departments. 79 1881-82. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Gentlemen, The Registrar General's annual summary for the year 1881 contains the following information:— Table I. Population of London and of its five groups of districts, as enumerated at the census of 1881, and the death-rates thereof:— London. West. North Central. East. South. Population 3,816,483 669,633 905,947 282,238 692,738 1,265,927 Deaths per 1000 21.2 19.5 20.6 23.0 24.2 20.4 I quote these figures, partly because they show at a glance the amazing populousness of the 80 polis, and how large a proportion the population of South London bears to the whole; but mainly because the death-rates for the year (here shown) are amongst the lowest Metropolitan death-rates on record, while that of South London is with one exception the most favourable of the series. Only once since civil registration began has the Metropolitan death-rate been lower than in 1881, namely in 1850, when it was 21.0. But the death-rate of 20.4 is the lowest that has ever been recorded for South London. HEALTH OP CAMBERWELL. From these prefatory remarks I proceed to discuss the statistical returns of our own parish. Some of the facts with respect to Camberwell ascertained by the census of 1881 were published sufficiently early to enable me to make use of them for the purposes of my last annual report. I now place them before you in more detail; and for the purposes of comparison have combined them in a table with like series of facts obtained at the previous Censuses. Table II. shows the houses and the population of the four sub-districts of Camber- 81 well, and of the entire Parish, as they were severally enumerated at the Censuses of 1851, 1861, 1871, and 1881. It shows with what rapid strides the houses and the population have increased in number during the thirty years to which the table relates; that within this time the population has more than trebled itself, and that the houses have increased in almost equal proportion; and that this marvellous growth (taking the whole period into consideration) has been shared in pretty equally by all the districts of the Parish. The rate of increase, however, has been far from uniform for the whole Parish between the different Censuses; and as regards the districts, such variations have been very considerable. TABLE II.

It will be seen that during these ten years the sub-district of Camberwell has been increasing much more rapidly than any other part of the Parish; that after this comes Peckham, then St. George's, and lastly Dulwich, whose rate of growth has been only half that of Camberwell. The whole Parish has increased at as nearly as possible the same rate as Peckham. In the 52 weeks ending Saturday, December 31st, 1881, 6,760 births, and 3,478 deaths were registered in the Parish (see Table III); the births being 113 above, the deaths 54 below those registed in 1880. Of these totals, 109 births and 47 deaths occured in Dulwich; 2,092 births, and 1,278 deaths in Camberwell; 2,595 births and 1,236 deaths in Peckham; and 1,964 births and 917 deaths in St. George's. Table IV. exhibits the relations of these numbers to those of the previous year:— Table III.—CAMBERWELL.—Return of Births and Deaths for the Fifty-Two Weeks ending Saturday, December 31st, 1881.

To determine, however, more accurately what the figures relating to deaths mean, it is necessary to consider them in connection with those representing the numbers of the populations among which the deaths occurred. The Census was taken on the 4th April, 1881, but the population has been gradually increasing since that time; and in the middle of the year (that is, three months later), the populations of the several sub districts and of the whole Parish (had they augmented severally at the same rates as those by which they had augmented between 1871 and 1881) would have been as nearly as possible as follows: g 2 84 TABLE V.—Population of Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. Total. 5,636 60,076 72,042 51,336 189,090 These figures represent the mean population of Camberwell, and of its several sub-divisions for the year 1881, and are those, therefore, with which the deaths must be compared in order to determine the death-rates. But before we can make this comparison (as far at least as concerns the sub-divisions of the Parish) we must make a correction in respect of the distribution of the deaths. The sub-district of Camberwell contains the Workhouse and two Lunatic Asylums, the deaths in which Institutions amounted in 1881 to no less than 371. But these deaths, though occurring in the Camberwell sub-district, belong not specially to that sub-district, but pretty nearly equally to all parts of the Parish. In order, therefore, to put this sub-district on equal terms with the other sub-districts, it is necessary to deduct these deaths from the returns of the Camberwell sub-district, and to distribute them in fair proportion among all of them. This I have done (as shown in Table VI.) by dividing the 371 deaths among the 85 several sub-districts in proportion to the deaths (independent of these) occurring in them severally. TABLE VI.

Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. Parish. 9.40 16.89 19.21 19.98 18.39 It will be observed that these death-rates are singularly low; and that if we regard the death-rates as a measure of healthiness, the Parish has been 86 singularly healthy during the year which has just elapsed; and further that, as usual, Dulwich is the most healthy district, and Camberwell the next, while Peckham and St. George's, which are the least healthy, have as nearly as possible the same mortuary rate. With one exception, there is not much to call for special comment in the mortuary returns for the year, either as regards the ages at which deaths occurred, the seasonal distribution of deaths, or the mortality of particular diseases. An examination of Table III. will show, the numbers of deaths at different ages; the numbers of deaths from various important specified diseases; the relative prevalence of different diseases at different times of the year; and the number of deaths due to each of these diseases in the several districts of the Parish. Further, Table VIII. shows the number of deaths due to the several zymotic diseases year by year from 1856 onwards; and Table IX. shows the mortality from the same diseases quarter by quarter for the last six years. In contrasting the mortality of successive years (as shown in these Tables) it must be recollected 87 that the population among which the deaths have occurred has been increasing rapidly year by year ; and that hence even had the health of the Parish (so far as the prevalence of zymotic diseases is concerned) remained stationary, the deaths from the several diseases comprised in the Tables must have shown an annual increase. An examination of the details of the several Tables will show that, with the exception of smallpox, the different zymotic diseases have not been specially prevalant or fatal, and that small-pox (though its incidence has been specially heavy) has still not been so largely fatal as to have any appreciable effect on the death-rate; and will confirm the opinion, already derived from the smallness of the death-rates, that the general health of the Parish has been, on the whole, exceptionally good. 88 TABLE VIII.

There was one important exception to the generally satisfactory condition of the Parish, as shewn in the Mortuary tables, namely, the continued prevalence of small pox in it, and mainly in that part which adjoins the Deptford Fever Hospital— a prevalence altogether out of proportion to that presented either by London as a whole, or by any other Metropolitan Parish. This undue prevalence, which has been manifested for several years past, and seemed to have a direct connection with the establishment of a large Small Pox Hospital on the borders of the Parish, has necessarily been a source of great anxiety to the Vestry, and an occasion of much alarm to the inhabitants of the Old Kent Road, and of its neighbourhood. There was all the more reason for dissatisfaction, that, previous to the small pox epidemic of 1871 (which affected all London, and from which Camberwell, although it suffered largely, suffered in no greater proportion than the rest of the Metropolis, and during which no special incidence of the disease was manifested in the Eastern part of the 91 Parish, or in No. 4 Ward), Camberwell, as long as statistics of deaths had been systematically taken, had suffered less from small pox than probably any other Metropolitan Parish. And indeed some twenty years ago, when Drs. Seaton and Buchanan made inquiries on behalf of Government into the question of vaccination and the prevalence of small pox, Camberwell was shewn by them to have been for years more free from small pox than any other part of London. Some two or three years ago the attention of the Sewers and Sanitary Committee was attracted by the apparently excessive prevalence of small pox in the part of the Parish adjoining the Deptford Hospital (which had then for some months been used for the reception of small pox cases), and I was directed to write a letter to the Managers of the Asylums' Board, placing before them such facts as I had in support of our opinion, and requesting them to institute some enquiry into the matter. I received an argumentative reply, which professed to demolish the charge conveyed in my letter; and as about that time the epidemic in great measure subsided, the matter, so far as we were concerned, was allowed to rest there. 92 In the early part of 1881, however, a recrudescence of the small pox took place, not only generally throughout London, but again with apparently disproportionate severity in our own Parish, and mainly in No. 4 Ward. Again the Sanitary Committee, and later the Vestry itself, became very anxious about the matter; and again, not unnaturally, the denizens of No. 4 Ward got seriously alarmed, held public meetings on the subject, and appealed to the Vestry to assist them in suppressing the nuisance created, as they believed, by the Deptford Hospital. Consequently, early in July, a deputation of the Vestry waited, by appointment, on the President of the Local Government Board, placed before him a series of maps which I had prepared with the assistance of Mr. Fisher, showing month by month for a period of three or four years the distribution of small pox in the Parish of Camberwell; adduced other facts and arguments to shew that there was strong prima facie evidence that the Deptford Hospital acted as a centre of contagion to us; and requested that a Government inquiry might be made, similar to that which had just been concluded in reference to the influence 93 of the Hospital at Fulham on the health of the surrounding neighbourhood—an enquiry which should embrace not only the incidence of small pox in Camberwell, but that also in Deptford and Greenwich, and its relation to the Hospital which is surrounded on all sides by these districts. It is needless to say that we were listened to very courteously and patiently. And it is important to point out that not long afterwards a Royal Commission was appointed to enquire into the whole subject of Small Pox Hospitals in the Metropolis, to report and to advise. This Commission which has been now some months at work has not yet concluded its labours. Pending their report, I do not deem it advisable to express any opinions of my own as to what steps, if any, should be taken to minimise the danger due to the accumulation of small pox patients in large hospitals, or to deal with greater success than we are now doing with the preventive treatment of the disease; for it seems probable that any opinions I may have formed will be largely modified by the important information which will surely have been elicited by their enquiries. 94 I shall satisfy myself therefore with placing before you in a collective form the various facts with respect to the prevalence of small pox in Camberwell and its several districts, which I have from time to time brought under your notice, and with which also I have furnished the Royal Commission. These facts prove, as I think, conclusively that, whatever good the Deptford Hospital has done us by receiving in large proportion our small pox cases, it has unfortunately done us more harm than good, by causing continued outbreaks of small pox in its immediate neighbourhood at times when small pox had almost died out elsewhere, and by aggravating the local incidence of the disease in a remarkable degree during times in which the disease has been prevailing epidemically in London. Since the opening of the Hospital for the reception of small pox cases, small pox has never ceased to prevail in a greater or less degree in No. 4 Ward, and at times its prevalence has been almost appalling—notably in the spring of 1879, and in the early part, and again at the end, of 1881. 95 The injurious influence of the Hospital is however shewn perhaps most remarkably during times at which the disease has been little prevalent in London, and in which its prevalence even in No. 4 Ward has not been sufficient to excite attention. For a careful examination of the tables will show that it is specially at such times that the proportion of cases in No. 4 Ward to those in other parts of the Parish has been greatest. The remarks which I now append, and the tables which accompany them, are mainly a reproduction of a memorandum which I prepared and laid before the Vestry early in the present year, and which also I furnished to the Royal Commission. I have excluded however from it a few statistics which I have given at greater length in an earlier part of this report; and I have added to it a table which I laid before the Vestry on another occasion, showing the number of cases of small pox which had come under our cognizance from the year 1876, onwards; and further 1 have continued all these tables to the end of March, 1882, in order to shew the subsequent course of an outbreak of small pox, which began late in 1881, and at the end of the year threatened to become severe beyond all precedent. 96 Table X shows the monthly and annual mortality from small pox for the years 187G, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880, 1881, and the first three months of 1882, for the Parish of Camberwell; for the Sub-districts of Camberwell, St. George's, and Peckham; and also for No. 4 Ward, which forms only a part of Peckham. Only one death from small pox occurred in Dulwich. The deaths include, not only those actually occurring in the Parish, but those also due to the Parish, but occurring in the Asylum Hospitals. The latter (with one or two exceptions) have all been referred to the districts whence the patients were removed, during life to Hospital. Table XI shows the rate of small pox mortality per 100,000 living persons for the same periods, and for the same areæ, as those referred to in Table X. For the purposes of this Table, I have calculated the populations of the Parish and of its several Sub-divisions for each of the years given in the Table. The following is the method I have adopted:— I have taken the populations of Camberwell 97 and of its Sub-districts, as enumerated at the Census of 1881, as the populations for the year 1881 (Table II). For the previous years I have in every case ascertained the actual increase of population which took place between 1871 and 1881, and have added to the population of 1871 a tenth part of this total increase for each year which has elapsed since 1871 (Table XIII). The method is open to objection, and no doubt does not give quite accurate results, but I know that the results are at least as accurate as any that could be obtained by other available methods.

I have also ascertained the proportion of inmates to houses in Peckham and in St. George's. And mainly from these data I have come to the conclusion that the population of No. 4 Ward in 1881 was about 37,000, or as nearly as possible one-fifth of the total population of the Parish. In estimating the population of the Ward for the several years previous to 1881, I have assumed that its rate of increase has been equal to that of St. George's, which it resembles in many important respects, and not to that of Peckham, as a whole, whose increase, though collectively much greater than that of St. George's, has taken place chiefly in the neighbourhood of Nunhead, and not in No. 4 Ward (Table XIII). It will be seen that 1 have taken pains not to under-estimate the population of No. 4 Ward, and thus not to exaggerate its mortuary rate.

The first column includes all the cases which were returned for the Parish, and the second column all those which occurred in No. 4 Ward. The third column shows the percentage of cases furnished by No. 4 Ward. The Tables X, XI and XII show that during nearly the whole of the six years to which they relate there has been a disproportionately large prevalence of small pox in Peckham District, and mainly in that part of it known as No. 4 Ward; and especially they show that there has been an increasing prevalence therein during the last three years, and that lately, when the disease appeared to be dying out in London and in other parts of Camberwell, there was a sudden and alarming increase of it in this locality. It will be observed, however, that there was an undue prevalence of small pox in No. 4 Ward, just before the Deptford Hospital was opened. Deptford Hospital was opened for the reception of small pox patients on the 17th March, 1877, and was closed on the 31st August of the same year. It was re-opened for small pox cases on the 11th April, 1878, and has continued to receive them down to the present time. H 2 100 If the mortality from small pox in London during the year 1881 had been as large in relation to population as that in No. 4 Ward, the deaths from small pox would have been 9,348, instead of only 2,376 ; and under the same conditions, those in the Parish of Camberwell would have been 458 instead of only 190. No. 4 Ward forms an irregular square, bounded roughly on the North by the Grand Surrey Canal, on the West by the Peckham branch of the Canal, on the South by the Peckham High Road, and on the East by the Eastern Boundary of the Parish; its area is, I should think, about four-fifths square mile, or about 500 acres; it contained 4,892 houses, or thereabouts, in 1881; and I estimate its population in that year at about one-fifth of that of the Parish, or 37,311. The Deptford Hospital abuts on the centre of its Eastern Boundary. INCIDENTS OF THE SMALL POX EPIDEMIC. Much of the information with respect to the general diffusion of vaccination and its efficacy in preventing or modifying small pox, collected by 101 Inspectors of Nuisances, though of much immediate value to us in determining our proceedings in respect of individual cases or groups of cases, is necessarily not sufficiently accurate to make it worth while to tabulate it. Certain facts however occasionally come to our knowledge which it seems desirable to record. The following are a few of such facts which have been noted by us during the year embraced in my report. A well known anti-vaccinator in the parish, who with his wife had been vaccinated in early childhood, had refused to have any of his family vaccinated. Two of his daughters contracted the disease early in 1881, and were removed to Hospital. One died there. After the occurrence of the second case he wisely re-considered his position, had his remaining children (three or four in number) at once vaccinated, and was also himself revaccinated. No other cases of small pox occurred in his house. Early in the year a young man who had never been vaccinated took small pox and was removed to the Hospital where he died. The undertaker's man, who was concerned in removing him, caught 102 small pox apparently from him and died. A husband and wife who had been in attendance on him and living in the house, after his conveyancc to Hospital removed to No. 1, Canterbury Road, and gave small pox to six children living in the house of whom four were unvaccinated. A child of three years old died of small pox at Meeting House lane, it had been vaccinated in early infancy and had had an attack of small pox when it was a year old. A youth died of small pox who had been three times unsuccessfully vaccinated. At Draycott place a child died that had been three times unsuccessfully vaccinated. All the other children had been successfully vaccinated and of these none took the disease. A young man of 18 had small pox, who had had a previous attack when three years old. At Nunhead a family of four unvaccinated children all took small pox and all died of it. At Kimpton Road four members of a household had small pox; first, three children who had 103 been vaccinated and who had the disease so mildly that it was mistaken for chicken pox. The father unfortunately took it from them and died of it. At Bird-in-Bush Road, a man, wife and five children were living. All five children took small pox. Three of these were unvaccinated; they had it very severely and two of them died. The other two had been vaccinated; and though they had small pox it was in a very mild form, and left no marks. The above cases illustrate different points in respect to small pox; they imply how commonly we meet with unvaccinated persons; that unvaccinated persons are not only much more liable to to the disease than those who are vaccinated, but are liable to take it in a specially severe form; that unsuccessful vaccination however often repeated is no protection against small pox; that mild cases of small pox are occasionally mistaken for other less serious diseases, to the danger of the public; that previous attacks of small pox are not more protective against small pox than vaccination; and that re-vaccination when suffi 104 ciently early performed prevents the spread of small pox. WORK DONE BY INSPECTORS. The work done by the Inspectors of Nuisances during the twelve months ending March 25th 1882, has been large in amount and I may add has been done exceedingly well and to my satisfaction. During this period 14,279 houses have been inspected, and 7,284 re-inspections have been made. These have led to to the serving of 5,376 first, and 1G7 second notices, and to only 45 summonses. At the end of the year 205 notices remained un-complied with. The details of the sanitary works are given in tables XIV and XV. There are a few items however to which I may specially call your attention. During the year 890 cases of small pox, 499 of scarlet fever, 46 of Diphtheria, and 41 of fever, were brought under our notice and were visited and looked after by your inspectors. And, in connection with these, 1,047 houses were disinfected and 1,002 lots of 105 bedding and clothing were disinfected or destroyed by the officers of the Vestry. The number of separate articles thus treated are given in table XV. This table also shows the number and character of the articles destroyed, and the amount paid by the Vestry in compensation. In addition to the cases* of infectious diseases removed to the Asylum Hospitals by the Guardians, four cases of small pox were sent to Highgate at the expense of the Vestry; four cases of small pox were removed to the same Hospital, and one to Deptford, at their own expense; and two cases of fever were sent to Liverpool Street Hospital at their own expense. The list of summonses given in the table includes the following:— Thirteen cases for not disinfecting houses after infectious diseases. A lady living in Edith Road for exposing her servant while suffering from small pox. In this case, the servant being unwell was sent by her mistress to a medical man living in the neighbour- *533 cases of Small-pox, and 96 of other Fevers were sent to Hospital by the Guardians in the course of the year. 106 hood, who recognized the case as one of small pox, and told her to return to her mistress. Her mistress however refused to receive her; and, giving her her dirty linen to take with her, sent her (accompanied by her own daughter) to her mother's home in Sultan Street. She had to travel by tramcar the whole of the way. There was some doubt when the case was finally disposed of before the magistrate as to whether the mistress who had been summoned, or the daughter, was answerable, and under the circumstances a fine of only 2s 6d. with costs was imposed. A lady living in Montpelier Road, for exposing her servant while suffering from small pox. The case was almost exactly identical with the last. The servant being ill was sent by her mistress to a chemist, who told her she had small pox. On returning home her mistress refused to admit her, and told her to go to a medical man. She did so and was again informed she had small pox. On her return home she was a second time refused admission, and told to go to a friend of hers who lived in Alexander Street. This she did (her mother living at Hazeldean, Sussex,) and 107 remained in the house, (which contained man, wife, and six children,) until arrangements had been completed for sending her to the Hospital. Her mistress was fined £5 and costs. A butcher, of 70, Queen's Road, was summoned for slaughtering cattle on unlicensed premises and was fined £3 and costs.

Precautionary Measures. 1.—All areas, basements, cellars, kitchens, and yards should be kept dry and clean, and if necessary, well Time-whited. 2.—All water-closets, sinks, and drains should be kept scrupulously clean, be regularly flushed with water, and have their traps in good order; they should also, if at all offensive, be kept flushed with solution of Sulphate of Iron or Carbolic Acid. 3.—All dust bins should be emptied at least once a week,and no unnecessary or undue accumulations of offensive matters should be permitted anywhere. Such accumulation should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of Chloride of Lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. 5.—All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should be kept clean and well ventilated. 6.—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. 1ll Measures to be taken when Fever of any kind is present. 1.—Every person suffering from Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—The patient should be at once separated, as efficiently as circumstances will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and if possible, should be placed in a top room. A sheet kept wet with a solution made by thoroughly mixing a quarter of a pint of Carbolic Acid, No. 4, with a gallon of water, should be hung up outside the door. 3.—All bed-curtains and other hangings, and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards, should be removed from the room. 4.—The patient's room should be well ventilated, but not needlessly draughty; windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free. A fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. 6.—A basin, containing Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or some of a solution made by dissolving a pound of Green Copperas in a gallon of water, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 1 12 8.—A pail, also containing solution of Chloride of Lime, or of Condy's Fluid, or of Carbolic Acid, should stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with Carbolic Acid Soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's Fluid ; her dress should be of cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should, before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or Carbolic Acid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disinfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn from a quarter to half a pound of brimstone in an iron dish, supported over a pail of water in the middle of the room, the door, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. The room should remain closed for twenty-four hours. CAUTIONS. 1.—If any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver thereof that he is so suffering, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 113 2. —Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering, who so exposes the sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 3.— Any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has conveyed any such sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 4.—Any person who, without previous disinfection, gives, lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things that have been exposed to infection from such disorder, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 5.—If any person knowingly lets any house, room, or part of a house in which a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, to any other person, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfaction of a qualified Medical Practitioner, as testified by a certificate given by him, such person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. 6—When any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, any Justice may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified Medical Practitioner, order the body to be removed to a mortuary at the cost of the Nuisance authority. I 114 NOTICES. 1— If any Infections Fever appears in anyplace information should be at once given at the Vestry Hall to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 2 —Complaints as to Nuisances should be made personally or by letter to the Inspectors of Nuisances, and as to Non-removal of Dust, to the Dust Superintendent at the Vestry Hall. 3.—Disinfectants may be had gratis on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 4—A Disinfecting Apparatus has been provided by the Vestry at the Parish Stone Yard, Peckham Park Road, at which bedding and articles of apparel may be disinfected gratis, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 5.—A Mortuary has been provided at Forest Hill Cemetery, whither dead bodies maybe at once removed, and where they may remain until the time of burial, on application to he Inspectors of Nuisances. 6.—An Ambulance, provided by the Board of Guardians, is kept at the Workhouse, and may be had on application to the Relieving Officer, or, in his absence, to the Master at the Workhouse. Dated 9th day of December, 1876. J. s. BRISTOWE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health 115 1881-82. ANALYST'S REPORTS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital, S.E., June 25th, 1881. To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, During the past quarter I have analysed fiftyarticles of more or less importance, the certificates of all of which are in the hands of your Inspectors. Milk is naturally of first importance, and twenty-nine samples have been analysed, eight in duplicate. Besides minor adulterations, we have had six milks with from 7 to 12 per cent, of added water. One was skimmed, but insufficiently to risk a prosecution; yet another was a top-skim, I 2 116 with 47 per cent, of cream, and nearly 9 per cent, of butter, and mixed with 5 per cent, of added water. / Of Butters I have analysed four, two in duplicate. Two of these were spurious butters. No. 28 had a melting point of 40°; No. 31 of 31.5°: the former was mainly of animal, the latter of vegetable origin. Both contained more water than is usual, had been worked up with buttermilk, and were very carefully prepared. Two Coffees, one of which was genuine, and one adulterated with at least one-third of chicory, leave much to be desired. The admixture with chicory, even when asked for, is a mistake, as it enables very inferior coffee to be used. When it is further remembered how uncertain is the quantity and quality of chicory that is added, and how large is the addition at times, it is a case in which the advice to mix for yourself is to the point. A new kind of Coffee which I need not publicly name, is now bidding for public favor. It owes its pleasant flavour to genuine coffee, and it also contains some chicory, but the chief constituent, 117 as far as quantity is concerned, is a variety of caramel, obtained from the sugar so largely present in the fruit, and which is the result of roasting. In spite of the testimonials in its favour, I see but little to recommend it. Two Ales and one Porter are the only alcoholic drinks which have been analysed this Quarter. Both ales are sufficiently alcoholic, containing each about 10½ per cent, of proof-spirit. No. 25 is superior to No. 18, although it contains nearly three times as much salt. This depends either upon the water, or upon the quality of the sugar employed in the brew. The porter was somewhat sour, but was in other respects of fair quality. The alcoholic drinks are naturally accompanied in my report by a non-alcoholic beverage which is supposed to be in everyone's mouth. It is sufficient to characterize it without naming it. It is distinctly tonic, and tastes of iron sufficiently. It is very well aerated, and contains about twice its volume of carbonic acid. Phosphorous in an oxydized form is also present, and it certainly answers to its description. As an occasional tonic it is certainly useful, but whether it can maintain its ground as a beverage is quite another matter. 118 I have also examined four varieties of Pickles. One of these, a mixed pickle, contained a notable quantity of lead, amounting to 2^ths grain per lb. The lead was in the pickle, and almost absent from the vinegar. Even such a quantity as this would be of small matter to most eaters of pickle; not so, however, to those who eat them in large quantities. About Mustards, two samples of which have been examined, I have to repeat a former statement. Although both were perfectly genuine, and suitable as a condiment, it would be well to purchase the article from the chemist when the mustard is required for medicinal purposes. Lastly, I have to mention two Rhubarbs, both of which were genuine. Michaelmas, 1881. In the Quarter just passed, I have analysed fifty articles, eight of them in duplicate. 119 In Milks, I am glad to report a great improvement, in spite of the season. Only three out of thirty contained a considerable admixture of water, in quantities varying between 10 and 15 per cent., although there were several of more than doubtful character, involving the necessity for duplicate analysis. The Condensed Milk, No. 81, was of excellent character, and presented, as compared with former analysis, a uniformity of composition very much to be desired. Of two Coffees, one was adulterated with 50 per cent, of chicory, and the other, although genuine, was wrapped up in a paper announcing on the inside that it was sold as a mixture of coffee and chicory. Seven Butters were analysed. One sample consisted almost entirely of Butterine. The density of another sample was more than suspicious, but the quantity of insoluble fatty acids, on the standard at present adopted, was high enough to make it pass for butter. 120 Three Teas and two Peppers were all good of their kind. Three Mustards agreed in this, that they were quite unadulterated, but very weak in quality. Sufficiently strong as condiments, the only matter of concern as an article of consumption, but undependable for medicinal purposes. The Pickled Onions were contained in a vinegar entirely free from sulphuric acid, and only contained a mere trace of copper. Lastly, a sample of Siveets has been examined. It was labelled "London Mixture." The sample was somewhat dirty and broken; it consisted of jujubes, liqueur sweets, globular comfits, and apparently, sugar almonds. Every variety required, and received, careful examination. The "sugar almonds" were correct in shape, but contained no almonds. They are obviously made to deceive, but as they were not sold as sugared almonds, no official notice could be taken. The coloring matters, though brilliant, were quite innocuous, and the sugar employed was of good quality. There is no doubt that a wonderful improve- 121 ment has taken place in the character of sweetmeats for children, and although I have mentioned the imitation sugar almonds as a sham, they are only so far injurious that they are very hard and not well suited to little teeth. Christmas, 1881. During the Quarter just passed, I have examined thirty-two samples of Milk. Only three were adulterated with, respectively 9, 18, and 20 per cent, of water, and two with 4 per cent, of water. One was skimmed. But even this exhibits considerable improvement as compared with the days that are gone. On the 6th October, 1874, I received six milks. One was normal, but the other five contained, respectively, 10, 13, 22, 23 and 33 per cent, of added water. On the corresponding day this year, our Inspector, Mr. Mackay, brought me five genuine milks, and one a little skimmed. On the 9th December, 1874, of five milks, one was good, the others contained, 122 respectively, 8, 15, 15 and 33 per cent, of added water: on the 23rd, I received four milks, one of which was good, the others contained, respectively, 25, 25 and 34 per cent, of added water. When I use the word genuine, of course, I would not have you suppose that no water has been added to the genuine milks, but that they fully come up to the standard of the Public Analysts. And again, as to the skimming, I am thankful to say that the great majority of Camberwell milks contain butter beyond the standard. Of eight Butters, only one was a complete imitation of butter fat, the others were genuine. Four Coffees were genuine. Two Cacaos, sold as such, and not as mixtures, have been successfully prosecuted. With reference to them, the Magistrate considered "that they were not cacao, but 30 per cent, cacao, made up with arrowroot and sugar. Where could the line be drawn if a mixture was so to be termed ? a person might have a mixture consisting of only, perhaps, 2 per cent, of cacao, and the rest starch and sugar." This is also my contention, and I maintain that the 123 thinnest slice of bread and butter, taken with a cup of genuine cacao, would far more than compensate for the thickening with starch and the sweetening with sugar. Of a sample of Chocolate Powder nothing could be said, as it contained cacao, and there is no fixed composition recognized. One Mustard of very good quality, and four Spices of good composition complete the list. Lady-Day, 1882. During the past Quarter I have analysed thirtyone Milks. One of them was skimmed, and several were a little suspicious. Eleven were adulterated with, respectively, 16, 16, 11, 16, 24, 15, 9, 18, 18, 12, and 12 per cent, of water. Two of the milks were taken by Inspector Stevenson at a railway station, and were found to be adulterated with 18 per cent, of water in each case. The farmer brought me sample of the milk as obtained from the herd, and it was curious as containing 124 exactly the amount of solids (not fat) fixed by the Society of Public Analysts. The analyses of the two milks contrast well: Adulterated. Supposed genuine. Sp.gr.1,025 Sp.gr 1,033 Cream 7% Cream 11 % Total solids 9.75 12.23 Water 90.25 87.77 Fat 2.50 3 23 Solids not fat 7.25 9 00 100.00 100.00 Ash 0.61 0.81 Salt 0.08 0.14 The matter of interest to the public lies in this, that the milk supposed to be genuine would not bear the addition of one per cent of water without detection. Seven Butters have been analysed. Of these, five passed, one was somewhat adulterated, another was nearly one-half admixed with fat other than butter-fat. Seven Beers and Porters have also been examined. They are all sufficiently alcoholic, and average ten per cent, of proof-spirit. Those which 125 are very thin, and contain little extractive, are more quickly operative than others, and should be used moderately. The salt in all cases is well within the allowed quantity. Of a sample of Coffee, it need only be said that it was good. A Pepper was of fair quality. Of three Mustards, one was adulterated with flour, and colored with turmeric. The certificates are all in the hands of the Inspectors. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. The above Reports are submitted to the Vestry. (Signed) T. L.

We find that of the sum of £38 0s. 6d., alluded to in the last Report of the Auditors, as the balance of a defalcation, the sum of £30 has been received by the Vestry, leaving a balance of £8 0s. 6d. still due. N 2 180 We would desire to draw the attention of the Vestry to the recommendations made by the Auditors in past years (1877 and 1878) with respect to the advisability of adopting some better arrangement with regard to receipts and counterfoils in the Collectors' books, in cases where portions only of the Rates demanded have been paid. We consider that a better plan than that now in use might be adopted which would facilitate the labour of the Auditors, and be more generally satisfactory. And we would strongly urge this question upon the attention of the Vestry, with the view to their adopting some practical mode of giving effect to it. THOMAS TAYLOR, Colonel, Chairman. W. P.
