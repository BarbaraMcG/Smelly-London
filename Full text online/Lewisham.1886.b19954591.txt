The Boarrl submit herewith :— A statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1887, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1884-5, 1885-0, and 1886-7. A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1887. A statement of the contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1887. The Board also submit the Report of their Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1886, containing particulars of the population, rate of mortality, and other statistics relating to the general health of the District; and the Report of their Surveyor for the year ended Lady-day, 1887, in which will be found the particulars of the works carried out under his supervision. LOANS. During the year the Board paid the sum of £5,685 in reduction of the mortgages owing by them, and they raised during the year the sum of £3,200 for new permanent works and improvements in the District. The Loans which weie raised at £5 per cent, interest have now all been paid off the last instalments having been paid in January. THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. This Establishment— for the isolation of infectious diseases— has been maintained throughout the year in a thorough 6 state of efficiency, but few cases have occurred needing isolation. Ratepayers are invited to use this hospital for themselves, or for members of their households, the charge being only one guinea per week, covering medical attendance, board, lodging, and nursing. NEW STREETS AND SEWERS. The various works projected and carried out by the Board under this head will, as in previous years, be found specified in the Surveyor's Report. STREET NAMING, &c. During the year orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board of Works, altering Street names and numbers, and such orders have been duly carried out by this Board. The following Streets were re-named : — The Avenue, Lawric Park, re-named "Lawrie Park Avenue, S.E." Part of Brockley Lane, from Iligh Street, Lewisham, to the Cemetery, re-named "Ladywell Road, S.E." Penge Lane re-named "Newlands Park, S.E." Victoria Road, Lewisham Hill, re-named "Blackheath Rise, S.E.," and also re-numbered. The following Streets were re-numbered:— Acacia Road and Elderton Road, Lower Sydenham. Ellerdale Street and Slaithwaite Road, Lewisham. Hanover Street and Wells Road, Sydenham. London Road, Park Road, and Tyson Road, Forest Hill. Laurel Grove, St. Hugh's Road, Lullington Road, Maple Road, Tudor Road, and Waldegrave Road, Penge. SANITARY. The Sanitary condition of the district continues highly satisfactory. It will be seen from the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, appended hereto, that the annual rate of mortality in the District for the year was 13.36 per 1000, 7 whilst the annual rate of the whole of London for the like periodwas 199 per 1000, and of Districts outside London 16.5. Thus, notwithstanding the great increase in the District, little alteration has taken place in the death rate; last year it was 13.75. The number of inhabited houses and the population of the District continue to increase, as shewn by the Table in the Medical Officer's Report The number in each case, at Midsummer, 1886, being— Inhabited houses— Lewisham 10,453 „ Penge 3,160 13,613 Estimated population— Lewisham 64,286 „ Penge 21,014 85,300 The Return (Table VI.), shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. The Slaughter-houses, Cowhouses, and Fishmongers' premises, have been periodically inspected by the Board's Sanitary Officers. In addition to these inspections, special house-to-house inspections have been made under the Regulations adopted by the Board as to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, and many sanitary improvements have been effected in the houses which are not specified in the Return referred to. On page 11 the Board refer to these regulations. Under this head the Beard have, in their previous Reports, mentioned the subject of the collection and removal of Dust and House Refuse, to which considerable time and attention is devoted by the Board's Committees and their Officers, as being a matter of great importance to the health of the District. 8 The cost of this work was in the year 1886-7 nearly £2,500, and as the price obtained by the Board for the refuse is declining this cost must grow, but every effort is made, without unduly increasing the expenditure, to keep the district as clear from dust as possible. The Board, therefore, again urgently request all householders to see that the men are not refused the dust on calling, and that any vegetable, animal, or other matter, which may be burnt or otherwise destroyed, is not placed in the ashpits. They would also call attention to the necessity of having the ashbins periodically cleansed and limewashed, or limewhited. It frequently happens that this most needful work is absolutely overlooked and neglected, even when houses are otherwise completely renovated. Any complaints of the non-clearance of ashpits may be made by letter to the Board, at their Offices, when attention will be given to the same; but it is apparent that the Board cannot collect the dust more frequently than at present without incurring a much heavier outlay. BAKEHOUSES. These premises are periodically inspected by the Board's Officers, pursuant to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1883, under which authority for such inspection is given. RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District at the end of the year 1886, as given by the Metropolitan Board of Works in their apportionment of the sums required to be raised by that Board in the several Parishes and Districts in the Metropolis, for the year ending 31st December, 1887, was— Lewisham £413,502 Penge 162,570 Total £606,072 9 This was a slight reduction in the value as given in the Lists which came into force in April, 1886, on the quinquennial Valuation, when the figures were— Lewisham £443,502 Renge 165,375 £608,877 LOCAL EXPENDITURE. As this Board has to collect and pay over to the different Metropolitan Boards very considerable sums in the course of the year, it is usual in the Board's Report to cull attention to the actual amount required by the Board during the year under review for its own purposes. The sum required in the past year from the Local Guardians of the Poor of the Parish of Lewishum, was only £34,352, being equivalent to a rate, on the Rateable Value in force at the commencement of the year, of a triflo over Is. 6¼d. in the pound. The amount so required from the Overseers of the Hamlet of Penge was £9,516, being equivalent to a rate of a fraction under Is. 2d. in the pound. The amounts raised by the Board for Metropolitan bodies, and paid over to them, were:— For the Metropolitan Board, £17,660; for the School Board, £22,684. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. Proceedings have been taken under these Acts, and during the year now closed 87 samples of food were analysed —82 proved to be genuine, 5 were adulterated. In these cases summonses were applied tor and issued, and on the hearing of the cases at the Police-courts penalties were inflicted by the Magistrates. The constant exercise of the provision of these Acts in the District has doubtless had a most beneficial effect. Ratepayers are invited to avail themselves of the Acts, for which purpose full particulars of the facilities offered by the Board were given by public notice, as set out in 10 vious Reports; and for convcnienco the Board again repeat such, notice:— The Notice referred to. "The attention of the Board having been called to the desirability of giving greater facilities than at present exist to the general public in aid of the working of 'The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts,' they have now made arrangements with the Public Analyst of the District, Mr. C. Heisch, of 79, Mark Lane, E.C., whereby samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left with the Secretary of the Board during office hours, at their Offices, and no further trouble in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of such sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis, the balance of the analyst's fee of 10s. Gd. will be paid by the Board. "Care should be taken that the samples brought for analysis are in the same condition as when bought. The name and address of the seller must be supplied, and the buyer must sign the proper form, which will be prepared at the Board's Offices. All samples received for analysis are accepted in strict confidencc, and the result will be communicated to the buyer direct by post. "The only expense to the buyer is the payment of the beforementioned fee of 2s. Gd. "If residents within the District have reasonable grounds for suspecting any seller of adulterating, they may write to the Board, giving the name and address of the seller and the article suspected and enclosing a double fee of 5s., when the Board will direct their Inspectors of Nuisances to take the necessary steps for obtaining an analysis without further reference or expense to the resident; and if the article is found to be adulterated further steps will be taken by the Board. Such communications will also be received in stirict confidence. No notice can be taken of anonymous communications, although the fee may be enclosed." deputations. Duiing the year the Board have appointed Members 11 to attend several deputations and conferences called for the discussion of different questions affecting the general wellbeing of the Metropolis, particularly with reference to the question of communications across the Thames East of London Bridge. HOUSES LET IX LODGINGS AND OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. The Regulations adopted by the Board under the provisions of the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 18G6, are printed in a separate form, and can be obtained at the Board's Offices. The same apply to all houses let in lodgings, with the following exceptions: — (a) Where for the purpose of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than Gs. per week: (b) Where for the purpose of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 7s. 6d. per week. RECREATION GROUNDS, LEWISHAM AND PENGE. The Board have under their consideration a proposal for acquiring a Recreation Ground for the inhabitants of Lewisham. Sites have been suggested for the purpose, and at the close of the year, 25th March, the subject stood referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee, the Board having referred it to that Committee to consider the advisability of securing the sites known as the Ravensbourne site and the 12 Lewisham Park site, according to a scheme submitted to the Board by their Chairman, Mr. T. W. Williams. Mr. Williams has since submitted the matter to the Lewisham Vestry, according to a promise previously made to that effect, and the Vestry have passed a resolution as follows:— "That having further considered the question of the desirability of securing a Rccreation Ground for Lewisham and Catford, and having had submitted to them the particulars of what is known as the Ravensbournc Scheme, this Vestry, taking all the circumstances into consideration, expresses its hearty approval of the Scheme, and also hopes that every endeavour will be made to secure the land, in whole or in part, as a Recreation Ground for the people." With regard to the Penge Recrcation Ground, the matter was submitted to the Board in July, 1886. The Board, on the 7th of that month, on their Annual Inspection, viewed the piece of ground situated nearly opposite St. John's Church, Beckenliam Road, Penge, and on the 28th the following resolutions were passed: — "That this Board, having at the recent Annual Inspection, viewed the site of a piece of land situated nearly opposite to St. John's Church, Penge, which site the inhabitants desire to acquire for the purpose of a Public Rccreation Ground, hereby resolve that the same be accepted by the Board, in accordance with the resolution of the Board of the 15th day of December, 1875." That this Board feeling the benefit that would accrue to the Hamlet of Penge if a Recreation Ground could be provided for its inhabitants, hereby resolves that it is desirable that the Board should be empowered to apply the sum of £1,722 12s. ltd., known as the Gravel Allotment Fund, and at picsent invested at 3½ per cent, for the benefit of Highways, Penge, in acquiring and improving an open space or Recreation Ground for such Hamlet, and that the Metropolitan Board he requested to insert a clause to effect this purpose in their next general Bill." 13 With the view of giving effect to such resolutions this Board at once presented Memorials to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and on the 27th Octobcr that Board wrote intimating that they had resolved to apply to Parliament for the powers desired by this Board, and the Metropolitan Board accordingly inserted a clause in their Various Powers Bill for the purpose This Bill had made considerable progress at the end of the year, and the Board had every reason to hope it will have passed both Houses of Parliament before this Report is issued. The following is a copy of the resolution of this Board of the loth December, 187o, above referred to:— "Resolved unanimously, that this Board is prepared, in pursuance of the provisions of the 11th section of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1856, to take by agreement or gift, any piece or pieccs of land, of which the Board may approve, on such terms and conditions as they think fit, for the purpose of such land being either kept as an open space, or being kept and maintained as a pleasure ground for the public benefit of the Inhabitants of the District; and is also prepared to authorise such expenditure as the Board may deem necessary for the purpose of enclosing, maintaining, planting, and otherwise improving such land." AUDIENCES OF TIIE BOARD. The following is the Bye-Law made bv the Board in respect of interviews: — "Interviews. "I.

Very shortly after the close of the financial year, under review in this Report, the Board sustained a severe loss by the death of Mr. Howard Samuel Winnett, the Clerk of the Board. Mr. Winnett's death was reported at the meeting held on the 1st June, 1887, when the Board expressed their very high appreciation of his character and ability, and of the services he had rendered them. The Board passed a resolurecordmg on their Minutes an expression of the deep sorrow with which they had heard of Mr. Winnett's death, and of the sense of the great loss the Board had thereby sustained.

REPORT tO The Board of Works for the Lewisham District TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1886, by DR. FREDK WILKINSON, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, as estimated at the middle of the year 1886, amounted to 85,300, occupying 13,613 houses. The population in 1881, at the time of the census, was ascertained to be 71,715. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1880 amounted to 2,324, of which 91, or 3.9 per cent., were illegitimate. Males 1,157. Females 1,167. The Birth Rate to population was 27.24 per 1,000. In London 133,700 births were registered, the Birth Rate being 32.3 per 1,000, the lowest since 1850. In England and Wales 903,216 births were registered, the birth rate being 324 per 1,000, which is 2.0 below the mean annual rate in the ten years 1876-85, and lower than 2 in any previous year since 1848, when a similar rate was recorded. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1886 was 1,100, being 22 more than the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality was 13.30 per 1,000. During the same period the annual rate oi mortality in England and Wales was 19.3, a trifle below the average of the last six years. The death rate of London was 19.9, an increase of 0.9 on that of the previous year, which was the lowest on record, while the death rate in the "Outer Ring" of suburban districts, with a population considerably over a million, did not exceed 16.5 per 1,000, a reduction of 1.0 on the previous year. The death rate in the twenty-seven great towns, excluding London, with an aggregate population of nearly five millions, was 20.1, ranging between 171 in Brighton, and 28.9 in Preston. Marriages. During the year 1886 there were 378 Marriages in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 312 were solemnised in the various Churches, 20 in Dissenting Chapels, and 40 at the Registrar's Office. During the same period there were 95 in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 82 were solemnised in Churches, 7 in Dissenting Chapels, and 0 at the Registrar's Office. Total 473, as compared with 531 in the previous year ; the lowest number recorded since 1880. The marriage rate was equal to 11*0 per 1,000. In London the marriage rate was 10'0, the hrwest yet recorded, though it has been on the decrease every year since 1883. I able I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which 3 have taken place in the District during the year 1886 and the 10 previous years. Table II. gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions in the District for the same periods. Table III. gives the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1886. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 1876 to 1885 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in the year 1886. Table VI. The Inspectors' Report of sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population in 1886, with the birth and death rates in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising ''the Lewisham District." Table VIII. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licensed cow-houses. Table IX. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. The number of deaths in Public Institutions, though fewer than last year, was above the average. Of a total of 97, 69 occurred in the Lewisham Workhouse, the majority being old and infirm persons, as were the 6 who died at the Waterman's Asylum. St. John's Hospital, Lewisham, a new Institution, accounts for 12 deaths; the remaining 10 were children, of whom 7 died at the Sick Children's Home, Sydenham, and 3 at the North Surrey District Schools, Anerley. 4 Inquests were held in 52 cases. The causes of death were returned as follows:— Natural Causes 23 Violent deaths— 29 Accidental 10 Suicidal 8 Homicidal 2 Eighteen deaths were registered as "Not Certified," no inquest being considered necessary by the Coroner after inquiry. Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich in 1886 was 48.7° Fahreinheit, or 0.6° below the average of 40 years. The highest reading by day, 89.8°, was registered in July, and the lowest reading by night, 16.0°, in January. Rain fell on 1G3 days, the total amount of rainfall being 24.21 inches, a slight increase on the previous year, but still an inch below the average. Milk. Too much importance cannot be attached to the necessity of having all milk cooked before using it, for though all dairies and milk shops are carefully inspected, and the cleanliness and well-being of the cows insisted upon, diseases of cattle come on so insidiously, that long before the dairyman has any suspicion of danger, zymotic disease, more especially, it is thought, scarlet fever, may be spread unwittingly over a district. The simple act of boiling destroys the poisonous germs, and enables the milk to be kept longer without decomposition. Water Supply. The water supply still continues to be of good quality and free from impurity, but I must again impress upon 5 householders the necessity of having their cisterns properly covered and periodically cleansed. In conclusion, I must thank Mr. Carline and other Officers of the Board, who have, by acting in concert with me, materially lightened my duties. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, FRED. WILKINSON, Medical Officer of Health to the Lettisham District. 6 TABLE I. Population, Inhabited Houses, Births, Deaths, and Marriages. (GROSS NUMBERS).

COLLECTION OF DUST, &c. The dust and ashes were collected in the Parish of Lewisham by the Hoard's own horses and carts, assisted by hired horses when requisite. The Parish was divided, as last year, into five Districts, two being again sub-divided. Some of the dust was given away on account of the increasing difficulty of obtaining shoots.

An arrangement was made with the Crystal Palace District Gas Company to rent the Yard of the Old Gas Works, Southend Lane, at the nominal sum of £4 per annum. An iron shed has been erected, and tar pavement has been made there for some time past. The yard will be very handy as a store for material, and in the winter the shed will be useful to put carts, &c., under. During the year 404 cubic yards of tar pavement were made for Highways.

These Sewers when completed will make an additional length of 330 feet of 18 inch pipe, 1,752 feet of 15 inch pipe, and l,800 feet of 12 inch pipe to the Sewers already maintained by the Board. The following Table shews the number of Houses sanctioned to be built and drained, and number of gullies, manholes, ventilators, and flushing chambers constructed in existing Sewers during the year:— Locality.

The condition oi the sewers is greatly improved by the flashing tanks; and in constructing the manholes, defects in the older sewers have been discovered and remedied, which otherwise would never have been known until a total stoppage had occurred. It is a matter of 11 congratulation that the sanitary condition of the sewers is improving year by year, and that we are surely and steadily carrying out a system of automatic flushing which I believe is not attempted as yet in any part of the Metropolis. Below I give a complete list of the flushing tanks constructed in the sewers up to the 25th of March last. In the present year's estimate I included 13 flushing tanks in Lewi sham, and 2 in Penge in addition to these. Parish of Lewisham. Locality. Capacity of Tank in Gallons.

Anerley Hill 1 Croydon Road 1 Hamlet Road 1 Raleigh Road 1 Seymour Villas 1 Wordsworth Road 2 Total 7 In addition to these Manholes the following small Manholes were constructed adjoining the new flushing tanks:— Parish of Lewisham. Church Hill 1 Clarendon Road 1 Dartmouth Row 1 13 Drysdale Road 1 Elmira Street 1 Lethbridge Road 1 Sunderland Road 1 Tyson Road 1 Total 8 Hamlet of Pengs. Belvedere Road 1 Croydon Road 1 Minden Road 1 Total 3 In this year's estimates 10 manholes and ventilators are included in Lewisham and 6 in Penge, in addition to the al»ve. An additional amount of flushing by means of water vans and carts was carried on, the water being mixed with Permanganate of potash for that purpose, and the flushing men were engaged at regular periods in examining and cleansing the sewers vested in the Board. A careful watch was kept upon the Perry Vale, Church Vale, and Westbourne Road sewers, and the temperature of the fluid flowing from Messrs. Morgan's Brewery regularly taken. There were fewer complaints of smells from these sewers than last year, and in fact of the sewers generally. I am pleased to report the chimney shaft and furnace for deodorising the sewer air from the Ivy Lane sewer was completed, and has been working many months. So far as I know, not a single complaint has been made since the coke fire has been in operation. One of the best proofs I can give is the evidence of the men, who say they can traverse the sewer now without inconvenience, when formerly the sewer was so foul, that entering it was attended with some danger. "Were it not for the expense, I should be inclined to recommend the Board to adopt the system in other sewers. A portion of the sewer in Morley Road was found to be defective, and 1 recommended that it be relaid, which was done. 1 also found the sewer pipe draining a portion of Teak Hill, Sydenham, to have an insufficient fall. The work of relaying the pipes was commenced, but not completed during the year. 14 The Board, in conjunction with the Beckenham Local Board of Health, determined to oppose the Corporation of Croydon in obtaining powers to purchase additional land to extend the South Norwood Sewage Farm. I was engaged in making plans and obtaining information regarding the matter. I also gave evidence before the Local Government Board's Inspector at the inquiries held at Croydon. Unfortunately the Boards were not successful in their opposition to the scheme. The wooden staircases of the footbridge at Park End, Sydenham, having become decayed from age, and unsafe, they were replaced by iron staircases, with wooden treads and parapets. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. The following table shews the surface water drains sanctioned:— Locality. Length in feet. Size. Material. Remarks. Westdown Road 220 9-inch. Pipe Completed. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. The only Bills affecting the District deposited dniring the year were as follow:— 1. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Bill, which included, amongst other matters not connected with the District, power to purchase the proposed Recreation Ground lor Penge, which is pretty certain to be obtained. 2. The South Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich, and District) Tramways Bill. This Bill, I have every reason to believe, will come to nothing. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, &c. No flooding of any moment occurred during the year, fifteen letters, asking suggestions upon frontage lines of building, &c„, under the 75 section of the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, 1862, were received. The following Table shows the manner in which they were dealt with:- 15 Date. Case No. Name of Applicant. Nature of Application. Board's Suggestion. Result. 1886. April 2 35,649 Mr. E.

The South Eastern Railway Company have done nothing as yet towards widening their line in the District, powers for which were obtained last year. It seems a pity to lose so much time in carrying out so desirable a work. The cleansing of the lower mill pond at Southend, was nearly completed, four thousand two hundred and seventy cubic yards of silt having been removed. Many names of streets were fixed to buildings and public lamps in the District. I was also engaged in preparing plans for proposed Recreation Grounds in Lewisham and Penge. There were 37 notices sent to builders and others, for 'commencing to build without giving the statutory notice, and several summonses, by direction of the Board, taken out and convictions obtained, for this and other offences. A large number of estimates and reports were made, one hundred and sixteen plans and tracings prepared, and a great many letters written. 1 append to this Report, a list of the New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board during the year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. 17 NEW STREETS SANCTIONED.
