Beatt S.R.N., S.C.M., R.F.N., H.V.Cert (Part time) 6 To the Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Beddington and Wallington Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my annual report for 1962. The report is drawn up in accordance with the suggestions made by the Minister of Health in his Circular 1/63. The vital statistics are based on information supplied by the Registrar-General. The report includes those services, which are under the control of the Surrey County Council, the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946, under the heading of General provision of Health Services for the Area. These services are:â€” Nursing in the Home: Domestic Help Service; Chiropody; Care of Mothers and Young Children; Immunisation and Vaccination: Ambulance Facilities. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population of Beddington and Wallington at mid-year 1962 is 32,600, and this figure is used in the compilation of the vital statistics. The figure shows an increase of 10 compared with the Registrar-General's estimate for mid-year 1961. The census of population taken in 1961 was 32,588. The live birth rate per 1,000 total population shows an increase at 15.20 in 1962, as compared with 14.44 in 1961. This rate is below that for England and Wales, which is 18.00. The stillbirth rate per 1,000 total births is 8.40 compared with 8.85 in 1961. The figure for England and Wales is recorded as 18.10. The number of children stillborn in the district was 4 out of a total of 476 births. The death rate from all causes per 1,000 total population is 10.95 compared with 10.31 in 1961 and 11.90 for England and Wales. Of the 372 deaths, diseases of the heart accounted for 135 (36.29 per cent of total deaths), cancer 78 (20.97 per cent of total deaths), and tuberculosis 1 (0.27 per cent of total deaths). It will be seen from the table on page 13 showing causes of death, that there were 135 deaths from heart disease, and that other diseases of the circulatory system accounted for 18 deaths, while vascular lesions of the nervous system (stroke) accounted for 53 deaths, making a total of 206 deaths. Most of these deaths took place in people past middleage, which follows the usual pattern of mortality in this district. The 78 deaths from cancer were also in people of advancing years. No mothers died in childbirth during 1962, and this gives a maternal mortality rate per 1,000 total births of nil, as compared with 0.35 for England and Wales. The infantile mortality rate shows a decrease at 19.07 per 1,000 live births, as compared with 20.09 in 1961. Nine infants died under the 7 age of 1 year in 1962 out of 472 live births. On page 15 will be found an analysis of the causes of death. The corresponding rate for England and Wales is 21.40. The incidence of infectious disease generally throughout the year, has been low, measles giving the highest figure with 23 notified cases. Whooping cough with 16 notified cases was next in order of incidence. Fifteen cases of scarlet fever were notified. It is felt that the attention of parents should again be drawn to the need for immunisation against whooping cough. The immunising material used throughout the year against diphtheria, contained immunising material against whooping cough and tetanus. It is pleasing to record that during the year no cases of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough. This is the fourth year in succession in which we have been able to make this comment. The annual reports for the years 1937 and 1961 covered periods respectively when the District was an Urban District and the 25 years after the District became a Borough. In looking over the records of the District since 1915 one is struck by the changing outlook and character of the work of the Public Health Department. The introduction of immunising procedures against diphtheria, whooping cough, poliomyelitis and tuberculosis has so reduced the number of cases of all these diseases now notified as to make the work of prevention very much easier. In the case of tuberculosis there has been an enormous reduction of mortality from the disease as well as the incidence. Much of the time thus made available to Public Health staff has to be spent in the field of social medicine. In particular, the Medical Officer of Health in his capacity of Divisional Medical Officer for the MidEastern Division of the Surrey County Council, has to devote a great deal of his energies to the alleviation of families suffering from social malaise. The changing pattern of the life of many people, together with the altered moral outlook has created social problems, which are giving a great deal of anxiety to both Central and Local Governments. The number of juvenile delinquents, which every year shows a great increase, has affected the work of Medical Officers as well as educationalists. The appointment of social workers, together with an increasing number of probation officers, has made it necessary to co-ordinate all aspects of social services in an endeavour to improve the worsening situation. The break up in family life resulting from divorce and temporary arrangements between men and women outside the marital bond brings enormous problems in its train. Increase in illegitimacy with the need to make provision either in foster homes or institutions for neglected and unwanted children throws a considerable burden on local Health Authorities. In an endeavour to co-ordinate the work of all persons trying to improve the social outlook, the County Council set up in 1957 co-ordinating Conferences under the chairmanship of the Divisional Medical Officers throughout the county, and this has already been reported upon in previous annual reports. These Conferences, at which every aspect of problem families are reviewed, have proved very effective in dealing with problems which had at first sight seemed insoluble. 8 Local Health Authorities, through their Children's Department, have to spend a considerable proportion of the rate on the provision of homes to take children into care as well as appointing more Child Care officers to assist in the supervision of bad homes. The work of the Public Health Inspectors too has altered very considerably over the years. The introduction of new legislation, i.e. Smoke Abatement Acts, the extension of the Food and Drugs Act and New Housing Acts have made the work of this section of the Department very much more responsible than it was previously. The impact of establishing Smoke Control Areas has had a considerable effect upon the work and the deviation of responsibility of the Department. The work of the Clean Air Act, which has so far been undertaken without the appointment of additional staff has increased to such an extent that it now takes up a disproportionate amount of the time of the available staff. This can be seen from the following table which shews the number of visits made in connection with duties under the Clean Air Act, mainly in connection with Smoke Control Areas, and the number of inspections of houses, food premises and factories. While the total figure indicates that the volume of work is now greater than heretofore, the other figures shew that the emphasis has so changed that certain aspects of the work are not receiving the attention they warrant and formerly received.

The provision of home help, district nursing, meals on wheels and other services for the aged has alleviated the lot of many lonely, sick and old persons. The admission to hospital of many cases has been arranged through the kindly help of the Geriatric Department at St. Helier's Hospital. During the year under review no Magistrate's Orders had to be sought for the removal of an old person. Most of the cases dealt with were only too pleased to accept the administration arrangements made on their behalf. Once again we must record the appreciation of all for the very considerable help given by the W.V.S. in this connection under the able guidance of Mrs. O. L. Wiles. 9 The number of attendances at the various Infant Welfare Centres throughout the town has, over the past few years, shown a remarkable increase. The rising birth rate has, no doubt, contributed considerably to this but also it is generally felt that ratepayers are more and more inclined to take advantage of the various services for the health of mothers and children provided by the Local Health Authority. In September 1962 a new Maternity and Child Welfare Clinic was established at the British Red Cross House in Woodcote Road. The object of introducing a new Clinic at this site was to meet the demand of young parents now occupying new properties in the Southern part of the Borough. There has been much expansion of private dwellings in this area and many new families are growing up who require these services. With an average attendance of 50 now in this new Clinic it is felt that the venture has amply justified itself. A new Clinic to provide services previously enjoyed at the Grange Mansion, burnt down in January 1960, is being built in Shotfield and should be completed early in 1965. It is hoped in these new premises to combine the School Medical Service, Dental and Physiotherapy clinics as well as most of the services for Maternity and Child Welfare including ante-natal clinics and Infant Welfare clinics, together with the sale of Infant Welfare foods and medicaments. On Page 21 where records of immunising procedures are recorded, it will be noticed that during the early part of the year under review there was a considerable increase in the number of smallpox vaccinations carried out. This increase is accounted for by the considerable demand which arose after occurrences of smallpox in Wales and the North of England. In conclusion, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the loyal service and valuable assistance I have received from all members of my staff throughout the year. I have the honour to be. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, PATRICK J. O'CONNELL, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Wallington. Telephone: Wallington 4500.

By an Order in Council, dated 20th August, 1937, H.M. King George VI granted a charter to Beddington and Wallington, which was presented on the 15th September, 1937, by the Lord Lieutenant of the County of Surrey. The Borough is bounded on the east by the County Borough of Croydon, to the north by the Borough of Mitcham, to the west by the Carshalton Urban District, and to the south by the Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley. The Borough is practically fully developed, but the Council has preserved much of the open character of the area, by the extensive use of its powers in providing parks and open spaces. The area is mainly residential, but there are factories in the Borough, providing employment for some 9,000 people, these being situated mostly in the northern part of the Borough. During recent years there has been considerable residential development in the southern part of the Borough, with the provision of new roads of detached houses. All this development, in one of the best parts of the district, has been carried out on a policy of low density of houses to the acre, and the whole character of the scheme is in keeping with the accepted standards of the southern part of the Borough. Parks and open spaces continue to be well maintained, and give breathing space and facilities for open-air recreational activities. Beddington Park and Grange Park are used as much as ever, and are an inestimable boon during the holiday months to children and parents, who are unable to go away for a holiday. The pleasing residential character of the district is well maintained, and is much appreciated by many City workers, who return home to pleasant relaxation in their gardens and allotments in the evenings. 11 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS Resident Populationâ€”Estimated mid.year 1962 32,600 Live Births Males 1 Females Total Legitimate 244 205 449 Illegitimate 11 12 23 Total 255 217 472 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 population 14.48 Adjusted Birth Rate 15.20 England and Wales Live Birth Rate 18.00 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total Live Births 4.87 Still Births Legitimate 3 1 4 Illegitimate â€” â€” â€” Total 3 1 4 Rate per 1,000 total Live and Stillbirths 8.40 England and Wales Stillbirth Rate 18.10 Live and Stillbirths Legitimate 247 206 453 Illegitimate 11 12 23 Total 258 218 476 Deaths 200 172 372 (i) Death Rate per 1,000 population 11.41 Adjusted Death Rate 10.95 England and Wales Death Rate 11.90 (ii) Infant Deathsâ€”under 1 year of age Total No. of Deaths 9 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births 19.07 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births: Legitimate 20 04 Illegitimate Nil Infant Mortality Rate for England and Wales 21.40 Neo Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births (Under 4 weeks of age) 14.83 Early Neo.natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live Births (Deaths under 1 week) 14.83 Peri.natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Stillbirths (Stillbirths and deaths under 1 week) 23.11 (iii) Maternal Deaths (including abortion) total Nil Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Stillbirths Nil England and Wales Maternal Mortality Rate 0.35 12 REGISTERED CAUSES OF DEATH The following table, supplied by the Registrar-General, gives the causes of death of residents in the Borough during 1962: Causes of Death Males Females Total All Causes 200 172 372 1.

The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales per 1,000 live and still births was 0.35. INFANTILE MORTALITY The infantile mortality rate for 1962 was 19 07 per 1,000 live births. The comparable rate for England and Wales is 21 .40. Great credit is due to the services operated in the Borough for the care of mothers and young children. Of the total of 472 live births, only 9 deaths of infants under one year of age (5 males and 4 females) were registered. 14 The following table gives the age and cause of death of each infant who died: Age Sex Cause of Death 1 hour M Multiple Congenital Abnormalities. 1 hour F Prematurity. 6 hours M Pulmonary haemorrhage.

NURSING IN THE HOME The Beddington and Wallington District Nurses' Home, 57 Montagu Gardens, administered by the Surrey County Council, continues to offer excellent facilities for nursing as in previous years, the day-to-day administration being in the hands of the Divisional Medical Officer for the Beddington and Wallington part of Mid-Eastern Division. During the year the District Nurses attended 893 cases, including 128 maternity and midwifery patients. A total of 21,062 visits was made. Since the destruction of the Grange Mansion, the school health service has been housed in the Nurses Home, and in addition, physiotherapy, and ante-natal relaxation exercises are carried out on the premises. DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE This important branch of social service continued to meet a great need during the year, both for confinements and illness in the home. The service is administered by the Divisional Medical Officer at the Wallington Town Hall, and a part-time supervisor, who acts under the general direction of the Divisional Medical Officer, is employed. Close liaison was kept up with the almoners of hospitals, and it was found possible to meet the many requests received for Medical and Surgical patients and the care of the aged under the St. Helier Hospital geriatric service. The cases attended were as follows: Total Maternity 45 Chronic Sick (including aged and infirm) 200 Acute Sick 36 Tuberculosis 1 282 CHIROPODY The County Council, in February 1960, approved arrangements for the provision of chiropody for the elderly, for expectant mothers and physically handicapped persons. The scheme came into operation on the 9th May, 1960. So far as the elderly were concerned, the County Council invited voluntary bodies administering schemes for chiropody treatment to continue and expand their schemes with financial help from the Council. The Divisional Medical Officer was asked to administer the scheme for expectant mothers and handicapped persons through chiropodists practising in the area, who had agreed to participate in the scheme. As 16 from the 1st July, 1961, elderly persons, the registered blind and partially sighted were included in the scheme operated by the Divisional Medical Officer. The Chiropodist is paid a uniform fee of 7/6 for each treatment undertaken in the surgery and 12/6 for a domiciliary visit. The patient is required to contribute a standard fee of 3/- per treatment. In approved cases the Divisional Medical Officer may authorise treatment free of charge. In 1962 the following persons were treated:- Elderly persons 72 Handicapped persons 12 Total 84 A total of 383 treatments were given (232 at surgery and 151 at the patients home). The chiropody service introduced in 1958 through the active cooperation of the W.V.S. and the British Red Cross Society, continued to operate in 1962. In addition arrangements were made through the Beddington and Wallington Fund for the Aged and Infirm, for a Chiropodist to visit the homes of sick people who were unable to get out and treatment was carried out at an agreed cost to the Fund. THE CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Supervision. This clinic, as in previous years, continued to be held at the Nurses Home, 57 Montagu Gardens. During the year, 114 women made 466 pre-natal attendances. This represents an attendance of 24.0 per cent of the total number of confinements which occurred during 1962. Post-natal examinations were also conducted at this clinic, 12 patients making 12 attendances. As mentioned in previous reports, however, considerably more women have post-natal supervision than are recorded here. Those who have institutional confinements usually return to hospital as a routine a few weeks after their discharge, and have their post-natal examination conducted by the hospital Medical Officers. Institutional Confinements. Three hundred and forty or 72.0 per cent. of births allocated to this district, took place in hospitals and nursing homes, compared with 69.69 per cent recorded in the previous year. Patients going into hospital for a confinement are classified under two headings, those whose admission is essential on medical grounds and those who have unsatisfactory homes in which it would be inadvisable to conduct a domiciliary confinement. Every case is properly investigated, and it is only after a visit from the Health Visitor that patients requiring admission on social grounds are put forward for consideration by the hospital. 17 Treatment Centres and Clinics Child Welfare Centres Woodcote Road Centre When held Red Cross House, Woodcote Road.

During the year voluntary help was again generously given by many ladies in the district, in assisting in the operation of the infant welfare centres. Among these, special mention should be made of the members of the British Red Cross Society, who continued to supply the great majority of the voluntary help given. The ladies of the W.V.S. continued to organize the sales and distribution of the Welfare Foods, previously administered by the Ministry of National Insurance. Infant Welfare Services. Infant Welfare clinics and general supervisory control through health visiting were continued by the Surrey County Council during the year. In general, a high standard of visiting and a smooth and efficient service were maintained. The number of attendances recorded at the four clinics during the year was as follows:â€” Number attending Total attendances Children under 1 year 436 5,969 Children, 1-5 years 840 3,565 Total 1,276 9,534 18 Health Visiting. Four health visitors are employed by the Surrey County Council for the supervision of infants up to 5 years of age and expectant and nursing mothers, both at home and at the infant welfare and ante-natal clinics. These health visitors are also responsible for the supervision of children attending schools in the Borough. Visits during the year were made as follows: First visits Total visits Expectant Mothers 202 384 Children, 0-1 year 452 2,201 Children, 1-5 years â€” 3,036 Other Cases â€” 138 Ineffectual â€” 637 Total 654 6,396 Child Life Protection. This function is now governed by the Children Act, 1948, which came into operation on the 5th July, 1948. A Children's Officer is appointed by the Surrey County Council to supervise all children coming within the provisions of the Act. The health visitors, however, visit on behalf of the Children's Officer deprived children under 5 years of age and certain other children in registered residential establishments. Care of Premature Infants. The arrangements made for the care of premature infants continued during 1962. Equipment is kept at the District Nurses' Home, the headquarters of the local Midwives, where it is ready for immediate use when required. Thirty-one premature live births were notified during the year, 29 of which occurred in hospital. Two infants died within 24 hours of birth. The remaining 29 children survived. Care of Illegitimate Children. The Surrey County Council make an annual grant to the Sutton and District Girls' Aid Association, whose visitor follows up cases occurring in the Borough. A grant is also made to homes for mothers and babies in Surrey where the unmarried mother can be admitted before the birth of her child, and cared for some months after birth. Ladies of the Women's Voluntary Services and the health visitors continue to co-operate in the alleviation of the lot of these unfortunate mothers. 19 Treatment. Minor Ailments. Twenty-six cases were referred from the Infant Welfare Centres to Hospital Specialists for investigation and treatment during the year. The principal defects were as follows: Eye conditions 7 Ear, Nose and Throat 8 Skin Conditions 3 Hernia 3 Dental. The year's work at the Dental Clinic, which provided for school children and children below the age of five years, as well as nursing and expectant mothers, is summarised in the following table: No. of Cases Extractions Fillings Scaling & Gum Treatment Provision of Dentures Full Partial Expectant and Nursing Mothers 3 1 3 - - - Children, 0-5 33 37 93 â€” â€” â€” Totals 36 38 96 â€” â€” â€” As has been pointed out elsewhere, this service is now accommodated at Rochester Road, Carshalton, and will continue on these premises until the County Council's new clinic project is ready. Orthopaedic. Patients attending infant welfare centres who require treatment for orthopaedic defects are referred by the Clinic Medical Officer to orthopaedic surgeons at St. Helier or other hospitals. Physiotherapy. This department continues to do very useful work, and a high standard of attendance was maintained throughout the year. In addition to ultra-violet light and infra-red irradiation, massage, manipulation and corrective treatments are given. Classes for remedial exercises for children suffering from minor orthopaedic and postural defects were conducted during the year. The Physiotherapist continued to arrange classes for pregnant mothers desiring a course of relaxation exercises. The following table gives details of attendances: Total attendances Irradiations Corrective treatments Relaxation Exercises Children, 0-5 years 218 129 â€” Children, 5-15 years 494 1,802 â€” Expectant and Nursing Mothers 18 â€” 449 Total 730 1,931 449 20 Immunisation and Vaccination This is one of the services transferred to the local Health Authority on 5th July, 1948. In Beddington and Wallington the work is conducted by the Divisional Medical Officer. In addition, general practitioners have been brought into the scheme and they forward returns of completed cases ofimmunisation to the Divisional Medical Officer, for which they receive a fee. Smallpox Vaccination. During 1962, 1097 persons including 491 children under 5 years of age, were vaccinated and 657 persons were re-vaccinated at the weekly clinic held at the Town Hall, or by their general practitioner. Diphtheria Immunisation. Six clinicsare heldweeklyto give immunisation against diphtheria. These are held at each of the five Infant Welfare Centres and at the Medical Officer of Health's Department at the Town Hall. The following table gives the number of children residing in the Borough who were known to be immunised in both age groups. 0-5 years 5-15 years Total 0-15 years Approximate number of children in the Borough at 31st Dec., 1962 1,949 4,272 6,221 Number of children known to be immunised at 31st Dec., 1962 1,668 4,085 5,753 Percentage of children immunised 85.6 95.6 92.5 It is customary now to include immunisation against both whooping cough and tetanus in the injection given to immunise against diphtheria. Children immunised primarily against diphtheria, therefore, are automatically immunised against whooping cough and tetanus at the same time. Whooping Cough Immunisation. This service was continued throughout the year by the local health authority, to whom it was transferred on the 5th July, 1948. During the year, 400 children were immunised at County Council clinics or by their general practitioner. Tetanus Immunisation. Children are immunised against Tetanus at County Council clinics, or by their general practitioner. During 1962, 430 children completed a primary course and 67 children received a reinforcing dose. 21 Poliomyelitis. The Poliomyelitis vaccination scheme, introduced in 1956, continued, within the prescribed age groups, during 1962. In March of this year, the Minister of Health introduced the new oral vaccine known as the Sabine vaccine. It is held by the experts that this is a better vaccine than the injection of Salk, as not only is a general immunity in the blood stream set up, but also a local immunity in the intestinal tract. It is thought that this vaccine will take over completely from the Salk injections. During the year considerable use was made of this vaccine, especially by children. The following figures show the number of persons vaccinated by the end of 1962. Salk Vaccine No. of children born 1943-62 who have received two injections of Salk Vaccine 7644 No. of persons born 1920-42 who have received two injections of Salk Vaccine 3977 No. of persons who received a 3rd injection of Salk after two former injections 10803 No. of children between the ages of 5-12 years who received a 4th dose of Salk Vaccine after a former 3 injections. 2394 Oral Vaccine No. of children born 1943-62 who received a primary course of three doses of Oral Vaccine 250 No. of persons born 1922-42 who received a primary course of three doses of Oral Vaccine 85 No. of persons who received 3rd dose of Oral Vaccine after two injections of Salk 378 No. of children who received 4th dose of Oral Vaccine after three injections of Salk 560 School Clinics With the coming into operation of the 1944 Education Act, the Medical Officer of Health was appointed in September, 1945, Divisional Medical Officer for the Beddington and Wallington half of the MidEastern Divisional Executive of the County of Surrey. School clinics were conducted at 57 Montagu Gardens Wallington, Rochester Road and Phoenix Flats, Carshalton. The services provided at these clinics were general medical inspection and treatment, dental treatment, speech therapy and physiotherapy. Cleansing of Persons During 1962 the Corporation continued to provide facilities for cleansing infested persons. LABORATORY FACILITIES The Corporation's arrangements for the examination of swabs, sputa and other pathological material continue as heretofore. During 1962, H. Amphlett Williams, Esq., Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., Public Analyst, City of London Laboratories, King's Head Yard, Borough High Street, London, S.E.I, continued the arrangement made in 1946 for the examination of milk, water and ice-cream. In general, pathological specimens, are sent to the Pathological Laboratories at St. Helier Hospital. Samples of milk and water are submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health laboratories at Epsom, reports being received free of charge under the National Health Service Act, 1946. 22 HOSPITALS Infectious Cases. The South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board make provision for the admission and treatment of cases of infectious disease in hospitals under their control. Most of the cases from Beddington and Wallington continue to be admitted to the Wandle Valley Isolation Hospital. Smallpox. The Regional Hospital Board have made arrangements for the admission of cases of smallpox to their hospital at Joyce Green, Dartford. Venereal Diseases Clinics The Surrey County Council was, until the 5th July, 1948, responsible for the control and treatment of venereal diseases in the area, and was a member of the London and Home Counties Scheme. This service was taken over on the 5th July, 1948, by the Regional Hospital Board, who continue to provide free diagnosis and treatment at the Croydon General Hospital, at clinics established at St. Helier Hospital, the Royal Surrey Hospital, Guildford, the East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, and at hospitals previously under the London and Home Counties Scheme. General and Accident Cases. Cases from this area are admitted to: Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington District (War Memorial) Hospital. St. Helier Hospital, Carshalton. Croydon General Hospital. The Wilson Hospital, Mitcham. Maternity Cases. The Regional Hospital Board continue the provision at St. Helier Hospital for maternity cases in the Borough requiring institutional confinements. Some patients continue to be admitted to the Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington (War Memorial) Hospital under arrangements made by their practitioners under the National Health Service Act, 1946. AMBULANCE FACILITIES General and Accident Cases. Reorganisation of the ambulance services was undertaken by the Surrey County Council on their transfer on 5th July, 1948. The main ambulance station is situated at 163 Kingston Road, New Maiden. All ambulances are equiped with short wave radio communication, and are readily available for direction in case of emergency. DISINFECTION The disinfection of houses has been undertaken by the Council during the year and the Wandle Valley Hospital has continued to co-operate in the disinfection of bedding. Disinfection which is not absolutely essential in the interests of the public health is also undertaken upon a payment of Â£1 per load for bedding, etc., and 7s. 6d. for the first room and 3s. 9d. for each additional room as applied to house disinfection. 23 HOUSING I am indebted to the Town Clerk, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and the Chief Public Health Inspector for the following information, which is given in connection with rehousing, the erection of new houses, and overcrowding:â€” Rehousing Number of houses requisitioned since the beginning of the war and still held under requisition Nil Number of prefabricated bungalows provided since the end of the war 94 Number of same demolished at end of 1962 38 Number of families rehoused by the Council or by private owners at the Council's instigation since the beginning of the war 1276 Number of live applications on the housing list for accomodation in Beddington and Wallington:â€” On the general waiting list 356 On the aged persons' list 238 For accommodation in Frimley and Camberley 28 New houses erected, etc. Number of new houses and flats erected in 1962:â€” Private enterprise 81 Local Authority Nil Number of flats erected by conversion in 1962:â€” Private enterprise 6 Local Authority 13 Number of houses and flats purchased in 1962 and let 3 Housing Act, 1957 Ninety-six houses were rendered fit as a result of informal or statutory action under the Public Health Act, 1936 and Housing Act, 1957. Number of inspections of dwelling-houses 164 Number of inspections recorded under Housing Regulations 36 In the absence of a complete survey of the Borough, it is impossible to give accurate figures relating to the number of cases of overcrowding. Evidence available indicates that the number is low. The table below sets out information concerning cases of overcrowding which have come to the knowledge of the Health Department. Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 4 Number of families dwelling therein 5 Number of persons dwelling therein 33 Number of new cases of overcrowding reported 2 Number of cases of overcrowding relieved 1 Number of persons concerned 8 Number of dwellinghouses in respect of which the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding and which have again become overcrowded Nil Rent Act 1957 One application for Certificate of Disrepair was received. One notice of intention to issue Certificate of Disrepair was sent out. 24 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLIERS The water supply is piped throughout the district from the Sutton District Water Company. All dwelling-houses in the area are connected to public water mains. None of the inhabitants rely upon stand pipes. During the year the supply has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. It is understood that the Water Company carry out routine bacteriological examinations of the raw and finished water daily from the wells at Sutton and Woodmansterne, and also of the treated water going into supply. Routine chemical examinations are also carried out. The raw water from the deep wells is of a relatively high degree of hardness. The company are under a statutory obligation (Sutton District Waterworks Act, 1903) to deliver water of not more than 9 degrees of hardness, and an elaborate softening plant is in use. During the year 43 samples of water were examined by the Public Analyst or the Public Health Laboratory Service. From the reports the water supply is shown to be satisfactory both in chemical and bacteriological purity, and no cases of illness associated with pollution of water supplies were recorded during the year. The chlorination of water from private wells situated in industrial premises was continued throughout the year. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE During the year the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal continue to be adequate but attention should be directed at the former in order that the system should remain so in the future. The sewers have been systematically cleaned and flushed, and no major difficulties were experienced in the maintenance and cleansing of soil and storm water drainage systems, during the year. RIVERS AND STREAMS The River Wandle received the usual attention, but no major works were undertaken pending the reconstruction to be carried out by Surrey County Council. CLOSET ACCOMMODATION Practically the whole of the area is on the water carriage system, draining into public sewers. There are a few chemical and earth closets, chiefly for use on sports grounds within the district, whilst four cesspools were in use in the district at the end of the year. PUBLIC CLEANSING During the year a Bedford Lacre suction sweeper was brought into operation on the highways and proved to be a more satisfactory method of cleansing than hand sweeping. Footpaths have continued to be swept by hand. The pilot scheme for refuse collection using paper bags instead of dustbins, which was carried out in 1960, proved successful and has been extended to other Council housing estates, 400 houses now being provided with brackets for paper bags. 25 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA The following statement by the Chief Public Health Inspector gives statistics as to the number of complaints received, inspections made, defects remedied, and other work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors.

During the year nearly two thousand visits were made to houses, which have been, or it is proposed will be, included in such areas. Three parts of the Borough have now been declared smoke contol areas. They are:- (1) That part of the Borough bounded by the boundary with the Urban District Councils of Carshalton and Coulsdon and Purley and by Woodcote and Heathdene Roads. The order relating to this area came into force on the 1st November, 1961. (2) That part of the Borough bounded by the County Borough of Croydon and the Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley and by Woodcote Road, Sandy Lane South and Stafford Road. The order relating to this area was made and confirmed in 1961 and came into force on the 1st October, 1962. (3) That part of the Borough bounded by Woodcote Road, Sandy Lane South and Stafford Road. The order relating to this area will come into force on the 1st October, 1963. During the year houses and other premises in a fourth area were visited with a view to their inclusion in a fourth smoke control order. The area is that bounded by Woodcote Road, Heathdene Road, Boundary Road the Sutton to West Croydon railway, Demesne Road and Stafford Road. INDUSTRIAL PREMISES During the year 97 observations were made on the chimneys of Industrial premises. One contravention of the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations was reported and brought to the notice of the Company. Advice was given when consulted, on the heights of new chimneys and new furnaces to be installed. 33 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for 12 months ending 31st December, 1962 Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses Business (& other premises) Total Agricultural Number of Properties in Local Authority's district 46 10,395 1,532 11,973 30 Number of Properties inspected as a result of: (a) Notification - 104 22 126 - (b) Survey under the Act 46 236 109 391 30 (c) Primarily for some other purpose - 236 461 697 - Properties found to shew major rat infestations - - - - - Properties found to shew minor rat infestations 12 72 20 104 - Properties found to shew major mice infestations - - - - - Properties found to shew minor mice infestations 1 22 5 28 - Total Infestations 13 94 25 132 - SEWER RAT CONTROL The introduction some years ago of Warfarin bait for sewer maintenance treatments resulted in an immediate reduction in the number of manholes showing evidence of infestation. At the time of the treatment in April, 1962, 13 manholes showed a take of bait. It was felt that a change of poison and procedure might effect an improvement and in the treatment carried out in November, fluoracetamide was used for the first time. The result of this change is not normally assessed until at least three treatments have been carried out and the result of a further test baiting examined. 34 PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS 67 Licenses were issued to keep petroleum spirit and/or petroleum mixture at 55 premises. The maximum quantities of these substances which may be kept under licence in the Borough are as follows: Petroleum Spirit 122,100 gallons (49 licences) Petroleum Mixture 12,155 gallons (18 licences) SHOPS ACT, 1950 The total number of inspections during the year was 201.

The water supply for the Swimming Bath is drawn from a well sunk in the grounds of the institution. After filling up,the water is only topped up, and complete emptying of the bath does not take place during the whole of the season. Chlorination is by means of a chlorine gas injector; the standard of chlorination maintained is 0.7 parts per million in the shallow end, and 0.4 parts per million in the middle of the bath. Filtration is carried out by pressure through a sand filter. Samples of the swimming bath water are submitted for bacteriological examination throughout the season. Those submitted in 1962 (7), were returned as bacteriologically satisfactory. SCHOOLS School Closure. Infectious diseases common to childhood were not prevalent in epidemic form in any of the schools during the year. As a result it was not found necessary for any school to be closed by the local sanitary authority to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Medical Inspection. Under the 1944 Education Act the Assistant Medical Officers of the County Council continued to carry out routine and special medical inspections of schoolchildren in the maintained schools. This work is under the general supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, in his capacity of Divisional School Medical Officer for the Mid-Eastern Divisional Executive of the Surrey County Council. Water Supply and Sanitary Conditions. All the schools are supplied with water from the public mains and are connected with the sewers. During the year some progress was made in bringing the maintained schools up to pre-war standards of decoration. No major sanitary defects were found. Considerable thought has been given to the maintenance of good standards of hygiene in school canteens. The serving of meals on a large scale in establishments such as schools, represents a danger-point for the occurrence of food poisoning. The maintenance of high standards of hygiene and sanitation is dependent upon the intelligent co-operation of every individual member of a canteen staff. The Ministries of Health and Education are constantly devising methods of educating staff to realise the importance of a high standard of personal hygiene, in order to avoid outbreaks of food poisoning. In order to further the interests of hygiene, and encourage washing after the use of the toilet, all Infants' schools in the Mid-Eastern Division have now been provided with a constant hot water supply to the taps supplying the wash basins in the school cloak rooms. 39 OUTBREAKS OF FOOD POISONING, AND CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN During the year no outbreaks of food poisoning occurred. The Chief Public Health Inspector and his staff continue to press for improved standards amongst shopkeepers and food handlers generally. The Inspectors, on their repeated visits to food premises, endeavour to induce a conscientious attitude towards the prevention of disease, by giving advice and distributing literature to all persons handling food. Instruction is given to shopkeepers and their assistants on personal hygiene and the dangers associated with disease and unclean habits in connection with their occupation. NUTRITION The nutritional standards of school children, as observed at routine examinations, and children below school age, as observed at infant welfare centres, are maintained at a very high level, the general impression gained being that children tend to be taller and heavier in the respective age-groups than formerly. The Local Health Authority continued the scheme for the distribution of welfare foods since it was handed over by the Ministry of Food in June, 1954. Local issues are made from an office situated in the Corporation Car Park by the Divisional Medical Officer's staff and ladies of the W.V.S. Issues were also made at infant welfare centres and at the branch library in Beddington. Grateful thanks are due to the many volunteers, who so willingly co-operate in this important service for mothers and infants. Proprietary brands of vitamin preparations and some dried milk foods continue to be available to mothers at infant welfare centres and at the Town Hall. SHELL FISH (MOLLUSCAN) Only a small quantity of shell fish is marketed in the district, and is obtained chiefly from Billingsgate Market, London. 40 ADOPTIVE ACTS AND BYE-LAWS The following Acts have been adopted: Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890, Parts I, II and III.
