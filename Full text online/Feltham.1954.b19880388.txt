BARKER (Appointed 23.6.54, Resigned 23.10.54) 2 Council Offices, Feltham, July, 1955. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1954. The District is divided into three Wards : Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4,925. The Home population (mid year) as estimated by the Registrar General was 48,200. This was an increase compared with the 1953 figure of 47,090. The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops, but a large number of residents work outside the district, particularly in London. Only a very small number continue to work in agriculture. The sum represented by a penny rate is £1,515. Rateable Value £368,330 Number of inhabited dwellings 13,027 Number of new houses erected 533 VITAL STATISTICS Births Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 735 374 361 Illegitimate 25 14 11 Total 760 388 372 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population— 15.76 (1953 16.41).

The numbers of new cases notified, however, show a decrease. The Mobile X-ray Unit of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board visited the district during September and members of the public were invited to attend. Appointments could be made at this department, the public libraries and at one or two chemist's shops. I am glad to say the public made full use of the facilities offered and the Unit was used to capacity. Maternal Mortality One maternal death occurred in hospital during the year, this is the third in the past four years. 7 Housing Since house building recommenced in 1946 this Authority has built 1,559 dwellings and 486 private dwellings have been erected. In addition there are 150 temporary bungalows. Despite this large programme the demand for houses is not satisfied and there are still many families, mostly young couples, who are sharing accommodation. Due to the restricted amount of building land now available the Council was forced to close its housing list in the early part of the year. The programme for dealing with unfit houses makes further demands, of course, upon the available supply of accommodation. In this connection every consideration is given to the needs of the people displaced, so that the enforced move causes as little worry as possible. Diphtheria Immunisation Facilities for immunisation against diphtheria are provided by the Middlesex County Council at their clinics or through the local medical practitioners. The Department has co-operated with the Area Medical Officer of the County with regard to the publicity campaigns which have been undertaken. Water Analysis 1. The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District are supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co., and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South West Suburban Water Co. is taken by the Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is derived from the River Thames purified in the storage reservoirs at Littleton, Staines and Walton, and is filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. A contact period of aver an hour is given at the works for the completion of chlorination. The water supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. 2. Samples for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis are taken by the Metropolitan Water Board at all stages of purification at least five times each week. Weekly samples. have been taken by the South West Suburban Water Co. In addition four samples were taken by my department. 8 Average Results of Analyses of Metropolitan Water Board Supply.

No action has been required in respect of contamination of the water. All water is chlorinated before distribution and all new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use. 5. With the exception of two or three outlying cottages, all the houses in the area are supplied from the public water mains. Only a very limited number of houses are supplied by standpipes common to two or more houses, the vast majority being supplied direct. Population supplied with water from standpipes is approximately 11. Food Poisoning Five unrelated cases of food poisoning have been notified during the year. Investigations, which in some instances were hampered by delayed notification, were made in each case, but the causes were not ascertained. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355-357 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Conclusion In conclusion I should like to thank the members of the Committee for the support which they have given me during the year and also Mr. Bell and the staff of the department for their able and willing assistance. F. H. WOODS, Medical Officer of Health. 10 CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing—Demolition and Closure The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, came into operation during the year and amended the Housing Act, 1936. Whilst it is too early yet to gauge the effect of this measure in dealing with unfit housing, it is felt that the standard has been lowered and that the Act will not make the local authorities' task easier. Action for dealing with unfit housing was re-commenced in 1946. From that year until the end of 1954, 138 houses have been dealt with as follows:— Demolition Orders made 126 Agreements entered into with owners to "close" or repair 10 Houses demolished 69 Houses demolished as a result of informal action 2 Persons who have been or will be displaced 389 Action taken during 1954 is as follows:— Housing Act, 1936 No. of Houses No. of Persons displaced Houses reported to Public Health Committee as being unfit 48 - Demolition orders made 28 — Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 11 11 15 Houses closed in pursuance of an undertaking given by the owners under Section 11, and still in force 1 4 Parts of buildings closed (Section 12) — — Housing Act, 1949 Closing Orders made under Section 3 (1) - - Demolition orders determined and closing Orders substituted under Section 3 (2) - - 11 Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 Closing Orders made under Section 10 (1) Housing—Repairs Action to secure the execution of repairs continued as necessary and is summarised below. A limitation is placed upon the effective repair of dwelling houses by the " reasonable cost" provision of the Housing Act, 1936. In many cases, if action is to be taken at all, it must of necessity be directed towards the making of demolition orders although it is true that in such cases the owners have the option of making offers to carry out repairs. After giving full consideration to the cost of works, in one particular case, a statutory notice to carry out repairs was served, but an appeal against this was allowed and the house was declared to be unfit and not repairable at reasonable cost. By comparison with this particular house the majority of the pre 1918 houses in the district could be considered as only fit for demolition action and the local authority is therefore precluded from taking statutory action to effect thorough repair. For some defects action could be taken under the Public Health Act, but this does not provide the complete answer. Informal Action No. of Houses No. of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local authority 99 Action under Statutory Powers Number of houses reported to Public Health Committee with a view to service of statutory notices 30 Number of statutory notices served 11 Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices:— No. of Houses (a) by owners 2 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Section 9, 10, 11 and 16):— (a) by owners 3 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 12 Housing—Improvement Grants Very careful consideration was given by the Council to the question of making improvement grants. The very small number of applications or enquiries was noted and it was eventually decided that in the interests of the ratepayers of the district the scheme of improvement grants be not adopted. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954—Disrepair Certificates Eight applications for disrepair certificates were made by tenants following service of notices of increase of rents by their landlords. In each case a certificate was issued. It appeared that the majority of landlords were not taking advantage of the provisions of the Act with regard to rent increases. In many cases no doubt they could not satisfy the preliminary requirements and in others the possible repercussions may have deterred them. Overcrowding Little statutory overcrowding has come to the notice of the department, although there have been a few cases. Such cases, where the people concerned are housing applicants, are given special consideration in the Council's housing points scheme. Moveable Dwellings Public health control of moveable dwellings in the area is effected by means of Section 345 of the Middlesex County Council Act as amended by the 1950 Act and by byelaws. The consent of the Council is required to the placing or keeping of any moveable dwelling used or intended to be used as the sole or principal means of habitation for more than three months in any year. During the year twelve applications for consent were received, five were refused and limited consents given in the other seven cases. Very little trouble was experienced with the wandering gypsy. Much of the land previously camped upon by these people has now either been built upon or enclosed and is no longer available to them. Shops All shops were regularly inspected, the department administering the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. Licences for the keeping of pet shops were granted in two instances. 13 Three shops were licensed to deal in game. The " late day " for the general closing hours of shops in the area is Friday, but shopkeepers remain free to fix their own half day closing subject to the provisions of the Shops Act. Most shops close for half day on Wednesday. Food Premises All types of food premises were inspected regularly and as frequently as possible, special attention being given to catering, establishments, premises registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, bakehouses and other places where food is actually prepared. There have been some unavoidable breaks in the routine visiting due to staff shortages and this is to be regretted as it is plainly noticeable in some premises that the standard achieved tends to deteriorate in such circumstances. There is still a very great deal of work to be done before food handling methods and practices can be considered really satisfactory, but an increasing number of traders are aware of the need for hygienic conditions and try to achieve them. Some maintain a very good standard. Food premises in the district consist of the following:— Catering establishments including factory canteens and school kitchens 113 Fruit canning factory 1 Grocery and provision shops and "general stores" 60 Greengrocers' shops 34 Butchers' shops 23 Bakers' shops 16 Milk shops 5 Fishmongers' shops 13 Sweet and confectionery shops 46 Food Preparing Premises Two premises were registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 as premises where food was to be preserved. In one case it was a butcher's shop registered for the purpose of sausage manufacture, and in the other a canning factory where fruits, vegetables, etc., were preserved. 14 At the end of the year there were 31 premises which had been registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows:— Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc 12 Premises used for the cooking of fish 9 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Premises used for the canning, etc., of fruits and vegetables 1 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicle, etc., who are not the occupiers of an open shop for the sale of foodstuffs require to be registered with the local authority and the foodstores at which the foodstuffs intended for sale are stored are also required to be registered. Attention is constantly given to traders in foodstuffs elsewhere than at shops. Many of these businesses are comparatively short lived so that new hawkers of foodstuffs are always being found. In most cases they commence trading without being registered and with little regard for the hygiene of food handling. During the year six hawkers of foodstuffs were registered. Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from a fixed site in any public street are required to hold a licence under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944 and issued by the local authority. During the year one renewal licence was granted. Slaughter-Houses Prior to the end of meat rationing and the lifting of restrictions on slaughtering in July the Public Health Committee considered what provision would be required with a view to maintaining an uninterrupted supply of meat. Enquiries were made of the local butchers, pig keepers and slaughter-house keepers but there appeared to be little demand for additional slaughtering facilities. As events have turned out there has been no increase in slaughtering and owners of disused slaughter-houses have not applied to bring them back in use. One application in respect of a proposed new slaughter-house was refused. No. of slaughter-houses licensed 3 No. of slaughtermen licensed 13 15 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Carcases examined at Slaughter-houses Beasts Calves Lambs Pigs Horses Goats No. killed 2 3 — 33 118 — No. Inspected 2 3 — 33 118 — Diseases excluding Tuberculosis Beasts Calves Lambs Pigs Horses Goats Whole carcase condemned Carcases of which some part or organ condemned Percentage affected with disease other than tuberculosis - - - - - - 1 — — 1 26 — 50 — — 3.3 22.03 — Tuberculosis only Beasts Calves Lambs Pigs Horses Goats Whole carcase condemned Carcases of which some part or organ condemned Percentage affected with tuberculosis - - - - - - — — — 1 — — 3.3 Meat Inspected at Butchers' Shops A number of carcases, quarters, parts of carcases and organs have been examined.

Syrup 1 lb 17 Disposal of Condemned Food Where possible condemned foodstuffs are sent to a waste products factory where they are processed for non-edible purposes. Foodstuffs which are not suitable for such disposal are buried at the Council's refuse tip. Food and Drugs Act, 1938—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district. The Public Control Department carry out the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 operated by the County Council and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of that Department for the following figures of samples taken in this district:— Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 135 26 Butter 5 — Cakes 8 — Cheese 2 — Coffee and Chicory Essence 3 — Cooked Meat 1 — Cornflour 1 — Cream 5 — Drugs 4 — Dried Fruit 1 — Fish (various) 9 — Fish Paste 1 — Glace Cherries 1 — Ice Cream 1 — Jam 2 — Liver 4 — Marzipan 1 — Meat Paste 1 — Margarine 2 — Minced Meat 2 — Mint Sauce 1 — Marmalade 2 — Non-brewed Condiment 4 1 Pepper 1 — Pickles 4 — Sausages 1 — Sweets 4 — Vanilla Essence 1 — Victoria Plums 3 — Vinegar 11 — Wines and Spirits 8 - Totals 229 27 18 Action was taken upon the unsatisfactory samples but prosecutions were not necessitated. Twelve inspections were made of milk processing plant and 76 samples of pasteurised milk were submitted for examination and found to be satisfactory. 62 premises were visited in connection with the Department's duties under the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887—1927 and 25 premises in connection with the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Milk (Special Designations), (Raw Milk) and (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 The number of dealers licences granted to sell graded milks is as follows:— Tuberculin Tested 7 Accredited - Pasteurised 7 Sterilised 17 Supplementary Licences:— Tuberculin Tested 12 Accredited - Pasteurised 11 Sterilised 12 30 samples of graded milks were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. All the samples were satisfactory. There are two registered dairies in the area. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continued to receive attention. There were no registered manufacturers of ice cream in the area. 14 samples were procured and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. Nine were graded Group I, 2 Group II and 3 Group III. With these last ones investigations were made at the place of manufacture by the local authorities concerned with satisfactory results. Two premises were registered, under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for the sale of ice cream. 19 Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was continued, although great difficulties were encountered for a large part of the year due to statf shortage. The Council's refuse tip was kept under observation and any sign of rat activity deal with immediately. During the twelve months ended on the 31st March, 1955, the complaints received of infestations numbered 191, and these together with cases discovered by members of the staff involved the inspection of 835 premises. Rat infestations were found at 155 premises and mice infestations at 51 premises. Of these 166 treatments were undertaken by the department, the remaining 40 being carried out by the occupiers. When treatments are carried out by this department on behalf of the occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings is made in the case of private dwellings, and the full cost of the treatment is recovered in the case of business premises. Where the occupiers elect to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision is given to ensure that the treatment is effective. Arrangements were continued with the Middlesex County Council for this department to carry out any rodent control works necessary on the portions of the Duke of Northumberland's River and the River Crane in the area. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are two premises registered under this Act, where filling materials are used. Four inspections were made. Disinfestation Five premises were found to be infested with bed bugs and were disinfested : Council houses infested 1 Other houses infested 4 The method of disinfestation normally employed was spraying with contact insecticides incorporating D.D.T., and this work was carried out by the department. 20 The furniture, etc., of prospective Council house tenants is inspected before removal to the Council's houses and if necessary is treated for the eradication of bugs. Disinfestation for the eradication of the following vermin was carried out at the numbers of premises stated:— Cockroaches 4. fleas 2. carpet beetles 1. In addition 20 wasps' nests were destroyed. Infectious Diseases—Disinfection The following numbers of premises have been disinfected after cases (or suspected cases) of infectious disease:— Tuberculosis 22 Scarlet Fever 59 Cancer 1 Meningitis 1 Total 83 Administration of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 Part 1 of the Act 1.

Of an establishment of three additional sanitary inspectors, two of the posts were vacant at the end of the year and this position continued into 1955 despite efforts to fill them. The department was without a rodent operative for some time but that post was eventually filled. In a small department such vacancies inevitably break the continuity of some of the work to its detriment. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee and the Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Woods, for the consideration shown to me, and the members of the staff for their support in carrying out the work of the department. FRANCIS V. BELL, Chief Sanitary Inspector.
