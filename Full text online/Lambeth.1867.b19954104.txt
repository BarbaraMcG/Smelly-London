The Works and Improvements referred to, are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage and Street, and House Drainage, &c., at page 4; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 6; Lighting Matters at page 8; and Sanitary Matters at page 10. The Report also contains an Account in abstract, showing the Receipt and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year ended at Lady-day last; also a summary Statement of all Contracts entered into, and of Monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These accounts have been duly audited, and allowed by the Auditors, elected by the Parishioners. For the purpose of efficient publication, an abstract Account, of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board, from the 1st day of April, 1867, to 31st day of March, 1868, is set forth at pages 34 and 35.

Flushing and Cleansing have been carried out as before, and the Sewers under the charge of the Vestry are in as clear condition as existing circumstances will permit. The progress of the Main Drainage Works causes temporary difficulty and inconvenience, but their completion will, it is hoped, afford improved outfalls, and enable the sewers to be kept free from deposit. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects, have been promptly examined and remedied as far as possible, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. The House Drainage has been constructed where new Sewers have been made, generally without notice being served upon the owners, applications have been made for the drainage of 1385 houses, upon which above £2,600 has been paid into the Office. The estimated cost of private work done by applicants is £9,600, which has been executed under the inspection and general supervison of the Officers of the Vestry. New Buildings. The Vestry have received notice for building 876 new houses, the drainage of which, and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the Sewers, have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. 108 Applications made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred to the Vestry and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board of Works has been given for the formation of 21 New Streets. 6 STATEMENT OF NEW WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS, Carried out under the direction of the General Purposes Committee, during the year ending the 25th March, 1868.

In the past year 62 memorials and applications have been received for improved lighting in various parts of the Parish; 47 of which were acceded to by the erection of new lamps or removals, and 15 were refused. There have been 83 new lamps erected, and 18 removed to positions, which increased their utility. The total number of lamps lighted by the Vestry, is 2586; and the cost of lighting for the year ending the 25th of March, 1868, including the erection of new columns, removals, and other expenses, amounts to £10,956 2s. 6d. The Chemical Examiner has made frequent periodical experiments with the Photometer, and his monthly reports have shewn that the illuminating power and purity of the gas supplied by the Companies, have been up to the Standard which they are bound to supply; although, in the case of the Phœnix Gas, from the Works at Bankside, also that of the Crystal Palace District Company, ammonia in small quantities is frequently found to be present; as will be seen by the following tabular statement furnished by the Examiner:— 9 RESULT OF 2,310 OBSERVATIONS OF THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THE GAS Made on 127 occasions, during the Year 1867.

The number of births registered in the year 1867 amounted to 7,387 exceeding those in 1864 by 948; those in 1865 by 535; and those in 1866 by 314. The births in the first quarter of the year were 2,001; in the second quarter 1,832; in the third quarter 1,747; and in the last quarter of the year 1,807. The births exceeded the total number of deaths recorded during the year by 3,334, an excess of births over deaths not previously known. The deaths recorded during 1867 were 4,053, being 182 less than in 1864 ; 44 less than in 1865 ; and 116 less than in 1866. In the first quarter of the year the deaths numbered 1,165; in the second quarter 870; in the third quarter 932; and in the fourth quarter 1,086. The births and deaths during each quarter of the year, in each of the Eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish, are shown in Table II. In the Waterloo Road, 1st part district, there were 11 597 births, and 313 deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part district, 999 births, and 469 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 1st part district, 812 births, and 420 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district, 1,407 births, and 1,033 deaths, 390 of which occurred in the Workhouse; in the Kennington 1st part district, 1,424 births, and 769 deaths; in the Kennington 2nd part district, 851 births, and 430 deaths; in the Brixton district 899 births, and 424 deaths; and in the Norwood district, 398 births, and 195 deaths, 40 of which occurred in the Children's Workhouse. The death rate of the Parish of Lambeth has for a series of years contrasted very favourably with that of the entire metropolis. In the year 1867 the respective death rates very nearly corresponded, owing to an extraordinary low death rate having prevailed in London, in which the deaths were nearly 10,000 less than in the previous year. The comprehensive mortality of Lambeth, the entire metropolis, and the South District, of which Lambeth forms a part, is shown in Table 111, which gives the estimated increased population as well of each of the Divisions of the Parish, upon which the death rate of each is calculated; from which it will be seen that the most healthy districts of Lambeth during 1867, were the Norwood, Brixton, Waterloo Road, 1st part, Kennington, 2nd part, and Lambeth Church, 1st part, districts; the Mortality being in the Norwood district (excluding the Workhouse) at the rate of 157 per 10,000 of the estimated population; in the Brixton district 177; in the Waterloo Road, 1st part, 195; in the Kennington, 2nd part district, 200; and in the Lambeth Church, 1st put, 202 per 10,000 of the population; in the other three Districts, viz:—the Kennington, 1st part; the Waterloo Road, 2nd part; and the Lambeth Church, 2nd part: the Mortality was 218 per 10,000 of the estimated population in the Kennington, 1st part; 219 in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part; and 333 in the Lambeth 12 Church, 2nd part; excluding the Workhouse the death rate of the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district, was 215 instead of 333 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the Norwood district (excluding the Children's Workhouse) one person out of 61 living died during the year; in the Brixton district one out of 56; in the Waterloo Road, 1st part, one out of 51; in the Kennington, 2nd part, and Lambeth Church, 1st part districts, each, one out of 49; in the Kennington, 1st part, one out of 45; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part, one out of 40; and in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part, one out of 29, or, excluding the Workhouse, one out of 45 living. The deaths from Epidemic diseases during 1867 are shown in Table IV., they amounted to 716, and were in the proportion of only 17½ per cent. of the Mortality from all causes. In the two preceding years they formed 21¼ per cent., and in 1863 and 1864, 23½ and 22 per cent. of the entire Mortality. There was a diminution from the usual annual Mortality in nearly all the Epidemic diseases, except Small Pox, which was prevalent during part of the year, particularly in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district. The number of deaths from Diarrhœa were 175, and from Choleraic Diarrhœa 11; Whooping Cough 121; Fever, including Typhus, 118; Measles 98; Scarlatina 82; Small Pox 80; and Diptheria 31. In Table I. is shown the number and nature of Nuisances brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, with the results and Sanitary Improvements effected. The number of Nuisances removed or abated, and Sanitary Improvement effected, amounted to 3,766, comprising 586 unwholesome houses cleansed or whitewashed; 554 houses with bad drainage improved; 476 drain obstructions removed; 247 cesspools emptied or abolished; 97 gullies and 18 foul urinals cleansed; 87 offensive smells, from trades, &c., abated; 45 lots of swine, consisting of 213 pigs, removed; 773 accumulations of dust, dung, 13 or garbage, removed; 188 new ashpits or dustbins erected; 201 houses provided with a proper water supply; 90 water receptacles cleansed; 198 houses provided with means of ventilation; 85 dilapidated houses repaired; 65 dangerous structures attended to; 46 yards cleansed or improved; and 10 lots of unwholesome food seized, conveyed to the Police Courts, and afterwards destroyed. There were also 229 bake-houses, 115 slaughter-houses, and 93 cow-houses inspected and white-washed several times. Before the completion of the above works 645 notices were required to be served, and 25 summonses were heard at the Lambeth and Southwark Police Courts. It is estimated that nearly 12,000 visits were paid by the Inspectors during the year. The diseased or unwholesome fish and meat destroyed during the twelve months consisted of 57 carcases of diseased sheep and lambs, weighing 13cwt. 3qrs. 141bs., and 43 dozen plaice, &c., weighing about 5cwt. Three applications for licenses for slaughterhouses were opposed at the Newington Sessions and refused. Several licenses for cow-houses were discontinued, and one new application granted. An inspection was made of bake-houses during the night, to ascertain whether boys were employed at night, contrary to the bake-houses regulation act; at two places boys were found so employed, summonses were taken out in consequence, and fines inflicted. I remain, Your obedient servant, GEORGE PUCKLE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
