Franks Medical officer of Health Council Officer, Old Station Road, loughton, Essex. Tel: Loughton 3871. To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council. THE CHAIRMAN, MADAM AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1960, which includes the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. It is fitting for me to refer here to the retirement during the year of Mr. W.H. Digweed from the post of Chief Public Health Inspector. The Council and the people of the District owe him a great debt of gratitude for his loyal and painstaking services over a period of 25 years of Public Service, during which he instigated and pursued many improvements affecting the health and welfare of the general public, and became a beloved and respected figure. Almost from the moment of his retirement, Mr. Digweed has regrettably suffered grievous illness, and I know you will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery and a long and happy retirement with good health in the future. The Council is fortunate to have, as Mr. Digweed's successor, Mr. G. Holmes, who came to you from the post of Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector in Swindon, and whose first Annual Report to you is here, included with my own report, Mr. Holmes is, I know, already assured of your full support, and you will join with me in wishing him a long and happy period of office. The opening of the new Essex County Council Health Services Clinic in The Drive, Loughton, was a noteworthy occasion of the year. The clinic has provided a very welcome extension to the amenities of the District, and is being increasingly used and appreciated, VITAL STATISTICS. The birth-rate continued almost unchanged at the comparatively low figure of 11.6 per thousand of the population, after applying the correction factor of 0.92 to allow for a slight predominance of females of child-bearing age in the local population, relative to the national "standard population". The small rise in the overall death-rate noted in the previous year (due to more deaths from diseases of the heart and circulation and bronchitis) was not repeated, though deaths from cancer were slightly more. Although deaths from motor vehicle accidents increased from 6 to 8, there was a very welcome decrease in other accidental deaths, from 9 to 4. 3 of these were aged 83, 83 and 85, respectively, and the remaining one was a man of 27, who died by drowning, so that no fatal home accidents occurred to children, compared with 6 in the previous year. This is encouraging evidence that the intensive "home safety" propaganda, both national and local, is proving effective. /INFECTIOUS 2 INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Infectious illnesses throughout the year were of a mild nature, and there were no notified cases of poliomyelitis or diphtheria. The mild form of infective diarrhoea known as "Sonne Dysentery", which has been prevalent among children throughout the country in recent years, caused a good deal of anxiety to parents and teachers at several schools, and numerous investigations and visits were made by the department in efforts to limit the spread of the disease. Authorities everywhere are finding control of this infection to be extremely difficult because most of the cases are so mild and short in duration that they go undetected or are not reported, though they are highly infectious. As has been said many times before, a high standard of personal hygiene is the only way of breaking the chain of infection and the t raining of young children and all who handle foodstuffs to wash their hands thoroughly after every visit to the toilet, is the most important single measure likely to achieve success. Whilst not wishing to make light of the discomforts of this disease, I feel that many parents and teachers become unduly alarmed because of the use of the word "Dysentery", which has associations with a much more serious and often fatal complaint oocurring under tropical, wartime and other adverse conditions. Although both diseases are caused by germs of similar appearance and cultural characteristics (i.e., types of the Bacillus Dysenteriae), Sonne Dysentery should be regarded from the practical point of view with no greater degree of importance than the common cold or chicken pox. PUBLIC HEALTH (INFECTIOUS DISEASES) REGULATIONS. 1953. 2 persons who were required under the above Regulations to suspend their employment as food-handlers in order to prevent the risk of spread of food-borne infections, were compensated by the Council for loss of earnings amounting to £l6.4.0d., and £26.1.4d., respectively. MASS X-RAY, Mass Radiography Unit 6A operated at five locations in the District during the last two weeks of May by arrangement with the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. A detailed analysis of the response and results is given in the tables on page nine of the report, from which it will be seen that a total of 3,365 persons attended either individually or in organised groups, in addition to 364 at a special visit of the Unit to Messrs W. & C. French Ltd. The Direotor of the Unit reports as follows:- /"Dear 3 "Dear Dr. Franks, Herewith the final figures of the Loughton Mass Radiography Survey which took place last year. You will see that we visited five separate centres but that we had very few cases (12) referred by General Practitioners; in any survey this is always a variable figure but I have been often very disappointed in the very poor response in spite of reasonable advertisement. As far as the total number X-rayed is concerned it is really quite good for a period of only two weeks; you will see that a total of nine cases were discovered which can be classified as significant tuberculosis, that is, those requiring immediate treatment or close clinic supervision. This gives a rate of 2.7 per 1,000 which is relatively high compared with the overall figure for England and Wales which is given as 1.9 in the last report of the Chief Medical Officer, 1959. The figures are small of course and may not have any very definite significance. Of the nine significant cases six were in the group requiring immediate treaiment and of these four were sputum positive; two were negative and the remaining three cases are in the group requiring close clinic supervision. Two of the nine cases live outside the Loughton area but all the remainder live in the Debden Estate; two of these were positive, the other two positive being those living outside. Yours sincerely, Signed: HUGH RAMSAY,M.D. Medical Director." In addition to the 9 cases of tuberculosis requiring treatment or supervision, 20 other abnormalities were discovered, and referred for treatment or supervision, as necessary. SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT. 1951. Of the 6 cases kept under observation during the year, 2 died, and 2 were admitted to hospital; the 2 remaining cases have been kept under observation at home with a view to further action, if necessary. /LEGISLATION 4 LEGISLATION ENACTED IN 1960. The following new legislation affecting the work of the Department became operative during the year:- Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960. Caravan Sites (Licence Application) Order, 1960. Fluorine in Food Regulations, 1959. Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960. Meat (Staining and Sterilisation) Regulations, 1960. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. Noise Abatement Act, 1960. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. For the statistical information which the Area and Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

The practice of inviting parents of all infants about to have their first routine medical inspection to give consent to their child participating in this scheme was continued. Participation involves no more than giving the child a simple test and the purpose of the scheme is to trace, through the child, the source of a tuberculous infection in the family or other person with whom the child has been in contact and may not be aware of the condition. As in previous years, a fairly high response was obtained and 69% of the children were tested as follows:- Number to whom offered: 643 Number tested and percentage 436 (67.80) Number positive 5 (3 known contacts) VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION SCHEMES: 1. Tuberculosis (B.C.G.) Vaccination against tuberculosis was offered under the school health service, to all children aged 13 years. The acceptance rate of this offer was 74.76%. Number of school children to whom B.C.G. Vaccination was offered 741 Number of school children undergoing tuberculin test after parents' consent had been received 558 Positive result 50 Number of school children who received B.C.G. 478 /All 10 All children who gave a positive reaction to the skin test were referred to the ohest clinic for investigation, but in no instance was anything significant discovered. 2. Smallpox. 600 primary vaccinations were performed and 223 persons were re-vaccinated during the year. 3. Diphtheria. 767 children completed a course of diphtheria immunisation during the year, 620 re-inforcing injections were also administered. 4. Whooping Cough. 414 children completed a course of immunisation against whooping dough, 5. Poliomyelitis. 1,024 children completed a course of immunisation against poliomyelitis. Young persons (15 - 25 years) 281 Adults (26-40 years) 1,126 Expectant mothers 212 Third injections 6,836 11 GENERAL PROVISION OP HEALTH SERVICES IN THE DISTRICT.

To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council. THE CHAIRMAN, MADAM AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. I took up my appointment on the 1st July, 1960, and wish to express my thanks to Mr. W.H. Digweed, my predecessor, for his kindness and expert guidance. I also thank Dr. H. Franks, the Medical Officer of Health, who has been unfailing in his encouragement and support, and the source of much valuable advice in the execution of my duties. There has been a major change in office administration. The filing system has been completely re-organised. Subject files have been replaced by premises files so that all matters appertaining to a particular premises are kept together in one file. It seemed an overwhelming task but somehow Miss Warriner and Mrs. Eaglestone, our clerks, have accomplished it, and most expertly. This system should increase the efficiency of the Department as a complete departmental history of each premises is now immediately available. The work of the Public Health Inspectors has also been re-arranged so that each Inspector is now responsible for all duties in the section of the District allotted to him. This system has several advantages over specialisation. The experience of the Inspector becomes more balanced, he has a smaller area to travel and thus economises on time, he gains a more intimate knowledge of the District and most important of all, I am sure that he finds the maximum interest in his work. The Department remains two Inspectors short of establishment. The work of the Inspectors is outlined on pages 18 to 37. It will be seen that housing work has been confined to dealing with disrepair. No unfit houses were included in Clearance Areas and only one was closed. There are poor dwellings in the District but action has been severely restricted by the shortage and high cost of building land. A further embarrassment to the Council is that the majority of these houses are scattered. They have to be dealt with individually and while the Council accepts the responsibility for re-housing the tenants, the land vacated is unsuitable for local authority housing. /It 16 It is probable that many of these substandard houses could be modernised and saved by means of improvement grant, and it is certain that many now deteriorating could be given a new lease of life. Each house thus improved is one less for the Council to provide. The financial saving is even more striking, a maximum of £400 for a Discretionary Grant against £2,500 to £3,000 for a new dwelling. Unfortunately, only a small proportion of applications are in respect of tenanted houses which are the principal problem. It seems necessary to acquaint landlords of the advantages of the schemes by advertising and other means and to encourage them to improve their houses by treating 'life-saving' applications as sympathetically as possible. I would ask the Council to give this suggested course of action their serious consideration. The drainage, sewerage and public cleansing information, on pages 19 and 20, was provided by the Engineer and Surveyor, Mr. R.W. Edwards,A.M.I.C.E.,I.M.I.Mun.E,, and the report on riding establishments on pages 38 and 39 by Mr. H.E. Bywater, M.R.C.V.S.,P.R.S.H. G. HOLMES, M.R.S.H.,M.A.P.H.I. Chief Public Health Inspector. June, 1961. 17 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 1. WATER. The water supply of the District is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board except for one house in the District where it is drawn from a well. This house is in the ownership of the Conservators of Epping Forest and is situated in the forest a long way from the mains supply. The water is piped and has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. The number of houses is 17,743 and the estimated population at mid-year was 63,020. The Metropolitan Water Board take regular and frequent samples of mains water for bacteriological and chemical examination. The re stilts are reported to have been satisfactory. 2. STEMMING BATHS. The District has one public bath, controlled by the London Parochial Charities, at Grange Farm, Chigwell. There are also 5 private baths, 4 of these being at schools and one at the Girl Guides' Camp at Chigwell. The Metropolitan Water Board supply the water to all of these baths. 35 inspections were made during the season and 29 tests of the chlorination treatment were carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. Results were satisfactory. 3. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Kill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area within this District which is under the .jurisdiction of the Essex River Board, Some flooding of fields in the valley occurred in i960 during the exceptionally heavy winter rains# /4. 16 4. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough Lane which were improved in 1938, extended after the war and are now nearing the end of a further stage of improvement. The 4 additional primary sludge digesters are almost complete and with the new detritus tanks should be in operation in the autumn. Improved effluent treatment area and storm water facilities are then due to be tackled. The completion of these improvements is expected to result in a higher standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the River Roding. So far, afair effluent has been maintained generally (except for isolated instances during periods of excessive rain). The Southern Intercepting Outfall Sewer has been laid except for the syphon under the sewer which is due for completion this summer. Storm water disposal difficulties at the old Buckhurst Hill Works have also been dealt with. The small subsidiary works at Millers Lane continues to maintain a good effluent. A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of Wanstead and Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme. Most of the Hainault Estate drains to the sewers of Dagenham District and the Works of that Authority. There are 4 outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. The extra pump was installed in Grange Hill Station during the year and the superstructure of the new Roding Road station (as part of the Southern Outfall Sewer Scheme). The Bradwell Road station is due to have two pumps replaced in 1961. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist, /5. 19 5. CLOSET ACCOMODATION AND CESSPOOLS. Number of Cesspools and. Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 88 Loughton 14 Number of Earth or Chemical Closets in Houses: Chigwell 35 Loughton 2 Premises which have earth closets, chemical closets, cesspools and septic tanks are in areas where no sewer is available. It is intended to connect about 30 premises to the main drainage system when the sewer extensions allowed for in the 1961/1962 expenditure are completed. 6. PUBLIC CLEANSING. Domestic refuse has been collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of 7 covered lorries is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a service of removing bulky articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. Trade refuse has also been collected, a charge related to actual cost being made, but with the definition confined to refuse the character of which is clearly not domestic. Replacement of the previous side-loading vehicles by 12/20 c. yd. "Compressmore" rear-loaders (Pordson chassis) is now complete. Refuse is at present disposed of by controlled tipping at a tip provided by a contractor. Payment to the firm is per load and includes levelling, compacting and covering, a bulldozer and the covering material being provided in the price. The area exposed at any one time is kept to a low minimum and measures are taken against flies and vermin as necessary from time to time. The life of this tip is drawing to a close. Salvage of paper and rags produced sales during the year of 463 tons. Road gullies (in adopted District roads) have been emptied and re-sealed with clean water by machine 3 times during the year by contract. /7. -20- 7. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The Public Health Inspectors made 1,116 enquiries and revisits concerning the following notifications:- Scarlet Fever 85 Food Poisoning 18 Sonne Dysentery 209 29 visits were made to smallpox contacts. Approximately 1,000 of the above enquiries and revisits were in respect of Sonne Dysentery, each case giving the Department much work. Detailed investigations are made, advioe on preventive hygiene is given to the households concerned, specimens are submitted to the Pathological Laboratory at St. Margaret's Hospital, Epping, and follow up specimens are taken until the infection is shown to be cleared up. 9. RODENT CONTROL. 345 complaints of rats and mice infestations were received and a total of 1,745 inspections and treatments was made. Permanent baits are laid on known routes and the District's sewers are also treated. In I960, 205 sewer manholes were baited with Warfarin and there were only 20 'takes' of poisoned bait. These figures are remarkably low and show a high degree of control in the District. This is the result of the excellent work of the Council's rodent operator, Mr, S. Mansfield and Mr. M. Lee, Student Public Health Inspector, whose methods and achievements are praised by the Divisional Pests Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The above staff also dealt with the majority of the 178 blocked drains, 124 insect infestations and 267 wasps nests reported to the Department. The latter, occurring as they do in a relatively short period, create an extreme pressure of work in those months and further credit is due for the prompt attention which was paid to these various complaints. /10. -23- 10. CARAVANS. The Council's duties under the Caravan Site and Control of Development Act, 1960, are being fully complied with in respect of all occupied caravans in the Distriot. The Council issued caravan site licences under the above Act, with appropriate conditions, as follows:- Chigwell: 6 sites 9 caravans Loughton: 1 site 1 caravan Applications for further site licences were still under consideration at the end of the year. Legal proceedings were taken against one site oooupier for permitting his land to be occupied by a caravan used for residential purposes without licence from the Council. A fine of £5, with cost of £3.8.0d., was imposed and the caravan removed. 11. AIR POLLUTION. The measurement of Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide in the atmosphere of the District was continued during the year by means of a daily volumetric apparatus at the Council Offices, and a Lead Dioxide candle sited on the roof of the London County Council Housing Office, Chigwell Lane, Loughton. Details of the average monthly readings are given below:Council Offices: Smoke Milligrammes per 100 cubio metres Sulphur Dioxide Parts per 100 million Highest Average Lowest Highest Average Lowest January 48 23 7 24.9 6.3 2.8 February 60 17 3 13.1 6.6 3.2 March 30 8 4 7.3 3.4 1.1 April 17 6 3 9 3.5 1.6 May 15 6 2 8.6 2.9 1.2 June 6 2 1 5.8 1.7 0.7 July 6 3 2 2.5 1.4 0.6 August 7 5 3 4.7 2.3 1.2 September 7 5 4 3.4 2 0.9 October 15 8 4 6.3 3.7 1.4 November 37 24 34 10.2 6.4 2.3 December 27 22 6 10.2 7.9 4.3 / L.C.C. - 22 - L.C.C.

This is demonstrated by the measurements which show a large increase in air pollution during the winter months when household fires come into use whereas industrial air pollution remains fairly constant throughout the year. It will be interesting to see if there is any significant decrease in air pollution in this District as a result of the Smoke Control areas now being made on some of our boundaries. Prior Approval. Upon application, the Council gave †Prior Approval† for 3 new furnaces under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956. -25- HOUSING STATISTICS 1960. 1. REDEVELOPMENT.

ENFORCEMENT OF STATUTES. In many of the above businesses it was found that the Food Hygiene Regulations and other statutory requirements were not being complied with, and as the first step, the Public Health Inspectors directed their efforts towards improving structural conditions. 107 notices were served, many of them lengthy and necessitating major alterations to premises. In the main, the food traders have been co-operative and the majority of the notices were complied with, resulting in improved hygienic conditions. /In -29- In 4 instances it was decided that legal proceedings for contraventions of the Food. Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 should be instituted and the following brief particulars are given:- Epping 9.12.60 Ice cream van in a dirty condition Defendant convicted. Fined £8 and 2 gns. costs awarded. Epping 3.3.61 Meat ran in a dirty condition Defendant convicted. Fined £10 and 3 gns. costs awarded. Epping 24.3.61 Greengrocer's shop in a dirty condition Defendant was described in the summons as the owner of the shop. He satisfied the Court that he was not the owner and the summons was dismissed on those grounds. Epping 24.3.61 Greengrocer's shop in a dirty condition Summons could not be served as defendant had gone to Portugal for a year. Case adjourned until his return. I am pleased to report that the traders concerned in the above proceedings are now co-operating and their businesses are being carried on in an exemplary manner. It would also appear that the Council's action in the above-mentioned cases has had a wide and salutory effect in the District. Food Hygiene Regulations 1955. Exemption Certificate. The Council being satisfied that certain facilities were conveniently accessible in a nearby premises, issued a Certificate of Exemption under Section 31 of the above Regulations in respect of a greengrocer's permanent stall. The occupier is exempted from the following requirements of the Regulations:- 1. Provision of a supply of water. 2. " " " wash-basin. 3. " " " sink. The Council may withdraw the Certificate if they cease to be satisfied that the above provisions cannot reasonably be required. /3. - 30 - 3.

REGISTRATION OF DAIRIES UNDER MILK & DAIRIES REGULATIONS. 1959. 3 milk distribution depots and 17 milkshops were registered in the District. 7 licences were issued to firms with premises in other areas to sell milk within the District. 5. SLAUGHTERING. 3 slaughterhouses were licensed during the year under Section 62 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955. 2 of these premises were quite unsatisfactory and the occupiers were advised that the cost of meeting the requirements of the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958 and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations, 1958 would be prohibitive. They were finally closed in November, 1960. The Knacker's Yard also closed during the year. The occupier of the remaining slaughterhouse is reconstructing his premises so that it will comply with the above-mentioned Regulations in 1961. Legal proceedings were taken at Epping on 28th April, 1961, against this occupier for offences committed in December, 1960. Convictions were obtained as follows:- Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations 1958. 1. Absence of proper food containers for animals in the lairage Fine £10. 2. Horned cattle in the lairage were not restrained " £10. 3. Refuse deposited in lairage amongst the animals on 10.12.60 " £10. 1+. Refuse deposited in lairage amongst the animals on 11.12.60 " £10. The Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958. 1. Hides not removed from a part of the slaughterhouse where neat was kept " £10. 2. Dirty condition of refuse bins " £10. Costs of 10 gns. were awarded to the Council. - 31 - /Legal Legal proceedings were also taken against 2 slaughterman under The Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1960, one for not wearing head covering and the other for smoking. They were each fined £2 with costs of 1 gn. 584 animals were slaughtered during the year and all were inspected for fitness for human consumption. These animals were completely free from tuberculosis which is a fine testimonial to the work of the Officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. A careful search was made for Cysticercus Bovis in the cattle but none was found. The meat was all of high quality and the total condemnation consisted of 13 diseased organs, all of which were found in the 342 "cattle excluding cows", as designated below. The percentage of the number of this class of cattle, which were inspected and found to be affected with disease other than tuberculosis, is thus 3.8%. Details of the cattle slaughtered are set out below:- Cattle excluding COWS 342 Cows 6 Calves 3 Sheep and Lambs 228 Pigs 5 The following organs were found to be diseased and were Dondemned:- Abscesses Adhesions Fasciolasis Cirrhosis Nephritis Pleurisy Pericarditis 3 livers 1 liver 4 livers 1 liver 2 kidneys 1 pair of lungs 1 heart 40 lbs. 12 " 66 " 14 " 5 " 12 " 6 " 6.

Apple tart 1 Meat pies 4 Bread 2 Milk 14 Chocolates 1 Plums 1 Cornflakes 1 Potatoes 1 Cream 1 Sausages 2 Hamburgers 1 Stuffing 1 Meat 3 Sugar 1 All complaints were investigated and in 13 cases the food was found to be fit for human consumption. In 10 cases no formal action was taken, mainly because of overlong delay in making the complaint or an unsatisfactory statement from the complainant. Legal proceedings were taken on the remaining 11 complaints, each resulting in a conviction. Particulars are given below:- No.10/60 Epping 30.9.60 Rodent excreta in stuffing Fine £10. Costs 25 gns.

(a) Chemical Analysis. 83 samples of foodstuffs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, who reported on these samples, as follows:- Butter 3 Satisfactory Cream 4 " Mikity 1 " Milk 24 " Cheese spread 1 " x " " 1 Unsatisfactory + Cream cheese 1 " Ginger 1 Satisfactory Nutmeg 1 " Mixed spice 1 " White pepper 1 " Sausages 41 " ø " 3 Unsatisfactory x Cheese Spread. Reported to be out of condition and the Council instructed that the Manufacturers be informed. + Cream Cheese (Foreign). Reported to be a superior cheese spread and not a cream cheese. It was also found to be a in a mouldy condition and unsuitable for human consumption. This was not a formal sample and thus no formal action was taken regarding the absence of cream. A letter was sent to the importers concerning the misleading label. Proceedings were authorised in respect of the mould and the case was heard at Epping on 24th February, 1961, where a fine of £2 was imposed. Costs were not allowed. The Defendant appealed, and at a re-hearing at the Quarter Sessions on 28th March, l96l, the case was dismissed with costs against the Council. ø Sausages. The meat content of 3 of the samples was found to be just below the accepted standard. The traders concerned were informed and repeat samples were satisfactory. In 7 cases it was found that preservatives were being used when the Statutory Declaration was not exhibited in the Shop. The Council sent warning letters to the traders concerned and they are now complying. -34- (b) Bacteriological Examination. Ice Cream. Selective sampling was carried out so that, as far as possible, all manufacturers were included. Furthermore, the samples were taken from dealers selling unwrapped ice cream when the risk of contamination is at its highest. 26 samples were taken and 24 were Grade I or II, which is very satisfactory. One was reported as Grade III which is 'fair' and the other was Grade IV, which is unsatisfactory. No faecal coliforms were detected. The dealers selling ice-cream Graded III and IV were visited and instructed in hygienic methods of storage and service. Repeat samples were satisfactory. Other Foods. Only 4 samples were taken. 2 were of salted beef and brine. The result showed that both were bad, proceedings were instituted and convictions obtained. The other 2 were taken in an investigation into food poisoning, but negative results were obtained. - 35 - FACTORIES. SHOPS.PETROLEUM. ETC. 1. SUMMARY OF VISITS AND INSPECTIONS.

The annual report of the Council's Veterinary Officer, Mr. H.E. Bywater, is as follows:- " I have pleasure in reporting upon the inspections of riding establishments made by me in your area during the year ended 31st December, 1960. Inspections were, as usual, made at varying times during each quarter of the year. Some inspections were made at times when it was to be expected that most, or all, of the horses would be in use and others when it was likely that most of the horses would be resting. This enabled one to form judgements both as to the condition of the animals in general and the manner in which the business was conducted. There was rather more than the average number of changes in ownership or management than normal but, on the whole, the general standards have been reasonably satisfactory and any minor suggestions or criticisms which were made were met with a reasonable response. I append a list of the premises inspected, the owner or person in charge and the average number of horses and ponies in each. Signed: H.E.
