The Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, in accordance with Section 189 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, beg to present the following Report of their proceedings, and other matters connected therewith, during the year ended on 25th March, 1897:- Area.—The Parish of Clerkenwell contains 380 acres, about 65 of which are situate in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill. Population.—According to the last census (1896) the population was 66,202. Number of Assessments.—The number of Assessments in the Parish is 8,933. The Rateable Value.—The rateable value for the year, according to the Valuation List in force on 5th April, 1896, was £393,910. Description of Wards—The Parish is divided into five wards, as follows:- Ward No. 1 (Pentonville) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies north of a line drawn from the west boundary of the Parish at Battle Bridge, along the centre of Pentonville Road, B 20 to the east boundary of the Parish at the top of the City Road, thence up High Street and Liverpool Road to Sermon Lane, thence westward (according to the boundary of the Parish) to Caledonian Road, including Nos. 61 to 77 and 68 to 100 in that road, and 6 to 17, Caledonian Crescent, thence to the western boundary at Battle Bridge, and all that portion of the Parish which is situate at or about Muswell Hill. This Ward contains 1,866 assessments, of a rateable value of £75,760 and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 2 (St. Philip's) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of King's Cross Road from Baker Street to Battle Bridge, thence up Pentonville Road to the north-west corner of Claremont Square, thence down Amwell Street and Rosoman Street to Exmouth Street, along Exmouth Street and Mount Pleasant to the boundary, thence along the boundary of the Parish to King's Cross Road, bottom of Baker Street, including nearly the whole of the Parcel Post Office. This Ward contains 1,394 assessments, of a rateable value of £55,403 and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's) comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn along Pentonville Road from the north-west corner of Claremont Square to the junction of City Road and Goswell Road, thence down Goswell Road to the Corner of Spencer Street (including Nos. 290 to 320 on the north-east side of Goswell Road, and Nos. 1 and 30 in Sidney Street), thence along Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Rosoman Street, and Amwell Street, to the north-west corner of Claremont Square, This Ward contains 1,193 21 assessments, of a rateable value of £59,997 and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 4 (St. James') comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn from Goswell Road, along the centre of Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Exmouth Street, Mount Pleasant, to the boundary of the Parish, thence along the line of the Old Fleet Ditch to the new street opposite Clerkenwell Green, and thence along Clerkenwell Green (north side of Sessions House) and Aylesbury Street to St. John Street, thence up the centre of St. John Street to Percival Street, along the centre of Percival Street, and up Goswell Road to Spencer Street. This Ward contains 2,906 assessments, of a rateable value of £115,447, and returns eighteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 5 (St. John's) comprises all that portiou of the Parish which lies south of the southern boundary of Ward 4, bounded on the east by a line drawn along the centre of Goswell Road from Percival Street to Clerkenwell Road, on the west by the Old Fleet Ditch, and on the south by a line drawn from Goswell Road down Clerkenwell Road, thence irregularly, according to the boundary of the Parish, to the Old Fleet Ditch. This Ward contains 1,574 assessments, of a rateable value of £96,909, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Clerkenwell Detached.—With regard to this outlying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— 22 "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Mnswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from London, and on the north-western confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a 'great cure performed upon a King of Scots, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell, a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell.' Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Boe had' a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea Biver." "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initial affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 100 houses and pieces of land in assessment. 23 Election of Vestrymen.—The annual Election of Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts took place on Saturday, May 16th, 1896, when the following members were returned:— WARD No. 1 (PENTONVILLE).

Mr. Alexander Anthony Bellefontaine 52·4, Exmouth Street WARD No. 5 (ST. JOHN'S)· [Number of Electors, 1804. Number voting, 452—25·4 per cent.] Mr. William Pierpoint 240, St. John Street ,, William John Hunter 34, Aylesbury Street „ William Henry Drury 1, St. John's Square ,, James Stephens Knight 4¾, Clerkenwell Close ,, Edward Robert Naylor 27, Great Sutton Street Auditor of Accounts. Mr. William Arthur Fincham 172, St John Street The expenses of the Election amounted to £98 1s. 6d. Mr. Robinson, being returned for two Wards, elected to sit for Ward No. 1, thereby creating a vacancy in Ward No. 2: and owing to the decease of Mr. Evans, representing Ward No. 5, on the 19th May, a vacancy was also created for that Ward. Elections to fill these vacancies took place on Saturday, June 20th, with the following results:— WARD No. 2. Number of Electors, 1,670. Number voting, 379 22·7 per cent. Mr. C. F. Brust 53, Amwell Street. WARD No. 5. Number of Electors, 1,804. Number voting, 713 39·5 per cent. Mr. Evan Jones, M.R.C.S. 89, Goswell Road. The expenses of these elections amounted to £36 8s. 25 Further vacancies had been created at the close of the year by the decease of Mr. Putnam and Mr. R. D. Lyons, and by the resignation of Mr. E. M. Baker, to be filled at the ordinary election in May, 1897. Decease of Members.—The Vestry regret to record the deaths during the year of Mr. Alfred Evans on the 19th May, of Mr. R. D. Lyons on the 19th November, and of Mr. H. G. Putnam on 4th December. Votes of condolence were passed with the families of the deceased gentlemen. Yotes of Condolence.—The Vestry also regret to record the decease on the 27th November of Mr. E. J. Thompson, one of the first members of the Vestry, elected in 1856, and for many years the representative of the parish at the Metropolitan Board of Works. Mr. Thompson had ceased to take an active part in the business of the parish, owing to his removal from the neighbourhood, but he always manifested the greatest interest in all that concerned Clerkenwell, and his death removes a personality to whom the parish was much indebted. The death on the 5th June, 1896, of the Rev. A. Styleman Herring, for many years the vicar of St. Paul's, Allen Street, has removed another of those who have laboured hard for the welfare of the parish, and the Vestry recorded their regret at his decease. Another benefactor to Clerkenwell has passed away during the year in the person of Mr. C. C, Walker of Lillieshall Old Hall, Shropshire. It was due to his munificence that Wilmington and 26 Northampton Square were laid out for the use of the public, and a vote of regret was placed upon the minutes of the Vestry. Meetings.—Under the Bye-laws of the Vestry, Standing Committees are appointed at the first Meeting of the Vestry after the Annual Elections, and Special Committees are appointed from time to time to deal with special questions, and it is at the Meetings of these Committees that a very large quantity of the detail work of the Vestry is carried out. The following statement shows the number of Meetings held by the Vestry and the various Committees during the year, and will also show the parishioners that the administration of their local affairs is no light task, but is one which entails considerable labour on those who come forward to take part in the municipal work of the Parish:— Vestry44 Works Committee 60 Wharf Committee 4 Joint Works and Public Health Committee 1 Works Sub-Committee Public Health Committee 31 Public Health Sub-Committee 4 Valuation Committee 15 Finance Committee 13 Finance Sub-Committee 1 Law and Parliamentary Committee 5 Town Hall Committee 6 Town Hall Sub-Committee 2 Petty Sessions 8 Baths and Washhouses Committee 2 Bye-laws Committee 5 Special Committees 5 196 27 Rates.—During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the Half-year to Michaelmas, 1896. A Poor Rate of 1s. 10d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £34,100 A Sewer Rate of 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,550 A Lighting Rate 1d. „ „ „ 1,550 A General Rate 1s. 0d. ,, ,, „ 18,600 3s. 0d. £55,800 For the Half-year to Lady-day, 1897.

The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £32,692 in the first, and £29,771 in the second half-year, total £62,463. The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £4757 17s. 8d. and £2,362 7s. 3d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union included the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works 28 were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £24,619 7s. 4d., divided into portions of £12,309 13s. 8d. in the first, and £12,309 13s. 8d. in the second half-year. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, it receives from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with two-fifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants formerly paid from the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payment of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day, for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the later amount for the year ending Lady-day, 1896, is £7,886, the amount being based on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £8,206 9s. 2d., collected as part of the Poor Rate. The Library Commissioners precept at 1d. in the £ amounted to £1,590, and the cost of Registration 29 of Voters, Collection of the Poor Rate, and other matters under the control of the Guardians or Governors of the Poor amounted to £1430, which, added to the sums above-mentioned, made the Poor Rate precepts as sent by that Board to the Vestry £65,861, to meet which and a deficiency in the previous rate the Poor Rate of £65,900 was levied. The precept of the School Board for the year 1896 amounted to the sum of £19,871 8s. 11d., which is collected as part of the General Rate. It will thus be seen that of the £114,630 raised during the year, the sum of £83,420 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 6s. 1d. in the pound for the year, 4s. 5d. was for other bodies, and 1s. 8d. for the local administration paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1180 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 27 committal warrants per quarter were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who 30 set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied; and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 12 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year dealing with 224 assessments, and increasing the rateable value by £7,739.

London (Equalization ot Rates) Act.—The principle of the Act is that a rate of 6d. in the pound per annum forms the Equalization Fund; the parishes contributing according to their rateable value, and receiving according to their population; parishes of a high rateable value and a small population having therefore to contribute to the fund, while those of a low rateable value and a large population receive a grant from it. The net amount received from the fund by the Parish of Clerkenwell for the year ending 31st March, 1897, was £3,417 19s. 9d. Collection of the Rates.—Of the Rates made in the Parish of Clerkenwell, a percentage of about 93½ is actually collected, 6½ per cent. being irrecoverable from allowances to owners who compound, empty houses, runs, and excusals on the ground of poverty. It follows therefore that when the Parish is called upon to satisfy the precept of some central body, such as the County Council or the School Board, which is stated to be at the rate of say 1s. in the pound, an actual rate of nearly 13d. must be made to produce the amount required. Rates Raised in 1895-6.—The Vestry have been furnished with a return by the London County Council, showing the amount in the pound of all rates raised in the County of London for the year 34 ending 31st March, 1896, distinguishing the rates raised for county and for parish purposes, and of rates raised in the principal boroughs and parishes in the immediate neighbourhood of London. The return shows the central rates at 4s. 0·875d. in the pound, and the total rates of the various parishes ranged from 4s. 9d. in St. James, Westminster, to 8s. 5d. at Rotherhithe; Clerkenwell with rates amounting to 6s. 2d. in the pound, standing very favourably on the list, 48 parishes having rates higher, and only 26 rates lower. Parliamentary Representation. The Parish of Clerkenwell forms the Central Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Finsbury, and is represented in Parliament by the Hon. W. F. B. MasseyMainwaring. The vestry feel that it is desirable and necessary that the representative of Clerkenwell should become acquainted with the local requirements, and be in close communication with the local authority, and therefore the Member for the Division is invited to be present at the meetings of the Vestry whenever he can attend, and the minutes, agenda notices, and other papers issued to the Vestrymen are sent to him.

Murray & Co.'s and Messrs. Condy and Mitchell's, and enclosed by gates, is public way. The circumstances of the enclosure are detailed in the report for the year ended 25th March, 1890. Plumber's Place.—It is also to be noted that this public way runs through the courtyard of Northampton Buildings, the boundaries of such public way being defined by narrow iron rails fixed in the paving. Owen's Row.—The Vestry, when removing the posts from the eastern end of Owen's Row, ordered a bar to be fixed, so that the right of closing same to vehicular traffic might be preserved. No complaint reached the Vestry of any nuisance arising from the street being opened, but it was found that the bar was sometimes unlocked and placed across the roadway. In consequence of this being done, an accident happened to a bicyclist at night, and the Vestry decided to remove the bar altogether. Fines for Adulteration.—The Vestry have drawn attention to the very small fines inflicted by the Police Magistrate in some of the cases of adulteration, and have caused a communication to be made to the Home Secretary and the Local Government Board, urging that some effective means may be adopted to prevent what is practically an encouragement of adulteration, and to the Member of Parliament for the Division, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, asking them to support same. 44 Summary Proceedings.—During the year Summonses have been issued at the instance of the Vestry and heard by the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court in respect of the following offences:— No. of Summonses issued. Offences charged. Convict ions. Dismissals. Penalties and Costs. £ s. d. 2 Neglecting to unstop and amend drain l 1 wthdn. 2 2 0 1 Neglecting to repair defective w.c. l 1 2 0 Defective drains 9 Neglecting to provide sufficient w.c. accommodation 9 17 8 0 4 Constructing w.c.contrary to bye-laws 4 4 10 0 3 Neglecting to pay costs incurred in removing refuse from house 2 1 wthdn. 1 8 0 4 Failing to repair defective paving 3 1 wthdn. 3 6 0 3 Failing to supply a water supply to w.c. 2 1 dismsd. 4 4 0 1 Failing to alter and amend defective soilpipes 1 0 12 0 1 Neglecting to provide dustbin 1 0 17 6 4 Ditto to make houses habitable 4 2 16 6 4 Exposing margarine for sale unlabelled 4 8 13 0 4 Selling margarine in an unstamped paper 4 8 5 6 49 Adulterated articles 44 3 wtdwn. 2 dismsd. 46 2 6 2 Failing to abate a nuisance 2 1 13 0 1 Neglecting to cleanse cistern 1 0 12 6 1 Allowing a kitchen to be illegally occupied 1 2 3 0 2 Exposing child in public place whilst suffering from infectious disease . 2 4 4 0 1 Keeping fowls in basement in an insanitary condition 1 0 7 0 1 Conveying offensive matter through the streets in prohibited hours 1 2 2 0 1 Obstructing thoroughfare 1 0 5 0 1 Placing goods on footway 1 0 5 0 3 Depositing goods on carriageway 2 1 1 1 0 3 Depositing refuse on public way 3 0 14 0 105 95 10 114 13 0 45 Sale of Food and Drugs Act.—The Vestry again draw attention to the fact that they have made arrangements for the analysis of private purchasers' samples of food and drugs, and have decided that any resident of the Parish (traders excepted) shall be allowed, upon payment of 2s. 6d., to bring to the Vestry any article of food or drugs purchased or delivered in the Parish, for the purpose of being tested by the public Analyst. Should the sample submitted prove to be adulterated, the report will be handed over to the Inspector of the district, with the name and address of the seller, for the purpose of his taking samples in conformity with the Act, and if in that case the sample be found to be adulterated, the 2s. 6d. deposited by the person bringing the sample will be returned to him. The rale has been printed on the back of the ratepapers, but up to the present time little advantage has been taken of the arrangement by the parishioners. Projections over Public Way.—A letter has been received from the County Council, stating that they are considering the advisability or otherwise of their making bye-laws under sec. 164 of the London Building Act, 1894, for the regulation of the size and height of lamps, signs, or other structures overhanging the public way, and asking for the opinion of the Vestry upon the subject. The enforcement of such bye-laws would be the duty of the local authorities, and the Council have been informed that the Vestry is in favour of such byelaws being made. Chapel Street.—The attention of the Vestry has been drawn to the great increase in the Sunday trading which has taken place in Chapel Street, and to the fact that it was prolonged until late in 46 the afternoon, to the discomfort and annoyance of a large number of inhabitants of the street and neighbourhood. The Vestry therefore gave notice in tbe street that after the second Sunday in August, 1896, trading on the public way would be stopped at noon, and the co-operation of the police was requested in carrying out this regulation. The rule has been enforced with very little difficulty, and the nuisance complained of by the inhabitants done away with. Costermongers.—A letter has been received from the Wandsworth District Board of Works stating the steps they have taken to endeavour to deal with the annoyance and obstruction caused by costermongers, and expressing the opinion that local authorities in London should be empowered to make bye-laws regulating the standing of costermongers in the streets. The Vestry agreed with the views expressed in such communication. Street Noises, &c.—The Vestry have had before them letters from the County Council asking the opinion of the Vestry as to the desirability of the Council making bye-laws to suppress nuisances from noise arising from shouting to sell goods, shooting galleries, roundabouts and steam organs, and also as to requiring vehicles to carry lights after sunset; and from the Paddington Vestry, expressing the opinion that, having regard to the varying conditions and requirements of different parts of the Metropolis, the Vestries and District Boards should have the power, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, of making such bye-laws. On the question of street shouting the Council has received a letter from the Home Secretary 47 expressing the opinion that a lye-law which is in force in Liverpool and many other places in the kingdom, in the following form, would be a valid one if adopted by the Council:—"No person shall, "for the purpose of hawking, selling or distributing "any newspaper or other article, shout, or use any "bell, gong, or noisy instrument in such a manner "as to cause nuisance or annoyance to the residents "or passengers," and such bye law, if made, would be enforced by the police. The Home Secretary points out that the requirement that public annoyance must be proved is an important safeguard against the oppressive application of the prohibition, and that it is not likely that Parliament would accept a more stringent provision. The Vestry passed the following resolutions:— (1) That the Council be informed that the Vestry is in favour of such a bye-law being made and applied in the County of London. (2) That the Council be informed that in the opinion of the Vestry it is desirable that powers should be obtained for Vestries and District Boards to make bye-laws to control the nuisance arising from shooting galleries, roundabouts and steam organs. (3) That the Council be informed that in the opinion of the Vestry it is desirable that all vehicles should be required to carry lights after sunset, such requirement being enforced by the Council. (4) That the Council be informed that in the opinion of the Vestry it is desirable that powers should be obtained for Vestries and District Boards to make bye-laws to regulate the keeping of noisy animals. 48 Gambling in the Streets—The Vestry have had their attention called to the prevalence of gambling in the streets of Clerkenwell, especially among youths, and they have written to the Superintendent of Police for the Division asking his assistance to stop the nuisance. Wilmington and Northampton Squares.—With the view to their greater use by the inhabitants, the Vestry decided that during the Summer months (May to October inclusive), Wilmington and Northampton Squares be opened on Sundays at 10 a.m. instead of 2 p.m., but having regard to the fact that the Squares are practically unused on Sundays during the winter months, they ordered that they be closed on Sundays during November, December, January and February. Cab Radius.—The Vestry have received a letter from the Vestry of Putney, in favour of the extension of the present cab' radius to five miles, or, if possible, so as to include the whole of the County of London, and they decided to agree therewith. Fire Alarm.—At the suggestion of the Vestry the County Council have fixed a fire alarm in St. John's Square. Registration of Births and Deaths. Muswell Hill. —A vacancy having occurred in the office of Registrar of Births and Deaths in the district comprising the detached portion of the Parish, the Vestry called the attention of the Registrar General to the inconvenience of the detached portion of the Parish forming part of the Pentonville registration district, and asked him to take advantage of the vacancy to remove such inconvenience, either by making a 49 separate district, or by appointing the Registrar of one of the adjoining districts to perform the duties. He, however, replied stating that whilst Clerkenwell (detached) remains part of the Holborn Union, it must remain part of the Registration district, and that he cannot create it a separate sub-district, as that would cause a considerable expense to the Exchequer, and would create an office the emoluments of which would be under £2 per annum. The Vestry informed him that they regretted his decision. Supply of Minutes to Clubs.—The Vestry have decided that all Social and Political Clubs and Associations of the Parish be supplied with the Minutes of each General Meeting of the Vestry, free of charge, on application for same by their respective Secretaries, provided that such Clubs and Associations shall not have less than fifty bond fide members. Baths and Washhouses.—The Vestry have received a requisition under the Baths and Washhouses Act, signed by twenty-seven ratepayers, to convene a meeting of the Vestry to determine whether the Baths and Washhouses Act shall be adopted for the Parish. Steps were being taken at the close of the year to hold the meeting. Metropolitan Asylums Board.—A letter has been received from the Vestry of Hackney expressing the opinion that the time has arrived when the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be reconstituted, and its members elected directly by the ratepayers; with which this Vestry concurred. 50 School Board Electoral Divisions.—Letters have been received during the year from the Vestries of Hammersmith, Hackney, and Battersea in favour of the School Board electoral divisions being made co-terminous with the Parliamentary electoral divisions, and the Vestry passed a resolution concurring therewith. Retirement of Vestrymen (London) Bill.—A Bill under this title was introduced into the House of Lords in the Session of 1896 by Lord Monkswell. It provided that, on the application of a Vestry, the County Council might order the simultaneous retirement of all the members of the Vestry in the month of May next following the issue of such order, and thereafter in every third year, the full number of Vestrymen being elected at each triennial election. The Vestry presented a petition stating that they prefer the present system of retirement by thirds each year, but suggesting that provision should be made whereby casual vacancies should be filled at the ensuing annual election, and bye-elections be thereby avoided. The Bill however failed to pass into law. Shops (Early Closing) Bill.—In April, 1896, a letter was read from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, calling attention to the proposal that the "local authority" for the purposes of the Shops (Early Closing) Bill shall be, as regards the Metropolis, the London County Council; and urging that the local governing bodies of the different districts are more likely to have an accurate knowledge of the requirements of the several localities, and should therefore be substituted for the County Council as the "local authorities," and asking the Vestry's support to the alteration. 51 The Vestry presented a petition against the Bill, stating that they are opposed on principle to the Bill, as being an undue interference with the liberty of the subject, but urging that, in the event of the proposed Bill being proceeded with the local authority and not the County Council should be the controlling authority. The Hon. W. F. B. Massey-Mainwaring, M.P., in writing to say that he had presented the Vestry's petition against the Bill, added that his own opinion accorded with that of the Vestry on the question. The Bill failed to pass into law. London Sea-water Supply Bill.—This Bill, introduced into the Session of 1896, duly passed into law, but the Vestry are not aware of any steps being yet taken to give effect to it. Old Street Widening.—A plan has been deposited by the London County Council for widening Old Street at its junction with Goswell Road. It is proposed to widen Goswell Road south of Great Sutton Street, and Old Street nearly to Central Street, to 60 feet respectively, the premises to be acquired being all in the Parish of St. Luke. The Vestry has given its assent to the scheme. Audit of the Vestry's Accounts.—The Vestry has considered the question of the desirability of having its accounts audited by Chartered Accountants, but have come to the conclusion, in which the elected Auditors concur, that the accounts of the Vestry are of a sufficiently simple character to be properly checked by the present system, as the departments and officers check each other to a large degree, and all accounts pass before one or two Committees, vouchers being produced to the Finance Committee and then to the elected 52 Auditors, and that there is no sufficient reason for going to the additional expense which would be incurred. The Vestry has also considered a letter from the Vestry of Hackney, asking the opinion of the Vestry on the desirability of Vestries' accounts being audited by an official auditor, appointed either by the London County Council or the Local Government Board; and also a letter from the Vestry of Hampstead, strongly opposing the proposal, on the ground that an audit by either of those authorities would carry with it a certain financial control, and that the desire of that Vestry is in the direction of greater independeuce rather than the reverse. The Vestry agreed with the views of the Vestry of Hampstead. Drainage of Clerkenwell detached.—The Vestry is happy to be able to record the fact that the longstanding difficulty of the drainage of the detached portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill has at last been satisfactorily settled, and an agreement between Friern Barnet, the London County Council, and Clerkenwell has been signed under which the first-named District will receive the drainage for a period of thirty years, the London County Council laying an outfall sewer and paying a rateable annual contribution during that period, the Vestry adjusting such sewers as may be found necessary. The Vestry desire to place upon record its high appreciation of the services of Mr. Sandeman, who has most ably and energetically contended for the interests of Clerkenwell during the whole of the negotiations; and the Vestry is also indebted to Mr. Walton, the Chairman of the Works Committee, the Clerk and the Surveyor for the large amount of care, time and attention which they have devoted to the settlement of the question. 53 Carriageway of Rosebery Avenue.—It was stated in the last annual report that the Vestrywere in correspondence with the County Council with the view to the Council repairing the road or re-imbursing the Vestry the cost of doing so, having regard to the comparatively short time that it has been open for traffic. In addition to considerable correspondence the Works Committee attended twice before the Improvements Committee as a deputation, and in July reported the receipt of a letter from the Council that they were advised that they had no power to accede to the Vestry's request. The Vestry then decided to repave the road between Garnault Place and Farringdon Road with hardwood but to again ask the Council to contribute to the cost of the work, and in the event of their declining to do so, to apply for a loan for ten years at a reduced rate of interest, and asked Dr. Blake and the Hon. Ashley Ponsonby to support the request. Tenders were duly advertised for, and that of the Improved Wood Paving Company accepted. In the course of the correspondence with the Council attention was called to sec. 11, sub-section 10, of the Local Government Act, 1888, as appearing to empower the Council to assist the Vestry in the matter; and the Council replied, on the 24th February, that in view of the importance of the question raised by the Vestry, and there being some doubt whether the section of the Act referred to really gives power to the Council in the direction indicated, it had been thought well to take the opinion of Counsel, with the result that the Council was advised that it had no power to accede to the request of the Vestry, and this being so, the Council regretted that it was unable to assist the Vestry in the matter. The Vestry thereupon asked the Council for a copy 54 of such opinion, and the matter was at this stage at the close of the year. By Order, E. E. PAGET, Vestry Clerk. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT.

To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, Gentlemen, In presenting my first Annual Report, I may remind you that though my own appointment only dates from September 30th, 1896, I had for the previous seven months acted a substitute for Dr. Griffith, your highly esteemed and respected late Medical Officer of Health. With the exception therefore of the first two months of the year, the facts on which this report is based came under my personal notice. The population of Clerkenwell, according to an enumeration made at the end of the first quarter in 1896, is 66,202. At the Census of 1891, it was returned as 66,216, so that for the past five years it has been practically stationary, the only difference being a loss of 14. In the previous inter-Census period, that between 1881 and 1891, there had been a somewhat rapid fall, the figures being in 1881, 69,019, and in 1891, 66,216, a loss of 2,803 in ten years. The past five years show therefore at least a temporary check to the diminution of population. The number of deaths from all causes registered in Clerkenwell during the year 1896, was 923. In 1895, the number was 1,038, and the annual average for the last ten years is 1,084, 104 so that the deaths are respectively 115 less than last year, and 161 less than the average. This intra-parochial mortality calculated on a population of 66,202, amounts to 13•9 per 1,000, while the mortality of the year before was 15•6 per 1,000. The births registered in the district during 1896, were 2,223. Compared with 1895, they show an excess of 140, and with the average of the past ten years, an excess of 19. This gives a birth rate of 33•5 per 1,000, the birth rate for London as a whole being 30•2 per 1,000. I append the table to which you have become accustomed in previous reports, giving the births and deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years:— YEAR. DEATHS. BIRTHS. 1887 1,216 2,263 1888 1,168 2,311 1889 1,033 2,277 1890 1,184 2,204 1891 1,171 2,222 1892 1,125 2,175 1893 1,183 2,106 1894 807 2,180 1895 1,038 2,083 1896 923 2,223 The deaths and births were distributed as follows:— DISTRICT. DEATHS. BIRTHS. St. James 215 505 Amwell 276 558 Pentonville 218 578 Goswell 214 582 Besides the 923 deaths occurring in the Parish, 440 inhabitants of Clerkenwell died outside the district, and these must be added before a true death rate which can be used for purposes of comparison will be obtained. 105 The total number of Clerkenwell deaths is thus 1,363, which gives a death-rate of 20•5 per 1,000, considerably less than in 1895, when it was 22 per 1,000. The death rate for London as a whole, however, is only 18•6. Compared with our immediate neighbours, I find that Islington has a death rate of 17•1; St. Pancras, 18•1; Holborn, 23•4; and St. Luke,25•1. The following is a list of the outlying Public Institutions and other places where residents of the Clerkenwell district died during the year:— INSTITUTION, ETC. NUMBER OF DEATHS.

The number and the causes of death from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last ten years are exhibited in the following table:— SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. DIPHTHERIA. WHPING COUGH. TYPHOID FEVER. DIARRHŒA. TOTALS. 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 1889 0 47 10 6 23 4 54 144 1890 0 33 5 2 64 6 62 172 1891 0 107 4 7 51 4 50 223 1892 0 40 3 6 39 9 28 119 1893 0 70 11 25 41 6 50 203 1894 0 40 0 7 38 3 27 115 1895 0 81 9 12 34 9 40 185 1896 0 50 4 14 38 9 91 206 Extra Parochial— 0 1 8 25 2 6 6 To the number of zymotic deaths occurring in the district, must be added 48 deaths which occurred in extra parochial hospitals, mainly those of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, making a total of 253 deaths from zymotic disease. This gives a death rate of 3.8 per 1,000, while the rate for London as a whole is only 3.1. The increase it will be seen from the table is largely due to diarrhœa. The epidemic followed the few weeks of hot weather we experienced in June and July, and it cost 108 Clerkenwell 91 lives. With only two exceptions, the deaths were those of children under 5 years of age. Occasional cases of diarrhœa occur at all seasons of the year from errors of diet and other causes, but the diarrhoea associated with high temperatures—epidemic summer diarrhœa as it is called—is of a different character. It is believed to be due to a microorganism which exists in the superficial layers of soil containing food suitable for it, that is, soil polluted by decomposing organic matter, either animal or vegetable. Under certain circumstances it has the power of leaving the soil to become borne by the air It thus gains access to food, and through the medium of food, as a rule, it is introduced into the human system, originating the special disease. It has been demonstrated that the particular circumstance which sets up this train of events is a high temperature, not in the air itself, but in the superficial layers of the soil. The summer rise in the diarrhœa death rate does not begin till the average weekly temperature of the thermometer, suspended in an iron tube 4 feet deep in the earth, has reached 56° F., no matter how high the temperature of the air may have been previously. Bearing in mind that though high earth temperatures follow high air temperatures they take place a week or more later in point of time, and also that death only occurs after a longer or shorter period of disease, the following table giving the diarrhœa deaths in Clerkenwell for each week, side by side with the average temperature of the air for the same week, shows clearly the relationship existing between high temperatures of the boil and epidemic summer diarrhoea:— week mean deaths ending. temp. from diarrhœa.

But it should be frankly recognised that diarrhoea is a filth disease, to be found in excess wherever insanitary conditions leading to soil pollution exist. The erection of buildings on made soil is not a common occurrence in our district; for the past few years vigorous efforts have been made to discover and remedy defective drains; and the paving of yards and open spaces adjoining houses, with impermeable materials, is being insisted upon. Not so much however has been attempted in 110 connection with the prevention of the passage of ground air into houses. Cross ventilation beneath the floors is too often absent, and improvement in the frequency and regularity of removal of house refuse is urgently required. The deaths from scarlet fever occurring in the Parish were 4, while 8 deaths occurred among the cases removed to hospital for treatment. In the case of this disease, for the past few years the type has been extremely mild and the deaths have been few, though the numbers attacked have shown no diminution. The Registrar-General gives as the corrected death rate from scarlet fever for Clerkenwell, .22 per 1,000; St.. Pancras, .15; Islington, .17; and St. Lukes, .5. In contrast with the small number of scarlet fever deaths, measles contributes the comparatively large number of 50. A glance at the table of deaths from zymotic diseases, will show that during the past ten years, while scarlet fever has caused 68 deaths in the district, measles is responsible for no less a number than 598. This enormous preponderance in mortality of the non-notifiable disease measles, over the notifiable disease scarlet fever, has led to much comment, and the Vestry has on more than one occasion been asked to give an opinion as to the advisability of adding measles to the list of diseases which have to be notified. Influenced by the belief that notification would be of little benefit without isolation, and that the difficulties in the way of securing effective isolation cannot at the present time be wisely faceld, they have without disagreeing either with the gravity of present conditions, or the desire that they should be improved, considered the present moment inopportune for making the proposed change. Diphtheria has caused during the year 14 deaths in the district, and 25 deaths in institutions situated outside the Parish. The Registrar-General gives as the corrected death rate from diphtheria for Clerkenwell, .62 per 1,000; St. Pancras, .40; 1ll Islington, .74; Holborn, .38; and St. Lukes, .62. In spite of sanitary improvements, diphtheria, almost as a solitary exception amongst diseases, continues to claim a gradually increasing number of victims in London. In our district, as in London generally, the deaths in 1896 from this disease have been much above the average of the past ten years. The following table, giving the death rates from diphtheria per 1,000 living, after distribution of deaths in Public Institutions, shows the decided rise:— Clerkenwell— 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 0•25 0•39 0•36 0•28 0•42 0•42 1•15 0•51 0•51 0•62 The deaths of infants under one year of age, occurring in the Parish, were 357, against 360 in the previous year. 114 inquests were held in the year, 18 less than in the preceding year. The few cow-houses and slaughter-houses in the district were duly inspected and found in satisfactory condition. Bakehouses.—The bakehouses were made the subject of a special report, presented to the Vestry in October, of which the following is a copy:— I have recently inspected the bakehouses in the district and beg to report as follows:—I find there are 59 of them in actual use, the majority being underground. Although by the Act of last year all underground bakehouses in use on the 1st of January, 1896, may legally continue to be used, many of them in our particular district are but imperfectly adapted for their purpose. They are low, and ventilation can never be rendered very efficient. The most common defect I found to be a dirty condition of walls, ceilings, and passages, and 20 notices have been served for the purpose of remedying this evil. The Act states that limewhiting shall be done at least once every six months. Considering the height of the ceilings in most cases, the amount of gas burnt, and the fumes emitted from the 112 ovens, when the requirements of the Act are barely complied with, the conditions found, as was to be expected, were far from satisfactory. The next unfavourable condition most commonly met with was a defective state of the floor, and 17 notices have been served in connection with this matter. It was the exception rather than the rule to find a smooth impermeable floor, giving facilities for being easily swept and kept clean. The two conditions mentioned comprised the common defects. What follows fortunately existed only in exceptional cases. Thrice I found accumulation of rubbish in the bakehouse; once rabbits kept in a recess. In two cases there was a gully, and in one an unenclosed water-closet placed in a space opening off the bakehouse. In one case I found the dustbin was kept regularly in the bakehouse, and in two other cases an ash and dust heap in a corner, evidently the accumulation of several days. In one case the cistern for the supply of the bakehouse was in an adjoining cellar at the level of the ground—the water could only be obtained by dipping the pail into it. It is quite a common occurrence to store the coals in the bakehouse, and in one case I found the coal cellar used as a flour store. On the whole, in too many cases, the standard of cleanliness is much too low. Bakehouse sweepings have a certain commercial value; they are sold, I believe, to pig keepers. It is a custom to sweep the refuse from the floor, under the troughs used in laying the sponge, and these spaces are cleaned out at uncertain and comparatively long intervals. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that every part of the floor should be swept at least once a day, and the refuse kept in properly covered vessels. It has been the custom to inspect the bakehouses twice a year; experience shows that this is not sufficient, and it is proposed in the future, where conditions found have shown the necessity, to call upon them at much more frequent intervals. Disinfecting Apparatus.—In October, a report was presented to the Vestry showing the unsatisfactory character of the methods of disinfection in use in the district. It had been the custom to disinfect the bedding, clothing, carpets, &c., in all 113 cases of cholera, typhus fever, and smallpox, A few typhoid fever cases, where the bedding had become soiled by the discharges, were similarly treated, but scarlet fever and diphtheria only received attention when a special request for disinfection was made by the people themselves. The apparatus in use was Frazer's hot air oven heated by gas. The advantages of steam over hot air as a disinfecting agent were pointed out, and the necessity for disinfection after each case of typhoid fever, scarlet fever and diphtheria insisted upon. A resolution that a steam disinfector should be provided was passed, and the Public Health Committee was instructed to report on the different types of apparatus in use, with a view that an efficient disinfector should be provided as speedily as possible. New Bye-laws for Houses Let in Lodgings were under consideration during the greater part of the year. Ultimately differences of opinion were adjusted and a form, which satistied the requirements of the Local Government Board, evolved. They were urgently required, and it is anticipated they will greatly facilitate tbe work of the Public Health Department. Removal of House Refuse.—In connection with the subject of diarrhoea, I have already pointed out the necessity for improvement in the matter of house refuse removal. Again and again, in visiting the district, one comes upon the familiar sight of a dustbin full to overflowing, with a rapidly growing heap of refuse by its side. Clerkenwell houses used to be provided, in nearly every case, with a brick-built ashpit, generally of considerable size. While these were in existence the accumulation of refuse was not so much noticed (though the evils of such accumulations were not altered). Since these porous filthsaturated structures have been largely replaced by non-porous netal bins of smaller size the defects of the present system have been brought into greater prominence. The emptying of every dustbin in the parish, at least once a week, is essential to a satisfactory state of the public health, and should at once be arranged for. I am afraid this cannot be done without increased 114 expenditure, but it is questionable if this need be at all considerable if the present insanitary and clumsy method of cartage of the dust to Lambeth, sorting and sifting by hand labour, and the removal of the refuse by barges, were replaced by a well thought out scheme of dust destruction and utilisation of heat, carried out in the parish. Water Supply.—The New River Company supplies the whole of Clerkenwell on the constant system. The supply is practically the filtered water of the River Lee, as, according to the last edition of Bolton's "London Water Supply," the New River Company distributes an average daily supply of 25,271,743 gallons of filtered water, only 4,820,385 gallons are obtained from springs and wells, the remaining 20,451,358 gallons being taken from the Lee, near Ware. This Lee water has received the drainage of manured and cultivated land, the more or less crude sewage from towns and villages on its banks, and has become grossly polluted. The processes relied upon to effect its purification are storage, to allow of settlement of the suspended matters, and filtration through sand. The Company uses a layer of very fine sand 1•8 feet thick, and it must be admitted that its action is wonderfully efficient. Suspended matter is almost entirely removed. According to Professor Frankland, the amount of suspended matter in the filtered water "rarely if ever exceeds 0•0002 grain in a tumblerfull, and therefore, in order to imbibe a single grain, it would be necessary for the consumer to drink no less than 5,000 tumblers full of water. The amount of organic matter in solution is also, to a certain extent, diminished by being oxidised or burnt up; and no less than 98 to 99 per cent. of germs or microbes are removed." The following table, which shows the maximum, minimum and average proportions of organic matter, as measured by the standard of the very pure water from the deep wells of the Kent Company taken as unity, is interesting and exhibits the superiority of the New River Company over all other Companies taking water from the Lee or the Thames:— 115 Sources. Maximum. Minimum. Average. River Lee New River 2.6 1.0 1.7 East London 4.1 1.7 2.9 River Thames Chelsea 5.2 2.1 3.2 Grand Junction 5.2 2.0 3.1 West Middlesex 5.2 2.0 3.2 Southwark 6.8 2.1 3.5 Lambeth 5.9 2.3 3.5 The New River Company has a storage capacity of 4•4 days' supply. The average rate of filtration per square foot per hour is 2•29 gallons, and the percentage of organisms left in the water after filtration is only 2•2; West Middlesex coming next with 2•5; while East London follows with 3•1; Chelsea 6•0, and Grand Junction 8•9 per cent. While freely admitting the superiority of the water of the New River Company over that of all other Companies drawing water from the Thames or the Lee, it is doubtful if any water which has been specifically polluted can furnish, within a limited period of time, a perfectly satisfactory domestic supply. There is no guarantee that filtration will always be efficient; indeed careful scrutiny of the weekly analyses show that it is not always efficient; filters are liable to various accidents, and common sense would suggest the avoidance of all risks, and give the preference to a water supply which has never received the germs of infectious disease rather than one which, having received them, must rely upon processes of purification for their removal. Mortuary.-During the year 253 bodies were brought to the mortuary; 59 of these were Holborn Guardian cases, and 194 were brought from the dwellings of parishioners, including 16 cases of infectious disease; 121 were inquest cases upon which 86 post-mortems were made Inspectors' Reports.— Inspector Bartlett's Report, 1896—No. 1 District. 61 w.c, water supplies reinstated. 220 defective w.c.'s repaired. 33 extra w.c.'s provided. 116 152 defective drains remedied, 199 dirty rooms and houses cleansed. 36 dilapidated houses repaired. 96 defective traps renewed. 144 defective pavings remedied 224 defective dustbins renewed 21 defective roofs repaired. 9 illegally occupied kitchens. 35 cases of overcrowding. 41 accumulations of rubbish removed. 9 water supplies reinstated. 3 dead bodies removed from rooms. 3 smoke nuisances abated. 5 dung receptacles provided. 29 choked w.c.'s unstopped. 26 workshops cleansed. 41 dirty cisterns cleansed. 14 defective stackpipes repaired. 8 foul urinals cleansed. 13 nuisances from animals. 90 dirty yards cleansed. 27 soilpipes ventilated and renewed. 34 sinks and wastes repaired. 242 fumigations : 2 small pox, 156 scarlet fever, 99 diphtheria, 23 typhoid, 0 Puerperal, 41 erysipelas. 49 summonses taken out ; 8 withdrawn; 2 dismissed; 3 defendants removed before hearing. £ s. d. 1 under Metropolis Local Management Act, fines and costs 2 2 0 5 under Margarine Act, ditto 2 0 6 13 under Food and Drugs Act, ditto 15 6 0 20 under Public Health Act, ditto 19 12 6 730 preliminary notices served. 234 statutory notices served. 683 houses visited on complaint, 2852 revisits. 117 Inspector Ensor's Report, 1896—No. 2 District. 13 reductions in number of occupants of houses. 85 new drains and defective drains repaired. 29 choked w.c.'s unstopped. 40 foul w.c. pans cleansed. 137 w.c.'s altered and amended. 60 w.c. water supplies provided. 184 yards, areas, washhouses and stables paved. 87 yards, areas, washhouses, stables, workshops and oasements limewhited. 147 new gully traps provided. 113 sinks and stackpipes disconnected. 9 illegally occupied kitchens emptied. 156 dirty rooms and houses cleansed. 34 additional w.c.'s provided or number in house lessened. 83 floors, windows and roofs repaired. 247 new dustbins provided or old repaired. 32 accumulations of rubbish removed. 71 cisterns repaired and cleansed. 4 smoke nuisances abated. 7 soil pipes renewed or repaired 28 stackpipes repaired. 5 water supplies to houses reinstated. 9 water pipes repaired. 2 manholes repaired. 10 choked sinks unstopped. 2 dung receptacles provided. 1584 preliminary notices served. 97 statutory notices served. 744 houses visited on complaint. 2740 houses revisited. 18 summonses were taken out, 1 withdrawn and 1 dismissed. 14 under Food and Drugs Act, fines and costs, £13 9s. 6d. 2 under Public Health Act, fines 1s. and 20s. costs. 1 under the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 2s. costs. 1 under Margarine Act, fine 10s. and 2s. costs. 118 281 fumigations after infectious disease. 158 cases of scarlet fever. 78 „ diphtheria. 22 ,, typhoid fever. 2 „ puerperal fever. 39 „ erysipelas.

VESTRY OF THE Parish of St. James and St. John, CLERKENWELL. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875. REPORTS OF Mr. J. K. COLWELL, F.I.C., F.C.S., Public Analyst AND INSPECTORS, 1896-7. 126 Analyst's Report. Clerkenwell Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, E.C., 12th July, 1897. To the Vestey of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, during the year ending 31st March, 1897. The total number of samples of food and drugs examined during this period was 311, a larger number than in any previous year. In the six preceding years the totals were as follows:— Year. Samples Examined. 1890-91 144 1891-92 149 1892-93 184 1893-94 185 1894-95 177 1895-96 228 During the past year Inspector W. J. Bartlett has submitted 101, Inspector W. P. Ensor 110, and Inspector W. Green 100 samples for analysis. In the following table will be found a statement of the articles examined during each quarter of the year:— 127 Article. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total. Grand Total. Gen.

This figure is about tbe average for the last six years, the percentage of adulterated samples during that period being as follows:— year. Percentage of Adulterated Samples. 1890-91 29.8 1891-92 22.1 1892-93 17.9 1898-94 23.7 1894-95 16.4 1895-96 23.2 128 MILK. As in previous years a large number of the samples taken have consisted of milk, altogether 186 having beeu submitted for analysis. Fifty of these, 36·7 per cent., were found to be adulterated either by the removal of fat, or by the addition of water in varying quantities. It is again my duty to emphasize the great importance of a proper supply of milk, both from a public health and an economic standpoint. As the main article of consumption among the younger members of the population it is essential that its good quality be maintained. It has been calculated that each head of population of England and Wales consumes milk to the value of £1 per annum. In a parish like Clerkenwell, with a population of upwards of 66,000 the annual expenditure upon milk must reach an enormous figure. The nature and amount of the adulteration was as follows:— No. of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration. FIRST QUARTER (ending 30th June, 1896.) C 2 34 At least 5 per cent of fat removed.

In addition to these adulterated samples nine other samples were of " poor quality." The Milk supply of the parish during the past year cannot be called good. BUTTER. Fifty-three samples of Butter were submitted for examination, 12 of which (22.6 per cent) were found to be adulterated as follows:— No. of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration.

RUM. Of the six samples of Rum examined one was unduly diluted with water, No. C/3 60, being 32 degrees under proof—seven degrees more than the standard strength. WHISKY. Two (6 per cent.) of the 36 samples of whisky had been diluted with water, No. C/2 48, being reduced to 27 degrees under proof, and No. C/3 1, to 28 degrees under proof. 131 COFFEE. Twenty per cent. of the 10 samples of Coffee were found to be adulterated by admixture with Chicory, No. 51 containing at least 25 per cent., and No. 21 at least 30 per cent. of the adulterant. MUSTARD. One of the 12 (9·09 per cent.) samples of mustard was adulterated, No. C/3 67, containing at least 12 per cent. of starch. LARD. Six samples were examined-one (16.66 per cent.) No. C/3 66 being adulterated with at least 15 per cent of cotton seed oil. BREAD, FLOUR, SAUSAGES, etc. The remaining samples were all certified to be "not adulterated."
