Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour, herewith, to present to you, this, my Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1959. This is the Twenty-sixth Report in the series, since I was appointed your Medical Officer of Health, and it is drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 15(5) of the Public Health Officers Regulations, 1959, and with Circular No. 1/60 of the Ministry of Health, dated 8th January, 1960. The Report is again one which relates not only to those functions which are carried out in my capacity as Medical Officer of Health for the Romford Borough Council, but, also to those which fall within my administration, as Area Medical Officer for the Essex County Council. I trust that you will agree when I say that the report, in general, is a satisfactory one. Once again, I have much pleasure in recording my sincere thanks to the members of the Borough Council, and to those of the Health Area Sub Committee; to the members of my staff, and to my colleagues in the other departments for their helpful assistance during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JAMES B. SAMSON, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Romford. (Tel.: Romford 46040).

Total 411 363 774 35 2 2 10 6 10 31 69 144 184 281 13 This year the Registrar-General has given his estimate of the midyear population of Romford as 114,800, which compares with 113,700 for last year, an increase of 1,100. During 1959, the total number of live births registered was 2,032, and the total number of deaths registered was 774. The difference of 1,258 gives the natural increase in the population As this number for the first time exceeds the Registrar-General's estimated increase of 1,100, it follows that the balance of 158 is made up of Emigration. For 1959, we estimate the Birth Rate to be 14.9 per 1,000 of the estimated resident population. This figure is obtained by multiplying the Crude Birth Rate of 17.7 by the Comparability Factor of 0.84. For last year, the Rate was 15.2. The Rate for England and Wales for 1959 is given as 16.5. The Death Rate for Romford is estimated as 10.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population. This figure is obtained by multiplying the Crude Death Rate of 6.7 by the Comparability Factor of 1.56. For last year the Rate was 11.1. The comparable Rate for England and Wales is 11.6. The chief causes of death in order of frequency were:— (1) Diseases of the Heart and Circulation. (2) Cancer. (3) Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Other Respiratory Diseases. A there were no maternal deaths, the Maternal Mortality Rate, which is the number of Maternal Deaths, due to conditions associated with pregnancy, or confinement, per 1,000 total (live and still) births, is 0.0 The Infant Mortality Rate, or the Death Rate of Infants under one year age per 1,000 live births, is 17.2, a decrease of 2.3 compared with 1958. The corresponding figure for England and Wales is 22.0. 14 1.—GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA (i) Staff The particulars relative to the staff are set out at the beginning of the report, and once again I have to point out that the Assistant Medical Officers, Dental Staff, Nursing Staff and the majority of the Clerical Staff are under the jurisdiction of the Essex County Council, and in that section of my Department, of which I am Area Medical Officer. (ii) Laboratory Facilities These facilities are the same as before, and meet the requirements of the Department, and of the General Practitioners. (iii) Nursing in the Home (a) General. At the end of the year 10 Home Nurses were serving the area. These were employed in general domiciliary nursing. Sick-room equipment has again been made available, without charge, in accordance with the provision made under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, and, in fact, a considerable amount is on loan. Table 3 sets out the work of the Home Nursing service, during the year. TABLE 3 (1) Number of visits paid 23,528 (2) Number of cases attended 1,002 (b) Domiciliary Midwives. At the end of the year 14 Domiciliary Midwives were employed, the most we have had, and assistance was again given by the Salvation Army Midwives. It will be noted that the general situation, with regard to recruitment, has definitely improved. The following gives a summary of the cases attended by the Domiciliary Midwives, as Midwives, and as Maternity Nurses. TABLE 4 As Midwives 861 As Maternity Nurses ... 36 Table 5 gives a summary of the "Medical Aid" notice received during the year. TABLE 5 (1) Where the medical practitioner had arranged to provide the patient with maternity services, under the National Hearth Service 14 (2) Others 71 15 (iv) Ante-natal Clinics Three Ante-natal sessions are held each week. When necessary, mothers have again been referred to the Consultative Clinic, which is held at Old church Hospital. During the year 249 individual expectant mothers attended the Ante-natal Clinics, of which 156 sessions were held. The total number of attendances of the Ante-natal mothers was 1,323, giving an average of 5.3 attendances per patient. The average number attending at each session was 8.5. (v) Child Welfare Clinics Twelve Child Welfare sessions are held each week. Altogether, there were 613 sessions, and the following table gives a summary of the attendances. TABLE 6 Individual children attending 3,300 Children under one year attending for the first time 1,461 Medical consultations 6,311 Attendance of children under one year of age 17,685 Attendance of children between the ages of one and five years 4,266 Average attendance per session 35.8 (vi) Health visitors A the end of the year there were 17 Health Visitors, again a definite improvement. Apart from the Tuberculosis Nurses, all also acted as School Nurses. Table 7 relates to Home Visits paid by the Health Visitors in conne on with their duties under Maternal and Child Welfare. TABLE 7 (a) To Expectant Mothers: — First Visits 167 Total Visits 207 (b) To Children under one year of age: — First Visits 2,467 Total Visits 6,628 (c) To Children between the ages of one and five years:— Total Visits 7,696 (vii) Inspection of Nursing Homes There are three Nursing Homes on the register. These were inspected on four occasions throughout the year, on behalf of the County Council, and conditions were found to be satisfactory. 16 (viii) Domestic Helps During the year 114 Part-time and Casual Helps were employed, and they attended 715 individual cases. Tuberculous patients have again received aid by the provision of special volunteers. Periodically, special courses are arranged by the County Council for the Domestic Helps, to enable them to appreciate the wider significance of the service, and how best they can meet the individual and varying needs of the families whom tbey serve. (ix) Day Nurseries The three Day Nurseries again served the area. The average daily attendances for the year at each Nursery is shown below : TABLE 8 "St. Moritz" Nursery 28 Collier Row Nursery 25 Rush Green Nursery 24 The "St. Moritz" and Collier Row Nurseries are scheduled to take 40 children each, and the Rush Green Nursery 50 children. (x) Dental Service At the end of the year, one full time and three part-time Dental Officers were employed, the latter giving between them ten sessions per week, of which one was an evening session. In spite of the financial improvement as far as salaries are concerned, recruitment to the service is still very difficult. The following gives particulars of the work done during t e year, for expectant and nursing mothers, and children under school age:— TABLE 9 (a) Numbers provided with Dental care:- Examined Needing Treatment Treated Made Dentally Fit Expectant and Nursing Mothers 50 45 40 19 Children under Five 170 133 110 95 (b) Forms of Dental Treatment provided:— Extractions Anaesthetics Fillings.

This includes Ante-natal and Post-natal consultations and examinations, Mothercraft lectures, exercises for the Expectant Mother, Child Welfare Clinics, Minor Ailment Clinics, Speech Therapy, Dental Sessions, Immunisation Sessions, etc. The four suites in the General Practitioners' section have been utilised by seven practitioners, or by their partners or assistants. The Nursing Staff and Clerical Assistants are provided by the Local Health Authority, as also the necessary equipment. Apart from the actual work of each section, various social activities have enabled all the personnel to get to know each other in an informal manner, with beneficial results. The Regional Hospital Board is responsible for the Ophthalmic and Orthopaedic staff and the Executive Council for the General Dental Service. 2.—SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA (i) Water Mr. H. G. Ramsay, Chief Engineer of the South Essex Waterworks Company, has kindly given me the following report with regard to the water supply to the district:— (a) There have been no new extensions of public water supply during the year 1959, other than those for the supply to permanent housing sites. (b) Lengths of mains laid, in yards:— 3" 4" 6" 18" 21" Romford Area 736 130 47 4 1,377 (c) The water supply of the area, and of its several parts, has been satisfactory, both as to quality and quantity, but owing to the exceptionally high demand during the extreme drought periods, the pressures were at times less than normal. (d) Bacteriological and Chemical examinations are made of th raw water, of the water in its various stages of treatment, of th water supplied from the Company's wells, and of the water go g into supply. Analyses are also made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in various parts of the Company's district; all proved to be sat, factory. A total of over 4,130 Chemical, Bacteriological and Biological examinations have been made. In addition, samples were examined for radioactivity. (e) The waters are not liable to plumbo-solvent action. (f) No contamination has arisen, therefore, no action has been necessary." 18 In addition to the analyses carried out by the Waterworks Company, samples have also been taken from consumers' taps by the Public Health Inspectors, and sent for Bacteriological analyses once per month, and Chemical analyses once per six months, and the results have confirmed the findings of the Company. (ii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area The Chief Public Health Inspector has given me the undermentioned report, as required by Regulation 25(20) of the Public Health Officers Regulations, 1959, and also the particulars which follow:- During the year 1,671 complaints were received and investigated, and 5,869 visits were made for this purpose.

Altogether there are 320 caravans on these sites used for permanent residential purposes. There are also two sites that have been developed during the latter part of the year, one site has 45 caravans stationed on it and the other has five. Although certain amenities have been provided on these sites they have not been licensed under the Public Health Act as enforcement action is being taken against the developers under the Town and Country Planning Act. In addition to the above, there are seven individual caravans licensed for residential purposes. Frequent inspections are made and the sites are maintained in a satisfactory condition. 21 (b) Gipsies. Quite a number of gipsy caravans visit the district during the course of the year and encamp on parcels of unfenced waste land to the north of the Borough. These nomads cause a considerable nuisance to the house-holders in the neighbourhood of the encampments by their insistent demands for water and their very low standards of hygiene. The Public Health Inspectors have to spend a considerable amount of time in securing the removal of these caravans, and the police are very co-operative in rendering assistance for this purpose. (v) Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. During the year the Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Operative carried out 2,912 inspections or re-inspections to premises suspected of being infested with rats or mice, and disinfestation measures were carried out where necessary. Further treatment of the sewers for rat disinfestation has been carried out during the year. In addition to rats and mice a number of complaints were received concerning grey squirrels, pigeons and moles; advice was given in all instances and where special treatment was necessary the matters were referred to the County Pest Officer. (vi) Disinfestation. Advice is given on all cases of infestation. Where the infestation is slight the Council has agreed to the work of disinfestation being carried out by the Rodent Operative, under the supervision of a Public Health Inspector, the charge made being based on labour and material. When the infestation is found to be severe, the persons concerned are advised to employ the services of specialist firms. During the year assistance has been given to householders in ridding premise of wasps, carpet beetles and other troublesome insects. (vii) Pet Animals Act, 1951. There are 16 persons licensed under the above Act to keep Pet Shops. Frequent inspections are made to ensure that the conditions of the license e are complied with. 3.—INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD (i) Mi. Supply. At the end of the year 40 firms were registered as retailers or distributors. Of these, 20 were licensed to retail Tuberculin Tested Milk, 32 were licensed to retail Pasteurised Milk and 38 were licensed to retail Sterilised Milk. One Pasteurising plant has been kept under surveillance by the department. During the year, 114 samples of milk were taken, and all passed the prescribed tests. 22 (ii) Ice Cream. All dealers in ice cream must be registered, and at the end of the year there were 231 vendors on the register. During the year 80 samples of ice cream were taken for bacteriological examination, of these 63 were satisfactory and 17 unsatisfactory and they were further classified as follows:— Ministry of Health (Provisional) Grade I 43 ,, ,, „ Grade II 17 „ „ „ Grade III 8 „ „ „ Grade IV 12 37 samples of ice lollies were taken for examination and of these 27 were of a satisfactory standard and 10 unsatisfactory. (iii) Meat. There are four licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough, one of these being licensed for the slaughter of horses as well as livestock. The Inspectors attended regularly to ensure a 100% inspection. During the year 1,228 such visits were made. Altogether 13,087 animals were slaughtered and a total of 6 tons, 9 cwts., 108 lbs. of meat was found to be unfit. This was disposed of for animal feeding, through the recognised channels. Table 12 sets out the particulars of the carcases inspected, and condemned. There are also four Wholesale Meat Depots and 74 Butcher Shops in the Borough, and during the year 285 inspections were made of these premises. During the year only two animals were found to be infected with Cysticercus bovis. One steer was found to have a cyst in the heart muscle, and one cow heifer had a cyst in the cheek muscle. Both carcases were detained in a cold store for a period of three wt ks and then released. (iv) Food Products in General. In addition to the premises used for Milk, Ice Cream, and Meat, referred to above, the following are registered under the Ramford Urban District Council Act, 1931, and are subject to the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. Bakers 31 Cafes 61 Confectioners 63 Fishmongers 32 Greengrocers 59 Grocers 152 Miscellaneous 22 Hawkers 50 There are also 45 food stalls situated in the Market Place on three days of the week. All the above are regularly inspected, and during the year 1,522 inspections were made, and 32 informal notices were served. Many improvements were again obtained through personal approach. 23 TABLE 12 CARCASES INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED 1959 Cattle except Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses TOTAL Number killed (if known) 1,134 780 253 6,791 4,014 115 13,087 Number inspected 1,134 780 253 6,791 4,014 115 13,087 All diseases except Tuberculosis.

During the year 469 visits were made to food premises, mainly on request, for the purpose of dealing with unsound food, and a total quantity of 8 tons 19 cwts., 34 lbs. of food was surrendered as unfit for human consumption. Where possible all unsound food is disposed of for animal feeding—the remainder being dealt with by the Cleansing Department. (vi) The Food and Drugs Act, 1955. During 1959, 318 samples were submitted for analysis, comprising 4 Formal and 313 Informal. Table 13 sets out the types of food examined. Of the 318 samples taken, 29 proved to be not genuine. Comments on these are as under:— Milk Two bottles of milk were submitted for examination following complaints that they contained foreign matter. One sample consisted of a one-third pint bottle approximately ¼ full of milk; this milk had a greyish colour and further examination of the contents of the bottle showed the presence of a heavy blackish deposit in the bottom. Our examination of this blackish foreign matter showed that it consisted essentially of finely divided carbonaceous matter of the nature of lamp black admixed with mineral matter which was mainly silicious in character. In other words the foreign matter had the general composition of soot. The other sample was again a one-third pint bottle which in this instance was approximately 2/3 full of milk and my examination of the bottle showed that large areas of the inner surface were stained a pale yellow and a pale brown colour. Microscopical examination of these stained areas showed that they were due to the presence of micro organisms of the nature of algae. Corned Beef (2 samples) This sample consisted of a large block of corned beef which showed the presence of a number of blackened areas both on the surface of the meat and also in the interior. Chemical and microscopical examination of these blackened areas showed that they were due to the development of iron sulphide. The formation of iron sulphide in a meat product of this nature is brought about by the action of micro organisms which produced traces of sulphuretted hydrogen which subsequently react with the iron naturally present in meat to give rise to the resulting black iron salphide. Salmon and Shrimp Paste Reference has already been made to the requirements of the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations 1957 in previous reports. Another sample of fish paste—salmon and shrimp, was found to contain Rhodamine B, a non permitted colour. It was ascertained that this was manufactured prior to the new Regulations coming into operation. 25 Pork Sausages Three of the seven samples of pork sausages examined were found to be unsatisfactory. Although there is still no official standard for the meat content of pork sausages nevertheless the tentative standards recommended by the Association of Public Analysts are widely adhered to. The meat content of one of the sausages examined was found to be not in accord with this minimum standard of 65 per cent of meat. Our examination showed the sausage to contain 54 per cent of meat being therefore deficient in meat to the extent of 11 per cent. The other two pork sausages were both satisfactory in respect of their meat content but both contained sulphur dioxide preservative to the extent of 240 and 260 parts per million respectively. The use of sulphur dioxide preservative to the extent of 450 parts per million is permitted in pork sausages by the Preservative Regulations provided that a declaration of the presence of preservative is given to the purchaser Chicken Noodle Soup Reference has been made in a number of previous reports to the newer type of soup powder, or packeted soup, now on the market. Attention was drawn to another of these soups during the present year. As in the case of previous soup powders to which attention was drawn the composition of the article was found to be in substantial accord with the declaration of ingredients given on the label. Soup prepared according to the directions given on the label, however, would contain lean chicken meat and chicken extractives equivalent to only one per cent of lean chicken meat. In our opinion the propotion of chicken meat in the final soup is poor for an article described as "Chicken Noodle Soup." Slice of a Current Loaf This sample consisted of the larger part of a slice of currant bread together with a dark brown mass which represented the missing, smaller, part of the slice of bread after it had been chewed. Examination of the dark brown mass showed that it consisted essentianty of a mixture of dough and a small quantity of dirty mineral oil together with some dried fruit. Examination of the portion of the slice of bread showed the presence of a number of small black particles embedded in the broken edge. Examination of these black particles showed that they consisted of a similar mixture of dirty dough and mineral oil similar to that in the dark brown mass referred to above. Legal proceedings were taken in this case. Pork Pie This sample consisted of a small portion of a meat pie including both a portion of pastry and some meat filling, and was submitted for examination following a complaint that it contained a foreign substance. Our examination of this sample showed the presence of a soft shiny black body about ¼" diameter embedded in the meat filling and also some black stains on the inside of the crust. 26 Detailed examination of this foreign material showed that it was essentially due to the discolouration of the filling, and also of the crust., brought about by atmospheric dust, or dirt. Lollipops Atmospheric dust or dirt accounted for two sugar lollipops being submitted for examination following a complaint that they were dirty. In one of the lollipops the contamination was in the form of a blackish spot whereas in the other it took the form of a faint blackish line. Sweets (Foam Tops 2, Liquorice Comfits 1) Reference has already been made in previous reports to the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations, 1957. These Regulations, which restrict the colouring matters to be used in food stuffs to a short list, are now in full operation. A colouring matter not permitted by the Regulations known as Rhodamine B, was found to be present in two samples of sweets described as Foam Tops, and one described as Liquorice Comfits. These sweets had various colours and it was the pink sweets which were found to contain Rhodamine B. The other coloured sweets were found to contain permitted dyes. It was ascertained that these sweets were manufactured before the Regulations came into operation. Grand Prix Salmon An unopened can of salmon was submitted to us for examination following a complaint that a similar can was alleged to have caused sickness. On opening the can a slight, but objectionable, odour of hydrogen sulphide (usually referred to as rotten eggs) was detected. Such odours are invariably produced as the result of bacterial decomposition but our examination of the contents showed that any such bacterial action as may have occurred had now ceased since the contents were bacteriologically sterile. Chemical examination showed that the oily constituent of the salmon had developed a slight incipient rancidity. As the result of our examination we formed the opinion that the salmon was now out of condition and may well have caused sickness to a person with a sensitive palate. Bread This sample consisted of a slice of bread together with several smaller pieces of bread which were spread with fat; some of the pieces also having a spreading' of shredded meat. This sample was alleged to contain foreign matter in the form of an insect. Examination of the sample showed the presence of insect fragments embedded not only in the whole slice but in two of the pieces. The fragments found consisted of parts of the thoracic segments and the legs. The other parts of the insect were missing. The fragments were, however, sufficient to dentify the insect as being a flour beetle. 27 Samples in a Mouldy Condition The very hot humid summer accelerated the rate of mould growth in many different foodstuffs and has accordingly reduced their "shelflife" considerably. Three of the unsatisfactory samples were found to be in a mouldy condition. The filling of an apple turnover showed the presence of two small blackish areas which were found to be due to mould growth. The filling of an apple pie was covered with a fine filamentous mould growth, the mould growth being considerably more extensive than was found in the turnover referred to above and in this instance has permeated the whole of the filling. The whole of the filling of a Cornish Pasty was found to be covered with a growth of greyish green mould. All three samples were clearly out of condition and unfit for human consumption. Buttered Bun This sample was submitted as the result of a complaint which alleged that the fat on the bun was not butter but margarine. Examination of the fat confirmed the complaint and showed that the fat consisted of margarine containing 10 per cent of butter. Cashew Nuts These nuts were submitted as the result of a complaint as to their condition. The sample, as received, consisted of approximately two ounce; of whole and broken cashew nuts. The sample also included eight grains of rice, a small black pellet about ¼" long and a small quantity of insect web and miscellaneous dust. Mieroscopical examination of the black pellet showed that it consisted a rodent excreta. No live insects were found in the sample but the presence of insect web indicated quite clearly that at some stage or another there had been some slight insect infestation. Legal proceedings were taken in this case. Apricot Tart This sample consisted of several fragments of pastry together with half of an apricot. Adhering to the apricot was a small brown pellet about ¼" long and embedded in the pastry were two smaller similar brown pellets. Upon removal these three pellets were found to consist of rodent excreta, Legal proceedings were taken in this case. 28 Luncheon Meat In the absence of an official standard for the meat content of luncheon meat, of recent years Public Analysts have been disturbed by the poor quality of some makes of this meat product on the market. Recently an agreement has been reached between the Food Manufacturers' Federation and the Association of Public Analysts that luncheon meat should contain at least 80 per cent of meat. Two samples of luncheon meat examined during the quarter failed to meet this standard, their meat content being respectively 70 and 71 per cent. As this agreement was only reached towards the end of last year it is clearly necessary to allow time for existing stocks to be used up before this agreement can be rigidly enforced. Flour This sample was in two parts, one consisting of about 18 ounces of flour admixed with fat, and the other approximately 7 ounces of straight flour. The sample was submitted for examination as the result of a complaint that it contained foreign matter. Examination of the flour which was mixed with fat showed that it contained a small insect having the general characteristics of a moth. No foreign matter, however, was found in the plain flour. Non-brewed Vinegar This sample was found to contain:— Acetic Acid 4.3 per cent and was therefore of full vinegar strength as regards its acidity. Further analysis showed, however, that it consisted of diluted and coloured acetic acid. In reporting on this sample, however, we pointed out that vinegar should be a product obtained by fermentation process and since this article was not the product of such a process the term "Vinegar" is inappropriate and the article therefore misdescribed. Concentrated Artificial Vinegar (Vinegarine Brown) Examination of this sample showed that it consisted of a coloured concentrated solution of acetic acid containing 63 per cent of acetic acid. The concentrated preparation was clearly designed to produce, on suitable dilution, the article now known as "Non Brewed Condiment." In reporting on this sample we pointed out that vinegar should be a product of a fermentation process and since the article was not the result of such a process the term "Vinegar" was inappropriate and the article was therefore misdescribed. 29 We also pointed out that the warning statement of the label "dangerous—not to be used unless diluted," which is required to be carried on articles of this nature by the Labelling of Food Order 1953, appears on the label of this article in type of a less size than is required by the above Order. (vii) Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 The Public Health Inspectors continue to devote a considerable amount of time to the inspection of food premises of all types to ensure that the requirements of the above Regulations are complied with. Provision is not made in these Regulations for the service of Statutory Notices in the case of contraventions and, legally, every contravention found by the inspectors could result in prosecution. However, in practice, it is rare that the contraventions observed are sufficiently serious as to warrant immediate legal action. When contraventions are noted, they are immediately drawn to the attention of the occupier, and the need for improvement explained. This verbal intimation is always followed by a letter, indicating the nature of the offence, and allowing the offender a period of grace in which to comply with the Regulations. This procedure has been adopted with a view to educating food traders, rather than to prosecute, and it appears to be paying dividends as the general standard of the food shops in the district has greatly improved. I addition to the inspection of food shops and restaurants, frequent visits are made to factory and school canteens, and other food preparing premises. The two main difficulties experienced with the enforcement of the Regulations are (a) the protection of open foodstuffs exposed for saw on stalls in the open market and (b) smoking by food handlers. It has been extremely difficult to impress on stallholders the real need for protecting food from contamination in the open air, but, after much perseverance, there is evidence of improvement. As regards smoking, the no in difficulty is that this habit is so widespread and ingrained and same food handlers, especially the stallholders, do not appreciate that they should be subjected to this prohibition, whilst the customer is not. Now people appear to appreciate that the reason for prohibiting the use of obacco including snuff, whilst handling open food is that the habit bring the fingers into close contact with the nose and mouth both possible reservoirs of food poisoning germs, the hands thus become contaminated, and the contamination is then transferred to the foodstuffs. During the past year it was necessary to prosecute six persons for smoking whilst handling open food, four of these being stallholders in the Market. Unfortunately the Courts do not take a very serious view of this offence as the fines imposed were purely nominal, varying from £1 to £2. Educational Activities In addition to the routine duties of inspection and observations, the Public Health Inspectors continue to give talks and lectures to local organisations, and, wherever possible, great stress is laid on food hygiene. At least once during the year a lecture is given to the staffs employed in the school canteens. 30 TABLE 13 SUMMARY OF SAMPLES TAKEN FOR ANALYSIS DURING THE YEAR 1959 Article Number examined Result of Analysis Formal Informal Total Genuine Not Genuine Apples — 3 3 2 1 Apple Pie — 1 1 — 1 Apple Turnover — 1 1 — 1 Apricot Tart — 1 1 — 1 Baked Beans with Hamburgers in sauce — 1 1 1 — Baking Powder — 1 1 1 — Baking Yeast — 1 1 1 — Beef, corned — 3 3 1 2 Bisk-o-Lait — 1 1 1 — Black Grapes — 2 2 2 — Blackcurrant Drink — 1 1 1 — Blackcurrant Syrup — 1 1 1 — Bread — 1 1 — 1 Butter — 2 2 2 — Butter Brazils — 1 1 1 — Buttered Buns — 1 1 — 1 Cake Icing mixture — 1 1 1 — Cashew Nuts — 1 1 — 1 Catarrh and Throat Pastilles — 1 1 1 — Cheese — 1 1 1 — Cheese spread — 2 2 2 — Cherries — 2 2 2 Chicken Paste — 1 1 1 — Chicken & Ham Paste — 1 1 1 — Chicken Meat — 1 1 1 — Chicken, minced — 1 1 1 — Chocolates — 1 1 1 — Cinnamon — 1 1 1 — Cod Roe, smoked — 1 1 1 — Coffee & Chicory Essence — 3 3 3 — Colourings, various — 4 4 4 — Condiment — 2 2 2 Cornish Pasty — 1 1 — 1 Crab, dressed — 2 2 2 — Crab, lobster paste — 1 1 1 — Crab paste — 1 1 1 — Crab spread — 2 2 2 Cream — 4 4 4 Currant loaf, slice of — 1 1 — 1 Custard Powder — 3 3 3 Diabetic chocolate — 1 1 1 — Dripping, beef — 7 7 7 Egg Vermicelli — 1 1 1 Eucalyptus Lollies — 1 1 1 Flavourings — 7 7 7 — Flour — 3 3 2 1 Foam Tops — 1 1 — 1 Food Colour — 1 1 1 — Frankfurters — 2 2 2 — Fruits, mixed — 2 2 2 — Fruit Sauce — 1 1 1 — Gees Linctus — 1 1 1 — Gelatine — 2 2 2 — Gherkins — 1 1 1 — Ginger — 1 1 1 — Carried forward — 93 93 80 13 31 Table 13—continued Article Number examined Result of Analysis Formal Informal Total Genuine Not Genuine Brought forward — 93 93 80 13 Glycerine & Blackcurrant sweets with glucose — 1 1 1 — Gravy Salt — 1 1 1 — Haliborange Tablets — 1 1 1 — Ham & Beef Roll — 1 1 1 — Ham & Chicken Galantine — 1 1 1 — Hamburgers — 1 1 1 — Ice-Cream — 13 13 13 — Ice-Cream mix — 1 1 1 — Jam — 2 2 2 — Jelly & Jelly crystals — 5 5 5 — Junket Powder — 1 1 1 — Lard — 1 1 1 — Lemon Curd — 1 1 1 — Lemon Juice — 1 1 1 — Lemon Wafer — 1 1 1 — Lemonade — 1 1 1 — Lemonade Powder — 2 2 1* — Lime flavour for Lollies — 1 1 1 — Lime Marmalade — 1 1 1 — Lollipops — 1 1 — 1 Lollies — 7 7 7 — Luncheon Meat — 3 3 1 2 Margarine — 4 4 4 — Marzipan — 3 3 3 — Meat Paste — 1 1 1 — Meat Pudding — 1 1 1 — Menthel & Eucalyptus Sweets — 2 2 2 — Meringue Powder — 1 1 1 — Milk — 20 20 18 2 Milk chocolate crunches — 1 1 1 — Milk chocolate drops — 1 1 1 — Milk, condensed — 3 3 3 — Milk, evaporated — 3 3 3 — Milk shake, banana flavour — 1 1 1 — Mincemeat — 4 4 3† — Mint imvinegar 1 1 1 — Mix-a-shake — 1 1 1 — Moutarde (liquid mustard) — 1 1 1 — Mustard — 2 2 2 — Noodles with meat in tomato sauce — 1 1 1 — Olive Oil — 2 2 2 — Onions, pickled — 1 1 1 — Orange juice — 1 1 1 — Orange junket — 1 1 1 — Orange squash — 1 1 1 — Orange sweetened — 1 1 1 — Paprika — 1 1 1 — Peanut Butter — 2 9 2 — Peas — 1 1 1 — Peas, processed — 1 — 1 — Pepper — 4 4 3* — Pickle — 1 1 1 — Carried forward — 209 209 191 18 32 Table 13—continued Article Number examined Result of Analysis Formal Informal Total Genuine Not Genuine Brought forward — 209 209 191 18 Pineapple, grapefruit juice drink — 1 1 1 — Plums in syrup — 1 1 1 — Pork kidneys — 1 1 1 — Pork pie — 2 2 1 1 Pork, rolled and stuffed — 1 1 1 — Rice — 1 1 1 — Rice pudding, creamed — 4 4 4 — Rice pudding, full cream — 1 1 1 — Rivella Health Drink — 1 1 1 — Rum & Butter Toffee — 1 1 1 — Salmon — 5 5 4 1 Salmon paste — 1 1 1 — Salmon & Shrimp paste 1 2 3 2 1 Salmon Spread — 1 1 1 — Salmon Spread with butter — 1 1 1 — Salmonaise — 1 1 1 — Sardine & Tomato paste — 2 2 2 — Sausages, pork 2 7 9 6 3 Sausages, unclassified — 2 2 2 — Saveloys — 1 1 1 — Seasoning — 1 1 1 — Self-raising flour — 1 1 1 — Soap (Camay) — 1 1 —† — Soft drink powder — 1 1 1 — Soup — 8 8 7 1 Soup, cream of tomato — 1 1 1 — Spice, mixed — 1 1 1 — Spaghetti in tomato sauce with cheese — 1 1 1 — Splendo — 1 1 1 — Steak & Kidney Pie — 1 1 1 — Steak & Kidney Pudding — 1 1 1 — Steak, with gravy, stewed — 1 1 1 — Steak, stewed — 1 1 — 1 Suet, beef — 1 1 1 — Sugarless pastilles — 1 1 1 — Sunny Spread — 1 1 1 — Sweets & Confectionery 1 24 25 21* 3 Table Cream — 1 1 1 — Tomato juice — 2 2 2 — Tomato Ketchup — 3 3 3 — Tomato paste — 1 1 1 — Tomato puree — 3 3 3 — Turkey, minced — 1 1 1 — Vegetable juices — 2 2 2 — Vinegar, malt — 2 2 2 — Vinegar, non-brewed — 1 1 — 1 Vinegarine — 2 2 — 2 Vitamin mineral capsules — 1 1 1 — Whipped Cream Bon- Bons — 1 1 1 — Whisky, chocolate — 1 1 1 — Totals 4 314 318 286 32 * Sample broken in transit. † Sample not reported. 33 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The following cases were taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955.

Altogether 3,534 inspections and observations have been made for various purposes under the Act during the year. The following contraventions were noted:— Failure to exhibit prescribed notices 244 Failure to keep records 77 Conditions of employment 45 Arrangements for Health and Welfare 47 Closing hours 5 Other matters 1 34 (b) Legal Proceedings. Offence Section Result (i) Failing to allow a weekly half-holiday Section 17(1) Fined £1 (ii) Employing a young person more than the normal maximum working hours Section 24 Fined £3 (iii) Record of hours worked not kept in the prescribed manner Section 32(2) Fined £2 (iv) Failing to exhibit Abstract of Provisions Section 32(3) Fined £1 (v) Sunday trading Section 47 Case dismissed Section 55 No costs awarded (ix) The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. 88 inspections were made of premises where heating appliances were exposed for sale and as a result of these visits four appliances were found not to conform with the standards prescribed. These were withdrawn from sale. I have to report that the appliances found not to conform with the Act were passed by the manufacturers as complying with the Regulations. At my request modifications have now been made to the guards, giving greater strength, etc., and the manufacturers have given assurances that more attention will be given in their final inspection to ensure there will be no further breaches of the Act. However, breaches will continue to occur, until each appliance is separately tested before leaving the factory. Enquiries show that only sample tests are made. (x) The Fabrics (Misdescription) Act, 1913. The Regulations dated 20th January, 1914 and 12th February, 1914 made under Section 1 of the Act are revoked and have been superseded by the Fabrics (Misdescription) Regulations 1959, which came into force on the 11th May, 1959. These regulations prescribe new standards of non-inflammability for textile fabrics to which is attributed the quality of non-inflammable or safety from fire or any degree of that quality. The Act applies to fabrics either in the piece or made up into garments. Enquiries have been made of the many fabric dealers in the borough and it has been ascertained there is but a small quantity of materials which carry the warranty of non-inflammability. Children's non-inflammable nightdresses are not in demand by reason of (a) the high cost (b) the hardness of the material and less dainty appeal. (xi) Clean Air Act, 1956. (a) Smoke Control Areas Preliminary surveys have been carried out in various parts of the district with a view to the establishment of "smoke control areas" at some future date. Joint meetings have also been held with neighbouring authorities to explore the possibilities of establishing joint areas. 35 The Council have adopted the Building Byelaw, referred to in Section 24 of the Act, requiring the installation of approved heating and cooking appliances, capable of burning approved smokeless fuel, in all new buildings. (b) Atmospheric Pollution The Council has continued to co-operate in the scheme, conducted by the Fuel Research Station, for recording atmospheric pollution. A Rain Deposit Gauge is situated on the roof of the Town Hall. This instrument is used to measure the rainfall in inches per month, and to estimate the amount of suspended pollutants in the air in the form of soluble and insoluble matter. A Lead Peroxide instrument is situated at North Road, Havering, this records the amount of Sulphur Dioxide in milligrams deposited per day on 100 sq. c.m. T' se recordings are taken monthly and the records for 1959 are set out on Table 14. 1959 was an exceedingly dry year, there being only 12.30 inches of rain for the whole year, this being 14.64 inches less than during the year 1958. aturally, the total amount of solid matter deposited was 10.65 tons per square mile less than the previous year. (xii) Public Baths There is one Public Bath situated in Romford, which was opened in 190< The swimming bath is 70 feet long by 30 feet wide. The water for the swimming bath is obtained from a well situated in the curtilag'e of the baths. This water is filtered and heated with Break-Point Chlorination, and has a turnover every 2½ hours. The temperature of the water is maintained at 76°F. The maximum load for the swimming bath is 100 persons, the bath is very well patronised and during the high season admission has to be restricted. Both Chemical and Bacteriological samples are taken from the well and bath at frequent intervals and the results of the examinations have always been satisfactory. In addition to the swimming bath, hip baths are also available for the use of the public. Although the baths are old they are maintained in a very satisfactory manner. It is appreciated by the Council that the present bath does not meet the demands of the ratepayers and plans are being made to establish one or two more baths in different parts of the Borough. 36 TABLE 14 ATMOSPHERIC POLUTION.

Rent Act, 1957. This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, and replaced the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. The object of that part of the Act, which imposes duties on the Health Department, is to permit owners of controlled properties to increase the rents to a sum equal to twice the gross rateable value, provided the house is kept in a satisfactory state of repair. During the year the Public Health Inspectors made 314 inspections in connection with the requirements of the Act. These inspections dealt with applications for Certificates of Disrepair, checking Undertakings made by owners, and inspecting the works carried out to remedy the defects and disrepair. The following is a summary of the matters dealt with during the year:— Number of applications for Certificates 43 Number of Certificates issued 10 Number of Certificates cancelled 12 Number of Undertakings accepted 31 Number of applications for Certificates as to remedying of defects, "Form O" 30 Number of Certificates as to remedying of defects:— Granted "Form P" 20 Refused 10 39 5. PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES (i) Notifiable Diseases Those notifications where the diagnosis has been altered after a period of observation, or after investigation have not been recorded. If, however, the diagnosis has proved to be of another type of infection, which is notifiable, this has been suitably recorded, and the amendment has been sent to the Registrar-General at the end of the appropriate quarter. (a) Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis This year, only one notification was received, and it was indicated that the condition was paralytic. The history did not suggest Poliomyelits-the child showed a limp for one day only, following a knock on the leg, and as he had recovered within 24 hours he was not admitted to hospital. In point of fact, it would appear that there were no cases during 1959. Our immunising campaign against this condition should go a long way towards keeping the disease in check. In connection with this campaign, 5,685 children under the age of 15 years received a course of two injections, and in addition, 17,330 received a "booster" dose. Likewise, 7,900 adolescents received two injections, and 4,393 a "booster" dose. Furthermore, 1,134 expectant mothers received two injections, and 433 a "booster" dose. (b) Acute Infective Hepatitis. This is a condition which is notifiable in the Eastern Region. Altogether, there were four notifications. (c) Diphtheria. Once again, I have to report an absence of Diphtheria from the district, and this again can, in large measure be attributed to our scheme of immunisation. Th following statistics relate to the state of immunisation at 31st December. In addition to the initial series of injections, "booster" doses have been given. TABLE 16 Under 5 years 5-15 years Number of children who had completed a full course of Immunisation at any time up to 31st December, 1959, and who were born between 31st December, 1944 and 31st December, 1959 5,384 16,955 40 (d) Dysentery. Forty-two cases of Dysentery were notified. Thirty six of these were due to Shigella Sonnei, and six were unclassified. (e) Food Poisoning. During the year, 35 cases were notified, which proved to be suffering from food poisoning. In addition 22 proved indefinite. The following table sets out details, as required by the Ministry of Health. TABLE 17 (a) Total number of outbreaks 5 (b) Total number of cases included in (a) 18 (c) Number of single cases 52 (d) Number of deaths Nil Cl. welchii Sal. Typhi-Murium Staphylococci Sal. Thompson Unknown (e) (i) Organisms responsible (ii) Outbreaks attributable to (i) 1 3 1 Nil Nil (iii) Single cases attributable to (i) Nil 26 3 1 22 On the 14th September, my attention was drawn to cases of Food Poisoning amongst the Canteen Staff at a school in the district. On investigation, it was ascertained that, of 15 members of the staff who had partaken of the mid-day meal on the 11th September, 10 had mild gastric pains and diarrhoea early in the morning of the 12th September. These symptoms lasted for a few hours and all were better by the 14th September. Samples of food partaken were sent for bacteriological examination, and also specimen samples from the patients. Those from the beef, and from some of the patients, showed evidence of Clostridium welchii. Although approximately 600 children also partook of the same meal, none were affected, and it is difficult to give any explanation of this. (f) Measles. Measles, which was in epidemic form during the latter part of 1958, continued in this form during the first few months of the present year. Altogether, throughout the year, 2,260 cases were notified. (g) Scarlet Fever. The notifications numbered 206, and the type continued mild, as it has now been for many years. (h) Smallpox. No cases occurred, and no contacts required to be kept under surveillance. Table 18 gives the statistics, relative to Vaccination, as recorded by the General Practitioners. 41 TABLE 18 Vaccinated: Under 6 months 334 Between the ages of 6 months and 1 year of age 208 Between the ages of 1 and 2 years 89 Between the ages of 2 and 5 years 75 Between the ages of 5 and 15 years 135 Over 15 years 77 Re- Vaccinated: Under 1 year of age — Between the ages of 1 and 2 years 1 Between the ages of 2 and 5 years 17 Between the ages of 5 and 15 years 97 Over 15 years 216 (i) Tuberculosis. The scheme, whereby B.C.G. is offered, with parental consent to children at the age of 13 years was continued and extended to cover a few who were just under 13 years, and also, to those of 14 years and upwards. The results were as follows:— TABLE 19 Number of pupils tuberculin tested 850 Number found to be positive 66 Number found to be negative 784 Number who received B.C.G. 784 (j) Whooping Cough. Altogether 24 cases were notified, and during 1959, 1,179 children received immunisation injections. (ii) Non-Notifiable The particulars of these are set out below, and the figures are compiled from the school returns. As they are not notifiable, however, the general prevalence is unknown.
