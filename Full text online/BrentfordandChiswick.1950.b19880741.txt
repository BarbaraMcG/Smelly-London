To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 23rd Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary circumstances of the population of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick. The health of the people continued to be good. The birth rate fell from 16.19 in 1949 to 14.82 in 1950. This figure has continued to fall since 1946 and is this year lower than the average for the whole of England and Wales, which is 15.8. t The death rate rose from 10.98 in 1949 to 11.75 in 1950. The principal increase during this year appears to be in deaths from circulatory diseases. The corresponding national figure was 11.6. The infant mortality rate which has been falling since 1947 showed a drop from 23.78 in 1949 to 22.37 in 1950 and is the lowest infant mortality rate ever recorded in this Borough. Graph A in the text shows in pictorial form the dramatic fall in this rate during the last 50 years. The figures for tuberculosis do not give rise to so much satisfaction however. While the number of new notifications has dropped from 110 to 108, the number of deaths occurring during the year has risen from 25 in 1949 to 34 in 1950. In 6 cases the disease had not been notified before death and it is possible that these patients did not seek advice with regard to their health until it was too late for curative treatment to be of any effect. Of the 34 deaths 14 were aged over 55 and 3 had reached the age of 70 or over. Of these 5 had been suffering from the disease for periods of from 6 to 20 years. Reference to the text will show an analysis of the new notifications of 1950 in occupations and with regard to housing conditions and overcrowding in the homes of the patients. Neither overcrowding nor any single type of occupation can be seen as a predominating factor in the incidenc e of new cases of tuberculosis during this year although statistical conclusions cannot be fairly drawn on one year's figure analysis. More intensive work is being carried out in the department in order to obtain more information with regard to the occurrence of multiple cases in individual premises and it is hoped that fuller information with regard to this matter may be available for next year's Annual Report. - 7 - The incidence of infectious disease was less during 1950, the number of notifications being 414 as compared with 652 in 19490 This was principally due to the smaller number of measles notifications. Points of note from the infectious disease figures are that one case of typhoid fever, presumably infected abroad, developed the disease here, but no second case of infection occurred; the number of cases of poliomyelitis occurring was 9,4 of whom developed some degree of paralysis requiring after-treatment. With regard to the Hygiene of Food the Borough Council adopted the new Bye-Laws for the Handling, Wrapping and Delivery of Food and the Sale of Food in the Open Air. The amount of food poisoning in the Borough was limited to 6 notifications of isolated cases and one small outbreak involving 20 persons but of a minor nature, no persons concerned being ill more than 4 days. A start was made on the complete survey of all Catering Establishments in the Borough to ascertain the sanitary conditions maintained on these premises and to effect such improvements as might be required.. Health propaganda was continuous throughout the year by means of personal communications, talks to groups and displays of topical posters on health subjects. The film on Poliomyelitis was shown to a large representative audience. In connection with the care of Old People it is of interest to note that provision of a Meals on Wheels Service was begun at the latter end of the year. This should be of considerable value to the aged and chronic sick especially if later the number of meals should be extended to more than one a week as is the present provision. The work of the Sanitary Inspectors continued to be heavy throughout the year, both as a result of complaints received in the department concerning defective housing, overcrowding, nuisances, unsound food etc., and in their routine inspections of the sanitary conditions of the Borough. A great deal of improvement was made without reference to Statutory authority although legal enforcement had to be used in six cases for repairs to defective properties and in three cases with regard to unsound food. A station for the investigation of atmospheric pollution was brought into operation at the Public Health Department in August, 1950 and regular observations have been taken from that date. Provision was made for a further station to be set up in the Brentford district to commence operation in January, 1951. In the text will be found graphs demonstrating the results of these observations and also comparisons with the results of other districts. The most interesting fact that appears from these graphs is the great drop in pollution during the summer months when domestic fires are at a minimum, although factories are working at near normal pressure. - 8 - I should like to take this opportunity of thanking all the members of the Health Department staff not only for their assistance in the preparation of this report but for all their efficient and willing service throughout the year. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Margant G.Glass Medical Officer of Health - 9 - GENERAL STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE BOROUGH, 1950 Area in acres (including 116 acres of foreshore of River Thames and 24 acres of inland water) 2,449*5 Population - Census 1931 62,617 Population - Registrar-General's Estimate for area (mid 1950) 60,320 Population - Census 1951 59,354 Number of Inhabited Houses according to Rate Book 15,269 Rateable Value at 1.4.1950 £702,992 Sum produced by 1d. Rate £2,835 The Borough is divided into nine Wards: Brentford; Brentford East Brentford West Brentford Central Chiswick: Chiswick Park Grove Park Bedford Park Gunnersbury Old Chiswick Turnham Green. The houses in the district are occupied by a mixed type population including artisans, factory workers, clerical and professional people of all grades, and the types of dwelling vary from small working class property to detached residences of fair size. Some of the old property has deteriorated partly through age and partly through effects of war damage to such an extent that it will require to be demolished when the housing situation will allow. The proportion of this type of home is not great. The problem of overcrowding in the Borough while still presenting some difficulties, is not of the very distressing nature found in certain other parts of London. It will be noted that on population figures the average number of persons per inhabited house amounts to 4. - 10 - Parks and Open Spaces controlled by the Council Area in Acres Boston Manor Park and Island 40.7 Carville Hall Park South 5.8 Carville Hall Park North 10.3 St. Paul's Recreation Ground 4.3 The Ham recreation Ground 1.3 Chiswick Common South 8.7 Chiswick House 65.9 Stamford Brook Common 2.5 Homefields Recreation Ground 10.2 Strand Open Space 2.5 Turnham Green Common 7.5 Duke's Meadows Sports Ground 19.9 Embankment Promenade 12.5 Future Embankment Promenade 15.3 Swimming Baths Controlled by the Council Brentford Indoor Swimming Baths Area 2,430 sq.ft.

The principal causes of death were:- Circulatory Diseases 184 Heart Disease 152 Cancer 112 During the year a new system of classification of causes of death was brought into use for Doctors and Coroners, the RegistrarGeneral and Medical Officers of Health dealing with vital statistics. The system is an international one with much more detail than in the previous classification. An interesting immediate result to be observed from the annual figures after the commencement of this new form of classification is a change of the principal cause of death in the statistics of this Borough. In 1949, the largest number of deaths were classified as "Heart Disease". In 1950, "the major cause is seen to be "Circulatory Disease". These two causes are obviously interrelated showing that a clearer definition of the primary factor of fatality has altered the proportion of the individual items. The total number of deaths from heart diseases added to those from circulatory diseases gives a higher combined total in 1950, i.e. 336 as compared with 280 in 1949. There is a drop of 10 in the number of deaths from cancer but the figure for tuberculosis deaths shows rather a disturbing rise from 25 in 1949 to 34 in 1950. 32 of these deaths were respiratory tuberculosis and two non-respiratory. This rise, following on a dramatic fall during the previous year, is a serious set-back although the number of tuberculosis notifications during 1950 was not increased, being 108 as compared with 110 new notifications in 1949. Page 30 shows in graphic form the progress of tuberculosis in the Borough since 1930. The local death rate compares with a national figure of 11.6.

This compares with a National Birth Rate figure of 15.8. INFANT MORTALITY The number of premature infants born in 1950 was 31. Of the 5 were born at home, all survived to the end of one month. 26 we born in hospital, of whom 20 survived to the end of one month. There were 851 legitimate births and 43 illegitimate births in the Borough during 1950 and 20 deaths of infants under one year of age were recorded. The INFANT MORTALITY RATE PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS in 1950 is, therefore, 22.37. The causes of death of the 20 infants under one year of age together with the actual ages at death are set out in Table II on page 21. The infant mortality rate 22.37 shows again a reduction from the figure of the previous year which was 23.78. This fall has been continuous for years now and this year's figure is the lowest yet recorded. The graph on page 20 shows the decline in infant mortality from the year 1900 in five year periods. The local figure compares with the National Infant Mortality Rate of 29.8 and so is well below the average for England and Wales. - 19 - GRAPH "A" GRAPH SHOVING INFANTILE MORTALITY HATES DURING THE PERIOD 1900 - 1950 - 20 - TABLE 11 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1950 Net deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year Under 1 day 1 day 2 days 3 days 4 days 5 days 6 days 7-14 days 14 - 21 21 - 28 1-2 mths 2 months 3 months 4 months 5 months 6 months 7 months 8 months 9 months 10 months 11-12 mths Total under 1 year Chicken Pox - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Measles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Scarlet Fever - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Whooping Cough - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Diphtheria or Group - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Erysipelas - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculous Meningitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Abdominal Tuberculosis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Other Tuberculous Diseases - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Meninigitis (Non-T.B.) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Convulsions - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Laryngitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Bronchitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Pneumonia (all forms) - - 1 - - - - - - 2 - 2 - 1 - - - - - - - 6 Diarrhoea - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Enteritis - — — - - — - - — - - — 1 1 - - - - - - - 2 Gastritis — — — — — — — — — — — — ~ — - — — — — — — — Rickets - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Suffocation (Overlying) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - — - - Injury at Birth 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 Atelectasis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 Congenital Malformation 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 Premature Birth 3 1 - 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - 6 Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Pemphigus Neonatorum - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Smallpox - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Other Causes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - TOTALS 5 2 1 3 - - - - - 2 - 2 1 2 1 - - 1 - - - 20 - 21 - TABLE III MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis NONE Other Causes NONE The following table shows the number of maternal deaths connected with pregnancy during the last 10 years:- Year Died from Sepsis Died from other causes connected with pregnancy 1941 - — 1942 - 2 1943 3 2 1944 - 2 1945 - - 1946 - 3 1947 - 1 1948 - ~ 1949 - 1950 - - During the year 18 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified; there were no maternal deaths. It is satisfactory to note that for three years in succession there have been no deaths associated with child birth. The figure for Puerperal Pyrexia notifications which appears very high is off-set by the fact that 13 of the notified cases we admitted from other areas to the local hospital. The actual figures for Puerperal Pyrexia cases belonging to the Borough is 5, all of whom made an uneventful recovery. - 22 - TABLE IV PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES NOTIFIABLE DISEASES DURING THE YEAR 1950 Disease Total cases notified Cases admitted to hospital Total deaths Scarlet Fever 50* (64) 25 (39) - (-) Whooping Cough 33 (4 5) 1 (8) - (-) Diphtheria - (-) — (-) - (-) Measles 269† (511) 8 (18) - (-) Pneumonia (notifiable) 15 (22) 1 (14) 32‡ (31)‡ Typhoid Fever 1 (-) 1 (-) - (-) Dysentery 9 (-) 6 (-) - (-) Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 (-) 2 (-) - (-) Puerperal Pyrexia 18 (3) 18 (3) - (-) Smallpox — (-) - (-) - (-) Erysipelas 2 (2) 2 (2) - (-) Meningococcal Infection — - — - Food Poisoning 6 (1) 3 (-) - (-) Malaria - (-) - (-) - (-) Acute Encephalitis Infective — - — - - - Post-Infectious - - - - - - Acute Poliomyelitis:- Paralytic 5 ) (4) 5 ) (4) - ) (-) Non-Paralytic 4≠ ) 3 ) - ) Totals 414 (652) 75 (88) 32 (31) *In addition, one case originally notified and admitted to hospital was subsequently diagnosed not Scarlet Fever. ≠ In addition, one case originally notified and admitted to hospital was subsequently diagnosed not Non-Paralytic Poliomyelitis. † In addition, one case originally notified and admitted to hospital was subsequently diagnosed not Measles.. ‡ Includes deaths from non-notifiable pneumonia.

The typhoid fever patient was likely to have obtained his infection daring a walking tour of the Pyrenees from which he returned shortly before developing the symptoms of this disease. During the year, notification was received of five persons who had been in contact with cases of smallpox. These were kept under supervision for the required period and no disease developed. Of the nine cases of poliomyelitis notified, four were nonparalytic and uncomplicated and one case of paralytic poliomyelitis had the diagnosis subsequently changed to non-paralytic. The other four cases were affected with paralysis to a limited extent and all required subsequent physiotherapy, details being as follows:- Case A (Adult). - Improved greatly .- still weakness of left leg having treatment and appliances from Stanmore Orthopaedic Hospital, and has resumed work in his former occupation as motor driver. Case B (Adult). - Improved but developed tuberculosis and is now in hospital where treatment for limitation of movement of left arm and shoulder due to poliomyelitis is being carried out. Case C (Schoolchild). - Improvement but still residual paralysis of right leg - attends Stanmore Orthopaedic Hospital. Case D (Adult). - Practically complete recovery - no further treatment required. Of the four cases of poliomyelitis in 1949 only one continued at the end of the year to show residual paralysis. The patient (an infant) continued to improve throughout 1950 under the care of the County Council Physiotherapy Department at Brentford. -27- TABLE IX LABORATORY WORK The following table sets out a record of the bacteriological work during the year 1950:- Nature of Specimen Result Positive Negative Total Diphtheria - swabs - 200 200 Tuberculosis - sputa - 5 5 Scarlet Fever Contacts - swabs 1 21 22 Faeces etc. 2 3 5 Totals 3 229 232 TABLE X TUBERCULOSIS - 1950 Age Groups New Gases Deaths Respiratory Nonrespiratory Respiratory NonRespiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Under 1 year — 1 - - — — — — 1-5 years 4 2 1 3 - - 1 5-15 years 3 2 - - - 1 — - 15-25 years 10 13 1 - 2 2 - — 25-35 years 18 10 2 3 3 3 - - 35-45 years 11 7 - - 1 2 - - 45-55 years 7 1 - - 3 2 - - 55-65 years 3 2 - - 6 3 - 1 65 yrs and over 3 1 — 4 — - Totals 59 39 4 6 19 13 1 1 Of the 34 recorded deaths, 28 were previously notified as cases of Tuberculosis, 6 had not been so notified. -28- TABLE XI TABLE OF TUBERCULOSIS CASES IN YEARS Year NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory NonRespiratory Total Respiratory NonRespiratory Total M F M F M F M F 1930 37 37 5 10 89 20 22 2 3 47 1931 38 34 7 6 85 24 17 1 7 49 1932 40 31 8 8 87 28 12 3 4 47 1933 34 44 10 2 90 33 26 5 1 65 1934 49 42 4 7 102 49 42 3 3 97 1935 46 47 3 5 101 21 15 5 1 42 1936 40 33 4 5 82 26 24 1 2 53 1937 38 46 9 9 102 22 13 1 3 39 1938 54 39 8 7 108 29 8 2 2 41 1939 36 33 9 7 85 18 18 2 3 41 1940 42 27 7 7 83 20 10 3 5 38 1941 52 25 3 3 83 23 12 5 2 42 1942 42 36 1 8 87 14 12 - 2 28 1943 52 29 3 5 89 25 11 - 1 37 1944 57 39 3 7 106 16 11 3 4 34 1945 46 41 9 6 102 18 11 1 2 32 1946 68 49 5 7 129 23 6 2 5 36 I947 62 36 4 4 106 30 8 - - 38 1948 61 47 1 6 115 18 16 2 3 39 1949 53 44 6 7 110 13 7 3 2 25 1950 59 39 4 6 108 19 13 1 1 34 -29- GRAPH "B" GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1930 - 1950 -30- TABLE XII OCCUPATIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1950 Male Female Buyer's Deputy — 1 Chauffeur 1 - Clerk 4 3 Commercial Artist 1 - Compositor 1 - Cook 1 - Customs and Excise Officer 1 - Domestic - 1 Dry Cleaner 1 - Education Officer 1 - Electrician 1 - Engineer 5 - Estate Agent 1 - Factory Worker 3 1 Furniture Remover 1 - Grocer 1 - H.

In 5 cases the housing was unsatisfactory or dilapidated and in 14 cases there was overcrowding. Special attention was paid to the overcrowded houses and bad property to ascertain the incidence of secondary cases of infection which might be attributable to these conditions. It is very interesting to note that on this year's notifications as far as can be ascertained from the information which we have been able to obtain up to the present time, no single family in which more than one member is a notified case of tuberculosis is living in housing conditions which are dilapidated, insanitary or overcrowded. Of the 33 remaining cases of tuberculosis notified, 8 cases removed from the district and 2 died before information could be obtained, 6 cases were not notified until death, and of the remaining cases, information was unobtainable for reasons of no access to premises and unwillingness on the part of the patient or relative to communicate information, etc. TABLE XIII FOOD POISONING OUTBREAKS Total Number of outbreaks Number of cases Number of deaths Organisms or other agents responsible with number of outbreaks attributable to each Foods involved with number of outbreaks associated with each Outbreaks due to Identified Agents. - - - — - Outbreaks of Undiscovered Cause. 1 20 - Steak pie suspect(not proven) Single Cases. — 6 — Not identified Not identified -32- HYGIENE OF FOOD Food Poisoning: There were six cases of Food Poisoning notified during the year. These were notified on symptoms alone and bacteriological examination revealed no causative organisms in any of the cases. The cases were widely separated and there was no article of food taken in common by the individuals concerned- All recovered rapidly and were more properly to be described as "cases of digestive disturbance". On 5th October information was received that a number of children attending Staveley Jtoad Schools were suffering from digestive symptoms suggesting food poisoning., Other cases occurred later, the total number amounting to 20° The main symptom was vomiting and 15 of the cases had recovered on 6th October. All were recovered by the 9th October. The only foods which had been partaken of by all the patients were steak pie and gravy. The steak pie had been completely consumed but a sample of the gravy, which had been prepared separately, was taken and bacteriologically examined, but showed no infective organisms. Investigations were made at the Cambridge Road Kitchen where school meals are prepared. It was ascertained that 390 to 400 persons were at risk of whom only 20 developed illness. Two food employees were excluded temporarily from work in the kitchen, one suffering from a cut finger - non-septic, and one from very slight nasal catarrh- There were no subsequent occurrences of intestinal trouble at the school. Bye-laws relating to the Handling, Wrapping and Delivery of Food and the Sale of Food in the Open Air: On 13th November, 1950, these Bye-laws came into force in the Borough. They are based on Model Bye-laws issued by the Ministry of Food, and extend to a certain degree the local powers of the Council to punish persons offending against certain elementary rules of hygiene. While in exceptional cases it may be necessary to bring persistent offenders to court for judgment, the policy of the Health Department has been to improve by persuasion and example, and with the friendly co-operation of food traders and handlers of food of all grades, I am of the opinion that we have in the past obtained, and can continue to obtain, much more in the way of improvement of hygienic method than by the extensive use of legal power. Unsound Food: Certain articles of contaminated food were brought to the Department by ratepayers during the year. In all such cases the person exposing the unsound food for sale is considered responsible by law and three prosecutions for the sale of unsound food were instigated by the Council during 1950 - all were successful, the tradesmen concerned being fined. Ten other cases were investigated. Two warning letters were sent to the Firms concerned, and in eight cases the complaints were not substantiated. -33- During these investigations the Sanitary Inspectors were often able to procure in the establishments concerned improvements above statutory requirements, and this was very useful sanitary work. Catering Establishments: The complete inspection of all catering establishments and licensed premises in the Borough was commenced during 195^ and was still progressing at the end of the year. A full report of the results obtained will be available for the 1951 report. Free Washing Facilities in Public Conveniences: Representations from the Public Health Committee were made to the Borough Council towards the end of the year for the consideratior of free washing facilities in public conveniences. Although this would be for the use of all ratepayers the principle involved was that food handlers, such as milk roundsmen, delivery boys etc. should be encouraged towards personal cleanliness by the availability of this amenity. The Borough Council agreed to consider making provision for this service in its forthcoming estimates. GENERAL HEALTH PROPAGANDA During the year propaganda on Health was continous. Members of the Staff gave lectures to Societies, also talks to individuals and small groups of persons during visits paid to homes, Schools, Factories, Catering Establishments, Food Shops, etc. Posters dealing with health subjects of topical interest were displayed on Borough notice boards; a new supply with change of subject was obtained every two monthso A film on Poliomyelitis diagnosis and management was shown in January to the Public relations Council of the Borough and representatives from the various Societies and Voluntary Associations. Dr. Bradley of the Ministry of Health attended in order to explain any technical matters of the film which might be a little advanced for a non-expert audience, and he answered all questions raised by viewers. The film appeared to arouse great interest. An Industrial Exhibition was held in the Borough during April, 1950, in which the Borough Council took great interest and authorised preparation of departmental exhibits showing the appropriate activities of each department. A stand with an illustrated alphabet to cover the major types of work carried out by the staff of the Health Department was exhibited and a leaflet was distributed to the public containing further information. Certain pathological specimen were also displayed and members of the Staff were available during tb period of the Exhibition to explain the exhibits to members of the public and to answer any questions concerning hygiene. -34- WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE During 1950 eleven cases of elderly people living in neglected conditions and likely to be in need of removal under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act were investigated. In no case was it found that there was unwillingness on the part of the patient to accept hospital or hostel accommodation although one patient having been admitted to hospital had previously discharged himself against advice. All cases were cleared by the end of the year, four having been admitted to hospital, two to a nursing home, one to the care of relatives, one was found dead in bed before removal could be effected, three were found capable of remaining in their homes provided adequate assistance of the nature of Home Help, District Nursing and Meals from the Meals Service was forthcoming. Excellent co-operation was obtained from the County Council Welfare Officer, hospital Almoners, and the County Council District Nursing and Home Help Staffs. There is an active Old People's Welfare Committee in the Borough and when special requirements in the way of bedding etc. have been required for cases, it has been possible to obtain them through this Committee or through the Brentford Philanthropic or the Chiswick Philanthropic Societies. The ready acquisition of these articles has in one or two cases meant that Home Help could succeed in carrying out immediate cleansing of the very dirty and/or verminous persons who might otherwise have required to be removed under the provisions of the National Assistance Act, Section 47, thus preventing the hold up of a hospital or hostel bed more appropriately of use for an infirm case0 In April, 1950, a scheme was started whereby Old Age Pensioners could obtain slipper baths at the Public Baths establishments at reduced charges, i.e. 2d per bathe 852 baths were taken under this scheme in Chiswick and 34 in Brentford. Meals on Wheels: In December, 1950, Old People's Welfare Committee commenced a service of Meals on Wheels. The meals are prepared at the Corporation Staff Canteen and carried in containers to the homes of the aged or elderly chronic sick. Before the scheme came into operation the local medical practitioners, local hospitals, Area Medical Officer and those Voluntary Associations dealing specifically with the Care of the Aged lere informed and asked to submit the names of suitable persons who would obtain benefit from the service. A charge of 1/- per meal was to be made but in necessitous cases the meal could be provided free. It is hoped that this service will be °f great benefit to the home-bound aged. -35- CARAVANS AND OTHER MOVEABLE DWELLINGS The survey of Garavans and Moveable Dwellings commenced in 1949 was completed during 1950. A total of 20 barges and houseboats and 47 caravans were inspected. The majority of the dwellings were found to have suitable and sufficient water supply, arrangements for refuse disposal and sewage disposal and to be in all respects suitable as temporary dwellings, though a number of them were not to be recommended for permanent accommodation for families with children. Where application for rehousing had been made by occupants this could be supported in many cases by the Health Committee on the grounds of Statutory overcrowding according to housing standards. (No definition has ever been laid down of the space requirements in dwellings of this type). Subsequently 4 families overcrowded in this way were rehoused, while 12 remain to be rehoused. The Committee was asked to pay special attention to the conditions obtaining at Workhouse Dock, the dwellings there had no individual water supply, no arrangements for refuse collection, and there is no doubt that some of the sewage disposal is by tipping into the Dock. A bacteriological examination of the Dock water gave the following result Sample Uo. Plate Count Goliforma Type Workhouse Dock Over 1800 plus B. Coli II East 5 million and B. Pyocyaneus Workhouse Dock Over 1800 plus Faecal Type 1 West 5 million Botli unsatisfactory. Under Town and Country Planning it is likely that action will be taken for the total removal of all caravans in the Borough„ The nuisance at Workhouse Dock has not been abated as it has beet impossible to ascertain the rightful owner of this property and it is still necessary to decide on the correct legal action to be taken. Observations have continued and the tenants warned of the risk they are taking if they persist in fouling the Dock waters. It is hoped that stronger action can be taken before long. -36- ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION During 1950 the first station for the investigation of atmospheric pollution was set up at the Health Department premises, Turnham Green. After a trial period routine observations were taken daily from 1st August. Measurements of the smoke contamination and of the quantity of sulphur dioxide pollution of the air were recorded for each 24 hours period. The figures in addition to being reported to the Committee are sent to the Fuel research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial research who thereupon compare the degree of pollution with those that obtain in all other areas of the country sharing in the experiment. The second station at Glifden Hoad Baths, Brentford was prepared for recordings to be taken as from 1st January, 195l« Results obtained for the last five months of 1950 from the Chiswick Station are as follows:- Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec. Highest Daily Average Sulphur Dioxide 0.030 0.05l 0.l64 0.300 0.219 Smoke 0.093 0.120 0.304 0.446 0.462 Monthly Average Sulphur Dioxide 0.019 0.026 0.061 0.074 0.103 Smoke 0.039 0.040 0.115 0.165 0.205 In these figures smoke is shown as milligrammes per cubic metre of air and sulphur dioxide as parts per million volumes of air. The graph on page 38 shows the gradual rise in pollution during the latter months of the year which was to be expected. It was rather interesting to compare the local results with those from other parts of the country as published in the monthly bulletins of the Department of Scientific and Industrial itesearch. In graph D the results from Leeds, Central London and Lerwick are compared with the Chiswick figure for smoke, and it will be observed that the local result comes half way between the pure air of a completely free district and that of Central London. In the Department,.complaints are received from time to time concerning specific pollution by smoke from factories etc., and it is significant that the results for Chiswick during the month of August, when domestic fires would be at a minimum although factories would be working almost at Winter level, are very good indeed. It is early as yet to deduce much from the results obtained and a more useful picture should be available as a result of the 1951 full twelve months recordings at stations in separate parts of the Borough with different atmospheric pollution problems. - 37 - VARIATION in avekage weekly concentkations of smoke and SULPHUK BTOXIDE IN CHISWICK FKOM THE COMMENCEMENT OF INVESTIGATIONS lST AUGUST, 1950 UNTIL 31ST DECEMBER, 1950 GKAPH "C" -38- GRAPH "D" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE IN THE AlR AT CHISWIGK, CENTRAL LONDON, LEEDS AND LERWICK -39- ESTABLISHMENTS FOn MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Eight establishments were inspected for licence under this heading and all were iound to be satisfactory for the purpose which was intended.

There are no standpipes now remaining in the district for the supply of persons inhabiting dwelling houses. There are two wells in the Borough and the following is the position with regard to these wells:- (i) Mr. A. Knapp, 21 Grove Park Gardens - well working but used for washing purposes only. Drinking water is obtained direct from mains. (ii) Green's Boat House, Riverside Lands - well working but used for washing purposes only. Drinking water is obtained direct from mains. The mains water supply is satisfactory both in quality and quantity and reports of the bacteriological and chemical analyses carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of by collecting freighters to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough. HOUSING 34 inspections of cases of alleged overcrowding were investigated by the Department during the year - 15 on behalf of other authorities. Of the remaining 19 cases, 16 were found to be Statutorily overcrowded or required rehousing for health reasons and were accordingly notified to the Housing Department in order that the claim for rehousing might be supported on hygienic grounds. -42- DISINFECTION Premises disinfected:- Ordinary notifiable diseases 46 Phthisis 16 Cancer 29 Other diseases 10 Rooms stripped and cleansed (Section 167 Public Health Act, 1936) - Premises treated for vermin 22 Premises treated for other pests (wasps, moths, ants and beetles) 29 SLAUGHTERHOUSES Number on the register (including one Knacker's Yard) 5 Contravention of Bye-laws - Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933 (vide Livestock (Restrictions on Slaughter) Order, 1940) Number of Licences to slaughter animals issued during the year:- New Licences - Renewed Licences - MILK During 1950 the following licences were issued under the Regulations mentioned:- Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 Dealer's Licences 40 Supplementary Licences 19 Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 Dealer's Licences 20 Supplementary Licences 10 Routine inspection of dairies was carried out in order to maintain the standard laid down by the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the condition of such premises. -43- ICE CREAM Sampling of Ice Cream: 83 samples of Ice Cream were taken during the year and examined bacteriologically. As a result of these tests the ice creams were graded as follows Grade I 56 Grade II 16 Grade III 6 Grade IV 5 No cases occurred during the yea1 of ice cream in such poor bacteriological condition as to require the stoppage of sale. The Grades III and IV samples totalling eleven in all were obtained from one firm only. This firm was kept under observation and advice given. Sampling subsequent to mid-October produced only Grade I and Grade II results suggesting that the difficulty had been overcome. BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 17 Contraventions of Factory Acts - There is one underground bakehouse in the Borough which is under observation and which is kept in satisfactory condition. BRENTFORD MARKET The Brentford Market which is a large centre for the wholesale distribution of Fruit, Vegetables and Flowers, was kept under supervision by the District Sanitary Inspectors. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS During the year under review a total of 58 pigs were slaughtered in the Borough. These were all slaughtered under licences issued by the Ministry of Food, were inspected at the time of slaughter and were all found to be in good condition and passed fit for human consumption. No beasts or sheep were slaughtered in the Borough during the year. -44- TABLE XIV Carcases Inspected and Condemned: Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed (if known) - - - - 58 Number inspected - - - - 58 All diseases except Tuberculosis:- Whole carcase condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than Tuberculosis - - - - - Tuberculosis only: Whole carcase condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than Tuberculosis - - - - — A total of 549 inspections of Food Shops and places where food is prepared were carried out during the year.
