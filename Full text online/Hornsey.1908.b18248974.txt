Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Report on the health of the Borough of Hornsey for the year 1908. Hornsey still retains her position as holding the lowest deathrate among the great towns of England and Wales. The corrected death-rate is a little lower than last year, and very nearly the lowest on record. Infectious disease has been less prevalent than in 1907, which was itself much under the average year in the number of cases notified. I should like to call attention also to the extremely low Infantile mortality. This is the lowest ever recorded in Hornsey, or I imagine in any large town. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HAROLD COATES, M.D., D.P.H. 3 BOROUGH OF HORNSEY. Summary of Statistics.

Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, adopted October, 1890. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, Parts 2, 3 and 5 adopted October, 1890. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part 3, adopted July, 1896. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, adopted. Population.—The population of the Borough is estimated by taking the number of occupied houses as shewn by the Rate Books and multiplying this number by the average number of inmates per house as shewn by the last census return. On this basis the estimated population of Hornsey at the middle of 1908 was 90,814. The estimated population at the middle of 1907 on the same basis of calculation was 90,221. This only shews an increase of population for the year of 593. This is much the smallest annual increase yet recorded; the only year to approach it being the year 1904-5, when the increase was 986. 4 The following table shews the yearly increase per cent, for each year since the last census:— Increase of population during the year. Increase per cent. 1901-1902 2,076 2.8 1902-1903 2,829 3.7 1903-1904 5,775 7.3 1904-1905 986 1.5 1905-1906 1,664 1.9 1906-1907 3,344 3.7 1907-1908 593 0.6 The rate of increase for 1907-8 is much below the average. The Registrar General's estimate of the population of Hornsey at the middle of 1908 is 92,713. This estimate is based on the assumption that the rate of increase of population since the last census (1901) is the same as the rate of increase between that census and the preceding one (1891). This method, while fairly accurate in older towns, where the conditions are fairly constant, does not answer so well in the case of suburban areas. Last year there was little difference between the two estimates, but this year the Registrar General's estimate is 1,899 higher than the estimate based on the number of occupied houses. The estimated population at the end of each Quarter of 1908 was as follows:— End of first quarter 90,865 „ second „ 90,347 „ third „ 90,570 „ fourth „ 90,880 The population of the Borough at the census (1901) was 72,056. The increase of population during the years from the date of the census to the middle of 1908 is, therefore, 18,758. This is equal to an annual average increase of 2,587. The increase for the year 1907-8 is little more than one-fifth of the average annual increase of recent years. The "natural increase" of population during the year 1908, i.e., excess of births over deaths, was 752, and as the actual increase is only 593 it is evident that the tide of immigration and emigration has for once resulted in a loss to Hornsey. This is the first time that the actual increase of population has fallen below what is called the "natural increase." During most recent years there has been a large influx of newcomers from other districts, particularly in 1903-4 and in 1906-7. 5 The following table shows the estimated population for each Ward in 1907 and 1908, with the increase or decrease which has taken place in the interval:— Ward. Estimated population, 1907. Estimated population, 1908. Variation during the year, 30th June, 1907, to 30th June, 1908. Increase. Decrease. Highgate 12,801 13,100 299 - Muswell Hill 12,214 12,565 361 - Crouch End 5,723 5,782 59 - West Hornsey 13,732 14,054 322 - East Hornsey 12,979 12,842 - 137 North Haringey 10,285 10,090 - 195 South Haringey 5,872 5,753 - 119 Stroud Green 9,653 9,575 - 78 Finsbury Park 6,962 7,053 91 - The Borough 90,221 90,814 1,122 529 Muswell Hill, West Hornsey and Highgate Wards shew the greatest increases of population, though in these Wards the increases are much less than in the preceding twelve months. Crouch End Ward has a smaller increase of population. In Finsbury Park Ward the population is almost the same as that of two years ago, last year there appeared to be a decrease of 97, and this is now almost counterbalanced by an increase of 91 in 1908. In East Hornsey we have been accustomed to a fairly large annual increase, but this year the estimated population shews a decrease when compared with the estimated population of 1907. North and South Haringey and Stroud Green Wards have usually shewn small increases in population each year. In 1908 the estimated population for each of these Wards is lower than that of a year ago. Density of Population.—The number of persons per acre has increased from 25 at the date of the last census to 31.5 in the middle of 1908. In 1906 the number of persons per acre was 30.2. North Haringey is the highest with a density of 80, and probably South Haringey and Finsbury Park are somewhat understated here. 6 The following table shows the density of population for each Ward:— Ward. Area in acres. Population. Number of persons per acre.

This is a decrease of 39 as compared with the number of births recorded in 1907. Twenty-five of the births were illegitimate. Ten of the births occurred in the Edmonton Workhouse, one in the City of London Lying-in-Hospital and two at other Institutions. The birth-rate for the year was 16.3, the lowest ever recorded in Hornsey. For the last 25 years there has been an almost continuous annual decline in the birth-rate. The number of births and the birth-rate for each quarter of the year is as follows:— 1907. HORNSEY. ENGLAND AND WALES. No. of Births. Birth-rate. Birth-rate. 1st Quarter 375 16.5 27.3 2nd „ 370 16.2 27.7 3rd „ 406 17.8 26.6 4th „ 334 14'.7 24.6 1,485 16.3 26.5 In the first and third quarters the birth-rate was slightly higher than during the corresponding quarters of 1907; it was slightly lower in the fourth quarter and considerably lower during the second quarter. The birth-rate in the 76 Great Towns was 26.9. in the 142 smaller towns was 26.0, and in England and Wales less the 218 towns 26.2. The birth-rates in certain towns are given below:— London and adjoining districts Tottenham 30.2 West Ham 28.8 Willesden 26.1 London 25.4 Croydon 25.4 East Ham 24.8 Finchley 22.2 Hornsey 16.3 8 Middlesbrough 35.9 Wolverhampton 25.8 St. Helen's 34.7 Devonport 25.4 Swansea 33.1 York 25.1 Wigan 32.8 Rochdale 24.6 Walsall 29.6 Huddersfield 24.4 Burnley 28.2 Reading 22.6 Stockport 27.7 Northampton 20.9 Aston Manor 26.1 The following table gives the number of births during the year, and the birth-rate for each Ward of the Borough:— WARD.

In 1907 there were 26 illegitimate births recorded. The proportion of illegitimate births of the total births is a very low one, viz.: 1.6 per cent. Five of the illegitimate births occurred in the Edmonton Workhouse, and in the following table these have been allocated to the Wards in which the mothers resided before seeking admission to the Workhouse:— 9 Ward.

The death-rate calculated on the number of deaths registered in the district (gross death-rate) is again a very low one, viz., 7.20 per thousand of the mean population for the year. Only twice has a lower gross death-rate been recorded in Hornsey, and those by very little, viz., 7.03 in 1907 and 7.12 in 1905. To arrive at the true number of deaths belonging to the district we must take account of those Hornsey people who happen to die outside the district, e.g., in the various Hospitals and other Institutions, and also of outsiders who may die in Hornsey. There were 112 Hornsey people who died outside the district during 1908, viz.:— 23 in the Edmonton Workhouse, 20 in the Great Northern Central Hospital, 42 in other Hospitals outside the Borough, 10 in Lunatic Asylums, and 17 in various other places. On the other hand there were 14 deaths registered in Hornsey of persons non-resident in the district. Deducting from the number of deaths registered in Hornsey (654) those of non-residents (14), and adding the number of Hornsey residents whose deaths were registered elsewhere (112), we get the net number of deaths belonging to Hornsey (752). This is the true basis of comparison with previous years. Unfortunately the figures are only available for the past 4 years. The death-rate calculated on these figures is the net deathrate, and for the past four years is as follows:— Year. Net death-rate. 1905 8.16 1906 8.85 1907 8.49 1908 8.28 There has been little variation. The rate is an extremely low one. 12 The following table gives the net death-rates for England and Wales, and the 76 Great Towns:— England and Wales 14.7 76 Great Towns 14.9 Hornsey 8.3 Gateshead 14.9 East Ham 10.3 Great Yarmouth 15.0 Leyton 10.4 Plymouth 15.0 King's Norton 10.4 Nottingham 15.2 Willesden 10.5 Leeds 15.3 Walthamstow 10.5 Bolton 15.4 Handsworth 10.7 Coventry 15.4 Northampton 11.6 Bradford 15.5 Hastings 11.7 South Shields 15.5 Reading 11.8 St. Helen's 15.7 West Hartlepool 12.0 Blackburn 15.7 Tottenham 12.5 Bury 15.8 Aston Manor 12.5 Birkenhead 15.8 York 12.6 Sheffield 15.8 Burton-on-Trent 12.7 Birmingham 15.9 Croydon 12.8 Rotherham 16.0 Bournemouth 12.9 Newcastle-on-Tyne 16.0 Southampton 12.9 Newport (Mon.) 16.1 Leicester 13.0 West Bromwich 16.2 Cardiff 13.0 Hull 16.2 Barrow-in-Furness 13.1 Warrington 17.0 Derby 13.1 Huddersfield 17.1 Devonport 13.3 Tynemouth 17.5 Southwick 13.4 Sunderland 17.7 Bristol 13.6 Salford 17.8 Wallasey 13.6 Burnley 17.9 Portsmouth 13.8 Wigan 18.0 London 13.8 Preston 18.0 West Ham 13.9 Stockton-on-Tees 18.0 Norwich 14.1 Stockport 18.2 Halifax 14.1 Bootle 18.2 Wolverhampton 14.3 Manchester 18.2 Ipswich 14.3 Hanley 18.4 Grimsby 14.4 Rochdale 18.4 Brighton 14.7 Rhondda 18.4 Walsall 14.9 13  1907. 1908.

The rates for years previous to 1905 are not comparable as it is not possible now to obtain the numbers so as to apply the correction for deaths of residents and non-residents. 16 The following table shows the general and corrected death- rates in Hornsey for past years:— 1 Gross death rate. 2 Net death rate (Corrected for Residents and Non-Residents). 3 Death rate corrected for age and sex distribution. 1882 11.90 1883 12.70 1884 13.34 1885 12.66 1886 11.82 1887 11.57 1888 10.18 1889 9.45 1890 11.20 1891 (Census taken) 11.11 1892 10.78 1893 10.90 1894 9.42 1895 10.15 1896 8.88 1897 8.54 1898 8.94 1899 10.08 1900 8.77 1901 (Census taken) 8.12 1902 8.20 1903 7.51 1904 7.81 1905 7.12 8.16 9.30 1906 7.73 8.85 10.08 1907 7.03 8.49 9.67 1908 7.20 8.28 9.43 The principal causes of death were as follows:— Bronchitis and Pneumonia 89 Cancer 84 Heart Disease 83 Old Age 69 Phthisis 53 Apoplexy 39 Epidemic Influenza 26 Bright's Disease 22 17 Premature Birth 20 Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of Liver 19 Want of Breast Milk, Marasmus and Convulsions 17 Forms of Tuberculosis other than Phthisis 16 Suicide 16 Accident 14 Ulcer and other diseases of Stomach 14 Measles 12 Whooping Cough 11 Diabetes Mellitus 10 Epidemic Enteritis 9 Paraplegia and Hemiplegia 9 Debility at Birth and Congenital Defects 9 Diphtheria 9 Softening of Brain 9 Diarrhœa 5 Enteritis 4 Scarlet Fever 3 Enteric Fever 2 There were considerably fewer deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia than in 1907. In 1907 the number of deaths from these causes was higher than usual, and this year. the number is down to the normal figure. The number of deaths from Cancer is again higher than in previous years. From Heart diseases also there is a larger mortality than usual. The deaths from Phthisis are slightly more numerous, 53 against 50, and from other forms of Tuberculosis are less numerous, 16 against 19, so that from all Tubercular diseases the number of deaths is the same in 1908 as in 1907, viz., 69. Measles was very prevalent at the beginning of 1908, and the number of deaths from this disease was 12, as compared with 5 in 1907. Diphtheria caused exactly as many deaths as in 1907, viz., 9, but the deaths from the other common infectious diseases were less numerous this year. 18 The following table shews the diseases which caused fewer deaths in 1908 as compared with 1907, and the gain in each case: 1908 1907.

Increase Cancer 84 76 8 Heart Disease 83 71 12 Old Age 69 55 14 Phthisis 53 50 3 Apoplexy 39 33 6 Epidemic Influenza 26 25 1 Want of Breast Milk, Marasmus and Convulsions 17 15 2 Ulcer and other diseases of Stomach 14 11 3 Diabetes Mellitus 10 9 1 Measles 12 5 7 Suicide 16 4 12 Epidemic Enteritis 9 3 6 Softening of Brain 9 2 7 Tuberculosis.—The deaths from Tuberculosis of the Lung numbered 53, three more than in the previous year, and two more than the yearly average for the preceding five years. 19 From other forms of Tuberculosis there were 16 deaths, a decrease of 3 compared with the previous year. The total deaths from all forms of Tuberculosis were, therefore, 69 in 1908, exactly the same number as in 1907. There is, therefore, a slight increase this year over 1906, but the number is a little lower than in 1905 and 1904, both for Phthisis and other forms of Tuberculosis. There were no deaths from Phthisis in persons below the age of 15 years. On the other hand, 12 out of a total of 16 deaths from other forms of Tuberculosis were of persons below the age of 15 years. Phthisis is still the principle cause of death in the middle years of life. Comparing the mortality from Tuberculosis with that of the so-called seven principal zymotic diseases, the figures are as follows: The number of deaths recorded in the year 1908 from the 7 principal zymotic diseases was:— Measles 12 Scarlet Fever 3 Diphtheria 9 Enteric Fever 2 Whooping Cough 11 Diarrhœa 9 Total 46 and from Tuberculosis:— Phthisis 53 Other forms of Tuberculosis 16 Total 69 Year by year it is seen that Phthisis alone is responsible for far more deaths than the notifiable infectious diseases, and even when the chief non-notifiable infectious diseases, Measles, Whooping Cough and Epidemic Diarrhœa are added, Phthisis is still a more frequent cause of death. We must also take into consideration that every death recorded from Phthisis means that the victim has suffered an 20 average of 3-4 years from the disease, and that for some considerable part of that period has been prevented by his illness from earning his living. In many cases this has entailed great privation and hardship on those depending on him. The importance of preventive measures in such a disease as this cannot be over-estimated.

Reference to the accompanying Chart will show that the mortality from Cancer has been steadily rising for several years. The death-rate due to Cancer per 1,000 persons living was 0.924 in 1908, 0.842 in 1907, 0.748 in 1906, and 0.762 in 1905. The rise in mortality has been almost continuous since 1895, when the death-rate from Cancer per 1,000 was 0.38. 24 25 The following table shows the Wards in which deaths from Cancer have occurred during the last 9 years:— Year.

This is an increase of 6 over the previous year, but is much lower than the average. Seven of the nine deaths were of infants under one year of age. All the deaths from this cause occurred in the third quarter of the year. The death-rate per 1,000 of the population from this cause was 0.09 in 1908, 0.03 in 1907. and 0.47 in 1906. Diphtheria caused 9 deaths, exactly the same number as in the previous year. The death-rate from this cause was 0.09. Enteric Fever caused two deaths in 1908, being two fewer than in 1907. Scarlet Fever was the cause of death in three cases, being one less than in 1907. The mortality from Measles was higher in 1908 as compared with 1907, 12 deaths being due to this disease in 1908 and 5 in 1907. From Puerperal Fever the number of deaths (3) was one more than in 1907. Whooping- Cough was less fatal than in 1907. There were 11 deaths from this cause in 1908, as against 19 in 1907. The death-rate due to Whooping Cough was 0.12 per 1,000. Ages at Death.—The ages at which deaths occurred are as follows:— 1908 1907 1906 1905 1904 1903 Under 1 year 95 116 136 106 145 132 1 year and under 5 years 52 50 55 43 66 53 5 years and under 15 „ 19 23 32 16 24 17 15 „ 25 „ 33 16 34 24 28 19 25 „ 65 „ 295 291 269 272 203 216 65 years and over 258 270 243 235 224 167 Total deaths 752 766 769 696 690 604 28  1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

The infantile mortality was 124 in the 142 smaller towns, and 110 in England and Wales less the 218 towns. Infantile Mortality.—The infantile mortality for 1908 is 63. This is the lowest infantile mortality yet recorded in Hornsey, the next lowest being 67 in 1905. The average infantile mortality of the last 15 years is 91. The highest infantile mortality was 133 in 1895. There were 95 deaths of infants under 1 year of age during the year. 29 The following table gives the number of infantile deaths and the mortality for each Ward of the Borough:— Number of deaths uder 1 year.

Of these, the deaths from Debility, Convulsions and Diarrhœal Diseases were probably largely due to improper feeding, and thus in a sense were preventible. 30 Infantile Mortality (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 births) 1894-1908. 31  1908 1907 1906 1905 1904 1903 1902 1901 1900 1899 1898 1897 1896 1895 1894 INFANTILE MORTAlLITY.

Of the 22 premature births, most of the infants did not survive more than a few days, and thus this cause is largely responsible for the heavy mortality at this period.

If increase of population is taken into account this is one of the best records. Both Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever have been less prevalent than usual. There have also been very few cases of Enteric Fever in the Borough during the year. The only increase in cases notified over last year is in the case of Erysipelas. Reference to the table printed below will show the cases of infectious disease notified in the Borough for several years. The cases notified during each quarter of the year were as follows:— 1908.

Of these 540 were specimens taken at the Hospital, and 100 specimens were sent in by Medical men practising in the district. There were 45 specimens sent by Medical practitioners for examination from suspected cases of Tuberculosis, and 28 miscellaneous specimens were received and examined. There were also 51 specimens examined from children suffering from Ringworm who were scholars at the public elementary schools. Altogether 764 specimens were examined in the Bacteriological Laboratory, of which 173 were received from Medical men practising in the district. Last year there were 90 specimens received from the Medical practitioners. There were 1,860 samples of sewage and effluent analysed and reported on. There were also 36 samples of drinking water examined, and in every case the sample was found to be quite satisfactory. Diseases of Animals Acts.—There were 3 outbreaks of Glanders during the year, and 8 horses were destroyed. The Council paid £89 to the owners as compensation, in accordance with the terms of the Glanders Order, for the loss of these horses. There was one outbreak of Swine Fever, and 11 pigs died from the disease, or were killed by the owners. There were 4 certificates for the movement of swine issued. The following table shows the number of dogs seized and dealt with under the Does Act 1906: — DOGS. Seized by Police. Claimed bya Owners. Sold.

The dogs are seized by the Police and then dealt with by the Corporation on terms arranged with the Chief Commissioner of Police. Employment of Children Act, 1903.—The Report of the Chief Inspector for the year ended December 31st, 1908, is as follows:— "The officers' reports show that, while the number of children employed for wages out of school hours remains stationary, the hours of labour have decreased considerably. During the year 95 children were detected working contrary to the provisions of the Act or Bye-laws, and in all cases notices were served upon the employers. The notices had the desired effect, and it was not found necessary to take legal proceedings in any case. "There appears to have been an increase in the number of children engaged in street trading; but this was due, in a great measure, to the lack of uniformity in the Bye-laws operating in districts contiguous to Hornsey. Arrangements have now been made, however, for the co-operation of outside authorities in dealing with this matter. "Of the 95 cases reported by the Inspectors it was found that 47 were employed during prohibited hours and 27 in occupations not allowed by the Bye-laws, while 21 were under the prescribed age. Warnings have been issued to a number of parents who have by wilful default or habitual neglect allowed their children to be employed while excluded from school for various reasons." Diseased and Unsound Food.—The following articles have been destroyed at the instance of the Local Authority during the year: — 1 Crate of Bananas. 9 lbs. Raspberries. 3 lbs. Cherries. 91 lbs. Cod Fish. 1 Barrel of Crabs. 28 lbs. of Liver. 67 Stones of Pork. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.—Register of Workshops.—The number of Workshops on the Register at the end of 44 1907 was 332. During the year 1908 14 workshops have been added and 14 taken off the Register, so that at the end of 1908 there were 332 workshops on the Register in Hornsey. They were as follows:— Dressmakers 67 Milliners 20 Bootmakers and repairers 38 Cycle makers and repairers 10 Farriers 5 Picture Frame makers 2 Children's Outfitters 1 Tailors 19 Laundries 29 Restaurant Kitchens 33 Bakers 41 Miscellaneous 67 849 inspections were made and 76 written notices were served. The number of sanitary defects discovered and remedied was 106. As in previous years, want of cleanliness is the most frequent defect to be dealt with. In 30 cases, comparing with 52 for the previous year, the occupier was requested to cleanse, and this was immediately done. During the year 7 cases of overcrowding were found, and in each case the nuisance was at once abated. In 40 cases the sanitary accommodation was found to be unsuitable, insufficient or defective. At one workshop separate accommodation was not provided for each sex. These nuisances were, however, remedied on the occupier's attention being called to the matter. Home Work.—There are 63 persons on the list of homeworkers, a decrease of 2 during the year. In every case the premises occupied have been inspected, but no insanitary condition existed. No case of infectious disease has occurred in a house occupied by a home-worker. Bakehouses.—There are 41 bakehouses in the Borough being one less than in 1907. 45 There are 5 underground bakehouses in the Borough. Frequent inspections have been made of bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, places where ice cream is made, and other business premises concerned in the preparation of food, and, speaking generally, the conditions found were satisfactory. Dairies and Milkshops, numbering 78, and 3 Cowsheds in the Borough have been frequently inspected. In 17 instances contravention of the bye-laws or regulations have been found, and the matters were at once attended to. The number of premises now on the list for periodical inspection is 715, as compared with 705 for last year. 525 for 1906, 495 for 1905, 412 in 1904, and 152 in 1903. Preliminary notices issued numbered 927, and statutory notices 158.
