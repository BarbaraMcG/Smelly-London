Ac 4379 504 74 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1964 A. D. C. S. CAMERON, M.B., CH.B., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health - i - To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark YOUR WORSHIP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the Annua Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1964. Vital Statistics The Registrar General's estimate of the population at mid 1964 shows a decrease of some 1,040 persons. The excess of births over deaths was 470 as compared with 391 during 1963. A great deal of re-development has taken place in recent years in the Borough, and the decrease in the Registrar General's estimate of the population of the area is some indication of the relative proportion of the total development which has taken the form of residential accommodation. The birth rate during 1964 was of the same order as that for the previous year and only slightly less than that for the country as a whole. Having regard to the relatively small figures involved the infant mortality rate is bound to show some fluctuation owing to the operation of chance. During 1964, the infant mortality rate of 21 per 1,000 live births was rather higher than the low rate of 18.9 per 1,000 live births experienced in 1963, but only slightly higher than that for the country as a whole. Similarly the still birth rate, although higher than last year was only slightly higher than the figure for England & Wales. The neonatal mortality rate which refers to the important group of deaths which occur during the first four weeks of life showed a reduction from 13.2 per 1,000 live births last year to 12.7. Once more during 1964 no deaths occurred which were attributable to pregnancy, child birth or abortion. The crude general death rate after adjustment by the application of the comparability factor was 12.4 per 1,000 and was lower than that of 13.3 per 1,000 of the population which was experienced during the previous year, but slightly higher than that for England & Wales, which was 11.3. The commonest cause of death was disease of the circulatory system. The next highest number of deaths was due to malignant disease, and in this connection it is of particular note that the number of deaths from cancer of the lung increased from 64 during 1963 to 94 in 1964, an increase of no less than 30 during the year and the highest number of such deaths recorded in Southwark. The number of deaths in 1964 due to malignant disease was particularly high and formed 23 per cent, of the total deaths. The lung cancer mortality figures are in very great contrast to the total number of deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis which during 1964 amounted to 6 or 0.7 per cent, of all deaths. The number of deaths due to bronchitis fell from 121 during 1963 to 85 in 1964. Infectious Disease The year 1964 was a relatively satisfactory one in so far as the incidence of infectious disease is concerned. The total number of notifications received was the lowest since 1954. The reduction as compared with the previous year was largely due to a fall in the number of cases of dysentery as well as to the fact that 1964 was not a measles year. Even so too much dysentery was present during the year. A very large proportion of the cases occurred in institutions and involved persons who had been admitted from a wide area of London generally. For the second year in succession not one single case of poliomyelitis was reported during the year. This is the first time that this gratifying position has been achieved in Southwark for many years and is a very satisfactory result of the widespread use of polio vaccine in the area. A reminder of the necessity to ensure that children are immunised against all the diseases for which purpose suitable means are available was presented by the occurrence in February of three cases of diphtheria. A boy of 11 years, along with his sister of 6 years were admitted to hospital as clinical cases. In collaboration with the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council an investigation of school and home contacts was inmediately put in hand and a second sister of the first case, aged 17 years, was admitted to hospital with the disease. It is gratifying to be able to report that no further cases were encountered, the disease being confined to members of this one family. Paratyphoid was diagnosed in a Southwark child who was being nursed in the same special unit in a local hospital in which a child from another area was found to be infected with Salmonella Paratyphi 'B'. There were no other cases. The 22 cases of food poisoning which were notified during the year were, apart from 6 cases which occurred in three families, single cases. Clostridium welchii was the causal - ii - organism in 5 cases of food poisoning which occurred in a small outbreak in a factory in Southwark. The persons infected were not Southwark residents and the cause of the outbreak was considered to be the pre-cooking of a steak pie served in the Canteen. Suitable instructions were given to the person in charge of the cooking am ngements at this particular canteen and certain new equipment was provided. Health Education The General Purposes Sub-Committee of the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee received during the year representations from the Camberwell Borough Council supporting the view of their Medical Officer of Health that the establishment of a central board for health education, as recommended in the report of the joint committee on health education (The Cohen Report), was not the best method of securing an increase in health education activities. The Medical Officer of Health of Camberwell urged that this increase could best be secured by expanding the Central Council for Health Education, which already has wide experience of the subject, rather than by setting up a new body. Camberwell Borough Council asked the Standing Joint Committee to make appropriate recommendations to the Ministry of Health, and the General Purposes Sub-Committee asked for the views of this Council on this question. Your Medical Officer of Health expressed views exactly similar to those of the Medical Officer of Health of Camberwell and emphasized that the Central Council for Health Education is supported by funds raised by the local authorities and has proved to be a valuable servant, often going out of its way to assist local authorities with their own particular problems. This is of fundamental importance, as health education is the essence of public health and is a local authority function. By its constitution the Central Council is able to serve a client, which is preferable to the setting up of a new board with centralized functions which may well decide on rigid lines of health education, thereby preventing local authorities from having any influence on the content of health education. For these reasons the Medical Officer of Health considered that the Central Council should be preserved. At the same time it is an undoubted fact that expenditure in this field must be substantially increased, if whatever body undertakes the co-ordination and central organisation of health education, is to effectively counteract the propaganda, inimicable to health, upon which so nuch money is spent by commercial undertakings. - iii - Conclusion This is the last Annual Report which I shall have the honour of presenting to the members of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. I am particularly anxious therefore, this year, to express to the Chairmen and Members of the various Committees of the Council my very sincere thanks for their encouragement during the years I have served the Council, as well as to Chief Officers and the staff of their departments, all of whom have been most helpful in regard to public health matters at all times. My associations with Dr. W.H.S. Wallace, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, during the years I have been in Southwark have been very happy and I should like to express to him and to his staff my thanks for help freely given at all times. I wish to acknowledge also the great help which has been received from the Public Health Laboratory Service and in particular to Dr. Tomlinson, the Director of the local Laboratory. The relations of the Southwark Public Health Department with the family Doctors practising in the area have always been extremely good and I would thank them sincerely for this. Finally to the Chief Public Health Inspector,Mr. H. Archer, the Senior Clerk, Mr. E.A. Clark, and to each individual member of the staff of the Public Health Department, my very sincere thanks for their loyal support so generally forthcoming during my tenure of office as Medical Officer of Health in Southwark. May I take this opportunity of wishing them all every success in their future careers. May I in conclusion also, as the last holder of the office of Medical Officer of Health to the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark, be allowed to extend my best wishes first to Dr. J.E. Epsom, my colleague in Bermondsey, who is now first Medical Officer of Health of the London Borough of Southwark. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, A.D.C.S. CAMERON Medical Officer of Health - iv - PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at 31st December, 1964) Mayor - J.H.

The Borough forms a boundary with Lambeth to the west as far south as Kennington Park, to the south with Camberwell, and to the east with Bermondsey. The landward part of the Borough extends to 1,131 acres and is divided into ten Wards. The Elephant and Castle forms a landmark, roughly dividing the borough into two. The portion of the borough between the Elephant and the river is becoming increasingly devoted to wharves, warehouses, diverse industry including food factories, and the printing trade, and offices, while the area south and south-east of the Elephant is mainly residential in character. The provision of office accomnodation in the northern part of the Borough continues a trend of commercialisation which was commented upon sixty years ago by the Borough's first Medical Officer of Health in his first annual report. The momentum of development has however of late rapidly increased, not only in the north but also in the southern part of the borough where the improved aesthetic effects of the new and attractive housing estates which have been built both by this Council and the London County Council, with their associated open spaces become ever more apparent. The role of Southwark as a religious centre is symbolised by the two fine Cathedrals which it contains. The historic and cultural aspects of the borough are well known and the commercial and industrial importance of this central London borough have continued to increase. The extensive redevelopment which is taking place at the Elephant and Castle, the Brandon Estate and elsewhere are already giving Southwark a new look. A large modern office block already houses the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Health now occupy newly constructed offices at the Elephant and Castle. - 1 - The natural increase in population - that is, the excess of births over deaths - was 470 compared with 391 for the previous year. 1954 - 95,370 1959 - 88,720 1955 - 93,820 1960 - 88,690 1956 - 92,300 1961 - 86,270 1957 - 91,140 1962 - 86,440 1958 - 89,920 1963 - 85,870 Live - Births - 1,565: Rate per 1,000 pop 18.4 Adjusted by comparability factor (0.93) 17.1 Still births-27: Rate per 1,000 total births 16.9 Total births-Live and still 1,592 Total deaths-1,095: Rate per 1,000 pop 12.8 Adjusted by comparability factor (0.97) 12.4 Infant deaths - 33: Rate per 1,000 live births 21.0 Rate per 1 000 live births, legitimate 20.5 illegitimate 25.8 Neo-Natal mortality 20 (under 4 weeks) Rate per 1 000 live births 12.7 Illegitimate Live Births - 155 Percentage of total live births 9.9 Maternal Deaths (including abortion) Rate per 1 000 live and still births nil Deaths under 1 week excl. still births 17 Perinatal rate per 1,000 total births 27.6 - 2 - VITAL STATISTICS Land Area 1,131 acres Estimated Number of Dwellings 25,211 Dwellings Erected by Borough Council During Year 187 *Approximate Rateable Value (Total) £6,270,720 (Dwellings) £1,646,197 *Sum represented by a Penny Hate £25,195 Population: Census 1961 86,249 Registrar General's estimate (mid-1964) 84,830 This estimate represents a decrease in the figure for 1963 of 1,040 COMPARATIVE ADJUSTED BIRTH AND DEATH RATES <###> 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 Live Births Southwark England and Wales (per 1,000 population) 14.9 15.4 16.1 15.8 15.3 16.2 17.8 17.3 17.0 17.1 15.0 15.6 16.1 16.4 16.5 17.1 17.4 18.0 18.2 18.4 Total Deaths Southwark England and Wales (per 1,000 population) 14.1 11.6 10.8 10.2 11.5 12.0 12.0 11.9 13.3 12.4 11.7 11.7 11.5 11.7 11.6 11.5 12.0 11.9 12.2 11.3 Infant Deaths Southwark England and Wales (per 1,000 Live Births) 28.1 16.0 22.3 26.7 28.2 26.8 21.8 20.5 18.9 21.0 24.9 23.7 23.1 22.6 22.2 21.7 21.6 21.4 20.9 20.0 Still Births Southwark England and Wales (per 1,000 Total Births) 22.1 18.7 24.7 20.1 18.0 15.9 20.8 17.2 13.1 16.9 23.2 22.9 22.4 21.6 21.0 19.7 19.1 18.1 17.3 16.3 Neo-Natal Mortality (under 4 weeks) Southwark England and Wales (per 1,000 Live Births) 20.80 11.08 15.69 18.68 16.4 16.8 11.8 13.3 13.2 12.7 17.3 16.8 16.5 16.2 15.8 15.6 15.5 15.1 14.2 13.8 Maternal Mortality Southwark England and Wales (per 1,000 Live and Still Births) 1.1 Nil Nil 0.6 Nil 0.61 1.1 0.5 Nil Nil 0.64 0.56 0.47 0.43 0.38 0.30 0.33 0.35 0.28 0.25 - 3 - (England and Wales rates for 1964 are provisional estimates only) - 4- YEAR LEGITIMATE ILLEGITIMATE TOTAL Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total LIVE BIRTHS 1960 789 701 1,490 59 51 110 848 752 1,600 1961 791 744 1,535 78 79 157 869 823 1,692 1962 817 675 1,492 88 71 159 905 746 1,651 1963 730 694 1,424 82 74 156 812 768 1,580 1964 732 678 1,410 84 71 155 816 749 1,565 STILL BIRTHS 1960 8 16 24 1 1 2 9 17 26 1961 17 12 29 3 4 7 20 16 36 1962 10 15 25 3 1 4 13 16 29 1963 12 7 19 2 • 2 14 7 21 1964 14 12 26 1 - 1 15 12 27 INFANT DEATHS (Under l year) 1960 17 22 39 2 2 4 19 23 43 1961 17 13 30 3 4 7 20 17 37 1962 18 12 30 2 2 4 20 14 34 1963 14 14 28 1 1 2 15 15 30 1964 18 11 29 2 2 4 20 13 33 DEATHS Male and Female Age Groups Under 1 1-4 5-14 15-44 45-64 65 and over Total Males 20 8 1 59 178 354 590 Females 13 - 3 25 78 386 505 33 8 4 54 256 740 1,095 Infant Mortality The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 33 the causes of death being as follows:- Pneumonia 3 Bronchitis 1 Gastritis, Enteritis, Diarrhoea 4 Other infective and parasitic diseases 1 Congenital malformations 6 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 18 Seventeen of these deaths occurred under the age of one week, as follows:- Males Females Legitimate 9 6 Illegitimate 1 1 There were no deaths from pregnancy, childbirth or abortion. - 5 - CANCER DEATHS Year Cancer of: Lung and Bronchus Other Organs Total Cancer deaths per 1,000 pop.

TREATMENT AND BATHING CENTRE 1964 Superintendent - Hr. T. Lloyd, T.D. The demands on the incontinent laundry service continues to increase and a total of 52,259 1bs of soiled items for the Southwark and Lambeth areas were laundered during the year. In Southwark, this laundry is delivered back to the home on the day following collection and in cases of acute incontinence, collections are made three times a week. This service is considered to be a major amenity to those, mainly aged and usually bedridden persons, who have to bear with this most embarrassing condition added to their worries of continual ill health. The number of individuals requiring treatment for a verminous condition of the head and body, remained at about the same low level as in the previous year, i.e. 805 in all, including 322 school children. The majority of the male adult persons treated were occupants of hostels or lodging houses, or stated that they had no fixed abode. In every case these were obvious or suspected cases of body vermin infestations. Of the female adult persons requiring treatment for a verminous condition, 63 of the 165 cases were from hostels and lodging houses. The majority of these had infestations of head lice only. The total of scabies treatments carried out during the year showed a fairly considerable increase on the 1963 figures. A substantial number of those requiring treatment were from immigrant families. The long, warm summer resulted in more rapid insect pest breeding and a consequent greater demand from domestic and other premises for assistance in dealing with a varied selection of insects and other arthropods. With a general increase in the number of holidays taken abroad, it is inevitable that more of the residents in this Borough may find that when they return home, they are placed under some period of surveillance in accordance with the International Sanitary Regulations. Without necessarily being aware of it, they may have been closely or remotely in some form of contact with one of the six diseases covered by these Regulations. In the case of Smallpox, a person who has visited an 'infected local area' and does not produce a valid certificate of vaccination, is placed under surveillance for a period of 14 days. During 1964, ten Southwark residents were placed under such surveillance and were much surprised when informed that one of the ports at which their ships had called, was in a Smallpox 'infected local area'. -17- Infectious Disease Cases: Enquiries and Visits Total 467 as under: Diphtheria 5 Gastro enteritis 6 Scarlet Fever 86 Dysentery (bacilliary) 130 Food Poisoning 25 Erysipelas 2 Meningococcal infections 2 Smallpox contacts 10 Typhoid contacts 1 Paratyphoid contacts 15 Revisits 185 Disinfection following infectious diseases Rooms treated (Formalin solution) 65 Library books treated 126 Other disinfection, Tuberculosis etc. -- Treatment of Verminous and Infected Articles (including precautionary disinfestation) Verminous articles treated Infected articles treated Beds 99 1 Palliasses 698 21 Bolsters 77 4 Pillows 999 45 Cushions 33 - Blankets 1,263 16 Sheets 629 11 Quilts 426 5 Other articles (clothing, etc.) 5,603 68 Rehousing Precautionary disinfestation of soft goods and bedding: 264 families.

During the year, 2 complaints were received. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and the samples analysed and found satisfactory. Whilst the Board from time to time draws samples for bacteriological and chemical examination, samples of drinking water have been taken by the Public Health Inspectors and submitted to the Public Analyst who has reported in each case that the supply was satisfactory. In some of the old tenement buildings the water supply is communal, there being taps on the staircase landings whilst in others the water passes through storage tanks on the roofs. The indirect supply of water for drinking purposes has been considered in a number of cases to be unsatisfactory and representations have been made to the owners with a view to all taps being supplied direct from the rising main. -23- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 98 During the year 9 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 95 Certificates have been issued in respect of the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water at 491 new dwellings.

Three intimation notices were served, which have been complied with. OFFENSIVE TRADES There are now 3 premises engaged in offensive trades in the Borough as follows: Manure Manufacturer 1, Fat Extractors 2. Twenty two inspections of these premises were made. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Eight applications were received for registration under the Act, all of which were satisfactory. Two hundred and sixty inspections were made during the year. -26- PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949 (Rodent Officer - Mr. R. Warboys) Notifications to the Public Health Department of rat infested premises, both domestic and business, showed a spectacular decrease and followed the pattern of previous years. Premises inspected as a matter of routine tended to show an increase in respect of domestic premises and a decrease in respect of business premises. All infestations were of a minor nature and in no case was treatment long or difficult, in many instances being outside surface infestations or even sightings of stray rats. Treatment of infestations of domestic premises is free, and a charge of 12d.6d. per hour is made for treatment of business premises. Mouse infestations were slightly lower in domestic premises and a little higher in business premises. Warfarin is the poison normally used to deal with mouse infestations but it is believed that mice are steadily acquiring a natural resistance to this poison with resultant difficulties in eradication. It is hoped that a suitable alternative poison will soon be available to cope with persistent infestations. Warfarin and zinc phosphide are still used with considerable success in rat infestations both in premises and the Council's sewers. Sewer treatments are carried out quarterly, and follow the pattern started in the Borough some 12 years ago, and now recommended as standard practice. Sewer infestation is believed to be at a very low level, but complete eradication is impossible whilst drainage from adjoining authorities goes in to the same common trunk system. The existence of defective drainage in the Borough will also make complete eradication impossible. The Department is responsible for testing and locating all suspect and disused drainage, and the supervision of repair or sealing off at the sewer. The co-operation received from the Borough Engineer's Department in dealing with such drainage has been excellent at all times. This work is most important, as repair or sealing off of drainage has been found to effect an immediate clearance of the infestation, and has tended to confine rat population to the sewers. It is considered that the rat infestation is probably at a minimum, but no effort will be spared to reduce the rat population even further if this is at all possible. -27- Total properties Local Authority Type of Premises Dwellings Business & Others Total 19 25,211 8,559(a) 33,789 Properties inspected as result of notification 14 817 497 1,328 Infested by:- Common Bat major 1 - - 1 minor 13 501 323 837 Ship Rat major - - - • minor - - 21 21 House Mouse major . . - . minor - 316 174 490 Properties inspected by Survey under the Act - 1,267 655 1,922 Infested by:- Common Rat major - - - - minor - 822 390 1,212 Ship Rat major _ _ i. . minor - . 21 21 House Mouse major - - - - minor - 445 265 710 Properties otherwise inspected. - 157 89 246 Infested by:- Common Rat major - - - - minor - 92 50 142 Ship Rat major . . - - minor - - - - House Mouse major _ - - . minor - 65 39 104 Total Inspections and re-inspections. 48 3,461 1,846 5,355 Infested properties above treated by L.A. 48 2,241 1,241 3,530 Total Treatments 48 3,461 1,846 5,355 -28- PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT-CONTD.

SCRAP METAL DEALERS ACT, 1964 This Act will come into operation in April 1965, and will require scrap metal dealers to register with the local authority in whose area they carry on business. -30- AIR POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer-Mr. G. Stubbs) The overall figures of air pollution recorded by the Council's instruments during the year show no significant change. There was a slight increase in the deposited matter and sulphur dioxide during the winter months. The Smoke Control Order No.3 was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 28th February, 1964 and came into operation on 1st November, 1964. The area covers 50 acres and contains 1,896 separate dwellings. The work of conversions proceeded smoothly and there was a noticeable trend towards the installation of gas fires. The Mayor presided over a meeting held at the Town Hall on 30th September, 1964, attended by coal merchants, representatives of the nationalised undertakings, smokeless fuel manufacturers and interested bodies to discuss the availability of fuels for the proposed Smoke Control Area No.4. Assurances were given at the meeting that the additional tonnage of smokeless fuel required for the proposed area could be supplied by the trade. The Smoke Control Order No.4 was made by the Council on the 11th December, 1964 and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. The area adjoins No.3 Smoke Control Area and is bounded by Newington Butts, Dante Road, Brook Drive, Kennington Road, Lambeth Road, King Edward Walk, St. George's Road, Newington Butts, Walworth Road, Manor Place and Penton Place and covers 97 acres. In the area "there are 2,460 separate dwellings, 128 shops and commercial premises, four schools, two hospitals, one museum, one church and 35 factories and workplaces. The figures of the survey showed that appliances in 1,172 dwellings needed replacement or adaptation with gas ignition at an estimated cost of £21,500. It was calculated that 1,350 additional tons of smokeless fuel would be required for the area. Twelve notifications were received of proposals to install new furnaces, and plans and specifications in respect of four other installations were submitted and approval given. The Council has a daily volumetric smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus, two standard deposit gauges, and three lead peroxide instruments. The Central Electricity Generating Board has a lead peroxide instrument on the jetty of the Bankside Power Station. -31- During the year 12 complaints were received of smoke and grit emission, and 161 observations and inspections were made. 7 Intimation Notices were issued and it is pleasing to record that the managements took remedial action on all occasions. The Clean Air Act is amended by the Housing Act, 1964, so as to enable a local authority, when making an order declaring any area to be a smoke control area, to designate any class of heating appliance as being unsuitable for installation in the area because its consumption of fuel, or the time when the fuel is generally used (e.g. electricity used at peak periods) is likely to throw an undue strain on the fuel resources for the area. -32- Deposited matter at following sites:- 1964 Rainfall (inches) BANKSIDE WALWORTH ROAD Mean Daily Concentration of Sulphur Dioxide micro gms. per cubic metre.

Source of Supply Metropolitan Water Board. Twenty-two bath samples were analysed by the Public Analyst. It is standard practice to record the number of bathers who have used the bath prior to the sample being taken and the number of bathers in the pool at the time of sampling, and the appearance of the water. In four cases the appearance was cloudy, but in two of these over 200 bathers were using the bath immediately prior to the time of sampling. In 16 cases the bacterial count was not more than 5 per million and in four it was under 10. Free chlorine ranged from 0.2 to 3 parts per million.

ANIMAL BOARDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1963 There are no premises used as Animal Boarding Establishments in the borough. THE CHILDREN' S NIGHTDRESSES REGULATIONS, 1964 These Regulations which were made under the Consumer Protection Act, 1961 came into operation on 1st October, 1964, and impose certain requirements in relation to children's nightdresses. Subject to certain exceptions, no person may sell or have in his possession for sale a child's nightdress not complying with the Regulations, which require inter alia that materials used for the garments shall be of fabrics satisfying British Standard Specifications of 'low flammability'. -35- OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES ACT 1963 This Act, which makes provision for the health, safety and welfare of persons employed in offices, shops and certain railway premises, came into operation during 1964. Certain administrative provisions came into operation on the 1st May, 1964, including the registration of premises. Most of the remaining provisions came into force on 1st August, 1964. Broadly speaking, local authorities are responsible for enforcement of the Act (with the exception of certain provisions relating to fire prevention) in offices, shops and certain railway premises, except those within the curtilage of 'factory premises' as defined by the Factories Act 1961, where enforcement is the responsibility of H.M. Factory Inspectorate. In order to secure uniformity of action by the respective authorities, the Minister of Labour has appointed regional officers and circulars have been issued giving guidance on the practical interpretation of a number of provisions of the Act. Regulations with regard to Sanitary Conveniences and Washing Facilities will come into operation on the 1st January, 1966, and an Order setting out standards of first-aid equipment to be provided and maintained, came into effect on 1st December, 1964. Operation of the Act-General Following the widespread advertising campaign conducted earlier in the year through the press, radio and television, numerous applications for registration were received. Parts III of the registration forms were duly forwarded to the London County Council (as the fire authority). Many premises contain offices and shops within the same curtilage as 'factory' premises and the resultant problems of demarcation where the 'factory' processes are of a minor character, have been resolved by informal discussion with H.M. District Inspector of Factories whose willing co-operation is gratefully acknowledged. In many instances smaller shops were found to be outside the scope of the Act by reason of their operation by closely related members of the same family. Forms were delivered by hand to premises which appeared to be within the scope of the Act. Where application had not been made already, a further survey will be required to ensure complete coverage of all premises affected by the Act, as it would appear -36- that a number of premises have still to be registered. A total of 1,346 units were registered up to December 31st, 1964. Enforcement has been undertaken by the existing Public Health Inspectorate and clerical staff. The overall impression obtained is that of a readiness on the part of employers to co-operate in complying with the provisions of the Act. As will be seen from Appendix II, the principal shortcomings were in respect of Cleanliness,Temperature (maintenance and recording), Ventilation, Sanitary Conveniences (condition), Inadequate washing facilities, Floors, passages and stairs (condition) and First-Aid equipment provision. Accidents The Act places an obligation upon employers to notify the appropriate authority of certain accidents which occur on their premises, resulting in death or disablement from normal work for more than three days. Where necessary the circumstances of accidents are investigated and appropriate reports made. Quarterly returns are sent to the officer appointed by the Minister under Section 57 of the Act. During 1964, ten accident notifications were received. All were investigated and fortunately none was of a serious nature. Verbal notice was given to one employer with regard to poor lighting and obstruction of a staircase. Dangerous Machinery Provision is made for all machines to be securely fenced, so that no worker can come into contact with any dangerous part while the machines are moving,and for such fencing to be properly used and maintained. Young persons (i.e. under 18 years of age) may not clean machinery if, in so doing, they are exposed to risk of injury from moving parts or adjacent machinery. Certain machines have been prescribed by Order by the Minister as dangerous and may not be worked by persons other than those who are adequately trained or under adequate supervision. During routine inspection an apparently dangerous machine not listed in the Order was seen; this was an electric wallpaper trimming machine having unguarded circular cutting wheels. The advice of the Minister's appointed officer was sought and following his visit, representations were made by the user to the manufacturers. An adequate guard has now been developed and submitted to H.M. Inspector of Factories for approval. - 37 - First-Aid The occupier of premises to which the Act applies is required to provide first-aid boxes or cupboards in accordance with the Order. Exemption from such requirements may be granted by the enforcing authority where a suitably equipped first-aid room is maintained at or in conjunction with the premises. During the year, exemption was granted to the occupiers of a large office block.

These are as follows:- Fresh Apples Bacon and Ham Currants Poultry Sultanas Meat Raisins Margarine Eggs in shell Malt products Dried eggs Frozen or chilled Salmon Oat Products and Sea Trout Raw Tomatoes Butter Cucumbers Honey MEAT TREATMENT REGULATIONS 1964 These Regulations which came into operation on 23rd January, prohibit additions to raw and unprocessed meat intended for human consumption of ascorbic, erythorbic and nicotinic acids, nicotinamide, and any salt or any other derivative of these substances. -50- THE LIQUID EGG (PASTEURISATION) REGULATIONS, 1963 Processing plants. There are three egg pasteurising plants operating within the Borough, which combine the process of egg pasteurisation with that of egg breaking and freezing of liquid egg. Two of the plants were installed in premises which have long been used for egg breaking whilst the third formed part of a new installation in premises specially converted for this purpose when the Regulations were in draft form. Each plant has been equipped with its own laboratory for carrying out the required tests including B.Coli and plate count and detection of the enzyme aamylase. Sampling and Testing 109 samples of pasteurised liquid egg were taken from the plants for a-amylase test following the introduction of the Regulations on the 1st January, 1964. From then until 31st August check samples were taken from the productions and submitted to Colindale Laboratory where they were examined for the presence of salmonellae in addition to the a-amylase test. These samples were taken not only from Lion Brand Liquid Egg but also from Chilled Imported Eggs broken out in the plants and all showed the complete absence of a-amylase with readings on the Lovibond Comparator of 6 and 7. Since no salmonella organisms were being isolated and the pasteurisation plants were obviously working efficiently it was decided to ease the burden placed upon Colindale Laboratory and to submit the samples to the Public Analyst. In order to keep a check on the efficiency of the plants two samples from each plant were submitted to the Public Analyst each week. This sampling has now become standard procedure. In addition to the samples taken by the Public Health Inspectors, each plant took one sample from both the morning and afternoon productions, the results being examined by the Inspector during his frequent visits. The figures of 6 and 7 on the Lovibond Comparator for the test on home produced liquid egg contrast sharply with those received on Imported Pasteurised Liquid Egg, many of which show readings of 3 and 4, whilst some failed the test completely. In all, 443 samples of imported egg were taken from various shipments and 9 samples failed to pass the a-amylase test. The batches from which these samples were taken were placed under official detention in accordance with the provision of the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937/1948 and were subsequently -51- released for re-exportation to the producers in their country of origin for pasteurisation, the Embassy of that country being informed of our action. As a result of collaboration with the three manufacturers these plants were operating satisfactorily by January 1st and the egg was in conformity with the new legal requirements. The apparatus used in all plants is similar to that for milk pasteurisation. Initially, considerable difficulty was experienced in the effectual cleansing of the plants because viscosity and solids content of the egg was such that the application of time and temperature heat control produced a certain amount of baking, particularly on the last few plates of the heating unit. By experimentation and with the co-operation of those organisations concerned with the cleansing of food manufacturing machinery these difficulties were finally overcome with the result that inplace cleaning is now standard procedure. ICE CREAM There are 282 ice-cream dealers and 10 manufacturers in this borough, a decrease of 4 dealers since last year. Most of the sellers sold only pre-packed ice cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. Twenty-three samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:- 16 samples, Grade I 4 samples, Grade II 2 samples, Grade III 1 sample, Grade IV In addition: Twenty-five samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition, and all were found to be satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises and copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. Because of a Grocer's contravention of Regulations 8; 16(2): 23(1) and 24 of the Food Hygiene (General Regulations, 1960, the Public Health Committee, after due consideration, decided to -52- cancel the registration of his premises for the Sale and Storage of Ice Cream. DESIGNATED MILK The following Licences were issued during the year:- Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised milk 8 Sterilised milk 8 Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk 4 Thirty-one samples of Designated milks were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, and satisfied the prescribed tests. Fourteen samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council were informed of the results which were satisfactory in each case. MILK AND DAIRIES (GENERAL) REGULATIONS 1959 There were 144 registered milk distributors in the borough whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the borough from registered premises elsewhere was 12. 220 inspections of Milk shops and Dairies were made during the year. BAKEHOUSES There were 13 Bakehouses in use, one of which was a Basement Bakehouse. One basement bakehouse at 68 Alvey Street, was closed during the year. 30 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1959 Two samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis and both were certified to comply with the regulations. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no slaughterhouses in the borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 353 establishments in the borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have -53- received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1955) There are now 86 premises registered under Section 16 of the above Act for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for sale.

A total of £237.14s.5d. was recovered from the effects of the deceased persons, and from the Ministry of National Insurance.

Dean, Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee:- "The usual activities at St. Alban's Hall have continued throughout the year, shared by more and more old people. The 61 Visiting Comnittee has got into its stride with the result that many more oldpeople have been'discovered' and registered through the lists sent in by the various organisations in the borough. We have come to realise, to our dismay, how many old people are unknown to us - how many live out their lives alone,without kith or kin, often without friends; some too shy or even too proud to seek companionship; some too handicapped to leave their solitary homes. For this last group the Friday outing has been expanded to bring in 32 housebound old people each week, and this has been achieved only through the close co-operation of the W.V.S. to whose helpers we offer sincere thanks. MEALS SERVICE Restaurant To look in at the restaurant at St. Alban's Hall any day of the week makes one realise how worthwhile this service is and what a great need it fills. The hall is set out with tables for four people and it is already full by 12.15 for the first service. The menu is well thought out and varied from day to day, to include some of the old-fashioned boiled puddings which the old people enjoy but which they would have difficulty in preparing for themselves. One feels that if this is their only substantial meal of the day, they are well set up, and for the very reasonable charge of 1/-. A second service follows, then the cup of tea (for 1d.) without which, for the old people, no meal would be complete. It is small wonder that so many take advantage of our service and that one sees so many new faces. There is normally a drop during a spell of very bad weather when the more frail hesitate to risk frozen or sticky pavements and crossing dangerous roads; there is also a drop during periods of group holidays, but in other weeks there is an average of 180 daily in the restaurant. Meals-on-Wheels Watching the vans being loaded with meals to take out to the sick and permanently housebound, one wonders how all such people fared in that other age before Meals-onWheels were thought of. The demands on our service increase every week, and are especially heavy during the winter months when there is a greater incidence of illness among the elderly. Most of our vans are over-loaded, yet how can one reject an appeal for a dinner for an old lady of 88 who has just been discharged from hospital, still far from well and unable to cope with pots and pans. A regular check is necessary to ensure that the service is still needed, whether an old gentleman could not get himself as far as St. Alban's Hall or the nearest luncheon 62 club, and so a more urgent case be accepted in his place. The average daily numbers have increased dramatically, far outstripping the increase in meals for the active, and average 250 per day. Our helpers continue their invaluable work of reporting on their old people; an elderly man living alone who does not answer the door, the milk bottles accumulating; entrance is made and he is found to be needing urgent medical attention; another is full of the woes of an old lady whose home help no longer comes and she cannot manage to get out for her shopping; many messages are brought back,helping the organisation to keep track of the needs of the homebound, for some of whom the helpers come as welcome visitors against the drab monotony of a solitary life. Luncheon Clubs our five luncheon clubs have shown progressive increase in numbers and have considerably helped to reduce pressure on the Meals-on-Wheels service. So many old people find St. Alban's Hall just that much too far to reach for their dinner, especially those in the northern part of the borough and on the other side of the Walworth Road,and the clubs at Quinn Square, Nelson Square, Merrow Street and Surrey Square fit their purpose, whilst the old people at Edwards Almshouses are happy to have their dinners on the spot. For those who can get to a luncheon club the daily trip away from the small confined space of their flats is good for morale. They have the satisfaction of meeting friends and of feeling that they have been able to get there without help, which is an achievement. The following table shows the comparative figures of meals served during the past three years: Restaurant Meals-on-Wheels Luncheon Clubs Total 1962/63 44,336 56,393 6,572 107,301 1963/64 42,661 53,905 16,853 113,419 1964/65 42,475 55,314 20,308 118,097 CHIROPODY The demand for treatment becomes greater every year and the number of sessions has become totally inadequate. It remains at six per week at the clinic at St: Alban's Hall, with one domiciliary session weekly. As more handicapped are brought in on Fridays there are more old people asking for treatment on that day, and it is a desperate task to try to fit in urgent cases, and to reduce the time lapse of six to eight weeks between treatments. This service has become one of the most important offered to pensioners who are unable to afford private treatment and who nave to rely on our clinic to meet their needs. 63 The number of treatments given during the year at St. Alban's Hall was approximately 3,000 with, in addition, 450 treated at domicile. If only there were more trained personnel available we could report more happily on our achievements. VISITING This year has seen great strides in the numbers of old folk visited from St. Alban's Hall. Thanks to the untiring efforts of the Dulwich College boys new people are being put in touch with us and many more helped in numerous ways. There is,however, a great need for men or women willing to offer us a day or an afternoon each week to help cover the many homebound old people known to us. What greater service or kindness can we render to humanity than to ensure that our elderly citizens are not allowed to feel lonely and unwanted but can spend the last years of their life knowing that the community has their happiness at heart. HOLIDAYS The Joseph Collier Home at Bognor Regis has now been open about 18 months and has proved most successful and popular. Apart from a few weeks in late autumn when it was closed for renovations there have been guests continually and it was filled to capacity during the summer months. Fortunately all the old people who wanted to stay in Bognor could be accommodated and a total of 460 have been able to have a happy holiday under the best conditions, at rates varying according to season, some under the Borough Council scheme when they paid a nominal charge of £1 only, if they fulfilled the qualifications of residence and ceiling income. There was a very happy party for the Christmas period when priority was given to those who would otherwise be quite alone if left in their own homes. We are finding more and more old people who have not had a holiday in years,many of whom have lived in the borough all their lives,and who will be grateful to Mr. J oseph Collier for the inspiration which led to his endowment of the Home at Bognor Regis. Newquay A group of 41 old people spent a happy week here in September. This holiday was entirely at their own expense - they had saved up and paid in their contributions during the year. The weather was fine, the hotel comfortable, offering all the amenities possible, so that all enjoyed themselves immensely. 64 Courbevoie Last June a most enjoyable fortnight was spent in France by a group of 24 old people. They stayed at the Chateau de Tillet, a home for old people, at the invitation of Southwark's twin town, Courbevoie. They were feted by the civic authorities and taken on conducted tours to interesting places, and deeply appreciated their warm welcome. Special Holidays Individual holidays have been organised for the handicapped and those who could not be taken into the ordinary homes,mainly through the good offices of the Bermondsey Medical Mission at Bexhill; others went to Clacton. Altogether nine people were accommodated in this way, but it is difficult to arrange holidays for the handicapped until more homes are available. WROKSHOP With the advent of the 4th year of Workshop activities in the Welfare Centre the number of members now employed daily amounts to 60,separated into morning and afternoon sessions; the work from outside suppliers maintains a more or less reasonable level with a variety of items to keep workshop members constantly busy. It should be noted that during the last two or three months the male members of the workshop personnel have increased from 4 members of long standing to 12. In view of the shyness of male members to join workshops in the past, this is encouraging. Within the Workshop organisation itself, a pilot visiting scheme has been successfully achieved whereby contact is kept with other Workshop members who may be homebound or under hospital care for a number of reasons. As a result of the visits the members are able to ascertain the imnediate requirements of their colleagues to ensure that all their needs are catered for if humanly possible. From the view point of continued therapeutic and psychological treatment for rehabilitation after hospitalisation of potential or existing workshop members,constant discussions with the Medical Social Workers of the hospitals concerned have proved useful in determining any special requirements in understanding what is wanted to build up the ego of the person in question by the application of physical effort combined with an atmosphere wherein they are encouraged to expand themselves. As a break from workshop routine, two outings were arranged for workshop members during the year, one to Southsea and one to the Wembley Ice Show to see 'Ali Baba on Ice' both outings being throughly enjoyed by the participants. 65 Generally the workshop is considered to have had a successful year in so far as attendance with a steady flow of work can be used as a gauge of achievement, the morale of all members remaining at a high standard, coupled with a strong determination to do the work given them to the best of their ability. The list of potential candidates for workshops has, unfortunately, had to be limited due to the present space shortage, but it is hoped that with the need for future expansion in mind, the Committee will remedy the existing situation on completion of the Borough amalgamation. DECORATING OLD PEOPLE' S ROOMS During the past year a regular working team of young people has been formed who are ready to undertake decorations in the homes of old people where we feel that clean and bright atmosphere will make a difference to their outlook and give them encouragement. This team of about ten young men who work chiefly at weekends, papering and painting. It often happens that a medical social worker warns the office that an old lady will soon be discharged from hospital and her room is known to be in need of decorative repair which she herself is unable to finance. Application is made to the National Assistance Board who is most sympathetic and if possible a grant is made for the purchase of materials. In this way the old lady comes back to a bright, cheery room which does much to raise her spirits and generally improve morale. In other cases the old person would like the work done and can afford to pay for materials, but cannot find the labour, and the same happy result is achieved. This is a very worthwhile and rewarding task which is most appreciated by the old people. We are very grateful to the young Civil Defence members for giving up so much of their time. Decorating is also being undertaken by some of the senior boys of Dulwich College and we are most grateful for this gesture, as indeed for all their generous help and support. THE FRIDAY SOCIAL From the original small group of twelve, the Friday Social has grown to a party of thirty-two lonely and handicapped people who are brought in every week to St. Alban's Hall. To arrange the transport and entertainment of these old people, some of whom are chair cases, needed much thought and organising. We were fortunate enough to have the willing and skilful assistance - 66 - of the W.V.S. who organise the entertainment every Friday, and were able to enlist the help of the police cadets who act as escorts on the coaches. Here we have three organisations working smoothly side by side, happy in the knowledge that thanks to their united efforts 32 old people may look forward each Friday to an enjoyable afternoon among friends. TELEVISION FOR THE HOMEBOUND Providing TV sets for homebound old people continues to be a great problem. There is a real need for them and we are unable to find enough sponsors. We have contacts with two firms who provide TV sets at reduced rentals, where the old people pay the licence and rental themselves but for many even this outlay is impossible on a very restricted budget and we would welcome offers from firms to present sets in genuine cases of need. This has been done on a large scale in other boroughs and we are sure that firms in Southwark are not less generous than elsewhere; we have had such a fine response to our appeals for funds in general that we venture to make this special appeal for old people who have no other possible form of entertainment; to those unable to go out, rarely visited by friends or relatives, TV can make all the difference and turn a bleak existence into cheerful living. THE VISITING COMMITTEE This committee, which began as a small nucleus of members representing a few of the voluntary bodies who organise visiting in their districts, has expanded during the year to include a large number of organisations,meeting every two months to supply lists of old people and information which has been useful to establish a central record. With the merging of the three boroughs in view,and the resultant difficulties of the transition period to overcome,it was decided to change the function of this committee and make it a forum of all interested in the welfare of the elderly, where they could talk over problems and obtain advice. To this end a panel of expert advisers has been invited to sit as co-opted members. While the statutory organisations will be able to offer useful adv ice they will be in a position to appreciate the difficulties of those working in the closest contact with the old people of the borough, and it is hoped that these informal talks will thus be of reciprocal value. - 67 - JOINT COMMITTEE OF THE OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEES OF BERMONDSEY, CAMBERWELL AND SOUTHWARK With the approaching merger of the three boroughs it was considered advisable for representatives of the Old People's Welfare Associations and Committees to meet to compare ideas and procedure. On the initiative of Southwark a meeting was held at St. Alban's Hall and after discussion which showed some divergencies of ways and means it was agreed to form a committee (consisting of 6 members of each committee or association and the three secretaries) who should meet regularly to try to arrive at co-ordination or assimilation of ideas on the most important points in old people's welfare: meals service, transport, chiropody, holidays and welfare visiting, and to formulate suggestions acceptable to all. It was then agreed to form a subcommittee of six (the chairman and secretary of each organisation) to collate the findings of the committee in order to submit them as recommendations to the new Welfare Committee. SENIOR CITIZEN' S COMMITTEE A quite new venture, as yet only in its infancy, was the forming of a committee representing the Old People of St. Alban's Hall. The principal aim, as set out in the constitution, is the care of the sick and housebound by those more active, and a team of members is being organised who will visit regularly at least once a week an old person who is ill or handicapped. Several elderly members are already at work and we hope that more and more will be encouraged to undertake this very worthwhile task. The Chairman of the Senior Citizens' Committee has been invited to sit as a member of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee. FLAG DAY Flag Day was held on Saturday, 6th September, and during that week boxes were sent out to churches, doctors, hospitals, shops and business firms, who had responded to the appeal for collection. The Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee is very grateful to all the helpers and as a result of this cooperation and willing assistance from so many people the record sum of £400 was raised. - 68 - ALEXANDER ROSE DAY This past year the sale of roses was organised from St. Alban's Hall and with the support of many local firms raised the sum of £90, of which we received a contribution of £50. DICKENS FAIR The Dickens Fair of 1964 was held on Saturday,5th December, at St. Alban's Hall. Large crowds had come to see Harry Secombe open the Fair and we were delighted to have with us also on this occasion the Mayor and Mayoress of Southwark, also Southwark's M.P., the Rt. Hon. Ray Gunter and Mrs. Gunter, and Alderman and Mrs. A. Gates. Thanks to the generosity of firms in the borough who gave donations or gifts in kind, and to local schools who collected money or gifts for sale, and last but certainly not least, to the efforts of the old people themselves and to the many friends of St. Alban's Hall, the considerable sum of £449. 6s. 4d. was put into the Comforts Fund for the benefit of the old people of Southwark. CHRISTMAS ACTIVITIES On Saturday, 19th December, St. Alban's Hall was the scene of one of the happiest parties ever held there. About 130 handicapped and housebound old people were brought by coach to enjoy tea, drinks and an entertainment,and for many it must have been one of the highlights of the year. On Wednesday, 16th December, the Annual Christmas Dinner was held at St. Alban's Hall. As always a wonderful meal was prepared and much enjoyed by those who attended the restaurant and those who were served by the Meals-on-Wheels service and at the luncheon clubs. As Christmas Day fell on a Friday there was the problem of filling in the gap over the weekend for the meals of the homebound and sick. An appeal was made, in co-operation with Mealson-Wheels helpers, to neighbours and friends of old people who would be left in difficulty, and all but 41 were catered for in this way. For these there was a special service of frozen meals cooked by members of the staff on Christmas Day and delivered by Voluntary helpers. - 69 - Over 600 parcels were distributed to old people in the borough - on account of the huge demand we had to limit recipients to those who were living quite alone or housebound. We should like to thank the United Africa Company, the Ministry of Transport (St. Christopher House), Staff of the Ministry of Health, the London Electricity Board, Lana of Walworth Road and Messrs. Brooks who were among the many donors of parcels. OUTINGS AND ENTERTAINMENTS During the past year there have been many enjoyable outings and the usual entertainments given by various concert parties and children's dancing classes and the choir. Weekly classes have been meeting as usual for dressmaking and handicrafts. The mobile library continues to call at St. Alban's Hall on Fridays and provides a very welcome service for the old people. A concert party from among the old people have been busy rehearsing for an entertainment which they hope to give in the near future, and which will be available also for the entertainment of other clubs if wanted." HOME ACCIDENTS Information regarding home accidents is available from the London County Council giving figures reported by the London Ambulance Service according to cause and age, cause and Divisional area, and the total numbers in each borough. In regard to cause and age, estimates have been prepared of those occurring in Southwark during 1964 which are set out in Table 1 under the various causes. Similarly in Table 2, estimates have been made of the numbers of accidents occurring in Southwark in 1964 in the various age groups and the percentage contribution made by each age group to the total accidents. It is emphasised that these figures can only be estimates. - 70 - Table 1 Falls on stairs 28 from ladders 2 from chairs 5 outside 5 in garden 4 from one level to another 9 on same level 12 in bath 1 unspecified 147 Total falls 213 Hit by object 7 Cooking stove 6 Teapots 2 Other boiling water 8 Electric shock 3 Poisoning 13 Gassing .5 Knife wounds 12 Fires 5 Windows 2 Suffocation 1 Unspecified 16 Total 292 Rate per 1,000 population 3.4 Table 2 Age groups: Under 1 year 6 2.0 per cent 1- 13 4.4 2-4 30 10.4 5-14 27 9.4 15-24 23 7.8 25-44 39 13.4 45-64 49 16.7 65-74 36 12.3 75 & over 69 23.6 Total 292 - 71 - INDEX Aged Persons, 20, 61-70 Air Pollution, 31, 32, 33 Animal Boarding, 35 Area, 2 Bakehouses, 53 Births, i, 2-5 Burials, 59 Cancer, 6 Catering premises, 53 Children's Nightdresses, 35 Clearance Areas, 43, 44 Closing Orders, 43, 44 Common Lodging Houses, 26 Compulsory removals, 59 Deaths, i, 2-11 Demolitions, 43, 44 Disinfection, 17, 18, 20 Disinfestation, 17-20 Dwellings, 2, 24 Factories, 25 Food Imported, 46-51 Premises, 54 Sampling, 47, 55-56 Unsound, 48-50 Hairdressers, 29 Health Education, iii Home Safety, 70-71 Housing, 43-45 Ice Cream, 52 Immunisation, ii, 12 Infectious Diseases, ii, 12, 14-16 Inspections, 21, 43-45 Laundry, 20 Legal Proceedings, 23, 57, 58 Liquid Egg Pasteurisation, 51-52 Meat Treatment Regs, 50 Medical Examinations, 60 Merchandise & Marks Act, 50 Milk, 53 Mineral Hydrocarbons, 59 Mortuary, 59, 60 National Assistance Act, 59 Notices, 21, 43, 44 Offensive Trades, 26 Offices, Shops & Railways Premises Act, 36-42 Outworkers, 26 Overcrowding, 43-45 Pet Animals Act, 26 Pharmacy & Poisons, 59 Population, i, 2 Public Health Committee, v Rag Flock, 30 Rateable value, 2 Rehousing, 43-45 Rent Act, 30 Rodent Control, 27, 28, 29 Scrap Metal Dealers, 30 Slaughterhouses, 53 Smoke Control, 31-33 Social Conditions, 1 Staff, v, 58 Swimming Baths, 34, 35 Treatment & Bathing Centre, 17 Tuberculosis, 6, 12, 13 Unfit Premises, 43, 44 Water Domestic, 23-24 Wells, 24 Work Completed, 22, 54
