Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Hammersmith, 19th June, 1895. Gentlemen,—I beg to present to yon my Annual Report for last year. My Report will deal with the vital statistics and with the sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Vestry during the 52 weeks ending on December 29th, 1894. births. During last year 2,902 births were registered in this Parish, against 2,950 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 200 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 103,029 inhabitants, the number of births, registered during the year was equal to an annual rate of 28.2 births per 1,000 persons living. The birth-rate in London during last year on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,349, 166 inhabitants was equal to an annual rate of 30.1 births per 1,000 persons living. 187 DEATHS. During last year 1,510 deaths were registered in this Parish against 1,642 in the previous year. Making dueallowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in this Parish last year was 241 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. Adding 293 deaths of parishioners of this Parish which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other parishes of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums and deducting 154 deaths of non-parishioners which occurred, 97 at the West London Hospital, 40 at Nazareth House, 1 at St. Mary's Orphanage, 2 at St. Joseph's Schools, 8 at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, 2 at H.M. Prison, Wormwood Scrubs, and 4 which otherwise occurred in the Parish, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners which were registered during last year was 1649. On the before mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners which were registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 16*0 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate in London on the estimated population up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 17.8 deaths per 1,000 persons living. deaths of infants. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners, under one year of age, that were registered during last year was 423, against 470 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 25.7 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and was equal to 14.6 per cent. of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 24.8 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and to 14.3 per cent. of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered, 0.9 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London, and as compared with the total births registered 0'3 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London. 188 DEATHS OF AGED PERSONS. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 368, against 464 in the previous year. The number of these deaths last year was equal to 22.3 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered. The percentage of deaths of persons at 60 years of age and upwards in London last year was equal to 22.3 per cent. of the total deaths registered. This death-rate was, therefore, the same in this parish as in London. TABLE I.

Note 1. Medical Officers of Health of " Combined Districts" must make a separate Return for the District of each Sanitary Authority. 2. Medical Officers of Health acting for a portion only of the District of a Sanitary Authority should write, in the heading of the Table, the designation of the Division for which they act. 3. The words " Urban" " Rural,'' or "Metropolitan" must be inserted in in the appropriate space in the heading, according as the Sanitary Authority for the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The " Localities " adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population; such as parishes, groups of parishes. townships or wards. As stated at the head of the first column in each Table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments in which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. ft. The deaths which hare to be classified in this Table (A), and summed up in the horizontal line of " Totals," are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, e.g., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which corrections apply, may appear in the text of the report or in supplementary tables. Area and Population of the District or Division to which this Return relates. Area in Acres 2,287 Population (1891) 97,237 In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables A and B, attention has been given to the notes endorsed on the Tables. N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. June 19th, 1895. 191 DEATHS FROM THE NINE PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of parishioners that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases during last year was 272, against 286 in the previous year. The deaths of parishioners last year from these diseases were equal to 16.5 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 0.26 deaths per 100 persons living. The deaths from the nine principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 15.0 deaths per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 0.27 deaths per 100 persons living; these deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered, 1.5 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London: but as compared with the population. 0.01 per cent. less in this Parish than in London. TABLE III. The following table shows the deaths of parishioners registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the years 1885 to 1894. Year. Small-pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Whooping Cough. Typhus Fever. Enteric Fever. Simple Continued Fever. Diarrtœa and Cholera.

There were 684 cases of illness reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Parish during last year, against 1,252 in the previous year. There were also 142 192 cases of illness that were not notifiable under the Act, reported as due to infectious diseases, against 57 in the previous year. SMALL-POX. Seven cases were reported as due to small-pox last year, against 21 cases in the previous year. Of the seven cases which were reported last year, one was treated at the home of the patient, and six were removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, at the request of your Vestry, to the Hospital Ships at Dartford. No death occurred. All of the seven patients attacked had been vaccinated in infancy, but had never been re-vaccinated. It is to be noted that, although these patients contracted the disease none of them died. No doubt the protection afforded by vaccination in infancy so far mitigated the severity of the complaint as to prevent a fatal termination. CHICKEX-POX. One case of chicken-pox was reported last year against no case in the previous year. The case reported last year was treated at the home of the patient. MEASLES. Eighty-six cases were reported last year as due to measles, against six cases on the previous year. Seventytwo cases were not reported until after death, and in 14 cases the patients were at the time the disease was reported still suffering from the complaint. Eighty cases reported: last year were treated at the homes of the patients, one at the West London Hospital, and five at the Fulham Union Infirmary. As this is not a notifiable disease, it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as, no doubt, a very small proportion of the cases which occurred were reported to me. SCARLET FEVER Three hundred and thirty-two cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 673 cases in the previous year. One hundred and seventy-six cases reported last year were isolated in Isolation Hospitals, 171 at the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals, and five at the London 193 Fever Hospital at Islington, and 151 cases were treated at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the the cases reported was 3.01 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. One hundred and eighty-nine cases were reported as due to diphtheria or diphtheritic membranous croup, against 282 cases in the previous year. Forty-two cases reported last year were treated in the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 29 at the West London Hospital, and 118 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the total cases reported in the Parish was 28.08 per cent. WHOOPING COUGH. Fifty-five cases were reported last year as due to whooping cough, against 51 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at home, and were not reported until after death. As this is not a notifiable disease, it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as, no doubt, a very much larger number of cases which recovered were not reported to me. ENTERIC FEVER. Fifty-two cases were reported last year as due to enteric fever, against 68 cases in the previous year. Five of the cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 10 at the West London Hospital, one at St. Mary's Hospital, two at Charing Cross Hospital, and one at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Thirty-three cases were treated at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 26.9 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. No case was reported last year as due to typhus fever against no case in the previous year. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. Four cases were reported last year as due to simple, continued fever against four cases in the previous year. One of the cases reported last year was treated at an N 194 Isolation Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and three cases were treated at the homes of the patients. No death occurred. PUERPERAL FEVER. Eight cases were reported as due to puerperal fever last year, against 19 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last Year were treated at the homes of the patients. The mortality on the cases reported was 37.5 per cent. CHOLERA. No case was reported as due to cholera last year, against one case in the previous year. ERYSIPELAS. Ninety-two cases were reported as due to erysipelas iast year, against 184 cases in the previous year. Of the 92 cases reported last year nine were treated in the Fulham Union Infirmary, and 83 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 3.26 per cent. TABLE IV. The following table shows the number of cases that were reported as due to the under-mentioned 13 zymotic diseases during the years 1888 to 1894:— Year. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria or Diphtheritic Group Typhus Fever. Enteric Fever Simple Continued Fever. Relapsing Fever. Puerperal Fever. English Cholera. Erysipelas. Chicken-pox. Measles. Whooping Cough.

(See also Notes on back of Table A.) Note 1. The present Table B is concerned with population, births, and sickness (not with mortality) in the Sanitary district or division to which the Table relates. 2. As stated in the heading of Col. (a), Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the new cases of sickness in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 3. Comments on any unequal incidence of notifiable disease upon the several localities, and consideration as to the local incidence of consumption and other prevalent diseases, should be made in the text of the Report. 197 INFLUENZA. During last year 11 deaths were registered as due primarily to "Influenza," against 17 deaths in the previous year. No official action was taken in reference to this complaint. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 17 Licensed Slaughter-houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the several Sanitary Inspectors during last year. At the annual inspection of Slaughter-houses in October, 1894, I found them to be all in a satisfactory condition. At the Special Sessions . of the London County Council, held on October 29th, the whole of the 17 licences were granted without opposition by your Vestry.

The three Licensed Cowhouses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the several Sanitary Inspectors during last year. Before the annual inspection of Cowhouses, I received two notices from cowkeepers of their intention to apply for the renewal of their licences. At my annual inspection I found that the premises were in a satisfactory condition, and at the Special Sessions of the London County Council, held on October the 29th, both of the licences were renewed without opposition from your Vestry. Subsequent to October the 29th, I received a notice of an intention to apply at the adjourned meeting of the Special Sessions for the renewal of the licence for the other premises that had been previously licensed. I visited the premises at Wormholt Farm, but found that at the time of my visit no cows were being kept there. Your Vestry took no action in reference to the renewal of this licence, as no meeting intervened between the notice and the adjourned Special Sessions. At the adjourned Special Sessions of the London County Council, the licence was refused. The following is a List of the Licensed Cowhouses in this Parish :— Centre Ward. Address.

In 6 instances it was reported that the premises were not in a proper sanitary condition. Notices were served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Vestry. In each instance the notice was at once complied with. 199 The following is a list of the bakehouses in the Parish:— North Ward. Address. Name. 356, Uxbridge Road J.

SEIZURE OF UNWHOLESOME FOOD No articles of food were found to be in such a state as to be unfit for the food of man so as to justify seizure under 54 and 55 Vic., chap. 76, sec. 47. The heavy penalties obtained some years ago have no doubt had a salutary effect in preventing food being offered for sale in such a state to justify seizure. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 2,516 notices were reported as having been served by your Sanitary Inspectors, having for their 201 object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 2,997 in the previous year, and during last year 2,653 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 2,836 in the previous year. The wise course adopted by your Vestry in appointing a houseto-house inspector has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 3,317 houses in the parish. Altogether since his appointment on January 20th, 1893, he reports that he has inspected 6,892 out of a total of about 14,500 inhabited houses in the parish. The defects in premises discovered as the result of his inspection are dealt with by the four District Sanitary Inspectors. The reason why there were less notices served during last year as compared with the previous year, was owing to the fact that for a portion of the year one of the District Sanitary Inspectors was away owing to illness, and afterwards one of the appointments was vacant. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Vestry and Sanitary Committee gave authority for 178 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of your Vestry or the Sanitary Committee. Before any summonses were taken out a letter was written to the person in default, informing him that the Vestry or the Sanitary Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he were willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In most instances the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply to the magistrate for a summons. It has been the object of the Department to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no single instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Vestry. SUMMONSES TAKEN OUT. During last year only two summonses were taken out at the West London Police Court through the Sanitary Department. 202 The following is a list of the premises in reference to which summonses were issued with a statement as to the nature of the complaint and the result of the proceedings: TABLE VI. Address. Nature of Complaint. Result of Proceedings. Albert Mills, Oil Mill Lane Nuisance from smoke Defendant fined £5, and order made to abate the nuisance in 21 days. 1, Gates Cottages Premises unfit for occupation from dampness, &c. The warrant officer reported to the Magistrate on the hearing day that the defendant was not in a state of mind to understand the nature of the summons. The son of the defendant appeared and stated that the premises were unoccupied, and he would undertake that they should not be again let until therequirements of the Vestry were complied with. The Magistrate adjourned the summons sine die. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During last year your Vestry removed four dead bodies of persons who had died from infectious diseases to the mortuary at the Wharf, Chancellor's. There were 135. bodies brought to the Mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police, 33 of these were taken from the West London Hospital, and included 16 parishioners and 17 non-parishioners. PUBLIC NUISANCES. During last year I brought before your Sanitary Committee complaints received by me in reference to the following alleged public nuisances:— I. Insanitary condition of the roadway of Heath Place, Uxbridge Eoad. II. Nuisance from smoke from stable at the rear of 172, King Street. 203 III. Nuisance from Mr. Thomas Wiggins' premises, Old Oak Lane, in the Parish of Acton. IV. Large deposit of manure on Mr. Fortescue's ground, Rylett Crescent. V. Offensive odour from Messrs. Shepherd's Corn Malting Works, Hammersmith Mall. VI. Offensive effluvia from London Road Car Company's stables, Hammersmith Road. VII. Offensive fumes from the Epstein Electric Accumulator Company, Cadby Hall, Hammersmith Road. VIII. Offensive odour from the removal of fish offal from No. 9, Bridge Road. IX. Offensive effluvia from the removal of manure from Cobbold Mews. X. Deposit of ashes and house refuse in hole at the end of Hythe Road. XI. Offensive effluvia from accumulation of manure at Down's Place, King Street. XII. Offensive effluvia from the burning of fish at No. 254, Goldhawk Road. The whole of these complaints were reported upon, and had the careful consideration of your Sanitary Committee. PROSECUTION OF BRICK-MAKERS IN WOOD LANE. During last year proceedings were taken by the Kensington Vestry against three brickmakers in Wood Lane for an alleged nuisance to the inhabitants of Kensington from brick-burning, and the magistrate in convicting the defendants, expressed in very decisive terms his opinion that there had been neglect on the part of your Vestry in not taking proceedings in the matter. Such expression of opinion was in my opinion not justified by the facts, for as a matter of fact, no nuisance to the inhabitants of your parish has ever been discovered from brick-burning in the locality which would have justified any proceedings being taken by your Vestry. As a matter of fact the inhabitants of the locality have never to any considerable extent complained of a nuisance from brick-burning. During the last six years only two complaints have been received from inhabitants in your parish. One of these complaints was made by a lady who lived close to the brickfields. She commenced her letter by saying that the brick-burning had been stopped for five years, when 204 as a matter of fact it had only been stopped for one year, and therefore, although she lived close to the brickfields, so little nuisance did she perceive that for four years previous she thought that the brick-making had been discontinued. The only serious nuisances discovered from any of the brickfields during the last 18 years have been from two causes. One, about 15 years ago, by the burning of soft core, and in reference to which the inhabitants of the locality then bitterly complained, and the other from enormous heaps of ashes and house refuse deposited in the fields on the west of the lane. These heaps were mainly caused by the refuse brought there by the Kensington Vestry from the Parish of Kensington. Since the Kensington Vestry has ceased to deposit refuse in the fields, I have been unable to discover that any nuisance has been caused in the locality, and I do not at all believe that the brick-makers of Wood Lane have ever caused any nuisance to the inhabitants of Kensington from the burning of bricks. METEOROLOGY. The average mean temperature registered in London during last year was 49º.9 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 86º.0 in August. The lowest temperature registered was 12º.8 in January. Rain fell on 192 days. The total amount of rain fall was 26.88 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. C.

To the Chairman and Members of the Hammersmith Vestry. Gentlemen,—During the past year the total number of articles submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs and the Margarine Acts was 254. The number received during each of the four quarters of the year, and the division of these samples according to the results of analysis into genuine, inferior and adulterated, are as follows : TABLE 1.

Besides these adulterated samples there were 20 others considered to be of inferior quality, although not 208 sufficiently bad to justify their condemnation as adulterated. These inferior samples constitute therefore 7.87 per cent. of the whole. I wish to point out, as was the case last year, that these inferior samples were in each case samples of milk. The following table shows the percentage of adulterated and inferior samples, and also a comparison of the extent of adulteration during the past nine years :— TABLE III. Year. Total number of samples examined. Percentage of pure. Percentage. Inferior. Percentage Adulterated. 1886-87 160 83.75 16.25 1887—88 183 91.90 8.10 1888-89 196 74.50 12.24 13.26 1889—90 186 77.97 11.82 10.21 1890—91 184 76.70 8.70 14.67 1891—92 204 74.52 15.19 10.29 1892—93 250 82.00 5.20 12.80 1893—94 234 80.34 7.69 11.97 1894—95 254 85.82 7.87 6.30 A short note as to the results of summonses under the Adulteration Acts, see separate heading " Result of Summonses " page 59. Respecting the samples examined:— MILK. The sale of poor milk, that is of milk of inferior quality, has in no way abated during the past year. Of the 75 samples of milk examined, it will be seen that only three were so bad as to be returned as adulterated. In two cases water was added, and in the remaining case 15 per cent. of the fat had been abstracted. On the other hand the number of samples of milk which were of inferior quality have increased in number, and only 52 out of 75 samples analysed could be regarded as satisfactory. I would again call attention to the unsatisfactory state of the law in respect to the sale of this important article of food. 209 BUTTER. Of the 42 samples examined, it will be seen that 11 were adulterated, or 26.2 per cent. of those examined. This is slightly less than was the case last year, when the adulterated samples rose to 29.8 per cent. The percentage of foreign fat in the adulterated samples varied from 76 to 95 per cent., and the mean of the percentage of foreign fat reached an average of 84.7 per cent. Boric acid had been used in two cases as a preservative. It is needless for me to point out how largely margarine seems to be sold for butter in the parish. COCOA. There were eight samples of cocoa examined, and of these one was adulterated. The sample contained 35 per cent. of cocoa, the remainder consisting of 30 per cent. starch and 35 per cent. of sugar. These are the usual adulterants of cocoa. SPIRITS. Ten samples of whiskey, six of gin, three of brandy, and one of rum were examined. Of these, one sample of whiskey was found to be deficient in alcoholic strength, to the extent of nine degrees below the legal limit fixed by the Sale of Foods and Drugs Amendment Act of 1879. The remaining samples do not call for special notice. It will be seen that, as I pointed out last year, the practice of adulteration of food and drugs in Hammersmith is limited to a comparatively few substances as milk and butter. But it is to be noted that these are among the most important of all foods, and it is greatly to be regretted that the practice of selling these two articles of food in an adulterated state is still so much in evidence. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Wm. CHATTAWAY, F.I.C., Public Analyst. o 211 Annual Report of SURVEYOR, YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1895. 212 THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF HAMMMERSMITH. surveyor's department.

WOOD PAVING. KING STREET. {between Broadway and Shaftesbury Road.) The yellow deal paving laid in 1885 was taken up and the road repaved with Sin. by 9in. by 3in. Jarrahdale Jarrah wood blocks. The wood was purchased direct; from the importers as it was considered that a saving could be effected, and the Vestry having purchased the necessary plant, a part of the deals were sawn into blocks by the Vestry's own workmen. 219 The cost of taking up and removing the old wood pavement, preparing and screeding the foundation, laying and grouting the blocks, was £1,420.3.8. The number of wood blocks delivered on the ground was 406,711, and taking the cost of these at £11.10.0 per 1,000, it equals £4,677.3.3, making a total of £6,097.6.11, which is equal to 12/6 per superficial yard. In this amount is included the fixing and connecting of 6 additional gullies, and the work carried out at the expense of the rail contractor, which amounts to £39.5.5, which if deducted from the above total, equals 12/5 per superficial yard. Negotiations were entered into with the Tramway Company for the Vestry's workmen to pave that portion of the road under their control simultaneously with the Vestry's, so as to expedite the progress of the work. The amount paid by the Tramway Company is £1,320.13.0, making a nett cost to the Vestry of £4,776 . 13 . 11. UXBRIDGE ROAD. Tenders were invited for the excavation, carting of same, laying six inches of concrete foundation, and laying the wood blocks which were deposited on the side of the road by the Vestry. The total cost of such paving was as follows:— £ s. d. Value of Wood Blocks 11,706 11 11 Excavating, laying and grouting 4,220 15 11 New Gullies 171 6 4 Relaying curb, paving, and other incidental work 350 0 7 16,448 14 9 Less paid by Tramway Company 5,889 2 6 £10,559 12 3 220 With respect to the cost of supplying the wood blocks under the new arrangement, whereby the Vestry purchased the timber and had it sawn, partially by their own men and partially at the saw mills ; the quantity of timber in deals delivered was 2,340½ loads, and from that 1,476,095 blocks of 3in. by 9in. by 5in. were cut—this is equal to 630 blocks to the load. The total cost of the wood, barging up river, unloading, sawing, sawing plant, engines, and delivering and stacking the blocks on the road, and including 10 per cent. for supervision, is £16,524.10.0, equal to £11.3.11 per thousand. When the proposal was before the Committee on the 10th April, 1894, for the purpose of comparison, the value of the blocks was taken at £12.12.6 per thousand, this being the price paid by the Vestry the previous month, and it was then stated that a sum of £2,406 would be saved by adopting this method of obtaining the wood. If the difference between these two sums of £12.12.6 and £11.3.11 is taken, it gives a nett saving of £2,109 .9.0; in addition, there is a quantity of about 12,000 blocks in stock, varying from 2½ to 4½ inches in depth, as also the plant consisting of three saw benches, engine and sheds.

In last year's Annual Report will be found the terms upon which the above-named park was conveyed to the Vestry, and the matter having been duly completed, plans, estimates, and specifications, were prepared, presented and approved by the Committee for laying out the park. The plan showed a portion of the ground fenced off on the west side to be used for the purpose of a gymnasium fitted up with giant strides, swings, horizontal bars, &c., also a shelter, so that, in case of wet, the children using the park would have the opportunity of playing in a dry place. The other portion of the land has a serpentine path arranged around it, and the space 225 between the walk and the boundary is to be tilled in with plants and shrubs. The centre of the ground is grass. The ground has been levelled at a cost of £349.2.11, and a contract has been entered into for sewering, paving, curbing, and metalling the roads skirting Wendell Park, the contract price being £1,300, but at the present time the roads are not yet completed. The actual cost of laying out the park will appear in the next Report. IMPROVEMENTS. FULHAM PALACE ROAD AT THE JUNCTION WITH QUEEN STREET. The details of this important improvement having appeared in previous Annual Reports, I have now pleasure in giving the cost of same. The surplus land was put up to auction, but as the reserve price was not reached it was withdrawn, and subsequently the Vestry took over the land at the reserve and have used it for the purpose of stacking and sawing Jarrah timber into blocks. £ s. d.

The paving and curbing at the present time has not yet been laid down, and the cost of same will appear in the next Annual Report. KING STREET, An improvement has been effected opposite Nos. 26 and 26a, King Street, by the setting back of the shop fronts and a strip of land thrown into and added to the public footway. The Vestry paid £50 compensation for the land given up. REMOVAL OF HOARDING ACROSS PRIVATE ROAD LEADING FROM ABDALE ROAD TO TUNIS ROAD. As there was no communication between the above roads, a want that the inhabitants greatly needed, the Vestry considered the advisability of removing the same, and after negotiation paid the sum of £200 for the piece of land lying between Abdale Road and Tunis Road, the Vestry to make up the roadway and pave and curb the footways, which work will be carried out as soon as the Vestry obtain possession of the land. CEYLON ROAD. An improvement has been effected by a path being laid down of York stone and curb on the east side for a short distance, at a cost of £9.5.9. RAVEXSCOURT PARK. A piece of land given up by the London County Council, and added to the public footway. The Vestry paved it with 3-inch York stone, at a cost of £21.2.9. WATERLOO STREET. The old paving and curb has been taken up and carted to the wharf, and curb and paving from King Street has been resquared, redressed, jointed, and laid down in its 227 place. The old channel, where defective, was made good, but in several places granite curb had to be substituted for it. SUSSEX PLACE. The old curb taken up from King Street has been redressed and jointed, and laid down as channel on 6in, Portland cement concrete. BROADWAY COTTAGE. vestry's STABLES DEPOT. The Cartage Committee, having had under consideration the insufficient accommodation afforded to the Superintendent in Broadway Cottage, gave instructions for plans and estimates to be prepared, shewing increased room. The design submitted to the Committee shewed the dining-room enlarged, a w.c. and lavatory to be fitted up on the first floor, and two additional bedrooms on the top floor, which was effected by adding an additional storey. The total cost of the above alteration was £258.12.9. SEWERS. The length of main trunk Sewers in the Parish is 8 miles 6 furlongs 83 yards. The length of Sewers under the jurisdiction of the Vestry is 12 miles 0 furlongs 146 yards of brick, and 23 miles 0 furlongs 127 yards pipe sewers, the total being— Brick. Pipe. Total. Miles. Fur.

A complaint having been made that sewage water had risen in the basements of three houses in Devonport Road, the sewer was opened out, and on examination was found to be choked with fine sand and sewage, and it was considered that the only remedy to relieve the houses was to relay the sewer, which was done at a cost of £218 . 18 . 3. The existing manholes were built up with 9-inch brickwork to the level of the surface of the road, and fitted with ventilating covers. GULLIES. Sixty-eight additional stoneware gullies have been built and the connections to the sewer made, and nine gullies have been cleaned out and made watertight in the new streets taken to by the Vestry. Thirty have been fixed by Vestry's workmen in different roads in the Parish where new channelling has been laid, and also where it was found difficult to drain the water when relaying the channelling. The gullies are cleansed regularly in the summer once every month and flushed with water, and in winter once every six weeks. Two horses and carts, with men, havebeen employed 497 days removing 1,487 loads of slop. 229 In dry weather during the summer, two water-carts are employed filling the gullies with water and disinfectants. manholes. Thirty-two Manholes have been built up to the surface of the road, and provided with ventilating covers, and nine have been built in the new streets taken to by the Vestry. FLUSHING. Two men have been out 68 days with Flushing Van, and during that time discharged 726 loads of water into the sewers. The van contains 1,000 gallons of water when full, and the sewers of 92 different streets have been flushed. HOUSE DRAINAGE. In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120, sec. 76, and with the instructions issued by the Vestry to Builders and others, applications and plans have been submitted to and approved by the Works Committee, and subsequently sanctioned by the Vestry for the drainage of 206 dwelling houses, shops, &c.; six for churches, chapels and schools, and 18 for stables, factories and miscellaneous buildings. The drains are laid in accordance with the deposited plans, and in every case the Drainage Inspector tests the pipes before they are covered in. During the year 1894-95, the Vestry's workmen have laid and connected 96 drains from the back line of the footpaths to the sewers, and unstopped 18 house drains. The amount deposited to meet the cost of same was £530.5.8, paid in from time to time to the Accountant, which, with the balance left in hand on the 25th March, 1894, viz., £27.5.0, amounted to £557.10.8. The actual cost of the work carried out was £403.7.11. The surplus was £91 .1.6, which, after being reported to the 230 Finance Committee, was returned to the respective depositors, leaving a balance in hand of £63.1.8, being mostly deposits made in respect of drainage works just before closing the books on the 25th March, 1895. WATER FOR STREET WATERING, ROLLING, &c. The vans were out 116 days, during which time 1,697 horses and vans were employed, and 41.468 loads of water were distributed, giving an average of 24.43 loads per horse per day. The vans have an average capacity of holding 412 gallons when full, the quantity of water used and the cost thereof appear in the undermentioned statement. £ s. d.

UNDERGROUND SANITARY CONVENIENCE. THE BROADWAY. The following statement shows the number of persons using the w.c.'s and lavatory, and the amount of the 231 receipts. It will be observed on referring to the table that there is a considerable increase in the number of persons using the convenience as compared with the corresponding period of last year. The waste pipes from the urinals have, from time to time, become stopped up with furr by corrosion of the metal, and to obviate these continual stoppages, the pipes have been altered, and now discharge direct into the gullies, and it is hoped that there will be no future cause of complaint.

The Electric Lighting Committee having visited several existing electric installations, with a view of inquiring into the several systems, instructed the Surveyor to prepare a synopsis of the information obtained, and in accordance therewith the following report was laid before the Committee:— ST. PANCRAS. The works are situated in Stanhope Street, and have been erected to supply current to the South Western area of the district, being from 1 mile to 1¼ square. The Vestry purchased the site for £10,000; it is freehold and included a considerable number of small houses. About one halt of the site only has been cleared for the station, and the houses on the remainder yield a revenue from rents. The works were designed to serve 10,000 incandescent lamps of 16 c.-p., together with 90 arc lamps. The engine house is about 100 ft. long by 26 to 28 ft. wide; the boiler house is at the back of the engine house, the other parts of the building consists of battery room, testing room, office and stores. There is also an underground tank for storing water capable of holding 170,000 gallons. The chimney is 90 feet high. There are 8 water tube boilers of the Babcock and Wilcox type, 5 being 250 h.p. and 3 of 150 h.p.; 1 lb. of best Welsh coals evaporates about 9 lb. of water. There are 17 engines and dynamos, 12 being for private lighting, and 5 for street lighting. Two dynamos of 120 h.p. are kept running during the day to drive the motors for trade purposes. The engines are of the triple expansion type, and are supplied by Messrs. Willins & Robinson. Fourteen of the dynamos are of the Kapp type, made by Messrs. Johnson & Phillips, and 3 by Messrs. Clarke, Murehead & Co. The arc lamps are placed on posts 25 ft. from the ground. They are fixed from 120 to 240 feet apart along the middle of the road. There is an arrangement for cooling the hot water from the condensers. The arrangement consists of a large surface of corrugated iron sheets, over which the water flows, being collected underneath, and returned to the bottom tank. The plates providing the cooling surfaces are attached to framing, which is supported on the main chimney shaft. Q 2 244 The mains for the distributing of the current are laid on the low tension and what is known as the 3-wire system. The conductors are of bare copper strips, l½in. wide by Jin. thick; they are supported on edge in glazed porcelain insulators, which are carried on small cast-iron brackets built into the walls of the culvert. The smallest distributors have one strip in each conductor, and the largest, four strips on the outside and three strips on the middle conductor. The culverts are constructed of brick and concrete. The bottom is formed with concrete rendered on the inside with cement. The arc light cables are laid in 2in. cast-iron pipe by the side of the culverts. The Vestry have laid about 13 miles of main distributing lines. The public supply of current commenced in June, 1891. EALING. The works are situate in South Ealing Road, and occupy a portion of the ground used for the precipitation of the Sewage and Destruction of House Refuse and Sludge from the Sewage works. The buildings include engine-house, meter room,, boiler-room, with coal stores above, the whole area being about two acres. The compulsory area of supply extends the whole length of the district from east to west, being about 2 miles, and from north to south about 1½ miles. The works were designed to serve 5,000 8 c.p. incandescent lamps, and in addition it was thought advisable to provide for 70 arc lamps for public lighting. The amount expended was for— Buildings £9,000 Approximate. Boilers and Accessories 2,000 Engines and Dynamos 8,500 Mains 10,000 Total £29,500 The engine house, with meter room, is 72ft. by 35ft., and the boiler house, with coal stores above on the same level as the Occupation Road, is 42ft. 6in. by 28ft. 6in., and there is room on the south side for extending it to about double the size. The chimney is about 175 feet high, and is used also for destructor furnaces. There are three boilers of the Lancashire type by J. Watts and Co., constructed for a working pressure of 1201bs. Above the boiler house is a store capable of holding 100 tons of fuel, and the furnaces are fed with mechanical stokers direct. 245 The dynamos with engines are divided into two parts, one for public and the other for private lighting. The plant for public lighting comprises three direct coupled sets of Browett & Lindley engines, and Siemens constant current dynamos, and for private lighting four direct coupled sets of similar types of engines and Siemens alternators, together with two sets of single engines and Siemen's exciters direct coupled. The three engines are of the vertical compound condensing type. They are of 35 h.-p., and run at 300 revolutions per minutes. The four engines for private lighting two of the sets are of 100 h.-p., and run at 200 revolutions per minute, and the other two sets are of 50 h.-p., and run at 240 revolutions per minute. The effluent from the sewage works is used for condensing purposes, and the plant for pumping is installed in the basement of the engine house. The plant comprises a general surface condensor, to which is connected the main exhaust pipe receiving the whole of the exhaust steam from the engines. As already stated, the plant was designed to supply current for 5,000 8 c.-p. incandescent lamps for private lighting, and the Committee were informed that there were now 4,700 on the books ; the price charged is 6d. per unit to customers. The arc lamps for street lighting are of the Brockie & Pell type, and are suspended at a height of 24 feet from the ground by means of brackets arranged at the top of iron standards. They are capable of burning for 32 consecutive hours without being retrimmed. The base of the lamps in some cases are used for placing the transformers used in connection with the private supply mains. The method of distributing the current is on the high pressure alternating current to the primary circuits of the transformers, and it is there reduced from 2,000 volts to 102 volts. The following is the number of men employed at the station:— 1 Superintendent 2 Assistants 3 Engineers 2 Stokers 2 Labourers 2 Carpenters WEST BROMPTON. The works are situated in Richmond Road, adjoining the Metropolitan District Railway, on a plot of land 470ft. long by 60ft. wide. The building consists of offices, workshops, testing-room, boiler and engine-room. 246 There are four Babcock and Wilcox boilers, working up to a pressure of 120lb., and four of Fowler & Son's horizontal coupled compound engines, running at about 90 revolutions per minute ; one of them is of a small size, and works after 12 p.m. The dynamos are of the Lowell-Barker type, and made by Elwell, Parker & Co., and are driven by ropes from grooved flywheels of engines. At present there are about 36,000 8-c.p. incandescent lamps installed. The charge is 8d. per B.T. unite for private lighting and 6d. for public lighting. The supply is the high tension alternating current system, and it leaves the station at 2,000 volts, and is transformed. There is a very good automatic oiling arrangement in use. It is Mr. Bowden's patent. WESTMINSTER VESTRY DEPOT. Your Sub-Committee were informed that the Vestry of Westminster had adopted to a certain extent a combined system of dust destructor with an Electric Installation, and visited the works, after visiting the House-to-House Installation at Chelsea. When the Westminster Vestry were considering the arrangements in connection with the erection of stables, shops, and other buildings in connection with their depot, they decided to fix a boiler and a furnace for the destruction of refuse on Mr. Livett's principle. Mr. Wheeler, the Surveyor, who met the Committee, explained that the furnace consumed about four loads per day, equal to nine yards for 24 hours; there was a quantity of clinker, about 75 per cent. of the whole quantity being consumed, and this is ground up, and used with lime for mortar. The boiler, which can be worked up to about 80lb., but was giving only about 12½lb. from the refuse, provided all the steam to work the chaff-cutting machines, mortar mill, saw benches, as well as the electric dynamos. The electric installation would give sufficient power for 500 16-c.-p. lights, and there are about 50 lights in the stables, workshops, sheds, and offices. The Vestry have no power to supply private consumers, but they could light the street lamps and their own buildings. CHELSEA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY. The works are situated at Draycott Place, and were erected in 1887 and occupy the whole of the ground, the area being small, only about 100ft. deep by 40ft. wide: the necessity for an extension became apparent at the end of 1894, and a second generating station was erected in Manor Street. 247 The system is a combination of moderately high pressure direct current batteries using accumulators, and direct current motor transformers for low pressure discharge. The mode of distribution employed is that the current is generated at the central stations at a pressure of 1,000 volts, and is delivered to five sub-stations where it is transformed by means of continuous-current motor transformers to a pressure of 100 volts. Storage batteries are placed in these sub-stations, which, after being charged from the high pressure mains are switched on to the low pressure lamp service ; during the period of light load the accumulators alone are used, and during the period of heavy load,the transformers are turned on one at a time as the load increases and turned off similarly as the load decreases, the sub-stations being completely shut down after the transformer work is over. The lamp connections at the present time are 50,000 8-candle incandescent power lamps. There is no public street lighting. In Draycott Place there are six water-tube boilers (four of Babcock and Wilcox type and two of Mills type) having a total capacity of 900 horse power, at a working pressure of 150lbs. per square inch. The waste steam is used for partially heating the feed water; the current is generated by separately excited dynamo machines, driven by Willan's compound high speed engines coupled direct to the dynamos. The dynamos are of the Elwell and Parker type. The Committee only visited one of the sub-stations ; but they were informed that in three of them a battery and motor transformers are used, and two of the substations contain batteries alone. The furthest point served from any sub-station in the district is at present about 1½ miles. PORTSMOUTH. The site of the generating station is in proximity to the harbour, and is fairly central for the supply mains radiating to Southsea, Portsea and Landport. The buildings upon a portion of the site have been erected to allow of future extensions being economically carried out, they consist of boiler, economiser and engine-house with a coal store convenient to the boilers. The offices are over the coal store, and the store and test rooms, &c., adjoin the engine-house. The engine-house is 102 feet long by 66 feet wide, and is spanned by a travelling crane capable of lifting a weight of at least 10 tons. The boilers consist of five Lancashire boilers, and work at about 1401bs. to the square inch, The boilers are fitted with mechanical stokers and furnaces, and coal is conveyed to the hopper of these stokers by a conveyor running across the boiler-house directly over the hopper. There are 218 three slow speed engines and alternators. The alternators are not coupled to the engines, but form an integral portion of them. The fly-wheel being in the centre and having upon the outside of its circumference the field magnets which revolve inside the stationary armature. The condensors are connected up to an intake pipe which lies inthe trench behind the cylinders, and is carried 250 yards to a point in the Camber where tolerably clean sea water is obtained. The discharge of each condensor is connected to a discharge-pipe which discharges its water into the Camber. In addition there is one steam turbinealternator and exciter side by side with the engines but the Committee were informed it has not been found to answer well. The system of distribution is the alternating current with transformer stations beneath the surface of the streets, and about 300 yards apart. The boxes containing the transformers are of cast-iron, and are placed in brick chambers. Three separate sets of conductors are provided:— 1. High tension feeders to supply the primary windings of the various transformers. 2. Low tension distribution wires receiving the low sion current from the transformers, and distributing it to the premises of the consumers; and 3. High tension arc lighting mains containing the arc lamps in series of about 40 each. The high tension feeders and the arc lighting mains proceed straight from the generating station, but the low tension distribution wires are entirely disconnected from the generating station, and are only connected with the transformers which feed into them. The Committee noticed that where the arc lamps are used in street lighting that there are two incandescent lamps on the same post, one on each side; and these are used after midnight, the arc light being switched off at that hour. It is the practice where the system of supply is on the alternating current, and where public lighting is provided in addition to the private lighting, that an entirely separate plant, adopted for running the arc lamps in series, is used for the production of the current. The plant usually consists of two or three sets of engines of comparatively small power running high tension continuous current machines; this is found a great disadvantage owing to the smallness of the engines, and also that the engines working the private lighting plant are running with very little load. It was decided, therefore, to use Rectifyers, making the alternating currents into direct ones, and the Committee were informed that although this was the first station where they had been used it was most successful. They cost about £300 each, and three of them were fixed down one side of a small room. 249 INCANDESCENT LIGHTS. A communication having been received from the Incandescent Gas Light Company, suggesting the use of their Incandescent Lamps, enquiries were made with respect to them, and it was found that there would be a reduction in the consumption of gas. and an increase of double the illuminating power from that which was received from the old flat flame burner. The Brentford Gas Company were thereupon asked to glaze lanterns to meet the requirements of the incandescent lights, free of cost to the Vestry, which they consented to do, and the Vestry have fixed 20 burners, with by-pass lever and chains and mica chimney complete, at a cost of 11s. 6d. each, the Company also to keep them in order, at a cost of 12s. per burner per annum. The lights have been fixed on the north side of Shepherd's Bush Common. TESTING OF GAS. The gas supplied by the Brentford Gas Company has been tested two nights a week by the Gas Examiner (Mr. Howard R. Felkin) in the room fitted up with a photometer and other apparatus, and the average illuminating power of 125 experiments was found to be 14.50 candles or 50 candles above the standard of efficiencv.

The Vestry have given their consent to the West Middlesex Water Works Company to erect an open iron footbridge over the above public foot-path, upon condition that the Bridge be covered in and made watertight, so as to prevent any water dripping on the foot-path. 254 BOAT RACE. The Vestry, in accordance with the usual custom, granted permission for the wharf to be utilised for the purpose of viewing the boat race. Arrangements were made for the erection of a convenient stand, and a barge was also placed at the disposal of the Vestry (by Messrs. Keep) and fitted up. The total cost of erecting stand, &c., was £22. UNEMPLOYED. The number of unemployed men was considerably above the average last winter, as owing to the exceptional severity of the weather, all operations in the building and other kindred trades were entirely stopped for some weeks, and as a large number of men were thrown out of work, the amount of distress prevailing at that time was very great. A conference was called between the Cartage Committee and the Board of Guardians to try and ameliorate the distress and after consideration it was decided to employ 50 additional able-bodied men sweeping and cleansing the streets, 20 masons squaring York stone, 20 men breaking stones; also the number of men was increased to 50 at Wendell Park Recreation Ground, and the whole of these men were engaged two days a week so as to distribute the employment to as large a number of men as possible. In addition to the foregoing, as many men as practicable were put on to clean the roads and footways. Also a labour bureau was opened where men had their names, addresses, occupations, the name of their last employer and the length of time served put down. A large proportion of the names put down were for unskilled labour. Below will be found statements showing the number of men engaged and the amount paid. 255 No. of Men. Nature of Work employed on.

Gentlemen, The Report of the Library for the year ended 25th March, 1895, which I have the honour to present to you, compares very favourably with the reports of previous years. The additions to the Lending Department have been both numerous and important, the increase numbering 779 vols., of which 99 were presented, and 680 were purchased. The total number of volumes in this department is 10,051; but a very large proportion of these will require to be re-placed, owing to the severe wear of the past five years. The issue still maintains its high figure, the number being 192,504 ; an increase of 2,290 on last year's total. The system of reserving a particular book which was initiated in 1893 is very much appreciated by readers; during the past year 1,158 volumes have been registered. With the hope of increasing the issue in class K. Music, the privilege of allowing a special ticket for this class only, in addition to the ordinary ticket, was adopted in January last. There has been an increase in the issue of 336 volumes, but up to the present time the number of persons who have taken advantage of this privilege is comparatively small. The number of new borrowers is 1,841, and although only 827 have given their occupations, a perusal of Table V. will show that there is a marked improvement in the number of mechanics and shop assistants who have availed themselves of the opportunity of using the Library. The Reference Department has been replenished with 156 additional volumes, amongst which are some very important works of local interest; the number of volumes in this department is 2,309; and the total stock in both Lending and Reference Libraries is 12,360. The Kelmscott Press Books, presented to the Library last year by Mr. William Morris, are now exhibited in a suitable show-case, and are greatly admired. The crowded state 281 of the Reading Rooms at different times of the day has necessitated their re-arrangement by fixing reading slopes to the walls. The removal of the newspaper stands has made the rooms much lighter; and has improved their appearance considerably; it has also enabled me to display many more newspapers in a permanent position, and has greatly increased the accommodation for readers. The adoption of incandescent burners is a great improvement in lighting the rooms, and it is gratifying to notice that the arrangements made for increasing the comfort and convenience of the public are very much appreciated. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. MARTIN, Librarian and Secretary. THE PASSMORE EDWARDS FREE LIBRARY, SHEPHERD'S BUSH. In the year 1891 the idea of establishing a Branch • Library occupied the attention of the Commissioners, and at the meeting held on February 17th in that year Mr. T. Chamberlen urged "That the time had arrived when something should be done towards its establishment; that a piece of vacant land offered a most suitable site, the owners of which should be approached by the Commis sioners with view of ascertaining whether they would be disposed to grant a sufficient space for the purpose." The owners were the Copyholders of the ancient Manor of Fulham, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who are Lords of the said Manor. In due course the owners were communicated with, the result being that the piece of land in question, which has a frontage of 112 feet to Uxbridge Road, and a depth of 120 feet, was given to the Library Commissioners for the purpose of erecting a Branch Public Library thereon. The Library rate being limited to one 282 halfpenny in the £ did not produce a sufficient income to support two libraries, and it became necessary to obtain the consent of the ratepayers to raise the rate to the maximum allowed by the Act of Parliament, viz., one penny in the £. A vote of the Parish was taken in 1891, which was defeated by a small majority, and in 1893 another poll was taken, which met with a similar result. The matter was allowed to rest until 1894, when Mr. Stiles, of Uxbridge Road, communicated with Mr. J. Passmore Edwards, the well-known philanthropist (and brother of the late Mr. R. P. Edwards, a former Library Commissioner), asking his assistance. Mr. Edwards replied that he would be willing to substantially assist the scheme providing a guarantee were given that the ratepayers would do their part. On 13th March, 1895, the following letter was received :— 51, Bedford Square, W.C. March 13 th, 1895. My Dear Sir,— I have taken preliminary steps to provide a suitable Branch Library Building for Hammersmith provided competent local authority will undertake to maintain the Library under the provisions of the Free Libraries Act. I should be glad to know before I go further what prospect or assurance is there that this will be done ? I can only say that I am ready to perform my part of the undertaking, and that I shall do it most cheerfully, when the Commissioners of Hammersmith Public Libraries, armed with requisite authority, are prepared to do theirs. I remain, Yours faithfully, (Signed) J. PASSMORE EDWARDS. S. Martin, Esq. A Committee was formed to bring the matter before the ratepayers, the Parish was canvassed, four public meetings were held, and in due course the Parish was polled for the third time on the question of increasing the Library rate to one penny in the £. The result was eminently satisfactory, the majority in favour of the increase being 2,400, thereby showing that the ratepayers fully appreciated Mr. Edwards' munificent offer. 283 Meanwhile Mr. Edwards had instructed his architect, Mr. Maurice IS. Adams, F.R.I.B.A., of Bedford Park, to prepare plans for the proposed building, a description of which appeared in the Building News of 29th March. When erected, the Library will be a great ornament to that part of Uxbridge Road, the elevation being of a pleasing and artistic character, while the internal arrangements are both simple and commodious. The Library is expected to be ready for occupation early in 1896. It only remains to place on record the thanks of the Parishioners of Hammersmith to the Copyholders of the Manor of Fulham and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the gift of the valuable site, and to Mr. J. Passmore Edwards for his munificent present of a handsome and commodious Library, which cannot fail to improve the minds and brighten the lives of all those members of the community who make use of it in the time to come. 284 TABLE I.
