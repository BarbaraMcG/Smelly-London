Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1955. The preparation of the Report for this year has been greatly delayed by staff difficulties and, in particular, by the lack of a Chief Clerk for a period of four months. During this time the co-operation of the available staff enabled the more urgent day to day work of the department to be efficiently dealt with, but the statistical work required for a report of this nature could not be resumed until after the appointment of a Chief Clerk in October. The Report shows that the state of public health in the Borough continues to improve. The statistics reveal that both the death rate and the infantile mortality rate are lower than the national average. The infantile mortality rate is generally taken as a fair index of the state of the medical services both from the point of medical care in the home and as an index of public health efficiency. We can be satisfied, therefore, in this respect. A further cause for satisfaction and confidence in the continued improvement in medical services is shown by the fact that during the year there was not a single maternal death associated with pregnancy or child birth. Furthermore, in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years, only one death occurred from all causes. The principal causes of death are once again coronary thrombosis and other heart disease. This is followed by cancer, the main form being cancer of the lung. It is fitting that great interest in the cause and prevention of this disease is being shown at the present time among the medical profession and the public. The rise in mortality from the disease has been startling and has not been accompanied to the same extent by a rise in mortality from other forms of cancer. The rise in mortality has been shown to follow the rise in cigarette smoking which took place in this country thirty to forty years ago and investigations indicate that the incidence of cancer of the lung is much greater in heavy smokers than in nonsmokers. There may well be other factors involved but one should bear in mind the statement of the Minister of Health as long ago as 4 12th February, 1954, that "it is desirable that young people should be warned of the risks apparently attendant upon excessive smoking." Turning to infectious disease, we find that tuberculosis, although the main cause of death in this category, is still diminishing and the figures for the year show the lowest case rate ever recorded in the Borough. No death occurred from tuberculosis in any person under the age of 45. The infectious diseases of childhood, although still prevalent (measles showed an increase from 99 cases in the previous year to 1,087 cases in this year) caused no deaths. Poliomyelitis, although much in the national news, caused only seven cases in Finchley, all of which were mild and all recovered without severe paralysis. When considering the work of the Sanitary Inspectors one notes the increase in slaughtering from 623 animals in 1954 to 8,409 animals in this year. The inspectors worked long hours on meat inspection and their ready co-operation, together with that of Mr. Gray, the Senior Sanitary Inspector, is appreciated. Here I would also mention with gratitude the assistance I have received during the year from the other chief officers of the Council, the encouragement of the chairman and members of the Health Committee, and the support of the members of the staff of the Public Health Department. If the record of public health in Finchley for 1955 seems satisfactory, as indeed it is, I would say that this is due to a large extent to the General Practitioners of the district who are always prepared to spare time from a busy practice to help in public health problems which they regard as part of their every day interests. Medicine to-day is indeed a combination of forces and I cannot end without a word of thanks to the County services in the Area, particularly the Welfare and Health Visiting sections. I feel privileged to have the willing co-operation of so many persons with a common aim of improving the state of public health in the Borough. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, A. W. HAY, Medical Officer of Health. 5 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,478 Population, 1955 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 69,860 Number of Inhabited Houses (1955) 19,967 Rateable Value (1955) £958,479 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,927 Total Live Births 894 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 12.8 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 15.0 Total Stillbirths 21 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 23.5 Total Deaths 746 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 10.7 Standardised Death Rate 9.5 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.7 Infant Deaths 19 Infant Mortality Rate 21.3 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 24.9 Neo-Natal Deaths 15 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate 16.8 Maternal Deaths Maternal Mortality Rate Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.64 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate 449 407 856 Illegitimate 19 19 38 468 426 894 Birth rate 12.8 per 1,000 estimated home population.

This most satisfactory state can only be maintained if parents ensure that their children are immunised. During the year 24 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 27 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. In addition, 597 children were immunised with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic, 227 by General Practitioners and 370 by the Local Health Authority. Three hundred and eighty-two children were given "booster" does of diphtheria prophylactic alone, and 130 children were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Scarlet Fever There were 59 cases of Scarlet Fever, nine less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Polio-myelitis During the year, seven cases of Poliomyelitis were notified to me, and of these, 6 were found to be suffering from the paralytic form. All made good recoveries. 17 18 Case Rate per 1,000 Population INCIDENCE OF DIPHTHERIA SINCE 1925 The Council have continued to grant to the North London Branch of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship the use of the Squires Lane Bath on alternate Sundays for "old" cases of Poliomyelitis. The cases are collected from a wide area by ambulances and cars and they are assisted in changing and also in the water by voluntary helpers. All cases are certified by a doctor to be free from infection. Measles The number of notifications was 1,087 compared with 99 in 1954. This is the highest number of notifications recorded since the disease was made notifiable by the Regulations of 1939'. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 18 in 1955 which is the lowest figure for some years. There were no deaths. During the year, 7 children were immunised by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Forty-seven cases were notified in 1955 and there were 23 deaths, 19 of which were persons of 65 years of age and over. Malaria No case of Malaria was notified in 1955. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 38; 37 occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue, and one at home. Food Poisoning Fifteen cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. Four were single cases, three of which were due to Salmonella Typhi-murium, the agent for the fourth remaining unidentified. The other 11 cases notified concerned an outbreak in a school and were due to a food poisoning organism known as Clostridium Welchii. In all, 230 boys, 11 teachers and 7 kitchen staff were affected in the outbreak. The symptoms were mainly nausea, abdominal distension, colic and diarrhoea. Most cases were mild with the symptoms clearing up in 12 hours, although in one case they lasted 36 hours. 19 The Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale co-operated in establishing the cause of the outbreak. All the persons affected had eaten cold sliced salt beef, samples of which were found to contain the bacteria Clostridium Welchii, as did 24 faecal specimens from the persons affected. As a result of this outbreak I convened a conference with Dr. Betty Hobbs, the Food Bacteriologist from the Central Public Health Laboratory, the Bacteriologist employed by a large food firm, the Chief Chemist of the same firm and the Borough Senior Sanitary Inspector, to see what measures could be taken to prevent a recurrence of this type of food poisoning. I also talked to the Area School Meals Organiser and as a result of these discussions the following points emerged:— (1) The method of salting meat in brine tanks should, if possible, be standardised with the brine strength not less than 20% as measured by a hydrometer (concentrations of less than 20 % are not effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria). (2) Thorough cooking and rapid cooling of joints of meat is essential to prevent the multiplication of food poisoning bacteria in the interior but this is difficult unless the joints are cut so that they weigh not more than 6 lbs. (3) The process of boning and rolling meat allows the introduction of surface contamination into the joint. Even prolonged boiling may be insufficient to kill heatresistant spores of bacteria such as Clostridium Welchii at the centre of the meat. (4) Rapid cooling is essential immediately after cooking or the surviving spores develop quickly in conditions of warmth and sufficient bacteria to cause illness are produced. This rapid and thorough cooling cannot be guaranteed unless the joints are placed on wire cooling trays and electric fans arc used in addition. (5) In canteens meat should be cooked and eaten the same day, but if this is impracticable with the present methods of cooking, then pressure cooking should be used instead. These points were included in a complete report on the whole outbreak of food poisoning which was sent to the Minister of Health. 20 Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified:— Dysentery 9 Erysipelas 6 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 20 Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was five hundred and ninety-three. Two hundred and fifty-eight persons were re-vaccinated. Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1955:— Throat/Nose Swabs: Positive Negative Diphtheria Bacilli - 229 Hemolytic Streptococci 54 Vincent's Angina 4 Faeces: Sonne Dysentery 3 118 Salmonella 7 Clostridium Welchii 25 Sputum: T.B. Smear 10 52 Other Organisms - Whooping Cough: Cough Plate - 2 Post-nasal Swab 3 106 401 21 Tuberculosis Nine persons died from tuberculosis during 1955, giving a death rate of 0.129 per 1,000 population. Fifty-two new cases were notified, and this number is the lowest recorded since 1929. The case rate per 10,000 population was 7.44, the lowest recorded. Only one child of school age was found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs. Close co-operation between the Public Health Department, the Area Health Department and the Chest Clinic in the constant search for possible sources of infection in new cases of tuberculosis continues. The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M. F. M. F. M. F. M.

In April, public sessions, the first of their kind in the Borough, were held at East Finchley, North Finchley and Church End. 2,689 persons were X-rayed, of which 3 were found to be suffering from tuberculosis. 23 24 Rate per 10,000 Population TUBERCULOSIS (ALL FORMS) Organised groups, comprising employees of some local firms, were also arranged, and the Unit visited 5 premises in September. 2 persons were found to be suffering from tuberculosis out of a total of 702 persons X-rayed. Medical Examinations Thirty persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 20 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47 Cases continued to be brought to the notice of the Department of persons who were living in insanitary surroundings and who were not receiving proper care and attention. In one instance it was necessary to take emergency action in respect of an elderly lady, aged 70 years, and a Magistrate's order for her removal to Redhill House, Edgware, was obtained. In all other cases it was possible to make satisfactory arrangements for these persons without having to resort to compulsory removal to suitable premises under the provisions of the above section. (b) Section 50 No burials were carried out by the Council under the provisions of this Section. 25 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1955:— Housing Statistics 1.

Representations were made to the Council and Demolition Orders made. 57, Friern Park, N.12. The basement rooms of this house were found to be unfit for human habitation and were voluntarily closed. 357, 359 and 361, Regents Park Road, N.3. 27 An application was received from the owner of the above property for the Closing Order made on the above property to be rescinded, the owner giving an undertaking to carry out the work necessary to render the premises fit. Upon completion of the work the Order was cancelled. Repair of Insanitary Houses An appeal by the owner of five houses against the Council's notice to repair the property was heard at the County Court. The Judge, after hearing the evidence and inspecting the property, disallowed the appeal, although the cost of repairs was high in relation to the value of the property. Slum Clearance Section 1 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, imposed a duty upon the Local Authority to submit within one year as from the 30th August, 1954, an estimate of the total number of unfit houses in the area in such form as the Minister required, and proposals for dealing with houses within the district which appeared to be unfit for human habitation and with any other houses which in the opinion of the authority ought to be included in Clearance Areas. As a result of the foregoing a survey of the district was made and the following is a schedule of the property which was submitted to the Minister. Proposed No. of Year Address Houses 19956-7 1-10, Belgrave Terrace, N.12 10 4 & 8, Stanhope Road, N.12 2 1956-7 43 & 49, Gainsborough Road, N.12 2 1958-9 5 to 18 & 21, Winifred Place, N.12 15 306-324 (even nos.), Friern Barnet Lane, N.20 10 1-8, Solomons Terrace, N.20 1955-6 J 1291 & 1293, High Road, N.20 12 Vine Cottage & Oak Cottage, Totteridge Lane, N.20 1955-6 84 & 86, Swan Lane, N.20 2 1-5, Primrose Cottages, Granville Road, N.12 5 185, 187, 189 & 191, East End Road (known as 1-4, Percival Cottages, East End Road, N.2) 4 2-16, Church Lane, N.2 8 70 28 Before these proposals were submitted to the Minister it was necessary to collaborate with the Housing and Town Planning Committees, to consider other aspects including the development of sites, compulsory purchase of land and properties in the areas, and land or properties adjoining the areas, the sequence in which these areas should be dealt with to fit in with Council development, and rehousing of the displaced families. The form of proposals also included areas which had been submitted to the Minister in 1954, and the following premises are within that category:— NO; Of Address Houses 11, 13, 15 & 17, Swan Lane, N.20 4 Clearance Area and Compulsory Purchase Order 1118, 1120, 1122 & 1124, High Road, N.20 4 Clearance Area and Compulsory Purchase Order 411, 413 & 415, Long Lane, N.2 3 Clearance Area 27, 29, 31 & 33, Market Place, N.2 la, Prospect Place, N.2 1, 2, 3, 4, Galpins Cottages, 26 Clearance Area and 1, 2, 3 & 4, Galpins Cottages, Compulsory Purchase Order Prospect Place, N.2 1-17, Prospect Place, N.2 37 A public inquiry was held with regard to three of the above areas, and the Minister later confirmed all the Clearance Areas and Compulsory Purchase Orders. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 Repairs Increase and Certificates of Disrepair. The above Act, which came into force on the 30th August, 1954, imposed a duty on Local Authorities to issue Certificates of Disrepair where the landlord claimed a repairs increase in rent and the tenant felt that the house was not in good repair and was not reasonably fit for occupation. A charge of one shilling is made for a certificate, or for the revocation thereof. Many owners have availed themselves of the provisions to increase the rent by two-thirds of the statutory allowance where the tenant undertook to carry out internal decorative repairs. 29 The following table shows the particulars of applications received during the year:— Applications received 16 Certificates granted 13 Applications under consideration at end of year 1 Certificates refused 1 Applications withdrawn 1 Revocations 7 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 13,993. At 555 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 2,076 were discovered, and at the end of the year 1,631 including a number outstanding at the end of 1954 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 347 was in hand and 1,482 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 1,188 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:— Inspections under Housing Acts 215 Special Inspections 3,775 Re-inspections 2,553 Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 33 Inspections of Works in Progress 1,188 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 523 Visits to Slaughterhouses 419 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 19 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 75 Inspections of Meat, Fish and Other Food Shops 523 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 180 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 300 Visits re Rodent Control 3,581 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 66 Visits re Hawkers 20 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 23 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 6 30 Visits re Heating Appliances—Fireguards 11 National Assistance Act 10 Miscellaneous 473 13,993 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Repairs or amendments to existing drains 48 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 256 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 266 Length in yards of iron drains laid 31 Manholes provided 25 Manholes repaired 11 Manhole covers provided 37 Intercepting traps fixed 21 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 18 New gully traps fixed 26 Gully curbs provided or repaired 6 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 19 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 6 Water tests applied 124 Smoke tests applied 36 Air tests applied 4 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 94 Number of articles disinfected 1,011 Number of verminous premises dealt with 16 Verminous rooms disinfested 33 Three hundred visits were made by inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. Four premises infested with bugs were dealt with during the year. The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year:— Premises Bugs 4 Fleas 1 Cockroaches 8 Ants 1 Wasps 93 Moths 2 Miscellaneous 11 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was 33 compared with 42 in 1954. Many complaints were received regarding the infestation of dwellings by wood beetles, and considerable damage found to be caused by the larvae (woodworm). These infestations appear to be on the increase and are a matter of great concern. Although help and advice is given when sought, many cases are not notified or escape detection in the early stages. 33 In a number of cases where the Valuation Officer has made a survey arising from an application for a loan under the Housing Act, 1949, this trouble has been found and the inspectors have assisted in giving advice and supervising the remedial work. Sanitary Conveniences There are 24 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Complaints One thousand live hundred and eighty complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz:— Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 15 Accumulations of refuse and manure 25 Blocked or defective drains 247 Defective roofs 92 Defective W.Cs. 42 Dirty milk bottles 4 Flooding 12 Foreign matter in food 5 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 204 Noise 16 Non-removal of refuse 5 Nuisances from dampness 71 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 9 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 11 Premises infested with insects 72 Premises infested with rats or mice 475 Smells from Public Sewers 14 Smoke nuisances 27 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 28 Unsound food 20 Verminous condition of houses 1 Wasps' nests 93 Other complaints 92 34 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of complaint. Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Eighteen premises were inspected and report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council which is the licensing authority. Factories Acts, 1937-1948 1.

(4) Education Activities: Lectures to classes of senior school children were arranged at five schools. Talks were given by the Sanitary Inspectors, after which films were shown and discussed. The lectures were attended by some 140 children. In addition, Dr. Betty Hobbs of the Central Public Health Laboratory and the Senior Sanitary Inspector addressed a meeting of 23 School Meals Supervisors on food poisoning outbreaks. (5) Method of Disposal of Condemned Food: Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared continued to receive special attention. Four new registrations of hawkers were granted during the year. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. Two changes of storage premises were registered. 40 The number of barrow boys operating in the district at the end of the year was 4. Slaughterhouses > The two slaughterhouses in the district have been regularly inspected and as will be seen from the figures in the table of carcases examined the number of pigs slaughtered (8,409) was very much higher than in the previous year (623). Most of these were slaughtered at one slaughterhouse for the wholesale market and were brought from various parts of the country, arriving at the slaughterhouse at all times of the day and sometimes night, with the result that difficulties arose regarding the receipt of adequate notice of intention to slaughter and involving visits by the Inspectors late at night and during the week-ends. As this slaughterhouse is situated in a built-up area comprising good class property, it was inevitable that complaints would arise, and these were dealt with as far as possible, including unsuccessful efforts to get the existing legislation amended to restrict the hours of slaughter and prohibit Sunday killing. 41 Carcases and Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed (if known) 298 22 1,435 2,412 8,409 — Number inspected 298 22 1,435 2,412 8,409 - All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci: Whole carcases condemned — — 6 2 2 — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 58 2 3 163 401 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci 19.46 9.09 0.63 6.84 4.79 - Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned — — 1 — 2 — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 48 1 4 - 131 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis 16.11 4.55 0.35 - 1.58 - Cysticercosis: Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration - - - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - - 42 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1955 TUBERCULOSIS Cattle Forequarter 1 Heads and Tongues 18 Livers 4 Lungs 19 sets Mesenteries 7 Spleens 2 Omenta 5 Kidneys 2 Calves Carcase 1 Livers 1 Plucks 3 Pigs Carcases 2 Heads 114 Lungs 7 sets Mesenteries 1 Plucks 11 OTHER DISEASES Cattle Livers 53 (Abscess 7, Cirrhosis 2, Flukes 42, Adhesions 2) Lungs 3 sets (Abscess 2, Pleurisy 1) Calves Carcases 6 (Dropsy 1, Fevered 1, Moribund 4) Liver 1 (Flukes) Lungs 1 set (Pneumonia) Pluck 1 (Abscesses) 43 Pigs Carcases 2 (Moribund 1, Septicaemia 1) Hearts 51 (Pericarditis) Kidneys 2 (Nephritis) Livers 61 (Cirrhosis 27, Abscesses 5, Parasitic 17, Hepatitis 10, Necrosis 1, Milk Spot 1) Lungs 186 sets (Congestion 40, Pleurisy 14, Pneumonia 132) Sheep and Lambs Carcases 2 (Emaciation 1, Moribund 1) Heart 1 (Pleurisy and Pericarditis) Livers 139 (Abscess 1, Cysts 1, Cirrhosis 1, Flukes 114, Parasitic 21, Melanosis 1) Lungs 22 (Abscess 1, Parasitic 2, Pleurisy 1, Pneumonia 14, Strongylosis 4) Kidney 1 (Abscess) UNSOUND Cattle Beef 1,246½ lbs.

This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Acts also provide that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Four persons were licensed during 1955. Butchers' Shops There are 47 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 24. At 21 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. 47 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 9 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1955, as follows :— Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 19 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 18 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 24 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 7 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 8 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 8 Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 155 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Fourteen samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls At the end of the year there was only one remaining in the district. Fish Friers There were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out. Game Licences Twenty applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. 48 Shops Act, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows :— Number on Register at beginning of 1953 940 Number closed 11 New shops 13 Number on Register at end of 1955 942 Changes of occupancy 62 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was eleven. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 12 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 4 houses serving a population of 10 which are served by standpipes. Pollution of Streams and Watercourses Further investigations have been carried out regarding the pollution of streams in and adjoining the district and in connection therewith, a number of soil fittings were found to be connected to the surface water sewers and appropriate action was taken for these to be made to discharge into the soil sewers. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. 49 Twenty-seven complaints were received during the year, a number of them relating to burning of garden and other refuse. In one instance, investigations revealed that the mechanical stoker of a factory boiler plant was defective and upon representations being made to the occupier the necessary repairs were carried out. A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, are being converted or installed for oil burning. In two factories, three boilers have been converted from solid fuel to oil burning and in one case where periodical trouble was experienced through the emission of smoke and grit, this nuisance has completely disappeared. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil fired plant and for the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes refused in the absence of the necessary legislation to control this matter. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 One person previously registered under the above Act did not renew his licence. The number of persons remaining on the register was 5. All the premises have been inspected. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Eleven visits have been made to premises to ascertain that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. In one shop, a number of electric fires were found which did not comply with the Act. A warning was issued to the proprietor and the fires were withdrawn from sale until fitted with proper guards. Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his 50 general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Nine copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the sanitary inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances:— A firm of bakers was summoned with regard to dirt found in a loaf of bread. This summons was dismissed, but a summons against the manufacturers of the loaf resulted in a fine of £5 0s. 0d. being imposed, and an order to pay £3 3s. 0d. costs. The owner of some houses appealed in the County Court against notices served upon him by the Council to carry out repairs under the Housing Acts, 1936-1954. The appeal was lost, and particulars of the case appear on page 28. 51 RODENT CONTROL Complaints and Infestations Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1955/56 1954/55 1955/56 1954/55 1955/56 1954/55 Rats 354 278 213 185 114 98 Mice 121 125 114 102 7 18 Total 475 403 327 287 121 116 T. Barlow, the Rodent Operator, left the Department in September, 1955, and his place has been taken by G. Christie who commenced duties on 31st October, 1955. In January, 1956, he attended a three-day course for operators organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and he is now a very diligent worker. The number of rate complaints has increased, but I am satisfied that all the infestations are minor. Arising from these complaints, 36 additional premises were found to be infested with rats and 11 infested with mice. At 58 premises infested with rats, poultry was being kept which represented 23.29% of the infestations. Smoke tests were applied to rat runs, and in cases where defects in sewers or drains were revealed the necessary remedial work has been carried out. 52 Summary of Work carried out from 1/4/1955 to 31/3/1956 Rats Mice Visits in connection with infestations 2,718 863 Number of confirmed infestations 249 113 Prebaits 1,047 - Zinc Phosphide POISONS 468 - Arsenic 12 - Red Squill - - A.N.T.U. 77 - Warfarin 2,167 1,053 Treatment of Sewers Number of Manholes baited 435 Number of Poison takes 51 Only one maintenance treatment was carried out in May when the poison takes represented 11.7% of the number of manholes baited.
