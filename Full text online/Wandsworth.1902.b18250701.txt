Fairfield Ward: — Hennell, John. Southfield Ward : —Bulstrode, Frank. The Council regret to have to record the death, in December last, of Alderman Howick, who was a Member of the Council and its predecessor, the Wandsworth District Board of Works, for nearly 30 years, and an Overseer of the Parish of Wandsworth for 35 years. They have also to regret the death in January last of Councillor W. V. Barwell, a representative for the Balham Ward. Adjustment Scheme. 2.—An agreement was entered into defining the expressions " properties," " income," " debts, liabilities, and ex" penses," used in the former agreement and settling the balances to the credit of the several parochial funds. The agreements were subsequently confirmed by the Borough of Wandsworth (Adjustment) Scheme. Union of Parishes. 3.—With the view of having an uniform rate throughout the Borough the Council decided to apply to the London Government Act Commissioners for a Scheme under the provisions of section 16 of the London Government Act, 1899, to constitute the various Parishes in the Borough one Civil Parish. A public Inquiry into the matter was held by the Commissioners at the Council House on the 10th June, at which the Mayor and the Town Clerk supported the views of the Council, and objections of residents opposed to the scheme were heard. A draft scheme REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF THE Metropolitan borough of Wandsworth. For the Year ended 31 st March, 1903. 28 was subsequently prepared by the Commissioners upon which the Council made suggestions, most of which were adopted.. The scheme has since been approved by the Privy Council and will come into force on the 1st April, 1904. Under the scheme the Borough will form " The Parish of Wandsworth Borough " and (except as affected by the parochial balances at the above-mentioned date) there will in future be an equal General Rale. Another effect of the scheme is the extension to the Parish of Tooting of the provisions of the Burials Acts, which will hereafter be administered by the Council uniformly throughout the Borough. The change will also simplify the keeping of the accounts and the administrative work of the Council County boundary at Tooting. 4.—The order referred to in the last annual report providing for an alteration of the boundary of the County of London at Tooting has now been made and will come into operation on the 1st of April, 1904, The order provides that the boundary shall be along the north side of the Tooting, Merton, and Wimbledon Railway between Mitcham Road and Tooting Junction at one end and the extreme boundary of the County of London, west of Lambeth cemetery, at the other end, and that the areas to the north and south of this boundary line should be transferred to the Counties of London and Surrey respectively. 5.—On the 9th November, 1902, Councillor william Hunt Mayor. was unanimously elected Mayor. Portrait of Mayor. 6.—At the same Meeting Councillor Lidiard, on behalf of the subscribers (Members of the Council), presented to the Ex-Mayor, Councillor Lancaster, J.P., his portrait in oils (painted by Mr. C.

The Mayor accepted the portrait on behalf of the Council. —The following address, framed and illuminated, was also presented to the Ex-Mayor, viz.;— 29 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. "To William John Lancaster, Esq., J. P. "Mayor,—November, 1901—November, 1902. "We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Borough "of Wandsworth, desire, upon your retirement from the office of "Mayor, to express our high appreciation of the valuable services "that you have rendered the Borough during your Mayoralty, "which was fortunately coincident with the memorable period of the "Coronation of Their Majesties King Edward VII. and Queen "Alexandra. "The duties devolving upon you as Mayor during that year "involved a larger responsibility than usual, comprising as they "did attendance upon Their Majesties in Westminster Abbey, and "at the Presentation of the Joint Address from the Metropolitan "Borough Councils on the occasion of the Royal Progress through "South London. We desire to convey to you our deep sense of the "dignity and distinction with which you represented the Borough at "those historic Ceremonials. "We would also place on record our warmest recognition of "your generous hospitality within the Borough, extended as it "was to all parts thereof and to all classes, and more especially "of the unsparing efforts which you took to bring to a successful "conclusion the King's Dinner to 19,000 poor of the Borough and "the Coronation Entertainment to 40,000 children, to whom it will "be rendered memorable by your personal gifts of brooches and "medals. "Your Mayoralty has been marked by most munificent gifts "to the Council and the Borough, and amongst them we would "distinguish for especial thanks, on behalf of the inhabitants at "large, those of the Southfields Recreation Ground and of the new "Public Library at Tooting. "The admirable manner in which you have discharged your "magisterial duties and presided over the Meetings of the Council "has been most amply and gracefully seconded in extraneous "matters by your daughters, whose kindly and pleasant services "each in her capacity as Mayoress will live in our recollection. "In conclusion, we would express the earnest hope that the "Borough may long continue to receive the benefit of your services "as a Member of the Council. "Sealed by Order of the Council. (Signed) "William Hunt, Mayor. ( „ ) " Henry George Hills, Town Clerk. 30 Presentation to the Mayoress. 8.—Councillor Gay, on behalf of subscribers (Members of the Council), presented a brooch to each of the two Misses Lancaster as a mark of appreciation of their services in the discharge of the duties of Mayoress during the past year. Busts of King and Queen. 9.—The Mayor, Councillor W. J. Lancaster, presented to the Council a bust of the King, which is a replica of the bust by Mr. Sydney March, exhibited at the Royal Academy and approved by His Majesty. The bust has been placed on a pedestal on the right hand of the Mayor's Chair in the Council Chamber. Alderman J. M. Riicker has kindly promised to present a bust of the Queen which it is proposed to place on a pedestal in the Council Chamber on the left of the Mayor's Chair. Loving Cup. 10.—Alderman Riicker presented to the Council a Silver Gilt Loving Cup. The cup is a replica of the one presented by Councillor Lancaster, the Ex-Mayor, and bears the inscription "To the Corporation of the Metropolitan "Borough of Wandsworth, from Councillor James Morris Riicker, "1902"; with the arms of the Borough on the reverse side.

Zabell, and Mr. H. G. Hills, to be held upon trust for a Dispensary, Cottage Hospital, Convalescent Home, or other Medical Charity, for the benefit of the inhabitants of Streatham and the neighbourhood, and provided that the trust should be administered by a Committee consisting of the three above-mentioned Tiustees, three persons to be nominated every year by the Vestry of Streatham, and such other persons (not exceeding three) as the Trustees and the three representatives shall co-opt. The Council, as the successors of the Streatham Vestry, appointed Alderman Dickinson and Councillors Penfold and Welton, Members of the Committee. Accommodation. 17.—The subject of the accommodation of the Council and the Council's staff has continued to receive consideration, and on the 11th June, 1902, the following report of the General Purposes Committee on the subject was considered by the Council:— 32 The Committee have considered the reference to them as to the better housing of the Council and the Council's staff, and report as follows:— 1.—The staff employed by the Council in the General Offices, the Surveyors' Department, the Medical Officer's Department, aud the Rating Department, consists of 104 persons at present, including 13 rate collectors. 2.—The accommodation at the present Council House for the staff consist of 6 rooms, and is sufficient for 22 persons. Besides this there is a Council Chamber, and two Committee Rooms, and the only accommodation for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors consists of a hat and cloak room of very limited dimensions, and a lavatory. 3.—The officers and servants in the Surveyors', Medical Officer's, Rating, and Burials Departments are placed in separate buildings, away from the Council House. 4.—The Committee is of opinion that the work of the Surveyor's Department is best carried out at the premises at present used for the purpose. 5.—The Committee is of opinion that the whole of the Council's staff, except the Surveyor's staff and the Rate Collectors, should be accommodated in one building, and having considered the possibility of enlarging and extending the present Council House, recommend that it be referred to an architect to report whether it is possible to make alterations therein and additions thereto which would be adequate for the purpose. 6.—The Committee have also considered the advisability of purchasing No. 96, Wandsworth Common, North Side, and adapting it for the Council's purpose, but do not approve of it. 18.-—-Upon the motion to adopt the fifth paragraph of the report the following amendment was carried, viz.:—That the consideration of purchasing additional premises for the use of the Council's staff or extending the present Council House or erecting a new one be deferred until after the next Borough Council Election. On the amendment being put as a substantive motion a further amendment was moved and carried as follows, viz.:— That the whole question of the housing of the staff be referred back to the General Purposes Committee for reconsideration, having regard to the expression of opinion by the Council that day on the 33 subject. The General Purposes Committee subsequently recommended that certain premises at East Hill, Wandsworth, should be purchased for the temporary accommodation of the staff. The recommendation was adopted by the Council, but it was not possible to purchase the premises upon the terms agreed to by the Council. Staff. 19.—The Council appointed a Committee consisting of one Member from each Ward to consider and report as to the duties, salaries, and wages of all the officers, clerks, workmen, and other employees of the Council and also to enquire and report as to the sufficiency or otherwise of the staff of the Council. The Committee submitted to the Council (a) statement as to the staff in the employment of the Council on the 7th March, 1902, and any vacancies then existing; (b) reports by the heads of departments as to the efficiency or sufficiency of such staff; (c) statement as to the annual cost of the staff as then organised and as it existed prior to the incorporation of the Borough and transfer of the powers of several authorities now exercised by the Council. This information was referred to the several Committees who deal with the executive work of the Council for any comments which such Committees thought fit to offer. The reports of those Committees were then considered by the Officers and Servants Committee, who came to the conclusion that an additional clerk was required in the offices of the Town Clerk, the Medical Officer of Health, and the Surveyor for the Western District respectively. Putney Parish Oitlces. 20.—The front portion of these offices, which were formerly used by the late Vestry and Overseers of Putney, was sold by auction in November last, the remaining portion of the premises being retained by the Council for a Rate Collectors' office and gas-testing station. The proceeds of the sale were applied to the repayment of outstanding loans. Wandsworth & Clapham Union. 21.—The subject of the proposed separation of the Parish of Battersea from the Wandsworth and Clapham Union continues to receive the consideration of the Council. In April, 1902, a statement showing the action which had already been taken by the Council and its predecessors, 34 the late Wandsworth District Board, was forwarded to the Members of Parliament for the Borough who were asked to communicate with the President of the Local Government Board on the subject, and, if necessary, bring the matter before Parliament. In January last the Local Government Board stated that they had come to the conclusion that an Inquiry into the proposal should be held as early as practicable. The Inquiry was arranged for the 27th April, but at the request of the Battersea Borough Council it was postponed from time to time. It is now definitely proposed to open the Inquiry on the 1st October. Tort Authority for London. 22.—A Committee having been formed to consider the report of the Royal Commission and to formulate a scheme with reference to the creation of a Port Authority for London this Council, in view of the suggestion that the Authority should have power to require a contribution from the rates and of the fact that the Borough abuts on the River for a distance of two miles, made application to be represented on the Committee. The Committee, however, decided that no additions should be made to its numbers as originally constituted. Representation on London County Council. 23.—A reply to the memorial referred to in the last Annual Report in favour of an increase in the number of representatives of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth on the London County Council has been received from the Local Government Board, stating that as the number of Councillors for the Administrative County of London is fixed by the Local Government Act, 1888, at twice the number of Members of Parliament returned for each Parliamentary Borough in London the question is bound up with that of the Parliamentary representation of the Metropolis; and that the Local Government Board cannot contemplate special legislation to deal with the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth. South African War. 24.—In June last the following address was presented to His Majesty the King congratulating him on the termination of hostilities in South Africa:— 35 "To THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. "We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan "Borough of Wandsworth, humbly present to your Majesty our sincere "congratulations upon the successful termination of hostilities in South "Africa and the satisfactory terms of peace. "We confidently trust that a feeling of brotherhood and good fellow"ship will in future be maintained throughout the South African Colonies "and that the tract of country now added to the Empire will for ever "form an united and prosperous part of Your Majesty's Dominions. "We rejoice that the auspicious event to which your Majesty's "subjects are all looking forward,—the Coronation of your Majesty and "our much beloved Queen—will now take place under such completely "happy conditions and we trust that your Majesty may long be spared to "reign over a loyal, free, and contented people. "Signed on behalf of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the "Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. (Signed) "W. J. Lancaster, Mayor. ( „ ) "Henry George Hills, Town Clerk. "Council House, Wandsworlh, nth June, 1902." 25.—The following is a copy of the reply received by the Council, viz.:— "Home Office, Whitehall, "12th July, 1902. "Sir, "I have had the honour to lay before the King the loyal and "dutiful Address of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metro"politan Borough of Wandsworlh congratulating His Majesty on the "conclusion of peace in South Africa; and I have to inform you that "His Majesty was pleased to receive the same very graciously. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "Chas. T. Ritchie. "The Town Clerk, "Council House, Wandsworth." 36 Illness of the King. 26.—The following resolution was passed by the Council on the occasion of the sudden illness of the King, viz.:— "That this Council has learned with profound sorrow of the "illness of His Majesty, and humbly begs to offer to Her Majesty "the Queen and the Royal Family their sincere sympathy, and to "express the earnest hope that His Majesty may soon be restored "to good health." The resolution was signed by the Mayor and Town Clerk on behalf of the Council and forwarded to his Majesty. 27.—The following is a copy of the reply thereto:— "Home Office, Whitehall, "31st July, 1902. "Sir, "I have had the honour to lay before the King the loyal "Resolution of the Town Council of the Borough of Wandsworth, "expressing their sympathy with Her Majesty the Queen and the "Royal Family on the occasion of His Majesty's severe illness. "His Majesty was pleased to receive the same very giaciously. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "Chas. T. Ritchie. "The Town Clerk of Wandsworth. "Council House, Wandsworth, S.W." 28.—A Thanksgiving Service for the recovery of the King was held at St. Paul's Cathedral on the 26th October, at which the Mayor (Councillor W. J. Lancaster), the Ex-Mayor (Councillor J. Lidiard), and Councillor Campbell attended. Address to the King. 29.—The Council sealed the following joint Address from South London Boroughs, which was presented to the King on the occasion of the Royal Progress on the 25th October last. The Mayor (Councillor W. J. Lancaster), Alderman Dickinson, the Ex-Mayor (Councillor J. Lidiard), and the Town Clerk represented this Council at the Presentation. 37 "To Their Most Excellent Majesties King Edward and "Queen Alexandra. "The loyal and dutiful Address of the Mayors, Aldermen, and "Councillors of the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bermondsey, "Camberwell, Deptford, Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham, "Southwark, Wandsworth, and Woolwich. "May it Please Your Majesties, "We, Your Majesties' most loyal and dutiful subjects, humbly "approach Your Majesties with the expression of our heartfelt "congratulations upon the occasion of the Coronation of Your "Majesties. "The Empire over which Your Majesties' reign is unique alike "in its vast extent and in the preponderating influence it exercises "over the nations and peoples of the world, but the burden of "responsibility which Your Majesties have been called upon to "bear will to some extent be lightened by the continued support "and devoted attachment of the free and loyal people of Your "Majesties' dominions. "We recall with pleasure the arrival of Your Majesty the Queen "in England, on the 7th March, 1863, and the cordial enthusiasm "with which Your Majesty was received in passing through South "London, and we also remember the many occasions on which "Your Majesties have graciously manifested an interest in the "Municipal and other Institutions associated with this part of the "Metropolis. When Her late lamented Majesty ascended the "Throne in 1837, the provincial Municipalities, which under her "beneficient rule so powerfully influenced the progress and develop"ment of the arts and manufactures of the country and the well"being of the people, had recently been established, and we venture "to hope that the constitution of the Metropolitan Boroughs may "bring about equally beneficial results to the vast populations "committed to their care. In particular we humbly trust that, "encouraged by the deep personal interest which Your Majesties "have always shown in the provision of better housing and healthier "surroundings of Your Majesties' subjects, these Councils may "during Your Majesties' reign, be instrumental in ameliorating the "conditions under which large numbers of those subjects are com"pelled to live, and in developing, improving, and beautifying the "Metropolis of Your Empire. "We would especially desire to tender to Your Majesties the "assurance of the gratification which the recognition of the "Metropolitan Municipalities on recent State occasions has caused "to the inhabitants of the Boroughs we represent, and such recog- 38 "nition will, we feel confident, help to create a new and lively "interest in municipal work and duty. "We feel thankful that the application of medical and surgical "science has resulted in the complete recovery to health of Your "Majesty the King, and we humbly pray that Your Majesty may be "sustained, strengthened, and preserved for many years. "While assuring Your Majesties of our unabated loyalty and "devotion to Your Majesties' persons and Throne, we earnestly hope "that the Divine Blessing may attend Your Majesties' reign, and "that You may long live to rule over a loyal, contented, and "prosperous people." 30.—The following was the King's gracious reply to the Address, viz.:— "I thank you on behalf of myself and the Queen, for the loyal "and dutiful address presented by you in the name of the Mayors, "Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Boroughs south "of the Thames. We are deeply touched by the reference you have "made to my recovery from a dangerous illness (to which, under "God's mercy, medical science so much contributed), and by the "loyalty and devotion which are to-day being displayed by all "classes of our subjects. It is to us a source of much satisfaction to "know that the many social problems which present themselves to "those who are charged with the municipal go\ernment of the "Metropolis are receiving that attention which their importance "demands, and you have our hearty sympathy in all your efforts "to ameliorate the conditions under which large numbers of our "people are compelled to live." Coronation Celebration 31.—A Committee consisting of the Mayor (Councillor W. J. Lancaster, J.P.), Alderman the Rev. J. H. Anderson, Alderman H. J. Martin, Councillors Rear-Admiral H J. Campbell, C.B., Lieut.-General F. Lance, C.B., and J. Lidiard (Ex-Mayor), with the Town Clerk as Hon. Secretary, was appointed to consider what steps should be taken by the Council on behalf of the Borough to commemorate their Majesties Coronation. It was decided to entertain all children between the ages of 5 and 15 attending public elementary schools in the Borough and to present each child with a commemorative mug. Subscriptions to defray the expenses were invited from residents; Ward Committees were appointed to carry out the arrangements in the several wards, and the entertainments took place on the following dates, viz-: — 39 Date. Ward No. of Children. July 1st Clapham, North 6,277 July 3rd ,, South 5,205 July 1st Putney 4,200 July 2nd Streatham 4,000 July 4th Balham 4,000 July 3rd Tooting 2,700 July 2nd and 3rd Wandsworth 14,068 40,450 The Mayor presented to the head boy in each class in day and Sunday schools and Band of Hope classes a coronation medal and to each head girl a brooch. 32.—The arrangements for the King's Dinner to the Poor on the 5th July were entrusted to the same Committees that carried out the Borough Celebrations. 19,000 dinners were allotted by the Lord Mayor's Committee and were divided amongst the various wards as follows, viz,:— Ward. No. of Guests. Claphara North Ward 3,067 Clapham South Ward 1,490 Putney Ward 1,479 Balham Ward 3,099 Streatham Ward 1,588 Tooting Ward 1,093 Wandsworth Wards 7,114 Blind Poor 70 19,000 33.—A detailed report of the steps taken by the Council for celebrating the Coronation in the Borough was drawn up by the Committee and printed (with photographs of several places where the celebrations were held) in the report on the King's Dinner to the Poor issued by the Mansion House Committee. A copy of the report has been placed in each of the Public Libraries in the Borough, 40 Clapham Fire Station. 34.-—The memorial stone of the new fire station at the junction of Grafton Square and Old Town Clapham was laid by the Chairman of the Fire Brigade Committee of the London County Council on the 12th July, 1902, and the station opened by him on the 4th April, 1903, on which date the old station in Old Town, Clapham, was closed. 35.—The site of the old station, which had been parish property from time immemorial, was leased by the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Parish of Clapham to the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 15th March, 1867, at the rent of £1 per annum, and the Churchwardens and Overseers paid this rent into the funds of the Clapham Parish Church. Under the provisions of the London Government Act, 1899, the Churchwardens ceased to be Overseers and the legal interest in all property vested in the Churchwardens and Overseers (other than property connected with the affairs of the church or held for an ecclesiastical charity) was, subject to the provisions of any scheme made under the Act, vested in the Borough Council Application was therefore made to the London County Council for the rent to be paid to this Council, and after some correspondence with the Churchwardens and the Local Government Board on the subject, the Churchwardens felt it was their duty to relinquish their interest in the land and they accordingly informed the London County Council that the rent should in future be paid to this Council. Streatham Fire Station. 36.—The memorial stone of the new Fire Brigade Station at Mitcham Lane, Streatham, to the necessity for which this Council and the late District Board of Works have repeatedly called attention, was laid by the Chairman of the Fire Brigade Committee of the London County Council on the 7th February last. Blowing of Horns. 37—The London County Council, having under consideration the desirability of making a bye-law as to the blowing of horns, &c., on pleasure brakes and similar vehicles, invited the opinions of the Borough Councils on the subject. Considerable difference of opinion was manifested on the north side of the Thames as to the desirability of the proposed 41 bye-law being made, whilst only two of the Borough Councils on the south of the Thames disapproved the making of the bye-law. This Council and the Southwark Borough Council informed the County Council that they were of opinion that there should be some limitations as to the hours within which the bye-law should be enforced, and the County Council are now considering the desirability of making a bye-law for the part of London south of the Thames which should apply between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Noxious Literature. 38.—Councillors Henderson, Dewey, and Hennell were appointed the Council's representatives to attend a conference convened by the Greenwich Borough Council on the subject of noxious literature, and several meetings of the conference have taken place. Wandsworth Registration Sub-District. 39.—The Local Government Board have sanctioned the application of the Registrar-General for the division of the Wandsworth Registration Sub-District into two sub-districts, to be constituted as follows:—(a) a subdistrict co-extensive with Springfield Ward to be called Springfield Sub-District; and (6) a sub-district co-extensive with Southfield and Fairfield Wards, to be called Southfield Sub-District. Land Transfer Act. 40.—The Council presented a Petition to the House of Commons in favour of the appointment of a Committee to enquire into the past working of the Land Transfer Act, 1897, with the view of endeavouring to prevent any extension of its operation until an independent inquiry had been held. A conference convened by the City of London was held at the Guildhall, on the 28th November last, at which Councillor Lidiard represented this Council, and a resolution was passed to the effect that the experience gained in the working of the Act showed that a full and independent inquiry into the system of compulsory registration of title was imperatively called for, and deprecating the introduction of the system into the City in view of the undertaking given that the Act should not be so applied except with the previous consent of the City. 42 Compulsory purchase of Land. 41.—A conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Bethnal Green Borough Council, was held at the Town Hall, Bethnal Green, on the 10th April, with reference to the proposed extension of the power of Borough Councils to purchase land compulsorily. Councillors Lance and Hazell attended the conference as the representatives of this Council and the following resolutions were passed, viz.: — "That, in the opinion of this Conference, representative of the "Metropolitan Borough Councils constituted under the London "Government Act, 1899, the Councils should be invested with the "power to acquire land for any purpose connected with the duties "to be performed by the Councils, and that whether as to duties "under an Adoptive Act or not." "That the London Government Act, 1899, should be amended "so as to enable the Councils constituted thereunder to proceed by "way of Provisional Order to put in force the provisions of the "Lands Clauses Consolidation Acts for compulsory acquisition of "land as or in like manner as Local Authorities outside the Metro"polis are empowered to by section 176 of the Public Health Act, "1873." "That a copy of the resolutions be sent to the President of the "Local Government Board, and that the Councils representatives "do support the request to the President to give effect to the opinion "of this Conference and to ask the Members of Parliament for the "several Boroughs represented at this Conference to also support "such request." 42.—The foregoing resolutions were considered by the Council and the President of the Local Government Board and the Members of Parliament for this Borough were communicated with accordingly. The Local Government) Board have since stated that they are advised that Provisional Orders cannot be obtained in respect of the compulsory purchase of land required by a Borough Council for the purposes of the Baths and Washhouses Acts, the Burials Acts, the Public Libraries Acts, the Open Spaces Acts, or the Electric Lighting Acts, and that the suggestion that amending legislation should be promoted has been noted. 43 Litter in Streets. 43.—Proceedings were taken by the Council against the Advertising Manager of the Royal Duchess Theatre, Balhani, for littering roads in Streatham with bills advertising a performance at the theatre. The magistrate having dismissed the summons on the ground that the hand-bills were not litter within the meaning of the Act, the Council appealed to the Divisional Court, who decided that the case should go back to the magistrate for further consideration, as it was a question of fact as to whether or not paper was thrown on the street under such circumstances as would cause a litter in the ordinary popular sense of the word. The Council decided to take no further steps in this case and to take proceedings against persons littering the streets with hand-bills in future. Electric Lighting-. 44.—The Council has had under consideration the condition of and the charges for Electric Lighting in the Borough, and the current supplied to lamps belonging to the Council was tested. Although the variations of power were found to be somewhat in excess of the limits allowed, the Council was advised that these variations were not sufficient to warrant action being taken to enforce penalties for infringement of the Board of Trade regulations. The Council also obtained from Mr. Adams, an Electrical Engineer, a report on the possibility of using the steam power generated at the Tooting dust destructor for generating electric current for general supply, and this report showed that as far as he could ascertain from the information then at his disposal it was possible to use the power available from the dust destructor for generating electric current, and that current could be supplied to consumers at a profit for a flat rate of 5d. per unit for lighting purposes. Mr. Adams' report was referred to Messrs. Hopkinson and Talbot, who did not generally favour Mr. Adams' recommendations, especially as regards the advantage that would accrue from the use of the power generated by the dust destructor, but they at the same time acknowledged the general accuracy of the figures on which Mr. Adams' calculations had been based. 45.—In order to obtain further accurate information it was decided to test the steam power produced by the dust destructor, and to procure from Municipalities using power derived from dust destructors for generating electricity all the information possible 44 as to the results obtained. In February last the destructor was tested for a period of six days. The report showed that nearly I lbs. of steam was produced for every pound of refuse consumed. 46.—The Committee of the Council who considered the matter came to the following conclusions:— 1st. That dust destructors are usefully and economically employed in the production of electricity. 2nd. That the Tooting destructor is of good design and in good working order. 3rd. That electricity so generated can be supplied to consumers for lighting purposes at 5d. per unit. 47.—The Council has now commissioned Mr. Adams to draw out a complete scheme for the supply of electric current generated by power obtained from the dust destructor to such districts of the Borough as he considers it advisable to include in his operations. Patriotic Schools, Wandsworth Common. 48.—The attention of the Royal Patriotic Fund Commissioners was called to a statement in the press to the effect that the Commissioners proposed to sell for building purposes about 40 acres of the land attached to the Royal Patriotic Asylum at Wandsworth. The Commissioners stated in reply that the only foundation for such a statement was the fact that a Joint Committee of Lords and Commons in 1901 reported as follows:—"Consideration may well be given to the desirability "of realising full value of the land and obtaining at a less cost "suitable accommodation for the orphanape in a different " locality." Parliamentary Bills. 49.—The following Parliamentary Bills have been considered during the year, viz.:— London County Council (Tramways and Street Widenings). Croydon and District Electric Tramways. London and Brighton Electric Railway. London Building Acts (Amendment). London County Council (Electric Supply). 45 Local Authorities (Bills in Parliament). London Elections. London Water. Licensing. London County Council (General Powers). Food and Drugs (Amendment). Patriotic Fund. Clapham Junction to Marble Arch Railway A. Clapham Junction to Marble Arch Railway B. Bristol, London, and Southern Counties Railway. South-Eastern & Chatham & Dover (Extension of Time). Thames Steamboat Trust. River Thames Steamboat Service. Education No. 2. Rating of Machinery. Lighterage Rates. Parliamentary Voters. Registration of Motor Vehicles. London County Council (Receiving Houses for Patients). London County Council (Tramways and Street Widenings). 50.—The only tramways inc'uded in this Bill in this Borough were:— [a] a line (No. 6) commencing at the County boundary at the south-western end of Wimbledon Road. [b] a line (No. (a) commencing in Wimbledon Road two chains south-west of its junction with Garrait Lane te???nunating in Garratt Lane, two chains north-west of ihe junction of Wimbledon Road with Garratt Lane. This Council decided to consent to the scheme, subject to provisions satisfactory to the Council being inserted in the Bill with regard to the widening of the road to not less than fifty-four feet and to the Council not being called upon to contribute towards the cost of the street widening. The London County Council having agreed to the conditions of this Council, no opposition was made by this Council to the Bill before Parliament. Croydon and District Electric Tramways, 51.—This scheme included the construction of a proposed tramway from Mitcham Road passing along Longley Road to Merton Road to join the proposed London County Council tramways from Tooting Broadway to the County boundary in Merton Road. The proposal was objected to by this Council on the ground that the road was 46 unsuitable for a tramway and that the route would not be for the public advantage. An alternative route was suggested which would be entirely within the County of Surrey. The clauses relating to this Borough were struck out of the Bill. London and Brighton Electric Express Railway 52..—The promoters of this Bill sought powers to construct a railway commencing at Clare Street, near the Strand, crossing the River Thames near Waterloo Bridge, and entering the Borough of Wandsworth at Southville, near Priory Grove; crossing Larkhall Rise, near Union Road; the South-Eastern & Chatham & London, Brighton & South Coast Railways near Elmhurst Street; Manor Street; High Street, Clapham, near Wirtemberg Street; Clapham Park Road, Abbeville Road, Elms Road, Atkins Road, Grove Road; the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway; near Emmanuel Road; Tooting Bee Common; Bedford Hill; Tooting Bee Road; Mitcham Lane, near Eardley Road; the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, near the bridge over Eardley Road; Greyhound Lane; and proceeding thence through Mitcham and Croydon to Brighton. The Bill was not proceeded with. London Building: Acts Amendment Bill. 53.—This Bill proposed to amend the provisions of the London Building Act of 1894, relating to safety from fire. This Council suggested several amendments to the Bill and called attention to the fact that many provisions were unsatisfactory and likely to cause contention owing to the uncertainty which would arise as to the requirements which the County Council might make under them. The Bill was objected to by many of the other Local Authorities and it was eventually withdrawn. London County Council (Electric Supply). 54.—This Bill was the outcome of a conference between representatives of the County Council and the London Local Authorities, and would have enabled Local Authorities to combine for the purpose of purchasing the undertakings of any authorised distributors of electricity, in those cases where the areas of supply extend into more than one district. The Bill also provided that in cases where the Local Authorities did not desire themselves to exercise their power of purchase, the County Council should have powers, with the consent 47 of the Local Authorities concerned, to purchase any company's undertaking, and that the Council or Local Authorities in combination, purchasing an undertaking, might sell to any of the Local Authorities concerned part of the undertaking within their several districts. This Council approved of the Bill, which was, however, withdrawn on a statement that the Government had in draft a Bill on the same subject. Local Authorities (Bills in Parliament). 55.-—The object of this Bill, like the "Borough Funds Act "(1872) Amendment (London) Bill," referred to in the last report, was to improve the procedure of promoting and opposing Bills in Parliament. The Bill dealt chiefly with the promotion of Bills, but Clause 8 and the repealing schedule would have rendered unnecessary the consent of owners and ratepayers to the opposition of an authority to a Bill in Parliament. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which however met with considerable opposition in Parliament and was withdrawn. Borough Funds, 1803. 56.—This Bill, which was to the same effect as the lastmentioned Bill, was introduced in 1903 and received the Royal Assent on the nth August, 1903. London Elections Bill. 57.—The Council petitioned in favour of this Bill, which was introduced by the Government and proposed that the alterations of the areas of Parishes and Counties made under the London Government Act should have effect for all purposes relating to Parliamentary elections; that where any area transferred to a Parliamentary Borough abuts on one division only of that Borough, it should be added to that division, and that if it abuts on more than one division, it should be added to one or other division or divided between them in such manner as the London Government Act Commissioners might determine; and that the Board of Education might make orders altering the divisions for elections of the School Board so as to prevent the boundaries of any such division from cutting the boundaries of any Parish. The Bill also contained provisions for simplifying the form of lists and registers of voters in London. Owing to the opposition of several Members of Parliament the Government withdrew the Bill. 48 London Water Bill. 58.—This Bill was amended so that each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils should have one representative on the Water Board. The repayment of the capital is to be extended to a period of 100 years and provision is made for the introduction of a scheme for the equalisation of the charges for water. At a Meeting of the Council on the 4th February last Councillor J. Lidiard was appointed this Council's representative on the Board. Licensing. 59.—The Council petitioned in favour of this Bill, which proposed to amend the law relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor and to cases of drunkenness, and to provide for the registration of clubs. The Bill passed and came into operation on the 1st day of January, 1903. London County Council (General Powers) Bill. 60.—This Bill proposed (inter alia) to extend the time limited, by the Council's Act of 1898 for the widening of York Road, Battersea and Wandsworth, until the 12th August, 1905; to empower Borough Councils to provide accommodation for retail street vendors and to erect buildings or shelters and for that purpose to use any land belonging to them or to purchase or lease land, and to borrow money for the purpose,—any place, building, or shelter so provided to be opened for public use as a retail market upon such terms and such regulations as the Borough Council with the approval of the Local Government Board might prescribe; to prohibit any unlicensed premises being used for receiving horses for slaughter or dead horses; to empower the County Council to make bye-laws as to the conveyance of dead horses through streets, the enforcement of such bye-laws to rest with Borough Councils, provided that in case of default by a Borough Council the bye-laws might be enforced by the County Council, who should be entitled to recover from the Borough Council in default the expenses incurred; to repeal section 6 of the South Metropolitan Gas Act, 1900, relating to the description of burner for testing illuminating power; to empower Borough Councils supplying electrical energy to expend money upon the wiring and fitting, and supplying with wires, fittings, and apparatus, the premises of their consumers or prospective consumers, and to make such charge therefor as they may think fit, the Borough Councils to be empowered to borrow money 49 for such purposes as if such expenditure were for the purposes of the Electric Lighting Acts; and to authorise Borough Councils to expend money in providing and maintaining public clocks. This Council approved of the provisions relating to street markets and to the wiring of premises for electric lighting. The last-mentioned provisions and those relating to the South Metropolitan Gas Act, 1900, were, however, struck out of the Bill. The Royal assent was given to the Bill on the 11th of August. Food & Drags Amendment. 61.—This Bill proposed to extend the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts relating to the sale of margarine to the sale of butterine. "Butterine" was defined to mean butter to which any substitute was added whereby the amount of water was increased, but did not include margarine as defined by the Margarine Act, 1887. This Council pointed out that the use of the word butterine as proposed, or any word containing the word butter, would be objectionable as it would tend to facilitate fraud. The Bill was not proceeded with. Patriotic Fund. 62.—This Bill proposed to dissolve the Patriotic Fund Commission and to establish a Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation and to transfer the properties, rights, duties and liabilities of the Commission to the Corporation. The Corporation is to consist of 12 members nominated by His Majesty, the Chairman of every Council of a County, the Lord Mayors and Mayors of every County Borough in England and Ireland, and the Lord Provost and the Provost of every Royal, Parliamentary, or Police Burgh in Scotland with a population of not less than 50,000, together with 7 persons to be co-opted by the Council of the Corporation. This Council called the attention of the Government to the original circumstances under which the land at Wandsworth held by the Commission was alienated and devoted to its present purposes, and stated that in the opinion of this Council those circumstances altogether negative the suggestion that the land can be converted into a building estate, and in view of the anxiety created by that suggestion the Government were asked to make provision for a Member of this Council being placed upon any new governing body that might hereafter be created to administer the Patriotic Fund. Owing to the short time which 50 elapsed between the introduction and the passing of the Bill the Government were not able to give due consideration to the Council's suggestion. The measure received the Royal Assent on the 11 th August. 63.—No action was taken with regard to the other Bills abovementioned. London Electric Supply Corporation. 64.—This Company enquired whether the Council would, if not support, at least take no active steps to oppose, an application by them for a Provisional Order for the supply of electric current in this Borough, and in reply to the request of the Council stated the terms upon which they would undertake to supply consumers with current in the event of the Council not opposing the scheme. As it did not appear that the terms offered by the Company would benefit consumers of electricity in the Borough the Council decided to object to the proposed Order. Formal notice of the intention to apply for the proposed Order was given but was not proceeded with. Streatham Common Station. 65.—In October last the Council received a copy of a petition from residents of Streatham asking the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway to provide an entrance to their new station at Streatham Common from Eardley Road, and decided to support the request of the petitioners. In reply to the Council's letter the Company stated that they did not see their way to grant the request. A deputation consisting of Alderman Wellborne, Councillors Ling and Laceby, with the Town Clerk and the Surveyor, had an interview with the directors of the Company on the 31st December and pointed out the inconvenience which would arise from the arrangements proposed and suggested that a small booking office for Victoria and intermediate stations should be provided on the Eardley Road side of the station, and the present gate there retained. The Company declined to provide the accommodation asked for, and the matter is receiving the consideration of the Council. 51 Post Office Tooting. 66.—It being proposed to erect a new sorting office on the site of the Lawns, Upper Tooting Road, the Council pointed out to the Postmaster-General the increase in the population of the Parish of Tooting and the large area served from Tooting for postal purposes and asked him to establish a district post office in Tooting High Street. The PostmasterGeneral, however, regretted that at present the amount of post office business was not sufficient to justify the large additional expense that would be involved, and stated that the business was spread over a wide area served by 6 sub-post offices, at none of which was the business nearly sufficient to warrant the cost of a branch post office and no two of which could be closed if a branch office were established, and that the site of the proposed sorting office was not suitable for an office for the public. Unemployed. 67.—Alderman Anderson and Councillor Cewey were appointed the Council's representatives to attend a conference convened by the London County Council to consider the lack of employment in January last, when the following resolutions were passed. (a) That the County Council be recommended to consider if the immigration of the unemployed into London is sufficiently serious to warrant it in addressing county, borough, district, and parish councils warnings regarding the overcrowded state of the labour market in London, and in taking any other steps the Council may deem advisable to make the state of the London labour market as widely known as possible. (b) That as the recent cold weather showed how near we are to exceptional distress of a very grave kind, the conference declares that in its opinion local authorities in co-operation with the Government, should consider what steps can be taken to provide work of public utility so as to keep great numbers of the people profitably employed when private industry fails to do so, and with that end in view the conference recommends as follows:— (i.) That the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs should draw up schedules of improvements and other work which, if immediately undertaken, would be to the public benefit, and classify the work so as to show what part of it should be borne by the 52 localities, by the localities and the County Council, by the Country Council alone, and finally by the Government alone, or in conjunction with all or any of these municipal authorities. (ii.) That the Government be urged to take steps imraediate'y to undertake certain extensive work of public benefit to be carried out in convenient sections with a view both to giving workmen permanent employment away from large cities and to aiding them in times of exceptional distress, such works to include afforestation, reclamation of foreshores, and making of a national road round the coast, etc. 68.—Letters were also received from the Tooting Branch, Social Democratic Federation, and the Clapham Branch, Independent League, on the subject of the lack of employment, and in compliance with the request of the latter Association a deputation of five of the unemployed were invited to attend a Meeting of a Committee of the Council. The deputation however did not attend. Polling Districts. 69.—The Council, being of opinion that the Polling District consisting of the Clapham South Ward, had become unwieldly, made application to the London County Council to divide the same into 3 Polling Districts, for greater convenience at elections. A similar application was also made by the Battersea Borough Council. The London County Council in reply stated that having already made Orders dividing the electoral division into polling districts for parliamentary and county purposes, they were advised that their power to again alter the division for county purposes was extremely doubtful, and that the County Council considered that it would be inexpedient to alter the parliamentary polling districts without a corresponding alteration for County Council purposes; that in the circumstances the County Council regretted it was unable to accede to the requests of the Borough Councils, but had thought it desirable to call the attention of the Local Government Board to the applications, as further illustrating the need for an amendment of the law with respect to the provision of polling districts. 53 Fire at McMurray's Royal Paper Mills. 70.—On the 17th January last a serious fire took place at McMurray's Royal Paper Mills, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, whereby a large number of men, women and boys were thrown out of employment. The Mayor convened a public Meeting for the 26th January to consider the desirability of raising a fund for the assistance of these persons. At the public meeting an influential Committee was appointed for this object and for the distribution of the fund. Alderman Riicker was elected Treasurer of the Fund and Councillor A. J. Littlechild, Hon. Secretary to the Committee. The total sum raised was £787:9:11. Applications for assistance are considered by a SubCommittee weekly. The number of persons relieved has varied from 104 to 29 per week. It is anticipated that the fund will allow of relief being granted until the end of October. Water in Butter. 71.—Representations were made by the Council in 1901 to the Board of Agriculture with the view of regulations being made dealing with butter containing an excess of moisture, and the following regulation has been made under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899:— "That where the proportion of water in a sample of "butter exceeds 16 per cent. it shall be presumed for the pur"poses of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, until the contrary "is proved, that the butter is not genuine by reason of the "excessive amount of water therein. Colouring matter and preservatives in food. 72.—Representations have been made to the Local Government Board with the view of legislation being promoted to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee appointed to enquire into the use of preservatives and colouring matters in the preservation and colouring of food. The recommendations of the Committee were as follows:— (a) That the use of formaldehyde or formalin, or preparations thereof, in foods or drinks be absolutely prohibited, and that salicylic acid be not used in a greater proportion than I grain per pint in liquid food and I grain per pound in solid food. Its presence in all cases to be declared. (b) That tire use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in milk offered for sale in the United Kingdom be constituted an offence tinder the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 54 (<■) That the only preservative which it shall be lawful to use in cream be borac acid or mixtures of borac acid and borax, and in amount not exceeding o 25 per cent expressed as borac acid. The amount of such preservative to be notified by a label u] on the vessel. (1d) That the only preservative permitted to be used in butter and margarine be borac acid or mixtures of borac acid and borax, to be used in proportions not exceeding 0 5 per cent, expressed as borac acid. (f) That in the case of all dietetic preparations intended for the use of invalids or infants chemical preservatives of all kinds be prohibited. (/) That the use of copper salts in the so-called greening of preserved foods be prohibited. (g) That means be provided either by the establishment of a separate Court of Reference or by the imposition of more direct obligation on the Local Government Board to exercise supervision over the use of preservatives and colouring matters in food, and to prepare schedules of such as may be considered inimical to the public health. Penalties under Sale of Food Hz Drugs Acts. 73-—The attention of the Home Secretary was called to the inadequacy of the fines inflicted in proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, in comparison with the offence and the cost to the Council of procuring the sample and of the analysis. A circular letter on the subject has been addressed by the Home Secretary to magistrates. Samples for analyses. 74.-—The Council's attention having been called by the Board of Agriculture to the number of samples taken for analysis, it was decided to increase the number fro.n 600 per annum to a number equal to 3 per 1,000 of the population The present population is estimated at 243,000, and the present increase will be about 130 samples per annum. Housing of the Working: Classes. 75.—The question of the Housing of the Working Classes has continued to receive the consideration of the Public Health Committee during the year. The plans prepared by the architects to the Guinness Trustees for houses suitable for erection on sites at Hill's Yard, Wandsworth, and Rectory Grove, Clapham, and the reports upon the suitability of the sites and estimated cost of erecting such dwellings have been 55 very carefully considered. A copy of the reports and the report of the Committee thereon will be found in the report of the Medical Officer of Health, page 114. The Council, after considering the report referred the whole question back to the Committee for reconsideration of the schemes suggested and any others that may be brought before the Committee. At present the Committee have been unable to recommend a suitable site for the purpose which can be obtained upon favourable terms. Glanders. 76.—Owing to the prevalence of the disease of glanders, the Council considered the advisability of adopting the suggestion of the London County Council of closing the cattle troughs under its control and providing stand pipes in lieu thereof. This course was adopted in some Boroughs, but the Council decided to maintain the troughs, and in addition to provide stand pipes with spring valves to enable carmen to obtain water otherwise than from the troughs if they desired. Voluntary notification of consumption. 77..—The Council adopted, on the suggestion of the Medical Officer of Health, the voluntary notification of consumption, recommended by the conference on Tuberculosis in July, 1 go 1. The fee payable by the Council to medical practitioners for notification of cases is the same as for other notifiable diseases, viz.:—2s. 6d. for each case notified in private practice and I J. for each case notified in public practice. Disinfection of bedding in lodginghouses. 78.—Upon the application of the London County Council the Council decided to give facilities to keepers of common lodging-houses to have bedding disinfected in order to free it from vermin upon payment at the rate of 15s. per cwt. 79.—Other information relating to Public Health is contained in the Medical Officers report in the appendix. Coronation Gardens. 80.—At the Meeting of the Council on the 28th May, 1902, the Mayor (Councillor Wm. John Lancaster, J.P.) intimated that he was the owner of a piece of freehold land containing an area of about two acres, adjoining the Board school in Merton Road, Southfields, Wandsworth, a 56 hood which was becoming very populous, that he proposed to lay the land out as a recreation ground, with a gymnasium for the young and seats for the old, and to hand it over to the Council as a Coronation Gift, if the Council would undertake its maintenance as an open space for ever ; and that his sisters desired to add the gift of a drinking fountain for the ground. The offer was accepted by the Council and a vote of thanks to the Mayor and his sisters for their gifts to the Borough was unanimously passed. The ground, which it has been decided to call Coronation Gardens, has been laid out by the donor as an ornamental public garden and a number of seats have been provided. The Gardens were formally declared open to the public for ever by the present Mayor (Councillor Wm. Hunt, J.P.) on the 4th July, 1903, and were taken in charge by the Open Spaces Sub-Committee of the Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committee on behalf of the Council. The neighbourhood, which is being rapidly built over, is one where open spaces are very much needed and the Council desires to record its appreciation of Councillor Lancaster's gift, which will be highly prized by the inhabitants of «the Borough at large. Leader's Gardens. / 81.—The work of laying out Leader's Gardens, Putney Embankment, has been completed, and the Gardens were formally declared open to the public for ever on the same day as Coronation Gardens. Roads on Boundary of Borough. 82.—The Order referred to in last year's report respectingthe roads on the boundary of the Boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth has now been issued by the London County Council. The Order places under the exclusive management of the respective Councils for the purposes of paving, lighting, watering, cleansing, sewerage, and drainage the following streets situate partly in this Borough and partly in the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth, viz.: — 57 Wandsworth Borough Council. New Road (from a point 180 yards west of Wandsworth Road to Wandsworth Road). Wandsworth Road (from the south-west side of New Road to the northeast side of Belmore Street). Southville. Larkhall Lane (from the north-east side of Southville to the south-west side of Elwell Road). Elwell Road. Bromfelde Road (from the north-east side of Elwell Road to Gaskell Street).

Leigham Vale (from the north-east side of Kinfiuns Road to Leigham Court Road). 58 Street Paving. 83.—The Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Local Authorities convened by the Westminster City Council for the purpose of considering the materials and means of paving the streets of London best suited to ihe different localities and conditions of traffic, held a further meeting in January last, when the following resolution was passed, viz.: — That a permanent Committee be formed, consisting of one Member from the City of London, the City of Westminster, and each Metropolitan Borough ; that the duties of the Committee should be to meet at a particular period of the year for the purpoie of considering the reports of the various Engineers and Surveyors of the County with regard to the life and wear of the different kinds of paving, and upon experiments made ; that the said reports should be put into statistical form and be sent to every Alderman and Councillor in the County of London ; that the expenses of the Committee, not exceeding /200 per annum, should be paid by subscriptions from the various Councils, each paying according to its rateable value a proportion of such expenses. 84.—The various Metropolitan Local Authorities were each invited to adopt the resolution and to nominate a member of the proposed Committee. This Council decided to agree to the proposal and appointed the Chairman of the Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committee (Councillor Lorden) as its representative. ContHbut Ions towards Improvements. 85.—A conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils was convened by the Camberwell Borough Council to consider the subject of the varied treatment of Borough Councils by the London County Council in fixing the amount of the local and county contributions towards the cost of street improvements. This Council was represented by Councillors Lidiard and Lorden, and the following resolutions were passed, viz.: — (a) That the present system, whereby the London County Council claims from the Metropolitan Borough Councils contributions on varying bnses for similar improvements is contrary to the practice which should prevail in the Metropolis. (b) That having regard to the rapid growth of London and the consequent increase in traffic, and to the necessity for some uniform practice being adopted, this Conference do now consider upon what principle it is prepared to recommend that the cost of London improvements should be.borne, 59 County Improvements, (c) That the principle of treating London as a whole, and ot systematically selecting improvements best calculated to provide relief to the main thoroughfares, as advocated by a Select Committe of Parliament of 1871, should at once be formulated by the London County Council in a definite and comprehensive scheme for all future County improvements, and upon which London should equally contribute upon rateable value. Tramway Improvements. (d) That in all thoroughfares in which tramways are or may be constructed, a width of not less than 54 feet should be provided, and the total cost of widening borne by the London County Council either out of the tramways account or the county rate. Local Improvements. (e) That contributions to Local Authorities for local improvements should be, as far as possible, on a uniform basis. 86.—The Conference having invited this Council's observations on the resolutions was informed that this Council agreed with the resolution (c) subject to the words " chargeable to the County " Rate " being substituted for the words " and upon which London " should equally contribute upon rateable value " ; that the Council also agreed with the resolution (d) ; and that with regard to the resolution (e) the Council was of opinion that provided the London County Council undertook the improvements referred to in resolutions (c) and (d) the local authorities should undertake local improvements. Electrical Traction on Tramways. 87.—The work of re-constructing for electrical traction the Westminster to Tooting line of tramways has been completed and the new system was inaugurated by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales on the 15th May, 1903. The Council on several occasions called the attention of the London County Council to the dilatory way in which the work was being carried on and to the serious loss and inconvenience thereby caused to ratepayers in this Borough, and the County Council was urged to expedite matters by arranging for the employment of at least double shifts of men. Attention was also called to the danger axising from the method adopted of running the tramcars on temporary lines. The County Council shortly afterwards arranged for two shifts of men to be employed and took precautions to reduce the inconvenience to the ordinary traffic caused by the use of the temporary tramway tracks. The subsequent progress of the work was much more satisfactory. 60 88/—It being necessary to indicate by notices the stopping places for the electric cars the County Council proposed that the notices should be fixed to standards placed on the public footpath at distances varying from 150 to 300 yards. As the notices would have been unlighted and with the view of preventing as far as possible any needless obstruction of the public way, the Council declined to agree to this proposal, but suggested that a lamp (to which the notices could be attached) should be erected at each stopping place and offered to give facilities for the removal of lamps where necessary and to maintain such lamps as parish lamps. Upon further consideration the County Council decided to adopt this suggestion and the re-arrangement of the lamps has now been effected and the notices fixed. 89.—When the work of re-construction was nearing completion a number of feeder pillars were placed on the footpath for the purpose of controlling the various sections of the adjacent conduit conductors. Several of these were fixed in most inconvenient spots, causing considerable obstruction to the foot traffic, and as this Council had not had proper notice of the proposal the London County Council were asked to remove the pillars. The County Council, however, Stated that the pillars were essential, but promised that after the inauguration ceremony full consideration would be given to the matter with the view of meeting the wishes of this Council if possible. As the removal of the pillars at that time would probably have interfered with the ceremony they were allowed to remain temporarily. The Council has since been in communication with the County Council on the subject and it is hoped that some of the pillars will be shortly shifted to positions where they will cause less obstruction than at present. 90.—The re-constructed tramways were inspected on the 5th May, 1903, by Colonel Yorke and Mr. Trotter (on behalf of the Board of Trade). The Mayor and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committee, accompanied by the Town Clerk and the Surveyor for the Eastern District, attended the inspection when the attention of the Inspectors was called to the noise caused by the running of the cars; to the obstruction caused by the feeder pillars and by the process 0f 61 cleansing the conduits through the street boxes ; and to the likelihood of injury to passengers owing to the insufficient space between the cars and the under side of the railway bridges across High Street, Clapham, and Balham High Road. Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Council addressed co.nmunications to the Board of Trade and the London County Council upon these matters. The danger arising from the railway bridges has been dealt with in the regulations made by the Board of Trade with regard to the working of the tramways. The cars are required to stop before passing under the bridges, the speed of the cars under the bridges is limited to four miles an hour, the conductors are to warn passengers of the danger, and a notice is to be placed on each of the bridges. Electrical Tramways & Tramway Improvements. 91.—For some time past the Council has been urging upon the London County Council the necessity of pressing forward the acquisition of the property required lor the widening of the thoroughfare from York Road, Wandsworth, to Tooting Broadway in connection with the proposed construction of an electrical tramway there, and of at once carrying out the paving works wherever practicable. The County Council in their last communication on the subject stated that they had not yet obtained possession of all interests in any considerable extent of property required, but that they were1 using every endeavour to complete the improvement as rapidly as possible. This Council, however, not being satisfied with the progress of the scheme, pointed out in reply that in consequence of the delay in carrying out the paving works the thoroughfare was in a deplorable condition, and that in parts of the road the land required for the widening had already been thrown into the public way; and the County Council were again urged to at once proceed with the paving works in these sections. 92.—In July, 1902, the County Council deposited with the Board of Trade plans and description of the system of electrical traction which it was proposed to adopt for the use of electrical traction on the new tramways from Wandsworth to Tooting. The proposal was to construct the line on a conduit system similar to that which had been approved for the Westminster to Tooting tramways and this Council decided not to object thereto. Several 61 months later, however, this Council was informed by the County Council that it appeared to the Council that having regard to the semi-rural character of the district through which the tramway would pass the line was one on which an overhead system of electrical traction might with advantage be adopted, and that if this course were taken it would be practical to construct the tramway at a much earlier date than would be the case if an underground conduit system were employed, and the paving of the new portion of the carriageway could be expedited ; and this Council was asked whether it was prepared to give its consent to the use of overhead traction. At the same time the Council was invited to appoint representatives to confer with the Highways Committee of the County Council as to the proposed doubling of the tramways along Wandsworth Road, Nine Elms Lane, Battersea Park Road, and York Road and the use of overhead traction for those tramways. This Council thereupon appointed a deputation consisting of Aldermen Anderson and Howell, and Councillors Lancaster, Lidiard, Lorden, and Welton, to confer with the Committee of the County Council both as to the system of overhead traction proposed to be used, and as to the period within which the County Council would undertake to complete the necessary street widenings and the construction or re-construction of the tramways referrred to. 93.—The Conference was held in due course and the views of this Council having been considered by the Committee of the County Council, that Council stated that the approximate dates at which it was anticipated that the necessary street widenings might be effected and vacant possession of the sites given to the Council's Engineer were as follows: — (a) In Defoe Road and in Garratt Lane between Tooting High Street and Earlsfield Station—31st December, 1903. (b) In Tooting High Street, between the present tramway terminus and Defoe Road—31st March, 1904. (c) In Garratt Lane, north of Earlsfield Station and in South Street, and Red Lion Street—30th June, 1904. (id) In East Hill and Wandsworth Road, for which Parliamentary powers cannot be obtained until the Session of 1905—30th June, 1907, at the earliest. 63 that a considerable portion of the tramways between East Hill and Wandsworth Road consisted of single lines with passing places, and that in order to permit of the tramways being doubled street widenings, for which Parliamentary powers will have to be obtained, would have to be carried out; that the Council's Engineer was of opinion that, assuming the contracts for the reconstruction of the tramways were let sufficiently beforehand to allow the contractors time to prepare the heavy castings, &c., and to provide supplies of all materials required, the tramways could be constructed for the conduit system approximately by the following dates: — (a) Tooting tramway terminus to Earlsfield Station—30th June, 1504. (b) Earlsfield Station to York Road—31st October, 1904. (r) The v\hole of the tramways acquired by the Council from the South London Tramways Company, including the portion in the Borough of Wandsworth—31st December, 1908. The County Council also stated that if the overhead trolley system were adopted for the Garratt Lane tramway and for the whole of those acquired from the South London Tramways Company and arrangements made without delay, and subject to any portions of the tramways where at the time of re-construction widenings were still required remaining for the time being as single lines to be doubled when the widenings were being carried out, the work could be completed as to (rt) by 31st December, 1903 ; (b) by 28th February, 1904, and as to (c) by 31st December, 1904; that it was not anticipated that the cost of street widenings in connection with the Garratt Lane tramways would be in any way reduced if the overhead system were adopted; that the only immediate advantage to be gained by the adoption of the overhead system was that the tramways might at first be constructed, if necessary, with short portions of single line which could be doubled after the completion of the widenings ; and that as regards the property required for the Garratt Lane widenings all the notices to treat had been served and in a large number of cases terms had been arranged. 94.—The whole subject was then further considered by this Council and it was decided to inform the County Council: — 64 (1) That this Council is of opinion that the proposed tramways from the Tooting terminus to Earlsfield Station and from Earlsfield Station to York Road, Wandsworth, respectively, should be constructed upon the underground conduit system. (2) That as by adopting the overhead trolley system there will be a saving of four years in the introduction of electrical traction on the tramways acquired from the South London Tramways Company this Council is willing to consent as a temporary arrangement to the use of overhead traction on such tramways • upon condition that the London County Council agree to alter the overhead to the underground conduit system as soon as possible. West Hill, W andsworth. Widening. 95.—Considerable progress has been made with the negotiations for the acquisition of the property required for this improvement and terms have been arranged with the owners for the purchase of a number of the interests. In a few cases, however, the compensation offered by the Council not having been accepted it has been necessary to take steps to acquire the property compulsorily. The forecourt fences of some of the houses on the south side have been set back and the work of erecting an ornamental iron fence to the new line in front of the Public Library and removing the adjoining shops is in hand. The Council endeavoured to purchase the part of the forecourt of the police station which will project into the widened thoroughfare, but the Home Secretary declined to consent to the sale of any portion thereof. As the premises belong to the Crown, they are exempt from the operation of the Act under which the Council has power to acquire property compulsorily and the width of the road at the point will consequently be less than at first contemplated. 96.—The application to the County Council for a contribution towards the cost of the improvement has been proceeded with and that Council was informed that if it would contribute two-thirds of the cost this Council would give its consent to the construction of a tramway along the portion of the road proposed to be widened between the police station and Santos Road. The County Council in December last year gave its consent to the carrying out of the improvement in accordance with the plan prepared by this Council upon these terms. 65 97-—The estimate of the cost prepared by this Council amounted to £25,000. The County Council, however, estimated the cost at £23,800 and agreed to contribute two-thirds of the nett cost, the contribution not to exceed the sum of £15,866. High Street. Wandsworth, & St. Ann's Hill, Widening-. 98.—The Council having obtained possession of the property required for widening the road at the corner of High Street and St. Ann's Hill, Wandsworth, and on the western side of the latter thoroughfare, the buildings have been removed and the improvement carried out. The London County Council has agreed to contribute one-half the cost, the contribution not to exceed £1,150. When the Two Brewers public-house was re-erected some time ago the new buildings were set back and terms have now been settled for the acquisition of the property required for continuing the widening on the eastern side of St. Ann's Hill. The improvement has been partly carried out and the purchase of the remaining property is now in course of completion. Putney Bridge Road Widening. 99.—The widening of the very narrow part of Putney Bridge Road, by High Street, Wandsworth, has been carried out. The total estimated cost was £4,850 including the necessary paving works, part of which has been deferred for the present. The lease of the property being about to expire it was only necessary to purchase the freeholders' interest. The London County Council has promised to contribute one-third of the nett cost, the contribution not to exceed the sum of £1,617. Aboyne Road Widening1. 100.—The Council has continued to press upon the London County Council the desirability of improving the means of communication from Burntwood Lane round Garratt Green (which is vested in the London County Council) to Garratt Lane. A Sub-Committee of the Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committee met a Sub-Committee of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the County Council on the ground and pointed out the urgent necessity of the improvement. After further correspondence, as the Parks Committee appeared to be indisposed to recommend the widening of Aboyne Road, this Council suggested as an alternative that a new road should be formed on the western side of the Green. The County Council, however, declined to agree to either proposal, but has been asked to re-consider its decision. 66 High Street, Putney, & Coopers Arms Lane Widening iol.—Messrs. Brandon's Putney Brewery, Ltd., being desirous of erecting three new shops on the site of Nos. 58-64, High Street, Putney, the Council has arranged for the new buildings to be set back so as to widen the road, and for the widening of Coopers' Arms Lane at the Brewery premises. On the expiration of the existing leases No. 66 and 68, High Street will also be set back to the new line. Under the agreement the necessary steps are being taken to close the public footpath known as Pepper Alley, the site of which will revert to the Company. North Street & Rectory Grove, Clapham, Widening. 102.—Before its dissolution the late District Board had had a plan prepared for the widening of North Street and Rectory Grove, Clapham, and had approached the London County Council with the view of obtaining a contribution towards the cost, which was estimated at £9,000. The Council adopted the proposal but after considerable correspondence were not able to induce the County Council to agree to pay more than one-third the nett cost, the contribution not to exceed £3,000. The negotiations for the acquisition of the property required have been somewhat delayed as it was at one time proposed that the whole of certain premises affected by the improvement should be purchased and the land not required for the widening utilised as a site for a housing scheme. The Council, however, were not able to come to terms with the owners and it has not been found practicable to proceed with this propgsal. In a number of cases the strips of forecourt required have been purchased and the land added to the public way. For the purpose of acquiring the remaining properties the Council has had to put in force its compulsory powers and these proceedings are still in progress. Trinity Road, Balham, Widening. 103.—The Highways Committee have for some time past had under consideration the desirability of widening Trinity Road, Balham, between Balham High Road and St. Nicholas Road. A plan and estimate of the cost (amounting to £7,320) having been prepared the County Council were asked to contribute towards the cost and after some correspondence the Improvements Committee of that Council agreed to recommend the payment of one-half thereof, the contribution not to exceed the sum of £4,000. In the meantime 67 tiations had been com menced for the acquisition of the necessary property, and settlements have now been arrived at with all the owners. Owing to the nature of the interests in some cases the Council has not yet been able to complete the purchases but the matter is being pressed forward as rapidly as possible. The part of the road near Balham High Road will be widened to 54 feet. In connection with this improvement the carriageway of the part of Trinity Road in Balham will be paved with wood and the footpaths in the widened part of the road with artificial stone at an estimated cost of £2,680. Upper Tooting Road Widening. 104.—The owner of one of the pieces of land required for the last-mentioned improvement was also the owner of the old Wheatsheaf public-house in Upper Tooting Road. Since the premises had been unoccupied the forecourt had remained in a very uncared-for condition and the front of th" building having collapsed the Council availed itself of the opportunity of acquiring the necessary land to complete the widening of this part of the road. The forecourt has now been thrown in^o the public way and paved. Tooting High Street Widening. 105.—In connection with the re-building of the Castle publichouse in Tooting High Street, the Council secured the widening of the road to 60 feet in front of those premises. Terms have also been arranged for the acquisition of the property required for continuing the improvement to Defoe Road, including the widening of part of the lastmentioned thoroughfare to 54 feet, The purchases are now in course of completion but as in most cases the existing businesses are to be re-instated some little time must elapse before the improvement can be effected. The London County Council have promised to contribute two-thirds of the cost. The widening of the part of the road between the tramway terminus and the Castle public-house is in the hands of the County Council. Tooting High Street & Effort Street Widening. 106.—With regard to the widening of Tooting High Street in front of the St. Leonard's estate the necessary proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of the one remaining property have been taken, the jury have made their award, and the purchase of the land required is being proceeded with. A strip of land at the rear of the same premises is also being acquired under similar conditions for the purpose of widening Effort Street. 68 107.—A table of fees was adopted on the 23rd July, 1902, and Burial Fees, application made to the Local Government Board for their approval. Several letters were received from residents calling attention to the increase in the re-opening fees, and a letter was received from the Local Government Board on the subject. 108.—The fees made in July were revoked on the 21st January, 1903, and a fresh table approved, which the Local Government Board sanctioned. A clause was inserted in the table providing that the fees for second and subsequent interments in earthen graves, &c., in which the exclusive right of burial had been granted prior to the coming into force of the present table of fees should be the same as the re-opening fees in force at the time such exclusive right of burial was granted. 109.—The fees are as follows:— Parishioners.

Librarian: J. Reed Welch. 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE OF Clapham Public Library, For the Year ended 31st March, 1903. The new rules and regulations adopted by. the Council for the seven libraries in the Borough came into operation in the first week in February, 1903, The chief alterations in Clapham were the change of the stocktaking period from the first fourteen days in August to the first fourteen days in July, the Lending Library to be open on Saturdays till nine p.m. instead of eight, readers' tickets to be available for one year instead of two years, and alteration of fines for overdue books. The keeping open of the Lending Library till nine p.m. on Saturdays has not proved the success that was anticipated, very few borrowers coming after eight o'clock. A supplementary catalogue of books added to the Lending Library since the publication of the general catalogue in 1899 was compiled by the Librarian and ordered to be printed. The number of volumes now in stock is 11,499. The number issued during the year was 77,558, an increase of 4,741 as compared with the previous year, and representing a daily average issue of 318 volumes. A large number of worn-out and dilapidated books were replaced and rebound. A new stand for four newspapers has been placed in the Reading-Room, and a magazine rack in the Reference Library. In November, 1902, the Committee received with regret the resignation, in consequence of ill-health, of Mr. Thomas Stock, and the Council elected Mr. R. de M. Rudolf, I.S.O., to fill the vacancy, upon the recommendation of the Committee. Councillor Kipling was also elected a member of the Committee in place of Alderman Dunkley. The Committee have much pleasure in expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties. On behalf of the Committee, Charles P. Greene, Chairman. 25th May, 1903. 5 NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN STOCK On March 31st, 1903, AND Volumes Issued from 1st April, 1902, To March 31st, 1903. Lending Library:— Vols. in Stock.

REPORT OF THE PUTNEY DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE, 1902-1903. IN presenting their report for the year ended 31st March, 1903, the Committee are glad to state that the various departments of the Library continue to be extensively used. This is noticeable in the Reference department, which is frequented in the evenings by a large number of students. The new books purchased last year with the funds raised by the Bazaar and Exhibition are very attractive and of great service. The Committee decided to hold a short course of Lectures during the winter, a small charge being made for admission. The first lecture was given by Mr. W. Davenport Adams on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 27th January, the subject being "Gilbert-Sullivan Opera." Vocal and musical illustrations were most kindly given by Miss Rosina Brandram, Mr. Rutland Barrington, and Mr. Wharton Wells. The Lecture proved a great success. On the afternoon of Tuesday, the 17th February, a lecture on "Henry VIII., the Man and the Monarch," was given by Mr. A. F. Pollard, M.A., Examiner in Modern History to the Universities of Oxford and London, and was greatly appreciated by an audience that filled the Board room. The Third and last lecture of the series, "The Stately Homes of England," was given by Mr. J. Whitehead on the evening of the 30th March. This lecture, which was of a very interesting character, was admirably illustrated by lantern slides through the kindness of Mr. Francis Beeson. 11 As the result of the Lectures a sum of £10: 7: 6 was placed at the disposal of the Committee for the purchase of books. To Miss Brandram and to these gentlemen the Committee tender their very cordial thanks. It is hoped to provide a further and a longer series during the forthcoming winter session. For the convenience of the early visitors seeking situations a board has recently been fixed outside the Library for displaying before 9 o'clock advertisements of situations vacant from the " Daily Telegraph " and the " Daily Chronicle." Now that funds permit, tenders are being invited for reprinting the catalogue of books in the Library and it is expected that it will be in the hands of the printers by the date this report is published. The Committee again express their cordial thanks for many generous gifts of books. A detailed list will be found on page 15 of this report. The Committee regret that in September last, Mr. W. J. Gilks, who had been a Member since the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts in 1887, resigned his appointment. In October, Mr. W. Davenport Adams was elected to fill the vacant position. During the year thirteen General Meetings and five Sub-Committee Meetings have been held. In October the Caretaker, R. Scott, resigned his appointment to go to South Africa. H. Rock was appointed in his place. Lending Library. There are 7,727 volumes in this Department; and the total number of borrowers is 4,577. New borrowers to the number of 906 joined the Library during the year, and the number of books issued was 53,032. A much larger number would have been issued had a new catalogue been available. Full information, including a classification, may be found on pages 13 and 14 Magazine Room. For this room there are provided 27 monthly magazines and reviews, 2 quarterlies, and 37 weekly periodicals, list of which may be found on pages 17 and 18. 12 The magazines are transferred to the Lending Library at the end of each month, and are bound as the volumes are completed. News Room. Twenty-eight copies of daily newspapers, including the more important provincial dailies, and 89 weekly newspapers and periodicals are provided in this room.

During the past year the work of the Streatham, Balham and Tooting Public Libraries has entailed much time and attention on the part of the Divisional Committee, more particularly with regard to the enlargement of the Balham Library and the provision of books for the new public library at Tooting. Balham Library:— The alterations and additions to the Balham Library were completed in December. The new Reading Room is nearly three times the area of the old one, and the new Lending Department is capable of storing upwards of 30,000 volumes. This extension, it is hoped, will meet all requirements for some years to come. The increased use which has been made of the Balham Library since its re-opening has greatly exceeded the expectations of the Committee, and has fully justified the action of the Council in consenting to provide more adequate library accommodation for this growing district of the Borough. Tooting Library:— In the last report it was mentioned that by the liberality of Councillor W. J. Lancaster, J.P., Mayor of Wandsworth for the year 1901-2, a public library was being provided in the parish of Tooting, this being at that time the only one of the five parishes comprising the Borough of Wandsworth without an Institution of this kind. The handsome building which has been erected and tastefully furnished by his munificence was formally opened on the 8th November, 1902, by Mrs. Anderson, the wife of the Rector of Tooting. On the kind invitation of Councillor Lancaster a large number of the Borough representatives attended the opening ceremony, and among those who took part in the proceedings were:—The Bishop of Southwark; Councillor R. Simpson, M.A., LL.B., Chairman of the Libraries Committee during 1901-2; Mr. W. F. Massingham, Chairman of the Divisional Committee during 1902; Alderman the Rev. J. H. Anderson, M.A., Rector of Tooting; Mr. R. W. Essex; Alderman C. E. Wellborne; and Councillor William Hunt (the present Mayor) architect of the building. 21 A few weeks previous to the opening of the Library an appeal was made by the Tooting representatives on the Borough Council for contributions towards providing the first stock of books. This appeal met with a generous response and many donations were received from members of the Council and others interested in the welfare of the new library. The Divisional Committee have endeavoured to add to the popularity and usefulness of the Tooting Library by doing the utmost with the very limited funds at their disposal to provide as far as possible a varied selection of suitable books, periodicals, and newspapers, and they are gratified to find that the inhabitants of Tooting have availed themselves of the advantages afforded by Councillor Lancaster's generous gift. Number of Books issued:— 229,142 volumes were issued to readers at the three libraries during the year ended 31st March, 1903. The number of books issued at the Tate library, streatham, was 143,513, being an increase of 7,156 on the previous year's return. This increase in the circulation occurred in every class of literature, except Poetry and the Drama. The class percentages are almost the same as those of last year. At the Balham Library the number of books issued was 80,826, or 14,242 fewer than last year. This decrease is attributable solely to the fact that the library was closed from the early part of November till the middle of January for structural alterations and additions to the building. Immediately after the re-opening of the Balham Library a considerable increase occurred in the demand for books, the issues from the middle of January till the end of March being 6,123 more than during the corresponding period of the preceding year. The Lending Department of the tooting Library was opened on the 9th of February and the number of books issued during the seven weeks was 4,803. The following is a statement of the number of books issued in the different classes of literature during the year:— 22 NUMBER OF BOOKS ISSUED IN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF LITERATURE. CLASS.

Tate Library.—During the year 591 volumes were added to the Tate Library and 516 withdrawn from stock. The number of volumes at present in stock is 18,470. Balham Library.—Advantage was taken of the closing of the Balham Library to revise the stock in Class E (Prose Fiction) and re-number the books. 661 volumes, including re-placements, were added to the library during the year and 311 withdrawn from stock. The number of volumes at present in stock is 7,460 Tooting Library.—At the 31st March the Tooting Library possessed 2,996 volumes, acquired as follows :— Books presented or subscribed for 1,985 „ purchased out of the general funds of the library 879 „ transferred from the Streatham and Balham Libraries 132 Total 2,996 24 The Committee take this opportunity of expressing their indebtedness to the kind friends who manifested such a warm interest in the welfare of the new library at Tooting by so generously providing books. This aid did much to facilitate the opening of the Lending Department. The names of these donors are given on page 31. The following is a statement of the number of books in stock in the different classes of literature at the 31st March, 1903:— 45 CLASSIFICATION OF THE BOOKS IN STOCK. CLASS.

Tickets are available for a period of twelve months. Annual Stocktaking:— The Tate library was closed in July for the purposes of annual stocktaking and cleaning. At the Balham Library the stocktaking was done during the period that the building was closed for alterations. The books at both Institutions were examined and checked with the stock-registers, with the result that every book except one at the Tate Library could be accounted for. The interior of the Tate Library has been recently repainted and distempered. Catalogues:— In January, the Committee published an Author-List of the books in the Balham Library and an Indicator-Key for Class E (Prose Fiction). A catalogue of the books in the Tooting Library was printed a few weeks later. Card catalogues have been placed in each library and the usual lists of additions issued at intervals during the year. So far as funds will permit, every facility is given for readers to become acquainted with the books which are added from time to time to the libraries. New Rules and Regulations:— The new Rules and Regulations, applicable to all the public libraries in the Borough, were put into operation on the 1st of January. So far as these libraries are concerned the new rules have effected the following alterations:— 1—The earlier opening of the Reading Rooms and Lending Departments daily. 27 1—Allowing the Lending Departments to remain open one hour later on Saturday evenings.* 3—An earlier date for the annual stocktaking. 4—Reserving books for borrowers, by allowing them to leave at the receiving-desk an addressed post-card, stating the title and number of the book they require. Books are reserved for one day only after the cards are posted. The Divisional Committee decided in December last to close the Lending Department of the Tate Library on Wednesdays instead of Thursdays. The increased attendance at the library on Thursdays, compared with Wednesdays as formerly, appears to justify the action of the Committee. Reading Rooms:— The Reading Rooms have been well attended during the year and several additions made to the list of papers supplied. The rooms are open on week-days from 9 a.m. till 10 p.m, and on Sundays from 3 until 9 p.m. The Reading Rooms are now closed on Sundays during the months of July, August, and September. Fire Insurance:— The amount of fire insurance on the library buildings and their contents has been recently revised. Committee:— It is with feelings of very deep regret that the Committee have to record the loss which they have sustained by the death of the Rev. henry Barron, of Upper Tooting, and they desire to express their appreciation of the services rendered by him during the period that he served 011 the Streatham and Tooting Divisional Committee. †The Lending Departments of the Streatham, Balham and Tooting Libraries are now closed at 8 o'clock, the Committee having found it unnecessary to keep these departments open later on Saturday evenings. 28 The Council having lately adopted the Public Libraries Acts for the parish of Tooting, the penny rate was levied at the beginning of the financial year 1902-3. alderman the Rev. J. H. Anderson, M.A., Rector of Tooting, and Mr. Edward Coleman, M.R.C.VS., of Tooting, were appointed members of the Libraries Committee. In October last Mr. Ernest A. Davis, of Upper Tooting, was elected in the place of the Rev. H. Barron, deceased. In December, the Council re-elected the Committee for another year. The Committee take this opportunity of recording their high appreciation of Mr. MASSINGHAM'S services during his year of office as Chairman of the Divisional Committee and their indebtedness to him for the time and attention which he has devoted so assiduously to the interest and work of the libraries during the five years that he has been identified with the management. Councillor Clifford M. Ashdown has been appointed Chairman of the Divisional Committee for the ensuing twelve months. It will be seen from this Report that substantial progress has been made in the work of the libraries during the past year. Much, however, remains to be done if the libraries are to attain that efficient position which it is the desire and object of the Committee to see accomplished. The very limited stock of books contained in the Institutions located at Balham and Tooting is obviously quite inadequate for the needs of these rapidly growing suburbs, whilst the amount of money available for books at the Tate Library hardly suffices for more than the replacement of worn-out stock. During the ensuing year it is expected that a circulation of more than a quarter of a million volumes will be reached, consequently an increased expenditure for re-binding and replenishing the stock may be anticipated. The greater facilities which have been provided during the past year for borrowing books and reading the current periodical literature also entail an additional expenditure for maintenance, thus leaving a somewhat small 29 portion of the annual income available for the purchase of new books. As everything has been done to ensure the most economical administration, it seems that if the libraries are to be developed, as indicated above, the Committee must look to some other source for means to supplement the general funds. The penny rate will be ultimately more productive, but the Committee desire immediate results. They therefore turn their attention to donations. They remember with gratitude the generous aid experienced recently, when providing the first stock of books for the Tooting Library, and they take this opportunity of appealing to the public to assist them in extending the usefulness of the three libraries by donations of money or suitable books. Signed on behalf of the Streatham and Tooting Divisional Committee, CLIFF. M. ASHDOWN, Chairman. 29th June, 1903. 30 NAMES OF DONORS.

The Divisional Committee have little to record except the steady progress and increasing usefulness of the two libraries. At the November Meeting of the Council no change was made in the Committee, all the old members being unanimously re-elected. The Committee elected Councillor W. J. Harrison as their Chairman in place of the Rev. W. Reed, M.A., who had occupied the chair for the last two years. During the year 614 new books have been purchased and 407 replacements made for the West Hill Library, and 392 and 35 respectively-for the Allfarthing Lane Branch. In making additions the Committee have paid special attention to the supply of Technical, Musical, and Topographical works. The stock of books at West Hill Library now consists of 17,000 volumes. At Allfarthing Lane Branch there are now 2,680 volumes, an increase of 392 during the year. The number of readers' tickets available at West Hill on March 31st, 1902, was 2,111, as against 2,450 the previous year; at Allfarthing Lane 1,864, as against 1,699 the previous year. The issue of books at West Hill has reached 51,577, an increase of 4,408 on that of 1902; and that at Allfarthing Lane has been 39,009, an increase of 1,720. Fiction is still chief favourite among the different classes of books issued, the number at West Hill being 35,697 out of the total 51,577, and that at Allfarthing Lane, 26,727, out of 39,009. Next comes Juvenile Literature, the issues being 7,277 and 6,616 39 at the two Libraries, showing a slight increase. After these the most popular are C (History, Voyages and Travels), of which 2,106 and 1,018 volumes have been issued, an increase of over 26 per cent. over the previous year; and class E (Art, Science and Natural History), in which the issues have been 3,143, against 2,356 in the previous year, or an increase of over 33 per cent. These figures are the most satisfactory feature in the report, especially if they are compared with the increase in class F (Fiction), which is only 7 per cent. It should also be borne in mind that the issues of Fiction and other light literature are for much shorter periods than those of higher and more substantial works. The Committee has, by request, considered the question of "blacking out" all betting news in the newspapers supplied to the Libraries, but see no reason to do so. A Hand List of books added since 1896 has been issued. The supplemental volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica have been supplied to both Libraries and are much appreciated. The Committee have to thank the following donors for gifts of books, &c„ to the Libraries: — For West Hill—The British Museum, 3 vols.; Mr. and Mrs. Carter, 28 vols.; Mr. E. T. East 4 vols.; Miss Franc, 21 vols.; Councillor Lancaster, J.P., 2 vols.; Dr. LongstafT, a large number; a Member of the Rationalist Press Association, 2 vols.; Rationalist Press Association, 6 vols.; Mr. Rogers, 3 vols.; Stephens & Mackintosh (Leicester), 2 vols ; also Captain Adams, Mrs. Brown, Mr. T. J. W. Buckley, Mrs. Bull, Mr. Burgoyne, Miss Hales, Councillor Hennell, the Town Clerk, and others, one volume each. For Allfarthing Lane—Mrs. Armour, 2 vols.; Rev. F. Austin, 6 vols.; Mr. Beck, 2 vols.; Councillor Harrison, 6 vols.; Miss Jameson, 8 vols.; Mr. S. W. Proverbs, 27 vols.; Rationalist Press Association, 8 vols.; Miss Cook and Mr. F. Gould, 1 vol. each. Also for both Libraries a large number of Reports from various Public Libraries. 40 The Mayor (Councillor Lancaster, J.P.) has presented a medal commemorative of the Coronation, in a suitable frame, and it has been fixed in the Reference Library at West Hill. The Council has made such arrangements as to the insurance of the Libraries and their contents as to coVer all liability from loss by fire. The question of right of light at the back of the Library at West Hill has been referred to the Solicitor and he is of opinion that the Council's interests are sufficiently safeguarded in the existing deeds. The new Rules and Regulations for the Libraries came intc force on February 2nd and an abstract of the same has beer placed in each book in the Libraries. W. J.

To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Borough Council. Sir, and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1902. Population. The population of the Borough in the middle of the year 1902, estimated in the usual way was, including the public institutions in the Borough, 245,803. That this closely approximates to the actual population is shown by the fact that the estimated population based on the number of inhabited houses in 1902 multiplied by the average number of persons per house at the Census of 1901 was 246,282. The following Table shows the population for the Borough, estimated by both methods for the five parishes for the year, but as the population estimated in the usual way is used in calculating the rates for the year, that only is corrected for public institutions. 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I. PARISH. Census 1901. Population estimated to the middle of 1902. Population estimated from number of Inhabited Houses Corrected. Uncorrected. CLAPHAM 51,361 52,800 52,526 54.356 PUTNEY 24,139 25,200 25,126 25,264 STREATHAM 71,658 76,300 76,800 77,40 TOOTING 16,473 18,600 20,064 19,182 WANDSWORTH 68,403 67,900 71,284 70,079 WHOLE BOROUGH 232,034 240,800 245,800 246,282 The public institutions in the Borough are as follows:— Clapham:—Hostel of God. PUTNEY:—The Priory, Roehampton. streatham:—St. Anne's Home. (St Pancras parish). Lunatic Asylum, (part of). TOOTING:—Tooting Home. Fairfield House. (Chelsea parish) Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals— The Fountain and The Grove. Newlands Asylum. Wandsworth:—The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Northlands Home for Inebriates Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum. H.M. Prison. The total population of these institutions was 6,127, but as a considerable number of the inmates of the Tooting Home, The Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to the Borough, a deduction of 5,000 made from the uncorrected total will give approximately the corrected population of the Borough, viz.:—240,800, compared with a corrected popu lation of 228,702 in 1901. 5 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The year 1902 for statistical purposes consisted of 53 weeks, ending the 3rd January, 1903, and all the rates are calculated on a 53 weeks' population, so that an exact comparison can be made with previous years. Births. During the 53 weeks 6,440 births, 3,259 of males and 3,181 of females were registered, compared with 6,107 in 1901. and 5,754 in 1900. In Table II. is shown the number of births in each parish as well as the birth-rates and rate of natural increase. 152 births occurred in the Wandsworth Workhouse, compared with 134 in 1901. Of these 53 belonged to Battersea, 20 to Clapham, 5 to Putney, 14 to Streatham, 7 to Tooting, and 43 to Wandsworth. TABLE 11. Births. Rates. Sub-Districts. Males. Females. Total. Birth-Rate Rate of natural increase. Clapham 661 633 1,294 24.10 9.95 Putney 278 281 559 21.83 7.62 Streatham 860 882 1.742 22.46 10.89 Tooting 324 318 642 33.95 20.10 Wandsworth 1,136 1,067 2,203 31.92 17.16 Whole Borough 3,259 3,181 6,440 26.31 12.88 The birth-rate for the year was 26.31 per 1,000, an increase of .29 per 1,000 compared with 1901, and .52 per 1,000 above the mean for the 10 years 1892-1901. Only one year in the decennium, viz.:—1893, had a higher birth-rate. If the births occurring in the Workhouse of children whose parents belong to the Borough of Battersea be deducted, the birthrate would only be 26 09 per 1,000. 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. That the birth-rate should show an increase might be expected, owing to the growth of the Borough, and specially owing to the increasing number of houses for the working classes, in whom the birth-rate is always higher than among the well-to-do. It is disappointing nevertheless to find that this increase is not greater. If we look at the birth-rate in the separate parishes it will be seen that Tooting has a very high birth-rate, viz.:—33.95 per 1,000, and Wandsworth a rate of 31.92, while Putney has a rate of only 21 .83 per 1,000. These rates show conclusively that the birth-rates depend largely on the constitution of the population as regards social position. The birth-rate in the County of London for the year was 28.36, and for England and Wales 28.6 per 1,000. The natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths was 12 88, compared with 12.69 in 1901, and 1158 the average for the last ten years. Deaths. In the 53 weeks which make up the year 3,209 deaths, 1,606 of males and 1,603 of females, were registered in the Borough, compared with 3,009 in the 52 weeks which made up the year 1901. To compare this number with previous years and with the average for the last ten years allowance must be made for the extra seven days, and if this is done the total number of uncorrected deaths becomes 3,148, compared with 3,009 in 1901, and 3,142 in 1900. This number is 220 less than the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate was I2.84, compared with 12 82 in 1901, 14 in 1900, and I3'8 the average for the previous ten years. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in out-lying institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in public institutions of persons not belonging thereto, whose domicile was in other parts of London. 7 Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of corrected deaths was 3,304 in the 53 weeks, or 3,251 when corrected for the additional week. In 1901 the number of corrected deaths was 3,116, in 1900, 3,200, and the average for the ten years 1892-1901 was, corrected for increase of population, 3,470, or 219 above the year 1902. During the year there occurred in public institutions in the Borough 463 deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough and 24 deaths occurred in other places not institutions. The following Table shows these deaths arranged according to sub-districts, and also the institutions in which the deaths took place. TABLE 111. Name of Public Institutions. Clapham. Putney.

The next Table shows the total number of deaths in the Borough and in each sub-district, corrected and uncorrected, as well as the corrected and uncorrected death-rates. The death-rate in the County of London during the year 1902 was 17 2 per 1,000, compared with 17.1 in 1901, and 18.3 in 1900, while in this Borough the same rate was 13.43 in 1902, 13.33 in 1901, and 14.67 in 1900. The death-rate in England and Wales from all causes in the year 1902 was 16.3, in the 76 great towns 17.4, and in the 103 smaller towns 15.3 per 1,000. To compare more correctly the death-rate of this Borough with the same rate in England and Wales a correction has to be made for age and sex distribution of the population. In the decennium ending 1891 the factor for correction was 1068, but a considerable alteration has taken place in these in the decennium ending 1901, and the factor has been ascertained to be 1.043, by which the corrected death-rate must be multiplied. This gives a rate of 14.00 per 1,000 or 2.3 less than the death-rate for England and Wales for the year 1902. In the various Boroughs in the County of London the deathrate for the year varied considerably, the lowest rates being 10.8 in Hampstead, 13.4 in Stoke Newington, 13.43 in wandsworth, 13.6 in Lewisham, 14.6 in Paddington, and 15.0 in Hackney and Battersea, while the highest rates were, 20.8 in Bethnal Green and Bermondsay, 21.3 in Holborn, 21.4 in Southwark, and 22.9 in Finsbury. 9 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate was, during the year, highest in Wandsworth and lowest in Streatham. The death-rate in Putney shows a decided increase of deaths from Measles, Influenza, Acute Bronchitis, and all other causes, although the deaths from Diphtheria were eight compared with four in 1901. The Tooting death-rate shows a satisfactory decrease due largely to the diminution in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea. Clapham and Streatham show a lower rate than 1901, but Wandsworth has increased from 13.61 to 14.76 per 1,000. The above rates are not calculated on the same population as shown in Table VI., as the number of non-residents in institutions in the Borough is deducted. Table IV. is therefore a more exact statement of the number of deaths in the Borough and also of the corrected death-rate. The chart shows the annual death-rate during each week of the year for the whole of London, and the annual death-rate for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. A comparison of the two curves shows that the death-rate for the Borough was considerably lower than for the whole of London during the year, but to a very large extent the rise and fall of the two curves correspond during the whole year. A comparison with this and the curves for the County of London and the Borough for the previous years shows considerable difference in the months of July, August, and September. This was due chiefly to the decrease in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea in infants. The increase in the death-rate in February and March was partially due to the number of deaths from Small-pox.

In the next Table the number of deaths in institutions outside the Borough is given in detail, but a complete list of these institutions, with the number of deaths that occurred in each during the year, is given after Table I. of the Local Government Board's Tables. As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other Parishes in the Borough in institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in internal institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham ; Tooting Home, and the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Wandsworth. 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE V.

The total number of deaths in out-lying public institutions was 582, compared with 543 in 1901. 0 Of these, 264 occurred in the Union Infirmary, 260 in General and Special Hospitals, 23 in the Small-pox Hospital, and 18 in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals. There were also 17 deaths of Borough residents in other places not public institutions outside the Borough, three of which occurred in the River Thames. These are included in the Table under the head of General and Special Hospitals, etc. In 1901 only 15 deaths occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals outside the Borough, compared with 41 in 1902, but the increase is largely due to the fact that 24 deaths occurred from Small-pox, compared with only three in 1901. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. It is important to note that all rates per I,OOO in these Tables for the year 1902 are lessened by the fraction so as to compare more exactly with the previous decennium. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and for the ten preceding years ; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. The nett deaths in the Table do not correspond with the number in Table IV. as 24 deaths belonging to other places which did not occur in public institutions have to be deducted, giving an absolute nett number of 3,304, and a death-rate of 13.43 per 1,000. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various sub-districts. It also shows these for each year since 1891, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last ten years. 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to Hospital. Table IV. is the general mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in public institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. 15 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The percentage of deaths from one to five years was higher than in 1901. Infantile Death-rate. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in the Borough was 809, 162 in Clapham, 72 in Putney, 193 in Streatham, 81 in Tooting, and 301 in Wandsworth. The infantile death-rate calculated per 1,000 births was 126, compared with 133 in 1901, and 143 in 1900. The following Table shows the number of deaths in each subdistrict, the percentage to total deaths, the death-rate per 1,ooc registered births, as well as the totals for the whole Borough. 21 Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health.

Clapham, Streatham, and Tooting show a decrease, and Putney and Wandsworth an increase compared with the previous year. The decrease in the Tooting rate is very noticeable, and is largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Diarrhcea, only 11 death's having occurred from that disease in children under one year of age compared with 26 in 1901. The rate of infantile mortality compares very favourably with the other London Boroughs, six of these Boroughs having a lower, and 22 a higher rate. The lowest rate was Hampstead 87, and the highest Shoreditch 174, while for all London the rate was 139 per 1,000 births. The percentage of deaths under one year to total deaths was 24.31, compared with 26.07 in 1901. Putney had the lowest percentage, viz.:—19, and Tooting the highest, viz:—-30.9. The infantile mortality was on the whole lower all over the Metropolis during the year owing to the fact that the temperature kept low during the months of July and August, when Diarrhoea is at its maximum. 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The next Table shows the number of deaths from these diseases during the year and for the 10 previous years.

During the year 1902, zymotic diseases, with the exception of Diarrhoea, were very prevalent, and the causes of the increase will be described under the individual diseases. 535 deaths occurred from these, an increase of 109 compared with 1901, but 72.8 below the corrected decennial average. Small Pox was the cause of 26 deaths, compared with three in the year previous, and Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever, although higher than last year, yet are somewhat below the decennial average. Enteric Fever, Measles, and other Zymotic Diseases are above, while Whooping Cough, Influenza, and Diarrhoea are below the average. The death-rate per 1,000 from all these zymotic diseases was 2 . 18, compared with 1. 81 in 1901, 2 .12 in 1900, and 2.6 in 1899. The death-rate from the principal zymotic diseases, viz.:— Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea, was 1.68 per 1,000, compared with 1.55 in 1901. In the County of London the rate was 2.21. The mortality from these diseases shows considerable variation in the different Boroughs comprising the County of London, Hampstead being lowest with .81, Shoreditch the highest with 3.53, while this Borough is seventh on the list. In out-lying institutions 69 deaths from these zymotic diseases occurred during the year, (20 to Clapham, four to Putney, 11 to Streatham, seven to Tooting, and 27 to Wandsworth). In the year previous only 51 deaths occurred, but the increase is more than accounted for by the number of deaths from Small Pox, viz.:—25, compared with three in 1901. Of these 12 occurred in the Union Infirmary, two from Measles, two from Whooping Cough, two from Diarrhoea, and six from Erysipelas; 17 in General and Special Hospitals, one from Smallpox in Banstead Asylum, two from Influenza, three from Enteric 24 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Fever, three from Diarrhoea, two from Erysipelas, one from Puerperal Fever, and five from Other Septic Diseases; and 40 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 24 from Small-pox, six from Scarlet Fever, nine from Diphtheria, and one from Enteric Fever. In internal institutions 153 deaths occurred of non-residents in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in Tooting, five from Measles, 67 from Scarlet Fever, 42 from Diphtheria, 35 from Enteric Fever, and two from other Septic Diseases; in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Wandsworth, two from Influenza, and two from Erysipelas; in the Middlesex County Asylum two from Typhoid Fever, and one from Influenza; and one from other Septic Diseases in the Prison, a total of 161, compared with 188 in 1901. The number of deaths in the several sub-districts from these zymotic diseases was 121 in Clapham, 45 in Putney, 137 in Streatham, 49 in Tooting, and 183 in Wandsworth, a total of 535. The next Table shows the death-rate from these diseases including Influenza, for the whole Borough, for the year 1902, as well as for the ten years preceding.

The rate for the whole Borough, although above that for the years 1900 and 1901, is still .55 per 1,000 under the average for the preceding ten years. The rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Wandsworth, but all the sub-districts show an increase compared with 1901, in which year this rate was exceptionally low, with the exception of Tooting, which is .70 per 1,000 under the rate for the previous year. The cause of the increase compared with last year is the increased number of deaths from Small-pox and Influenza, and to some extent of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever. The total number of certificates of cases of infectious diseases received during the year for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts is shown on Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables. The number received in this Borough since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is as follows: — table xv. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 Small-pox 4 ... 29 1 15 1 2 1 ... 4 34 127 Scarlatina 453 887 1256 673 659 983 IOI4 703 894 672 684 1063 Diphtheria 164 242 398 321 266 286 569 581 615 454 466 743 Membranous Croup 8 17 33 22 21 3 7 8 6 6 3 7 Typhus 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

Of Small-pox 127 cases were notified, compared with 31 in 1901 ; of Scarlet Fever 1,063, compared with 684; of Diphtheria, 750, compared with 469 ; of Enteric Fever 139, compared with 96 ; of Puerperal Fever 21, compared with 14; and of Erysipelas 235, compared with 219. Thus there has been a very considerable increase in all the notifiable diseases compared with the previous year, or with any year since notification has been compulsory. The only previous year in which the notifications were over 2,000 was in 1893, when 2,224 were received. Since the 7th February, by an order of the London County Council, Chicken-pox was made notifiable, and from that date to the 31st December, 1,408 cases were notified, although it could hardly be said to be present in epidemic form in any particular part of the Borough. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 9-5, compared with 6-4 in 1901, and 6-7 in 1900. In the several sub-districts the rates were as follows:-—-Clapham 9-5, compared with 71; Putney 5 ■ 6, compared with 3 • 2 ; Streatham 7 • 9, compared with 5 • 3 ; Tooting 13-9, compared with 8 ■ 6 ; and Wandsworth 11 • 1, compared with 7-6. In the County of London this rate was 9-9, compared with 8-8 in 1901. Three cases of Small-pox, six of Scarlet Fever, 20 of Chickenpox, and 20 of Erysipelas were notified from the Workhouse ; two of Scarlet Fever, and three of Enteric Fever from the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum; one of Erysipelas from the Royal Hospital for Incurables ; three of Small-pox and two of Erysipelas from the Prison ; one of Scarlet Fever and four of Erysipelas from the Tooting Home; one of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria from the Fountain Fever Hospital; and five of Scarlet Fever, seven of Diphtheria, and four of Enteric Fever from the Grove Fever Hospital; a total of 83 notifications received from public institutions in the Borough, compared with 54 in 1901.

Another was re-vaccinated on the fifth day, a third on the sixth, and a fourth, an unvaccinated infant, was not vaccinated until nine days after exposure to infection. As soon as a notification was received a telephone message was sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and in nearly all the cases removal was effected within an hour. In one or two cases, owing to fog, the removal was delayed, but in no cases for more than a few hours. The Sanitary Inspector then called at the home, took down all the particulars as to occupation, source of infection, schools and contacts, and also waited for the disinfecting staff, to give instructions as to the amount of disinfection to be carried out. A personal visit was also made by myself in most cases within a few hours, and in a large number of cases before the patient had been removed, for the purpose of ascertaining the source of infection and of supervising personally the arrangements for disinfection, and vaccination of contacts. The name, address, and occupation of all contacts residing in the Borough (880 in number) were noted, and these contacts were visited and re-vaccination advised. The Public Vaccinator was also informed at once, and a copy of the Notification sent to the Vaccination Officer of the District. The name, address, occupation, and place of employment of any contacts residing outside the Borough (103 in number) were forwarded to the Chart shewing the number of cases of Small-pox notified each week during the outbreak 49 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. respective Medical Officers of Health. The names and addresses of 113 contacts were also received from Medical Officers of Health of other Sanitary Districts, such contacts having occurred outside the Borough. All contacts, both with cases inside and outside the Borough, were kept under observation for at least 14 days. In no cases where the advice given was followed did the disease occur, with the exception of the four cases already mentioned, and two of these would not have occurred if re-vaccination had been performed within 12 hours of the visit of one of the Sanitary Staff. In carrying out the above much extra work fell on the Sanitary Department, but I am pleased to be able to report that such work was carried out by the Inspectors, and the Clerical and Disinfecting Staff, fearlessly and conscientiously. All the Staff (23 in number) had been re-vaccinated at the beginning of the outbreak and no case occurred, although all, with the exception of the Clerical Staff, were frequently exposed to the infection in its most virulent form. Shelters. The two Shelters belonging to the Council, one at Putney and the other at Larch Road, Balham, were found in a few of the cases to be invaluable to enable thorough disinfection to be carried out. The Putney Shelter was used on four separate occasions, and was occupied in all 13 days. The Shelter at Larch Road was occupied on six occasions for 28 days. Every time the Shelters were vacated they were thoroughly disinfected and cleansed, and the bedding disinfected by steam. Source of Infection of the Cases. In a large proportion of the cases it was impossible to ascertain the source of infection, as the patients could give no definite account of the places they visited as far back as 14 days. In 30 of the cases the probable source of infection was unknown, while 38 of the cases were infected by previous cases in the same house or in the immediate neighbourhood. This was caused either 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. by refusal to be re-vaccinated, concealment of being in contact, or unrecognised cases. Six cases occurred in one house, five in another, four in three houses, three in three houses, and two in 11 houses. Infection was traced to the following places: —Paris, Smallpox Ships, St. Pancras, Hammersmith, Battersea, Lambeth, City of London, Southwark, Westminster, Finsbury, Bermondsey, St. Thomas's Hospital, and St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Nine of the cases were directly due to infection at the new Small-pox Hospital at Gore Farm, four cases were infected from cases contracted there, and one case was infected by one of the above four ; making a total of 14. All the four secondary cases were infected before notification of the case which caused the infection. In one case, the wife, and in another case, the wife and daughter, were notified, and on visiting the house I found that the husband in each case was suffering from a mild attack, and both were removed to Hospital. In addition to visiting the majority of the cases of Small-pox personally, at the beginning of the outbreak especially, I visited in consultation with the Medical Attendants, a large number of suspected cases for the purpose of confirming or negativing the diagnosis of Small-pox. As the majority of medical men practising in' the Borough had had no opportunity of seeing cases of Small-pox, it is surprising that more mistakes in diagnosis did not occur. Notification of Chicken-pox. In January, 1902, the London County Council made an Order under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, making Chicken-pox notifiable from February 7th, 1902, and this was extended to November 7th by a further Order in April, 1902. During the seven months ending September 7th, 822 cases were notified, and the following Table shows the total number notified at all ages, and at certain groups of ages during each month notification was in force. 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Special enquiry was made in all cases of Chicken-pox notified as occurring in persons over 15 years of age, as that disease is rare in adult life. TABLE XXI.

Two of these would certainly have been diagnosed as Small-pox within a day or two of their being notified as Chicken-pox, but two would in all probability have escaped notice until a secondary group of cases arose. Fortunately I was personally able to visit all four cases and diagnose Small-pox in time to prevent any further spread. Examination of Children in Public Schools. On examining the returns of the Vaccination Officers it was found that some parts of the Borough showed a higher proportion of unvaccinated children than others, and I advised that in those parts the examination of the arms of children in schools would be advantageous. The examination was carried out in 20 schools, and the result is contained in a special report made to the Council on March 24th, 1902, and which is appended to the Report. 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Number of Re-vaccinations. The total number of re-vaccinations performed during the outbreak cannot be definitely ascertained except in the case of the Public Vaccinators for the several districts in the Borough. Up to the end of August 13,685 re-vaccinations were recorded by these, and from enquiries sent to the other medical men practising in the Borough I have ascertained that nearly 15,000 were performed. The latter figure does not at all adequately represent the amount of re-vaccinations, as only about one-third of the medical men to whom a circular letter was sent replied, and large numbers of adults were re-vaccinated by practitioners residing outside this Borough. Cost of the Outbreak. The total cost of dealing with this Outbreak, as far as this Council was concerned, was £515 : 8 : i, made up as follows : — £ s. d.

This is doubtless due to three main factors: —- (1) To the large amount of re-vaccination performed. (2) To the constitution of the population. (3) To the methods adopted and carried out by the Sanitary Staff of the Borough. 54 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In October, 1901, I made the following report to the Public Health Committee, and the 1901 returns show no alteration with respect to the percentage of vaccination in the several sub-districts, Clapham and Streatham (including Tooting), still showing the lowest percentage of vaccinations and highest percentage of persons unaccounted for 10th October, 1901. To THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen,— I have obtained from the Clerk to the Guardians the Vaccination statistics for this Borough for the years 1899 and 1900, and, from an examination of these I find that there is considerable difference in the amount of successful vaccination in the parishes in the Borough. In the parish of Clapham of the births returned to the Vaccination Officer in the year 1897, 57.7 per cent, were successfully vaccinated, and 21.2 per cent, were not accounted for. In the parish of Putney the percentages were respectively, 72 and 3'2. In the parishes of Streatham and Tooting 61 and 6.3, and in the parish of Wandsworth 75.5 and 6 per cent. In the year 1900, of the births returned in the parish of Clapham 57 per cent, were successfully vaccinated, and 29 per cent, were unaccounted for; in the parish of Putney, 70 and 4.7; in the parishes of Streatham and Tooting 61 and 8.1; and in the parish of Wandsworth, 72 and 6.5. These figures show that in the parish of Clapham there are a larger number of unvaccinated children than in the other parishes of the Borough, and I am of opinion that this Committee should recommend to the Council to call the attention of the Guardians and of the Local Government Board to this fact. I remain, GENTLEMEN, Your obedient servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In consequence of this I advised the Council to obtain the consent of the School Board for London, and also of the Managers of the other Public Day Schools in the parishes of Clapham, part of Streatham and Tooting, to have an examination of the arms of the children made so as to ascertain the percentage of unvaccinated children attending school. The result of this examination is contained in a report which was presented to the Public Health Committee in March, 1902, and which is here inserted. Report of the Medical Officer of Health on the Examination of the arms of Children attending schools in Clapham, Balham & Tooting. To THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen,— I have to report the results of the examination of the arms of the children in the elementary schools in Clapham, Balham, and Tooting, these localities being considered from an examination of the returns of the Vaccination Officer, those in which the highest proportion of unvaccinated children in the Borough existed. In all, 20 schools were examined, 13 of these being Board, 6 Church, and 1 Roman Catholic school. The total number of children on the roll of these schools was 16,142, but it was found impossible to separate the boys from the girls in some schools, so that in the Tables which are given only the totals are stated. Of these 16,142 children the parents of 5,212, or 32.28 per cent., refused to allow the inspection to be made. It is to be regretted that so many parents objected, as to some extent these refusals lessen the value of the results obtained. It is almost certain that the percentage of unvaccinated among the objectors would be found to be greater than among those examined, so that the percentage of unvaccinated to those examined may be taken as a minimum, and that if all the 16,142 had been examined this percentage would have been higher. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In addition to the 5,212 objectors, 1,943 children, or 12.16 per cent, were absent from illness or other causes on the day of examination, leaving a total of 8,967, or 55.55 per cent., examined. In the Board Schools the lowest percentage of objectors, viz.: 21.92, was in Bonneville Road School, and the highest, viz.: 40.82, in Smallwood Road School; while in Church Schools the lowest percentage was 7.84, in St. Nicholas, Tooting, and the highest 28.20, in Christchurch School, Clapham. The Roman Catholic School had the highest percentage of all, viz.: 46. 22. Out of the total number of children examined, viz.8,967, 1,138 (or 12.69 per cent.), were found to be unvaccinated, and from an examination of the Tables it will be seen that the percentage of unvaccinated varies considerably in different schools. Among the Board Schools the lowest percentage of unvaccinated children, viz.: 5.35, was found in Bonneville Road School, and the highest, 17.04, in New Road School, Clapham. Among the Church Schools the lowest, 5.15, was found in St. Mary's School, Balham, and the highest, 32.35, in St. James', White Square, Clapham. St. Mary's Roman Catholic Schools, Clapham, also showed a high percentage, viz.: 25.67. In my report to the Council on the percentage of unvaccinated children in Clapham, as compared with other parts of the Borough, it was stated that 21.2 per cent, of the children in that parish were unaccounted for in the Vaccination Officer's return. The results of this inspection confirm this statement. In Clapham the percentage of unvaccinated children attending school was found to be above the average of the 20 schools in New Road, St. Paul's, Christchurch, St. James', White Square, St. Mary's Roman Catholic, and Cavendish Road, and below the average in St. Andrew's Street, Larkhall Lane, Wirtemberg Street, Clapham Parochial, Haselrigge Road, Bonneville Road, and New Park Road. In Balham and Tooting the schools above the average were Smallwood Road, Ensham Street, St. Nicholas, Broadwater Road, and Tooting Graveney, while Fircroft Road, and St. Mary's, Balham, were below the average. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table 24 shows the number and percentage of children found unvaccinated at the different years in each of the schools examined. The total unvaccinated at all ages is as already stated 12.69, and this Table shows that from 3 to 8 years the percentage is above this, and from 9 to 16 years it is below. It is noteworthy that the percentage of unvaccinated is highest at the lowest age, and this agrees with the returns of the Vaccination Officer, viz.: —that the percentage of children unvaccinated has, in this Borough as well as in London generally, increased during the last 10 years. The lowest percentage (excluding ages 15 and 16) occurred at 12 years. The total number of children showing marks of re-vaccination was 742, or 8.27 per cent, of the number examined. The percentage of re-vaccinated varies greatly in the different schools, the lowest being Ensham Street, 86, and the highest St. Mary's, Balham, 24.32. In the latter this shows that nearly onefourth of the children examined had been recently re-vaccinated. The names and addresses of all the unvaccinated children have been sent to the Vaccination Officer of the district in which they reside. In the case of children not resident in this Borough, of which there are a large number, the list of unvaccinated has been sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough in which they reside. I have been informed that a large proportion of the children have been visited by the several Public Vaccinators and re-vaccinated, but sufficient time has not elapsed to enable me to prepare statistics on the re-vaccination of these children. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The vaccination of infants therefore shows a satisfactory increase The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births for the Eorough and for the four vaccination subdistricts, for the year, as well as for the preceding ten years. The average for these ten years is also given. In 1891 the percentage was highest, viz.:—77.7, and its lowest in 1898, viz.:—62. The parish of Clapham shows the greatest decrease, being 76.7 in 1892 and only 51. 1 in 1898. The average for the ten years was lowest in Clapham, viz.: — 65.1, and highest in Wandsworth, 77.3. Comparing the percentage vaccinated in 1901 with the ten years previous, it must be seen that Clapham is still under the 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. average,but the others are above, the parish of Putney showing a higher percentage of successful vaccinations than in any of the ten years previous. The percentage in the Borough was higher in 1901 than it has been since 1894, and it is to be hoped that the statistics of 1902 when these are available will show a still greater increase in the percentage of successful vaccinations.

Scarlet Fever. During the year 1,063 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, compared with 684 in 1901, and 672 in 1900. 24 deaths occurred, compared with 15 in 1901, and 16 in 1900. Four of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, nine in Streatham, none in Tooting, and nine in Wandsworth. 798 of the cases, or 75 per cent., were removed to Hospital where 20 died, and 265, or 25 per cent., were kept at home with four deaths. The percentage of cases removed to Hospital is a little above that for the previous year, when 70.6 per cent, were removed. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total fatality during the year was still low, being only 2'2 per cent, the fatality in Hospital treated cases being 2.5 per cent., and among those treated at home 15 per cent. The fatality in 1901 was, in Hospital treated cases 2.19 per cent., and among those treated at home '99 per cent. The proportion of notified cases per 1,000 of population was 44, compared with 2.91, and in the County of London 3'8 or .6 per 1,000 under the rate for this Borough. in the separate sub-districts the annual rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living was as follows for the year and for the two previous years : — TABLE XXIX.

The death-rate per 1,000 living was .9, compared with .06 in 1901, while the death-rate for London was .12 per 1,000, compared with .12 in 1901. The prevalence of the disease during the year was due to the fact that a very considerable number of cases were of so mild a type that no medical man was called in until desquamation was observed, or other cases occurred in the house. 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The rash in many cases did not remain out more than 48 hours, and consequently cases were allowed to mix with other children, both in school and in the street, while in an infective condition. A study of the chart showing the number of cases notified shows that there was considerable difference in the number of cases notified during the 52 weeks. The maximum number of cases occurred in the week ending the 8th November, when 43 cases were notified. During that week and also during the weeks ending the 1st and 15th November Scarlet Fever was prevalent in all parts of the Borough, but more especially in Clapham, Streatham, and Wandsworth. The average weekly notifications were slightly over 20, and in 24 weeks the notification received were above, and in 28 weeks below this average. Chart showing the number of notifications of Scarlet Fever received during each week of the year 1902. 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. These diseases, which are now classed as one, were exceptionally prevalent during the year, but more especially in October and November. The number of notifications received, 750, was the largest received since notification was compulsory, and compares unfavourably with the two preceding years, when only 454 and 456 respectively were notified. The number of cases notified is 210 above the corrected average for the last 10 years. The largest number of notifications were received from the parish of Wandsworth, and the fewest from Tooting. 555, or 74 per cent, of the cases were removed to Hospital, with 49 deaths, and 195 cases, or 26 per cent., were treated at home with 21 deaths. There is a slight decrease in the percentage of cases removed to Hospital, compared with 1901, and a corresponding increase in the number of cases treated at home. The case mortality was 9.3 per cent., compared with 8.9 per cent, in 1901. The case mortality for all London, for the year, was 10.7, compared with 10.9 in 1901. The case mortality among those Hospital treated cases was 8.8 per cent., and l0.8 among those treated at home.

The cases in Tooting include those notified from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals and these numbered 15, reducing the Tooting case-rate to 4.0 instead of 4. 8. The death-rate in the Borough, .29, is lower than the average for the last ten years, but is .04 above that for the whole of London for 1902. In the separate sub-districts this rate was above the ten years average in Putney and Tooting, and below it in Clapham, Streatham, and Wandsworth. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The chart showing the number of cases notified in each week of the year shows two maxima in the months of October and November. This was due chiefly to three outbreaks of the disease, two in Wandsworth, and the other in Clapham and part in Balham. During the year 32 cases were notified among children attending St. Anne's School, Wandsworth, four in January, two in February, 11 in March,three in April, seven in May, one in June, one in September, two in October, and one in December. The greatest number of cases occurred in March, and on several occasions I visited the school for the purposes of ascertaining if there was anything in the condition of the school which would account for the excessive prevalence of Diphtheria. The Infants Department was chiefly affected, but personal infection in school did not seem to be causing the spread of the disease, as in only a few cases did the children affected sit near one another. The children attending this school all come from a circumscribed locality, and there were ample opportunities of infection other than in school hours. There are no open spaces in this locality, and the children after school hours play in the streets, and several cases were infected in this way. Of the 32 cases only one proved fatal. In none of the other schools in the district was there any outbreak of the disease, with the exception of two, one in the Swaffield Road Board School, Wandsworth, and one in Cavendish Road Board School, in the parish of Clapham. The outbreak in the parish of Wandsworth occurred chiefly in the Springfield Ward, and was confined to children attending Swaffield Road Board School. This school is a large one and had, up to this outbreak, been very free from infectious disease, and especially Diphtheria, but in October and November 34 cases were notified among children attending the school. 25 of the cases were females, and only nine males. The first case was notified on the 9th October, the child having been at school last on the 3rd. This case, although the first notified, was not the first actual case, but it was not till the 27th Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 69 October that the cause of the first series of cases was discovered. On that date in consequence of inquiries as to school absentees I received information that three children in one family were suffering from sore throat, and I ascertained that one of them had been ill since the 2nd, and that he had been at school in the Infants Department on that date. His sister, however, was allowed to attend school till the 13th, and she had suffered from sore throat since the 6th October. Another unrecognised case was the cause of a second series of cases, the girl having been taken ill on the 13th October, and although she was not at school from the 13th to the 20th she returned on the latter date and was at school while she was still in an infective condition till the 27th. A third unrecognised case was notified on the 6th November, having been taken ill on the 12th October, but this case only infected other three children in the same house, as it did not go to school after the first symptoms appeared. Of the 34 cases four occurred in one household, three cases in three households, and two cases in one household. The following Table shows the number of cases, the age, the last date patient was at school, the standard, and the date of the first symptoms. 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXI.

Three class-rooms, the hall, and two cloak-rooms were thoroughly disinfected by the Sanitary Staff. Only five cases of Diphtheria occurred among children attending this school during the rest of the year. From the onset of this outbreak, I was of opinion that it was due to some unrecognised 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 71 cases, and the means taken to find out these were successful in discovering cases which would not otherwise have been notified, at least till secondary cases occurred. Instructions were given to the teachers to exclude all cases of sore throat from school, and one of the Sanitary Staff called at the school each morning to get a list of absentees. These absentees were visited and the cause of absence ascertained. If sore throat was the cause the parents were advised to call in a medical man, and a swab was forwarded to the medical attendant so that a speedy diagnosis could be made. The school was not closed for any prolonged period, but careful watch was kept on all absentees, and any suspicious cases at once visited. The outbreak was practically at an end on the 17th November, as out of the five other cases notified after that date three were secondary. The noticeable feature of this outbreak was that out of the 34 cases no deaths occurred, and it is certain that in all the cases the diagnosis was correct. The third outbreak, which occurred in Clapham, also affected to some extent the Balham Ward, and was of especial importance, as the majority of the cases occurred on the Hyde Farm Estate, a locality in which Diphtheria had been prevalent to some extent since 1899, and which had already been the subject of special investigation. During the year 70 cases of Diphtheria occurred among children attending Cavendish Road Board School, one in January, four in February, one in April, three in May, six in July, two in August, 13 in September, seven in October, 25 in November, and eight in December. Of the 70 cases, 28 resided in Balham, and 42 in Clapham. In November, when the cases were most numerous, special inquiry was made, and as 19 of these cases occurred on the Hyde Farm Estate, attention was directed to that locality to ascertain if there were any local conditions that favoured the spread of the disease. 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. With reference to eases attending school the following list shows the number of cases from the 7th November, the class in school, and the date of the first symptoms. The Infants Department being specially affected this Department was closed on my recommendation by the Medical Officer to the School Board for London from the 28th November to the 15th December. The school was during that period thoroughly disinfected by the Sanitary Staff. TABLE XXXII. Cavendish Road Board School. No. Date Name. Age. Last day at School. Class. Date of First Symptoms.

Eight cases were notified after the closing of the school up to the 31st December, but five of these were possibly infected previously. The sanitary condition of the school is all that could be desired, but the school itself is built on a site similar to that on which the rest of the houses on the Hyde Farm Estate were erected. During the year 1902, 69 cases of Diphtheria were notified from the Hyde farm area, 42 being of children attending Cavendish Road School, and 27 of persons above or below school age. 27 cases occurred in Hydethorpe Road, 15 in Scholars Road, 17 in Pentney Road, two in Haverhill Road, seven in Cambray Road, and one in that part of Cavendish Road on this estate. Eight cases occurred in one household, five in another, four in three households, two in 10 households, and one case in 42 households. The following report was made to the Public Health Committee on the 6th November, but after that date 41 cases were notified. The report of the Surveyor of the Eastern District is also given. Report on the prevalence of Diphtheria on the Hyde Farm Estate. During the present year 28 cases of Diphtheria have been notified from houses on the Hyde Farm Estate, in the parish of Clapham, and as the houses are new and the sanitary arrangements thoroughly satisfactory it is necessary to look for some other cause than the unsanitary condition of the premises for the prevalence of the disease. This neighbourhood has, since the estate was opened up for building purposes in 1896, always had a bad Diphtheria record. 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In 1899, 22 cases were notified; in 1900, 17; in 1901, 20; and in 1902, up to the present time, 28. During that time the population has largely increased, being estimated at 1,100 in 1899, and about 4,000 in 1902. A large number of houses are still being built, which will probably accommodate about another 3,000. In consequence of this prevalence in 1899 the Medical Officer of Health for Clapham made a special report, which is published in his Annual Report for that year. I quite agree with the conclusions arrived at by him, but I would emphasise the fact stated in that report, that the wetness of the soil is no doubt one of the chief causes of this undue prevalence of Diphtheria. The Sanitary Inspector who supervised the sanitary work on this estate, and who was acquainted with all the local conditions before the houses were erected, reports that the surface of the land between Cavendish Road and Hydethorpe Road, was during the winter months and rainy weather, continuously under water, and that the subsoil was composed of a wet spongy clay and full of water. No attempt was made to drain the soil, but one old 6-inch drain, forming the boundary between Clapham and Streatham in Cavendish Road, was picked up and connected to the new drain. With reference to the concreting of the surface on which the houses are built, in 1899 an examination was made and the floors of several houses taken up. It was then ascertained that the concrete in the houses in Scholars Road was of poor quality and only about two inches thick, but this was afterwards remedied by the builder. Floors were also taken up in some of the houses in Pentney Road and Hydethorpe Road, but in these the concrete was found to be satisfactory. The yards were all paved about 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet wide along the back addition, except in the case of some of the flats, which are paved only along the width of the back addition, 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. About the centre of the estate there was an old cycle track which had been made of ashes and cinders, and some of this was screened and used with other material for mortar and concrete. The concrete now being used in the houses at present in course of construction seems to be satisfactory. After careful consideration of all the facts and also after examination of the returns of some of the other Metropolitan Boroughs, I have come to the conclusion that in houses built upon a wet soil which contains a large portion of organic matter, cases of Diphtheria may be looked for, the germ existing in the superficial layers of the soil. It is probable that the infection is conveyed to the mouth by the hands of the children playing with this soil, and consequent infection from person to person. It is desirable that more stringent legislation should be made against the building of houses on sites which are damp and which have been heavily manured, until such site has been thoroughly drained and the organic matter destroyed or rendered innocuous. Report of the Surveyor for the Eastern District. " When first asked to report on this matter, it occurred to me that possibly the surface sewer ventilators, as to which there have been complaints from time to time, might be partially responsible for the prevalence of the disease, but, on comparing the 'Spot' map prepared by the Medical Officer of Health with a plan showing all sewers and drains on the estate, I cannot trace any connection between the two. "Every care is being taken to prevent obnoxious emanations from the surface ventilators. Some time ago, on complaint by a builder, I recommended him to take out the stoppers of the interceptors on the main combined drains (from which the separate house drains are cut off by intercepting traps') in order that the upcast shafts at the upper ends of such combined drains might act as ventilators for the sewers in the streets, this having been successfully tried on another estate in Streatham. He did so and shortly afterwards informed me that there was no longer any offensive smell from the gratings in that particular road. The 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 'Spot' map, however, shows that this part of the estate has not enjoyed a greater freedom from the disease than the remainder. The only cause which can be found is the one mentioned by the Medical Officer of Health in his report on the matter." Of the 69 cases notified only three were fatal, one male and two females, of three and five years of age respectively. This gives a case mortality of 4.3 per cent. only, compared with a case mortality of 9.3 in the whole Borough. Unrecognised cases in this outbreak were responsible for a large proportion of the cases. In the house where eight cases occurred one unrecognised case infected the others, and it was only by a bacteriological examination after a second case occurred that the original case was detected. In several of the cases the diagnosis was made only after bacteriological examination. In any further outbreaks it will be advisable to have the throats of all children in school examined and swabs taken for bacteriological examination, but this is a step which could only be taken if the outbreak was serious and the sanction and approval of the School Board obtained. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the respective schools. In the Borough as a whole, of 750 cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup, 342, or 45.6 per cent., did not attend any school, either above or below the school age, leaving 408, or 54.4 per cent., cases of children at school. In Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables it will be seen that 375 of the cases occurred at ages five to 15, the theoretical school ages. A large number of children, however, attend school who are under five years of age. Whether this is a desirable thing either from an educational or sanitary point of view is a matter of opinion, although recent educational statistics show that at least from an educational point of view nothing is gained by the attendance of children under five years of age. 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From a sanitary point of view it is not desirable that children of five and four years should be grouped together in large numbers, as at these ages infectious diseases are more common, and the children more susceptible.

This Borough, during the ten years had a comparative caserate of 81 and was the lowest case-rate of any of the Boroughs south of the River Thames, although there are nine Boroughs on the north side with a lower case-rate, Diphtheria. Comparative Case Rates in Metropolitan Boroughs, Average of 10Years, 1892 1901. London Case Rate taken as 100. 79 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 48 cases of Scarlet Fever and eight of Diphtheria occurred after the return of a case from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals compared with 19 of Scarlet Fever and five of Diphtheria in 1901. The subject of return cases is at present being exhaustively dealt with by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but the report of the Investigator specially appointed has not yet been published. Of the cases of Scarlet Fever, nine occurred in the parish of Clapham, four in Putney, 14 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 14 in Wandsworth. Of the cases of Diphtheria, one occurred in Putney, three in Streatham, one in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth Two cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in one house in the parishes of Clapham and Putney, three cases in one house in Tooting, and two cases in two houses in Wandsworth. All the return cases of Diphtheria were single ones. There has been no definite outbreak traceable to this cause, although in the aggregate the number of these cases shows a considerable increase compared with previous years. As to the cause of return cases, in only a small percentage could it be said that the patients had anything wrong when a visit was made on the occasion of the second case. In the case of Scarlet Fever a few had discharge from nose or ears, and this seemed on inquiry to have been observed not immediately, but some days after discharge from hospital. In one or two cases complaint was made that the patients when returned from hospital were still desquamating, but the present opinion with regard to desquamation in Scarlet Fever is that in the later stages at all events this is not infectious. It is only fair to state, however, that this opinion is not held by all Medical Officers of Health. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In view of the increase in the number of return cases it would not be justifiable to give a definite opinion, at least until our knowledge of the subject is more thorough. Personally I still hold that all cases should be kept isolated till desquamation is quite completed. Enteric Fever. 139 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year compared with 96 in 1901, and 153 in 1900. 85 of the cases were removed to hospital where 18 died, and 54 were treated at home with 12 deaths. The total number of deaths was 30, compared with 15 in 1901 ,and 26 in 1900. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .57, compared with .40 in 1901, and .74 for the County of London. The case mortality was 21.5 per cent. for the Borough, and 15.7 per cent. for the whole of London. The case mortality is much higher this year than it was in 1901, when it was 15.6 per cent., showing that in the Borough the disease was of a more virulent type. The corrected death-rate from fever was .12 per 1,000, compared with .06 in 1901, and .12 in 1900. The number of cases notified in each sub-district, as also the number of deaths is given in the Tables. The death-rate for the different parishes were as follows:— Clapham .20, Putney .08, Streatham .13, Tooting .16, and Wandsworth .05. The number of deaths in the Borough is the greatest during the last ten years, and special inquiry has been made into the causation of the disease. Of the total 139 cases notified, in 95 the cause of the disease could not be ascertained, in 11 it was contracted outside the Borough, in eight it was caused by infection from previous cases, in three it was presumably caused by the eating of watercress, and in 22 the patients had partaken of shellfish two or three weeks before the first symptoms appeared. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Among the 22 cases caused by eating shellfish, there were six cases which were definitely traced to the eating of cockles, and of the six two were fatal, while other three had very serious attacks. With reference to the cases caused by the eating of cock'cs the following report was made to the Public Health Committee:— Cases of Typhoid Fever in Clapham due to Cockles. On the 1st December I was asked by Dr. Atkinson to see three cases of his residing at No. 10, Chip Street, Clapham, as he was suspicious that they were suffering from Typhoid Fever. I visited the house in the afternoon and found that the three patients were suffering from that disease and that it was of a markedly virulent type. On cross-questioning the patients I ascertained that two of the patients, one a young map, T. D., aged 20, and the other a girl of 18, N. D., had taken ill on the 15th November, and that the third case, a girl of 16, A. D., had taken ill on the 22nd November. I also ascertained that T. D. and N.D. had partaken of cockles on Saturday, the 1st November, and that A. D. had partaken of cockles on the 8th November, exactly a fortnight previous to the first symptoms The cockles were purchased from a man who had bought them from a man at Billingsgate on the mornings of the 1st and 8th November, and the father of the patients bought half a gallon on each of these days. One other member of the family partook of the cockles, but she has fortunately so far not shown any symptoms of infection. On the 4th December I received another notification of a case of Enteric Fever at Prescott Place, Clapham, the patient J. O. having partaken of cockles purchased from the same dealer on the 8th December. I telegraphed the above information to the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London so that he may take what action he considers necessary at Billingsgate Market. The man came from Leigh-on-Sea, near Southend, and I have written the Medical Officer of Health for that District asking 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. him to let me have particulars of where the cockles were obtained and how they were cooked and stored before being sold at Billingsgate. Of the 22 cases due to eating shellfish one was presumably due to eating mussels, one to winkles, six to cockles, and 14 to oysters. A copy of the report made with reference to infection from eating cockles was sent to Dr. Collingridge, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, and he instituted inquiries, the result of which are contained in a special report made to the Corporation of London. The result of the bacteriological examinations made by Dr. Klein show that most of the shellfish obtained in the Thames estuary contain bacilli similar to those existing in sewage, and in some instances bacilli resembling the typhoid bacilli were isolated. With regard to the causation of Enteric Fever from eating oysters, it has been a most difficult matter to trace the source of the oysters, as before being sold in this neighbourhood they frequently pass through the hands of two or three dealers. In only one of the cases were the oysters definitely traced to their source, viz.:—Emsworth. It was about the same period as the outbreak in Southampton due to eating oysters from the same source. Of the 22 cases due to shellfish, five were fatal, two of those infected by cockles, two by oysters, and one by mussels. In a large proportion of the cases it was impossible to ascertain whether the patient had eaten shellfish, but personally I am of opinion that a considerable number of the untraced cases were due to this cause, as it is extremely difficult in cases which are removed to hospital to get definite information from the occupiers of the house. The chart shows that the maximum number of cases were notified in October and the minimum in January. Chart showing the Number of Cases of Enteric Fever Notified during each week of the Year 1902 . 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. During the year information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board that the patient removed to hospital was not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease in 41 cases, exclusive of the cases of Small-pox, which have been separately dealt with. Of the cases treated at home no information was available whether the diagnosis was correct or not. In all, 1,448 cases of Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, and Enteric Fever were removed to Hospital, thus giving a percentage of 2'8 in which the diagnosis was wrong. The following Table shows the number of cases in each parish, as well as the percentage in each of the three diseases. TABLE XXXIV. Disease. No. of cases of mistaken diagnosis Total.

It is to be hoped that medical practitioners will in future take more advantage of the examination of patients suspected to be suffering from Typhoid Fever, as the examination to some extent would assist diagnosis before notification. 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The percentage of cases of errors in diagnosis is, in this Borough, much under the average, as shown in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's report for the year 1901. In that year 9.2 per cent. of the total admissions to Hospital were found not to be suffering from the disease mentioned in the medical certificate. The percentage of the total Scarlet Fever cases was 5.6, compared with 2.2 in this Borough, Diphtheria 12.8, compared with 2.3 , and Enteric Fever 25.5, compared with 11.7. Puerperal Fever. 21 cases of the above disease were notified, compared with 14 cases in 1901, and 15 in 1900. Five of the cases occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, four in Streatham, three in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. Eight of the cases, or 38 per cent. were fatal, four in Streatham, three in Putney (one of which was not notified), and one in Tooting. The death-rate was .033, compared with .029 in 1901. In all the cases the premises were disinfected and the nurse in attendance was warned and advised not to attend any other maternity case for at least four weeks. Erysipelas. 236 notifications were received and 18 deaths occurred, compared with 219 notifications and three deaths in 1901. Measles. The number of deaths from Measles was 94, 57 of males and 37 of females. 18 of these occurred in Clapham, six in Putney, 27 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 38 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 28 above the previous year, and is 3.8 above the corrected decennial average . 22 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 65 from one to five years, and seven above five years of age. 85 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate per 1,000 for the year was .39, compared with '29 in 1901. The death-rate for all London was '50, compared with .42 per 1,000 in 1901. The death-rate during 1902, although higher than the three previous years, cannot be considered excessive, as during the last 20 years this rate has been exceeded 11 times, the highest rate being in 1896 when it was '76 per 1,000. The highest rate recorded was in 1866 when it was .85 per 1,000 An examination of the death-rates from the year 1857 shows that the relationship between the deaths under and over five years of age has been altered, chiefly, in my opinion, by school attendance. Previous to the year 1871 the ratio of the death-rate under five to that over five years was as six to one, and from 1892 to 1901, as 15 to one. If the case mortality under and over five years has remained the same, then this points to a largely increased mortality of children under legal school age. It also shows that the aggregating of children in babies and infants classes in schools has a tendency to keep up the mortality of Measles. There is no doubt that the case mortality of children under five is higher than over five from this disease, and if the incidence could be postponed till the children were over the latter age the death-rate would be very much lowered. The following Table shows the number of Measles and other non-notifiable diseases notified to me by the teachers in the elementary schools in the Borough. Although not by any means giving a correct estimate of the number of these cases occurring in the Borough, yet it is much more exact than the same Table in last year's report. It is to be noted that the number of cases of Chicken-pox notified from schools is much under the number of actually notified under the Act, the notification of this disease being made compulsory from the 7th February. In all 3,158 cases were notified, compared with 1,327 in 1901. 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of these, 2,260 were cases of Measles, 259 of Chicken-pox, 288 of Whooping Cough, 216 of Mumps, and 135 of Ringworm. TABLE XXXV. School. Diseases. Measles. ChickenPox. Whooping Cough. Mumps.

As far as could be ascertained this had the effect of checking the spread of the disease. Whooping Cough. 64 deaths occurred from Whooping Cough, compared with 60 in 1901, and 86 3 the corrected decennial average. 21 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, five in Putney, 18 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth. 32 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 29 from one to five years, and three over five years. The death-rate was .26 per 1,000, compared with .25 in 1901, and with .41 for the whole of London. 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Epidemic influenza. Judging from the death-rate this disease was much more prevalent than in 1901, as 93 deaths were registered, compared with 41 in 1901, and 87 in 1900. The number of deaths is, however, 3.7 below the corrected decennial average. 28 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, nine in Putney, 31 in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 23 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .38 per 1,000, compared with .18 in 1901. Diarrhœa. The number of deaths from the above was very much under the average as only 93 deaths were registered, compared with 164 in 1901. Only two years in the previous decennium show a lower actual mortality, viz.:—in 1892, when 83 deaths occurred, and 1894, in which there were. 59 deaths. The number registered in 1902 is 87.7 below the corrected decennial average. In Clapham there were 14 deaths, compared with 42 in 1901, in Putney eight, compared with seven, in Streatham 11, compared with 29, in Tooting 14, compared with 29, and in Wandsworth 46, compared with 57. The death-rate for the year was .38, compared with .69 per 1,000 in 1901. The death-rate for the whole of London was also much under last year, being only .54, compared with .85 for the year previous. The death-rate in the parishes was as follows:—Clapham .26, Putney .31, Streatham .14, Tooting .75, and Wandsworth .68 per 1,000 With the exception of Putney, which is slightly higher, all the above rates are much under those for last year. Of the total deaths registered, 80 or 83.8 per cent. were of infants under one year of age. 89 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Including Enteritis, the total number of deaths was 155, compared with 214 in 1901, and 246 in 1900. The following Table shows the death-rate from Zymotic Diseases for the Borough for the year, as well as the two previous years. TABLE XXXVI.

Chicken-Pox. From the 7th February, when Chicken-pox was made a notifiable disease, 1408 cases were notified, 288 in Clapham, 115 in Putney, 410 in Streatham, 107 in Tooting, and 518 in Wandsworth. No further cases of Small-pox were discovered other than the four mentioned in the special report on Small-pox, although 64 of the cases of Chicken-pox notified were persons over 15 years of age. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 78 bacteriological examinations were made, compared with 66 in 1901, 44 in 1900, and 29 in 1899. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the particulars of these examinations, and the number in each parish:— TABLE XXXVII. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsw'th. Whole Borough. Diphtheria.

The result of this has been that many more examinations are now made, and during 1903 I anticipate a much more extended use of such examinations by the medical men in the Borough. NON-ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The next Table shows the number of deaths from these for the year, as well as for the previous decennium for the whole Borough. The numbers for the years 1900, 1901, and 1902 are corrected for external and internal institutions. 91 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXV7II.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer, which includes all forms of malignant disease, was 222, compared with 202 in 1901. The corrected death-rate was .90, compared with .86 in 1901. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each parish was as follows:—Clapham 60 and 1.09, Putney 25 and .97, Streatham 66 and .84, Tooting 10 and .52, and Wandsworth 61 and .89. Of the total number of deaths, 86 were males and 136 females. The total number of deaths is 45 above the corrected average, and the rate is the highest that has been registered since 1885, the last year for which definite statistics could be obtained. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths of males is 32.5 above the corrected decennial average and the females 12.25. Three of the deaths (one male and two females) were of persons under 15 years; 126 (47 of males and 79 of females) were from 25 to 65 years; and 93 (38 of males and 55 of females) were over 65 years. The following Table shows the deaths, males and females, in each parish, for the whole Borough, and for the separate parishes arranged in fourteen age groups. 93 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The greatest number of deaths occurred in persons over 70 years of age, and at most of the age periods the female deaths were greater than the male, more especially at ages 35 to 40, 45 to 50, and over 70. The following Table shows the number of deaths arranged according to part of body affected. TABLE XL. Locality of Disease. Males. Females. Total.

With a view of ascertaining what increase had taken place in the death-rate from Cancer in this Borough, I have searched the death returns since 1885, and the following chart and Tables show the death-rate from this disease in the Borough and in the separate parishes since that year. Death-rate per 100,000 from Cancer, 1885 to 1902. 95 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The chart shows that this rate has increased from 47 per 100,000 in 1885 to 90 in 1902, the mean rate for the 18 years being 66.5. With the exception of the year 1900, the rate has been above this mean since the year 1895. In the Table which shows the rates also in the separate parishes there is considerable variation in the rate as well as in the mean rate for the 18 years recorded. The means in the parishes for the 18 years were, in Clapham 79, Putney 61, Streatham 63, Tooting 68, and in Wandsworth 66. The rate thus shows that in the parish of Clapham Cancer has been more prevalent than in any other parish. It would be interesting, from a statistical point of view, to know whether this increase has taken place both among males and females, but the necessary corrected statistics could not easily be obtained. 96 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Chart showing the Death rate from Cancer per 100,000 in London, from, 18.52 to 1901. 97 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. This increase in the death-rate is not confined to this Borough, but has been general all over the country. The following chart shows the increase in the death-rate in London from the year 1852. The death-rate has more than doubled, having increased from 38 to 89 per 100,000 in the 50 years. Chart showing the death-rate from Cancer per 100,000 in London, from 1852 to 1901. 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It is not possible to say definitely whether this increase in the Cancer death-rate is a real increase. Some of the increase is due to the more exact certifying of the cause of death, but there is no doubt that some is due to an actual increase in the number of deaths. Professor de Bois, of the Reims School of Medicine, has made an exhaustive inquiry into this question, and a summary of his report appeared in the British Medical Journal in October, 1892. The conclusions he arrived at were as follows:— That Cancer of the Uterus and of the female Breast have declined. That Cancer of the Rectum appears to be stationary. That Cancer of the Mouth and of the upper digestive tract have greatly increased. That the most important element in the rise of the Cancer death-rate is that from Visceral Cancer. Dr. Templeman, of Dundee, has published a report on the deaths from Cancer in Dundee, and has arrived at conclusions which in some respects coincide with those of Professor de Bois. Dr. Templeman, however, found that Cancer of the Uterus and Breast have slightly increased, but that the great increase in females was due to increase in Cancer of the Abdominal Viscera. He also found that in males the highest mortality is from Cancer of the Abdominal Viscera. He also states that "Cancer of 'accessible' regions has in"creased, as well as that of parts not so accessible, and where "the diagnosis is more difficult, but the increase in the latter is "out of all proportion to that in the former class." An examination of the statistics for the Borough, as far as they are available, leads to practically similar conclusions. 99 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. On reference to Table 40 it will be seen that the number of deaths from Cancer of the Stomach, Abdomen, and Liver, amounts to 76, 37 of males and 39 of females, out of a total of 222. If Cancer of Rectum, Bowel, and Bladder be included then the total number of deaths from Cancer of the abdominal organs was 122, 60 of males and 62 of females. It is to be hoped that before long the researches presently made into the etiology of the disease will prove successful, and that preventive medicine may be able to do something to lessen the increasing mortality from this cause. Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from the above was 314, compared with 388 in 1901, and 374 in 1900. 215 of the deaths occurred from Phthisis pulmonalis, 36 from tubercular disease of the brain, and 63 from other forms of tubercular disease. The number of deaths from Phthisis and other Tubercular Diseases, and the rates per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate parishes are shown in the next Table. TABLE XLII. Sub-District.

Compared with 1901 and with previous years, the death-rate from all Tubercular Diseases, and from Phthisis especially, shows a remarkable decrease. The corrected death-rate from Phthisis is only .87, compared with 1.10 in 1901, and from all Tubercular Diseases 1.27, compared with 1.27. All the parishes in the Borough with the exception of Putney show a decrease, the greatest decrease having occurred in the parish of Wandsworth. Streatham has the lowest death-rate, viz.:—58 from Phthisis, and '95 from all Tubercular Diseases, and that this is no accidental circumstance may be seen from the Table which shows the deathrate from Phthisis for the last ten years in the Borough and in the several parishes.

In the report for 1903 the question of Consumption will be more fully dealt with, and the result of the system of voluntary notification, which has, since the close of 1902, been adopted by the Council, will be recorded and commented on. Circulatory Diseases. In the above are included not only organic and valvular disease of the heart, but also all other diseases of the circulatory organs. In all 320 deaths from these diseases were registered (88 in Clapham, 29 in Putney, 82 in Streatham, 26 in Tooting, and 95 in Wandsworth). 178 deaths occurred from organic affections of the heart, compared with 143 in 1901. 25 of these deaths were of persons under 25 years of age, and 153 of persons over 25 years. The number of deaths among males was slightly less than among females. Respiratory Diseases. 547 deaths occurred from diseases of the respiratory organs (121 in Clapham, 67 in Putney, 135 in Streatham, 43 in Tooting, and 181 in Wandsworth). Of the total deaths 164 occurred from Acute Bronchitis, 118 from Chronic Bronchitis, 118 from Lobar Pneumonia, 152 from Broncho Pneumonia, and 21 from other diseases of the respiratory organs. 103 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. From the above causes there were 308 deaths in 1902, 179 of males and 129 of females, compared with 274 in 1901. 131 of the deaths (77 of males and 54 of females) were from Premature Birth, and 177 (102 of males and 75 of females) from Developmental Diseases. 165 were under one year of age and 12 above that age. 70 of the deaths occurred in Claphain, 25 in Putney, 80 in Streatham, 29 in Tooting, and 104 in Wandsworth. Old Age. 190 deaths occurred from Old Age (70 of males and 120 of females), compared with 184 in 1901. 48 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 14 in Putney, 55 in Streatham, 18 in Tooting, and 55 in Wandsworth. With the exception of one, all the deaths were of persons over 65 years of age. 791, or 23.76 per cent. of the total deaths, occurred in persons over 65 years of age, compared with 729, or 23.29 per cent., in 1901. The percentage of deaths of persons over 65 years to total deaths in the several parishes was as follows:—In Clapham 25.03, Putney 23.32, Streatham 28 88, Tooting 2771, and Wandsworth 19.00 Inquests. The next Table shows the number of Inquests held during the year in the Borough. The total number was 225, compared with 207 in 1901, and 196 in 1900. Streatham shows an increase of one, and Wandsworth of 26, while Putney a decrease of three, and Tooting of six, compared with 1901. The number in Clapham is exactly the same as in 1901. 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In 145 or 64.4 per cent. of the total number of Inquests a verdict of death from natural causes was returned, in 53 or percent. from accidental causes, in 16 or 7.1 from suicidal causes, and in 8 or 3.5 per cent. open verdicts were returned. Three executions were carried out at the Wandsworth Prison during the year 1902, compared with one in 1901. TABLE XLV. [###INQUESTS PARISHES.

The following Table shows the number of Inquests held on residents in the Borough who died outside the Borough. The large number in which a verdict of accidental death was returned is due to the fact that cases of accident are often removed from this Borough to a general hospital where the Inquest is held if the case proves fatal.

Mortuaries. In the report for 1901, the position and condition of the Mortuaries in the Borough were stated, and no change has during the year taken place with one exception, viz.:—that the Mortuary in Putney has been closed, and since the 28th April the Mortuary in Wandsworth been used. Some of the fittings from the Putney Mortuary were removed and erected in the Wandsworth Mortuary In Clapham 43 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, in Putney up to the 28th April 12, in Streatham 45, in Tooting 11, in Wandsworth 123, of which 26 were from Putney Nothing further has been done with reference to the erection of the new mortuary in Wandsworth as the land on which it had been decided to build is not yet available. 108 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Water Supply. The water supply to the Borough is the hands of two Companies, (1) the Southwark and Vauxhall, which supplies Putney and the greater portion of Wandsworth, the dividing line being the main line of the London and South-Western Railway; and (2) the Lambeth Company which supplies Clapham, Streatham, Tooting, and a portion of Wandsworth. The monthly reports of the Government Analyst on the condition of the Thames derived water were satisfactory, any departure from the ordinary being carefully recorded. In May a letter was received from the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council calling attention to a report on the wells in the Borough, dated September, 1892, and July and December, 1893, and asking if these wells are still in existence, and if so, whether the water is used for domestic purposes. In consequence of this communcation an inspection of all the known wells was made and an amended list was forwarded to the London County Council. In reply to this the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council stated that the Council's chemist had been instructed to analyse samples of well water where necessary, and the Medical Officer of Health wished to be informed if the samples would be taken by them or by the officials of the Borough Council. This letter was brought before the Council in June, and it was decided to leave the analysis in the hands of the London County Council. An analysis of water from two of the wells was made, and as the analysis of one of the wells showed that the water was polluted it was decided to order the well to be closed. In the other case the water was satisfactory. The following list is a copy of the list forwarded to the London County Council. 109 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. PARISH OF CI.APHAM.

The following report of the Public Health Committee on this subject was, after careful consideration, presented to the Council and adopted on the 1st October, 1902:— REPORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. The Committee in their last report to the Council on the 7th November, 1901, advised that a definite report upon the possibilities of utilising three selected sites for buildings in the style of the Guinness Trust Buildings should be obtained from the Architects to the Trust. Three sites were chosen as being the central positions in the immediate neighbourhood of working class dwellings, and where such dwellings as were proposed would be likely to be much in demand, and appeared to be most required. A sum of £45 was voted by the Council for the reports. The Committee decided to commence by obtaining reports on two sites only, viz.:—Rectory Grove, Clapham, and Hills Yard, Wandsworth Plain, as being the two where such dwellings were most urgently, if anywhere, required in the Borough, and the sum of £30 only has been expended. The reports were as follows, viz. :— 115 Re-port of the Medical Officer of Health. RECTORY GROVE SITE, CLAPHAM. We have carefully inspected this site and its surroundings, and are of opinion that, although its shape is irregular in outline, and consequently a little wasteful, it is well adapted for the erection of Workmen's Dwellings. Its position within the area of a large industrial population, and its proximity to so fine an open space as Clapham Common, renders it exceptionally suitable for the purpose, and its site will be rendered more valuable when the contemplated widening next North Street is effected. As you have been unable to obtain leave from the owners to dig trial holes we cannot report as to the sub-soil, or as to the prospective cost of foundations, which is always a desirable preliminary step, but from our personal knowledge of the neighbourhood and the enquiries we have made, we have reason to believe that the sub-soil is gravel without much overlaying loam, and if such should prove to be the case it would be of great advantage to the undertaking. In the development of the site, as shown upon the block plan, we have the pleasure of submitting herewith, we have kept in view the expediency of devoting a large proportion of the space to playgrounds, which are proposed to be 4c feet wide, with entrance from Rectory Grove, enclosed by gates, thus allowing the access to all the staircases to be from the internal or playgrounds, and affording the best means of supervision and control. The orientation of the blocks is such that the windows of all rooms will, approximately, face east and west, so insuring a share of direct sunshine to the windows of every room. All the tenements are arranged on the Associated principle, as adopted by the Guinness Trustees in all their groups of dwellings, that is to say, with water-closets and laundries arranged on every storey accesible from the staircase landings, for the use in common by the occupants of the tenements on each landing. Our plan provides for the blocks being five storeys in height, comprising : —— 15 suites of 4-room tenements, 70 suites of 3-room tenements, 64 suites of a-room tenements, 22 suites of a-room tenements, a total of 171 rooms or 420 rooms, excluding the laundries. in addition to the above accommmodation the plan provides bath-rooms for the gratuitous use of the tenants, a drying-room heated by pipes, and a permanent supply of hot water in the neighbourhood of the drying-room. A kettle-room for the supply of boiling water at meal times is also contemplated, as well as a number of perambulator-sheds similar to those in the buildings of the Guinness Trust. 116 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Our approximate estimate of the cost of the buildings is £34,736, including commission and all other expenses, and taking the value of the site for this special purpose at 2s. 6d. per foot super, the total capital outlay will be £39,600. We annex a financial statement, which indicates the gross and nett rentals that can be reasonably expected, based upon our experiences in dwellings erected for other public bodies, charging less than the rents ruling in the neighbourhood, and this will show a nett return of £3: 13: 3 per cent., after allowing for a sinking fund invested at 3 per cent. to repay the total outlay in 60 years.

HILL'S YARD SITE, WANDSWORTH PLAIN. We have inspected this site and strongly recommend your Committee not to entertain its acquisition for their Housing Scheme unless the full frontage to Wandsworth Plain can be acquired at a sufficiently moderate cost as to give a satisfactory frontage to so large a group of dwellings and at the same time satisfactory access to the several rear Blocks, and to effect a desirable local improvement by widening the entrance to Frogmore Lane, now only about 21 feet in width. Assuming the additional frontage acquired, the site might then be considered suitable for a Scheme for Workmen's Dwellings, and we have the pleasure of submitting a Block plan indicating its development for that purpose. The cost of the buildings would be rather greater per cubic foot than that of the Rectory Grove Site, as there would have to be a number of comparatively short blocks in order to secure the windows facing east and west. There would be plenty of open spaces, all the intervening playgrounds being fully 40 feet wide, one being 65 feet. The trial holes which your Surveyor, Mr. Dodd, was good enough to have excavated for our inspection proved that the sub-soil was very satisfactory, sharp sand and gravel being found in every instance underlaying a thin layer of loam. No apprehension need, therefore, be felt as to the cost of foundations. Our plan provides for all the tenements to be on the Associated principle, as described for the Rectory Grove Site, and as adopted by the Guinness Trustees, five storeys in height and comprises:— 10 suites of 4-room tenements, 90 suites of 3-room tenements, 65 suites of 2-room tenements, 20 suites of 1-room tenements, A total of 185 tenements, or 460 rooms, excluding laundries, bathrooms, drying-room, and hot-water room. 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The financial aspect is set forth upon the statement submitted herewith, our approximate estimate of capital outlay being £44,100, made up of £39,300 for the buildings and £4,800 for the site. The financial statement indicates the gross and nett rentals that can be reasonably expected, based upon our experience in dwellings erected for other public bodies charging less than the rents ruling in the neighbourhood, and this will show a nett return of £3: 10: 4 per cent. per annum, after allowing for a sinking fund invested at 3 per cent. to repay the total outlay in 60 years.

Rentals ; Repairs, Painting, &c. 6 per cent. on Gross Rentals. (The deduction of rates and taxes is based on a rating of 7/4 in the £, but allowing the usual rebate for compounding). The reports were carefully prepared by Messrs. Joseph, Son & Smithem, and were accompanied by block plans and measurements, and Mr. Smithem attended the Committee and gave every explanation. The estimated cost of the land proposed to be purchased was, however, found to be, in the case of the Rectory Grove site, after allowing for the land required for the widening of North Street, and for tramway extension, and including compensation, £5,876, or £5,416 per acre, and in the case, of Hill's Yard £6,197. It is therefore clear that if, as the Committee think should be the case, these buildings are to be actually self-supporting, the price of land renders the scheme impracticable, for where the dwellings are most wanted, and therefore most likely to be generally full, the price of land is highest. The price of land being prohibitive, the Committee have not thought it necessary to further test the accuracy of the figures of the estimates contained in the reports. Unless, therefore, other suitable sites can be found or plans suggested that will be an improvement on the dwellings which appear to the Committee to be the best and most economical for the purpose, the Committee regrets that it cannot recommend the Council to proceed further with the matter at present. The Sub-Committee was re-appointed to further consider the question. With regard to the housing question in the wards of the Borough, the following information received from the Census Office on request of the Council shows the total tenements and tenements 6f less than five rooms, distinguishing those occupied by various numbers of persons in the Borough and its constituent wards at the Census of 1901. 120 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The percentage of tenements of one room to total tenements of less than five rooms is very different in these two parishes, being 14.03 in Clapham, and only 4.01 in Tooting. GENERAL SANITARY WORK IN 1902. No alteration has taken place during the year in the constitution of the staff of the Department, with two exceptions, viz. — the appointment of a lady Sanitary Inspector whose duties commenced in June, 1902, and the appointment of a new Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, owing to the resignation of the previous Inspector. During the first part of the year the energies of the whole staff were severely taxed, owing to the outbreak of Small-pox, and during the latter part of the year owing to the increase in number of the cases of infectious disease. All the work, however, was kept well up to date, with the exception of some of the clerical work: this latter could hardly be avoided owing to the large increase in the general correspondence, and also to the fact that for nearly the whole year Chicken-pox was notifiable. During the first three months of the year, when the cases of Small-pox were most numerous, a large amount of my own time was taken up in visiting all the premises where cases of the disease occurred, and also in visiting contacts in the Borough, both with cases notified in the Borough and with cases occurring outside the Borough. The London County Council, however, in the end of February appointed two medical men in the Borough to act as consultants in these cases, who were paid by that Council and the majority of the cases in which another opinion was necessary was seen by them, but the premises were always personally visited either before or after the case had been removed. Special inspection was again made this year of the houses in Young's Rents, Rowland's Cottages, and Charlotte Place, Clapham, with reference to the general sanitary condition, and inspection of the Hyde Farm Estate was made on three separate occasions owing to the prevalence of Diphtheria there. 123 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Special inspections of all bakehouses in the Borough were made, particularly with reference to the occupation of underground bakehouses, but this question will be dealt with more fully in next year's report. Other special inspections were made of the new roads in the vicinity of Earlsfield Station, to examine and report on the materials used in making up these roads. It was found that the great bulk of the material used was of an unobjectionable character, but several heaps of manure and decaying vegetable matter which had been deposited there were found, and these were, where visible, removed by the owner of the land after service of the usual notice. I also made 488 inspections of premises to report on their sanitary condition, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices, these including the inspections of factories and workshops. My attendance at the Police Court or the High Court was necessary on 20 separate occasions. The Table of sanitary operations is more complete for the year under consideration than it was in the year previous, as a more exact record has been kept of all the work done. The number of complaints received shows only a slight increase, 1,445, compared with 1,353. The number of houses and premises inspected was 14,703, compared with 12,592 in 1901, but this increase was not general in all the parishes. In Clapham and Tooting the number shows a decrease compared with last year, due largely to the cases of Small-pox occurring in these parishes, which occupied a large amount of the time of the Inspectors. With regard to house-to-house inspections, which I have always Considered one of the most) important duties of the Sanitary Inspectors ,the number of houses inspected was 4,823, compared with 4,365 in 1901. There also Clapham and Tooting show a decrease, compared with 1901, due to the reason stated above. 124 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLIX.

The Tables of house-to-house inspections which follow show the names of the streets and the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, the percentage of defects to houses inspected, as well as the number of families living in one, two, three, and four rooms and upwards. A summary is also given showing these details for the whole Borough and for each ward in the Borough. In column 3 of the summary where the percentage of defects to houses examined is given, the highest percentage existed in the Streatham ward, and the next in the Fairfield ward. The high percentage in the Streatham ward is due to the large number of sanitary defects found to exist in Wellfield Road, Ellison Road, and New Park Road, while in the Fairfield ward it was due to the large percentage in Ferrier Street, and Handel Street. The lowest percentage was in Southfields and Putney wards. The percentage of persons living in one room to the total families inspected was as follows:—Clapham North, 7.9; Clapham South, 8.7; Putney, 1.0; Streatham, 6.5; Balham, 7.3; Tooting, 3.9; Southfields, 7.2; Fairfield, 7.6; Springfield, 6.6; and in the whole Borough, 6.3. 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The number of intimation notices served was 6,471, compared with 6,204 in 1901, and the number of statutory notices 899, compared with 773. The number of statutory notices include bye-law notices, the particulars of which are as follows:— Dust bins 93, removal of manure 50, insufficient sanitary conveniences in workshops 19, dirty and uncovered cisterns 77, defective or no yard paving 123, absence of manure receptacles 11, defective water-closets 14, and offensive trades 1. 109 cases of overcrowding were dealt with during the year, by far the greater number of cases occurring in the parishes of Streatham and Wandsworth. In the parish of Streatham the overcrowding occurred in several houses in Greyhound Square, which were inspected in a. house-to-house inspection, and which would not have been discovered if such inspection had not taken place. In Wandsworth the cases occurred chiefly in the Fairfield ward. All the cases of overcrowding were abated without prosecution being necessary, and in the majority of cases such overcrowding was purely domestic. 610 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 525 in 1901, and 573 complaints (96 from Clapham, 115 from Putney, 180 from Streatham, 36 from Tooting and 146 from Wandsworth) were received during the year. The great majority of these complaints were due, as was the case in the previous year, to the fact that the occupiers were out at the time the dustmen called. The Surveyors inform me that no alteration has taken place in the arrangements for dusting and scavenging since last year, details of which were given in the report for that year. 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In 781 cases the yards of premises have been paved or the paving repaired compared with 496 in 1901. The want of yard paving in some of the smaller house property causes a great deal of discomfort and illness, especially among children. In a large amount of that class of property the water-closet is situated at the back of the premises entering from the yard, and unless a properly paved path exists from the door to the water-closet in wet weather this part of the yard is invariably in a very insanitary condition. There is no question that this paving adds greatly to the material comfort of the occupiers of the house. 3,086 rooms were cleansed and repaired, compared with 1,968 in 1901. In the parish of Streatham the number of rooms cleansed and repaired during the year was 1,577, compared with only 383 in 1901. This very large increase was due to the greater amount of inspections carried out in this parish. There was also an increase in the parish of Wandsworth, but a decrease in Clapham. 936 drains were cleansed and repaired, a slight increase, compared with last year. 187 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent on to the Surveyors from this Department, 47 in Clapham, 5 in Putney, 101 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 21 in Wandsworth. The number of water-closets cleansed and repaired was 1,465, slightly under the number for 1901. 233 accumulations of manure were removed, compared with 155 last year. Accumulations of manure have been the cause of a considerable number of complaints during the year. In the large tram and omnibus stables the removal is conducted as a rule regularly, and is carried out in a satisfactory manner. 725 water cisterns were cleansed, repaired, or covered, compared with 620 in the previous year. 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The periodical cleansing of cisterns is a most important matter, but unfortunately it is only very seldom done voluntarily. Numerous examples of this have been met with by the Inspectors during the year; they were told on many occasions by the occupier that although there was a cistern they did not know where it was, and in several cases, it was found in most inaccessible positions. In some parts of the Borough, under a bedroom floor was a favourite site, and in other parts the top of the house with no available access by long ladders. The number of unclassified nuisances dealt with was 1,137, a considerable increase. The parish of Streatham alone showing an increase from 54 to 507. Disinfection. During the year the number of infectious diseases notified showed a considerable increase, compared with previous years, and therefore the amount of disinfection done was proportionately increased. 1,953 rooms were disinfected, compared with 1,184 in the previous year, and 1,892 lots of bedding (418 in Clapham, 116 in Putney, 536 in Streatham, 176 in Tooting, and 646 in Wandsworth), compared with 1,130. All the work has been done most satisfactorily at the Disinfecting Station in Wandsworth, and only a few complaints were received during the year as to damage done to bedding. Every care is taken by the disinfectors, but it is quite impossible for the bedding, some of which is badly stained on being received, to be exposed to the necessary temperature, without fixing some of the stains already existing, and making them more visible. The 1,892 lots of bedding dealt with comprised the following articles:—1,535 beds, 1,493 bolsters, 3,842 pillows, 1,530 mattresses, 1,656 palliasses, 3,023 sheets, 2,272 quilts, 1,498 cushions, 14,900 articles of clothing, 4,449 blankets, 2,238 carpets, and 6,492 extra articles, a total of 44,928 articles, compared with 22,472 in 1901. 137 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The station at Wandsworth is now insufficient for the needs of a Borough of this size, principally caused by want of proper room to handle the articles, the infected and disinfected rooms being too small. It is also satisfactory to note that the apparatus has worked well throughout the year, no breakdown having occurred. A proposal is now under consideration to remove the present station to Tooting, and to erect there a much larger building containing two disinfectors, with proper accommodation for handling and storing articles. Smoke Nuisances. 46 cases of smoke nuisance were reported during the year, 39 from Wandsworth, one from Clapham, four from Streatham, and two from Tooting. In three cases proceedings were taken, two of these being against a Railway Company for black smoke issuing from locomotives, and in the third case three summonses were issued for offences at different times.

The following is a list of the above carried on in the Borough. With the exception of one, in the parish of Putney, they are all in the parish of Wandsworth.

(6).—Dallett & Company, High Street, Putney Soap Boilers. Do. do. Tallow Melters. No complaints were received during the year with respect to Nos. 1, 2, and 6. In regard to No. 3, proceedings were taken under Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in August, and the Magistrate adjourned the summons for two months to see if the defendants (who it was acknowledged, possessed the best practicable means of dealing with offensive effluvia), carried on the business so as to be a nuisance. No complaint was received after the 28th August, and the Sanitary Inspector reported on the 12th November that certain alterations had been carried out, but that no effluvia had been detected in the streets adjoining since the case had been adjourned. At the adjourned hearing of the summons on the 13th November the Magistrate stated that the defendants having carried on the business for two months withont nuisance arising therefrom, the primary object of the prosecution had been attained and he ordered the defendants to pay ten guineas towards the Council's costs. With regard to No. 4, an injunction had been obtained in the High Court in 1901, but as the proprietor of the works disobeyed this injunction by continuing to carry on the business so as to be a 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. nuisance, further proceedings were taken in the High Court in October, when both the defendants were ordered to be committed to prison, but the Judge intimated that as the object of the proceedings was to abate the nuisance he thought that if the defendants altogther ceased to carry on the business and paid the costs of the two motions, the Council would be well advised not to issue the writ of attachment. The defendants since that date have ceased to carry on the business, and the works were partially demolished. With regard to No. 5, notices were served on the owner on two separate occasions, the first notice being to repair the floor of the melting and storing chamber, and to properly repair the windows of the storage chamber, and the second was to properly and efficiently destroy the effluvia from the fat melting. The owner had satisfactory appliances for the destruction of the effluvia, but these were not being used in an efficient manner. These notices were complied with without having resource to proceedings at the Police Court. Offensive Trade Refuse. The Council have, during the year, extended the removal of offensive trade refuse to the whole Borough, and a large number of tradesmen have taken advantage of the system. A charge of fourpence per tin is made, the tins/ themselves being the property of the Council. The removal is carried out daily, twice, or three times weekly, as requested. In September last an arrangement was entered into with the Contractor to remove to the Destructor at Tooting during the night the fish and butchers' offal collected during the day, also to cleanse the tins before returning, free of cost, the poulterers' offal being destroyed in the furnaces. From a sanitary and financial point of view this arrangement has so far worked very satisfactorily. 143 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. As the destruction of such material is somewhat a difficult matter, and as it is of some marketable value, it would be, in my opinion, advisable to continue the present arrangements. During the year, 10,338 tins of offensive trade refuse were removed to the Destructor and disposed of. Slaughterhouses. The following list shows the number of slaughterhouses in the Borough as issued by the London County Council after October, 1902. One licence was refused by the County Council owing to the defective structural condition of the slaughterhouse. They were all inspected frequently during the year, not only for the purpose of seeing that the Bye-laws were carried out, but also for the purpose of inspecting the animals after slaughter. In one case it was necessary to take proceedings for non-compliance with the Bye-laws, and the defendant was fined. CLAPHAM— Oxley, Alfred, 63, Clapham Park Road. Woodman, George, 140, Larkhall Lane.

A considerable amount of extra inspection was made during the year of underground bakehouses, in order to prepare for the granting of certificates to these before the 1st January, 1904, and plans was made of all underground bakehouses by the Sanitary Inspectors. These inspections were purposely made during 1902 in order to give the occupiers and owners of bakehouses plenty of time to make all the necessary alterations. More detailed particulars of all underground bakehouses and the action taken by the Council will be given in the report for 1903, as all the details were not definitely settled during the year 1902. All the bakehouses were frequently inspected during the year, and the necessary cleansing and lime-washing carried out. The total number in the Borough is 153 (47 in Clapham, 22 in Putney, 42 in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 42 in Wandsworth), of which 60 are underground, that is, three feet under the level of the nearest ground. Houses-Let-in-Lodgings. The number on the Register is 116, (31 in Clapham, 42 in Streatham, and 43 in Wandsworth). 49 premises were placed in the Register during the year. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 145 These were all inspected at least twice during the year, and the necessary cleansing was carried out. A number of houses in Larch Road, Balham, were ordered by the Council to be placed on the Register, but the owners objected and the matter is still under consideration. Milkshops. All the milkshops on the Register have been frequently inspected, and I am able to report that they arc all kept in a satisfactory condition. 42 new millkshops were registered during the year, (two in Clapham, four in Putney, 15 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 14 in Wandsworth), and one was removed from the Register at the request of the owner. The total number now on the Register is 302. Inspection of Kitchens in Restaurants. During the year these were inspected and notices were served where the premises were not kept in a clean and satisfactory condition. The following Table shows the number of visits made by the sanitary Inspectors to slaughterhouses, bakehouses, cowhouses, and kitchens, as well as the number of inspections of urinals attached to public-houses.

Customs and Inland Revenue Act. During the year 39 certificates under the above Act that premises were so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons dwelling within, and that due provision had been made for their sanitary requirements, were given. These certificates referred to 480 separate houses. In the case of four of the houses, the certificate was refused as the houses were not let to two families. Unsound Food. During the year eight crates of bananas, two skate, one hamper of mackerel, three boxes of plaice, 30 mackerel in one box, 15 boxes of cherries, 10 boxes of kippers, one cwt. of potatoes, one box of soles, two boxes of skate, 24 wild rabbits (frozen), three-quarters of a tub of pears, one haunch of venison, and one box of coalies were destroyed at the request of the owners and certificates were given. Factories and Workshops. The Tables which follow show a summary of the work done in the Borough with reference to the inspection of Factories and Workshops. The first Table summarises the work of the Sanitary Inspectors, but does not include the work of the lady Sanitary Inspector. The majority of the inspections of dressmakers' premises on the first Table was made before the appointment of the lady Inspector, and consequently shows a decrease, compared with the Table in last year's report. The column headed miscellaneous, which includes all workshops, etc., where men are employed, shows an increase, compared with 1901, and the number of re-inspections of these an increase of 332. The number of workrooms found to be overcrowded was four, and 15 were found to be insufficiently ventilated. 107 workrooms were found to be dirty, compared with 30 in 1901. These were chiefly laundries and men's workshops. 147 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 156 notices were served, compared with 58 in 1901, and in only two instances was it necessary to take proceedings at the Police Court. In these two cases the nuisances were the absence of sanitary conveniences for the workpeople. As the work of providing these was begun before the cases were heard the summonses were withdrawn on the payment of costs. During the year several cases of lock-up shops have come under my observation in which there was no sanitary convenience, and in which it was practically impossible to erect one. Arrangements were made for the persons employed to use one in close proximity, or for one convenience to be used by the occupiers of several shops, provided no women were employed. In the latter case conveniences had to be arranged for. The works carried out include cleansing of workrooms, and the repair, etc., of water-closets, and in several cases the waterclosets were found to be dirty, but all notices with respect to these were promptly attended to by the occupiers. The number of workshops in which men only are employed on the Register at the end of the year is as follows:—124 in Clapham, 54 in Putney, 82 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 61 in Wandsworth. 148 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The next four Tables summarise the work of the lady Inspector since she was appointed on June 7th, 1902. In themselves they show strong evidence that the appointment made by the Council was a necessary one, and one which could not be so satisfactorily carried out by the other Inspectors. All the workshops inspected were workshops where females are employed, by far the largest proportion being dressmakers' and milliners' premises. The total number inspected during the seven months was 411 workshops, 301 domestic workshops and workplaces, and 138 outworkers' homes. In only eight cases was there any overcrowding and this was abated as soon as the attention of the owner was called to the fact that overcrowding existed. 69 workrooms were found to be in a dirty condition (18 in Clapham, 10 in Putney, nine in Streatham, three in Tooting, and 29 in Wandsworth). The majority of these were cleansed before the end of the year, but as many of the rooms which were found to be dirty were inspected in November and December the work of cleansing was postponed till after Christmas, and the remainder were cleansed soon after the New Year. The number of workrooms measured was 560, and the number of workroom cards on which the number of persons to be employed in each room is marked was 594. 149 workshops were reported to the Inspector of workshops on discovery by the lady Inspector, and the number of workshops reported by H.M. Inspector was 14. The number of intimation notices served, chiefly for dirty workrooms, was 59, but it was only necessary to serve two statutory notices. In 72 cases the nuisances were referred to me, as to abate the nuisance it was necessary for structural work to be carried 150 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. out. These referred chiefly to repairs to, or reconstruction of, water-closets. Table 62 shows the number of workshops on the Register, and Table 63 the number of small laundries which do not come under the Factory and Workshop Act, with the number of rooms in each in which work is carried on. Table 64 shows the nature of the trades carried on in the workshops inspected. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 151 Factory and Workshops Act, 1901.

During the year 1902, the lady Inspector only visited workshops and not factories where women where employed, consequently the number of laundries on the Register gives no idea of the amount of laundry work carried on in the Borough. All the large laundries are factories, and the number of females employed in these is considerable. During the year the majority of these were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors in their several districts to inspect the sanitary conveniences, but in the current year a more systematic inspection will be carried out by the lady Sanitary Inspector. I am glad to be able to report that in this Borough the condition of the workshops as a whole was found to be satisfactory. Outworkers. During the year ending the 31st December, the names of 208 outworkers were received either from employers in this Borough or from Medical Officers of Health of other Boroughs who had received the names from the various employers. 141 of these were women, and 67 men. They were all visited and the room in which the work was carried on inspected. In only 11 cases had cleansing to be carried out or any other sanitary defects remedied. The names of 95 outworkers were sent to the Medical Officers of Health of other sanitary districts. The following list gives the names of the district and the number of outworkers sent to each :—Battersea, 37 ; Lambeth, 17; Camberwell, 7; Croydon, Urban, 6; Stepney, 4; Wimbledon, 3; Fulham, 3; Southwark, 2; St. Pancras, 2; and Croydon Rural, Marylebone, Bermondsey, Chelsea, Hammersmith, Finsbury, South Woodford, Penge, Surbiton, West Ham, Willesden, Enfield, East Ham, and Norwich, one each. 155 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. was disinfected before being returned to the employers of the outworkers, and every precaution was taken to prevent the spread of the disease. In the case of Small-pox notified there was no work on the premises when the case occurred, and the patient, who was not an out-worker, had only been at home for two days. Statement of Work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the year ending the 31st December, 1902, 584 samples of foods and drugs have been submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these 51, or 87 per cent., were reported to be adulterated. In 36 cases proceedings were taken against the vendors of the adulterated articles, and in the 15 other cases the Council, taking into consideration the circumstances of the purchase and the low percentage of adulteration, decided not to prosecute. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year was £77 : 1 : 0, and the costs recovered amounted to £22 : 5 : 0, making a total of £gg: 6: 0. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total amount of work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, although to some extent interrupted by the resignation of the Inspector, compares favourably with the previous year. In 1902 the number of samples taken per 1,000 of population was 2.44, while in 1901 this number was 19, while the amount of adulteration in 1902 was only 87 compared with 13.21. During the latter part of the year, two female assistants were engaged twice a week in assisting the Inspector, but since the appointment of the new Inspector, the services of these have been dispensed with, and samples have been procured either by the Inspector himself, or by one of the Council's outdoor employees, or a member of the disinfecting staff, under his supervision. In October, 1902, the Council decided to make an important and necessary alteration in the number of samples to be taken. Hitherto 600 samples per annum had been the maximum, but owing to the great increase in the population it was thought that this was not sufficient, and it was decided to increase the number to three per thousand of the estimated population. During the present year, 1903, the number of samples taken will therefore be about 750, and the numbers will increase as the population increases. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the Department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH. Medical Officer of Health. Appendix.

This indicates an improvement in the case of the Milk samples from 16.l per cent. of impurity in 1901 to 10 per cent. in 1902. The Butter remains about the same, the percentage of adulteration being 8.3 in 1901 and 8.6 in 1902. II. Groceries. These included: — Coffee 25 samples. Pepper 8 „ Cocoa 5 „ Mustard 4 „ Tea 1 „ Baking Powder 1 „ 44 samples. All these were found to be genuine with the exception of one Coffee, which contained 28 per cent. of Chicory.
