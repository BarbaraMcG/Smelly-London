The number of deaths registered in the Parish of St. Mary, Newington, during the year of 53 weeks, was 1886, and the number of births 4276.

On a letter from the Vestry of Battersea the question of the Notification of Measles came again before the Vestry, and on its being referred to the Public Health Committee I read the following report: notification of measles. " Gentlemen, "At your request I have written to the Medical Officer of every Sanitary Authority in England where the practice of having Measles notified has been adopted by them. They number 54, and I have received replies from 36. For the convenience of the Committee I have summarised the 14 opinions expressed. It will be seen at once that nearly the whole of the Authorities who have adopted the notification are Urban, and their Medical Officers express views more or less in favour of having Measles notified, whilst in the very few Rural Authorities on the list their Medical Officers have hesitated to say much as to the benefit that has been received from its adoption. The important points are these, (1) They all say that Measles is much less satisfactory in its notification than Scarlet Fever and other diseases on the list, (2) That the early infectiousness of the complaint, as early even as the incubation stage, is a great obstacle to the prevention of the disease from spreading, (3) That effective isolation in hospital would be too costly for many authorities to bear, (4) That many think it is a very good thing to have notification even if you have not hospital accommodation, as the cases have so much better attention and care when visits are made to them by the officials of the Authority, (5) That the feeling in the matter is highly progressive, in the way that all infectious diseases, it is thought, ought to be reported to the local centre, (6) That if the full notification of all the cases is expensive the first case in the family might be the one alone notified. "Personally, I think that if any district could be benefited by this notification it is ours with its poor and overcrowded population. "If the notification embraced all the cases, I estimate the number to be 1,500 in the year, but if only the first cases, 400. I would advise the Committee to recommend that only the first case in the family be paid for; and to support the petition to the Local Government Board with that qualification. "Your obedient Servant, "GEORGE MILLSON." The Vestry after a discussion decided not to petition the Local Government Board, as it was thought not advisable to have Measles included in the list of Infectious Diseases compulsorily notified. 15 Houses Let in Lodgings.—Houses 50 to 70, Sayer Street, belonging to Mr. Attenborough, were reported by me as suitable ones to be placed under the regulatious. The report was referred to the Sub-Committee having that matter in hand. Some delay in placing houses under the regulations has arisen through the length of time taken in getting the new Bye-laws on the subject confirmed. Closing of Houses under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Housing of the Working Classes Act.—There has been no occasion during the year to seek such powers, the owners of property showing a readiness to carry out the works mentioned in the Vestry's notices. Bakehouses.—The following report was made to the Vestry:— "I have recently inspected the whole of the bakehouses in the parish. They number 75, of which 51 are on the ground level, and 24 below the ground level. Of the latter, 2 are eel pie shops. Structural alterations, especially in the matter of ventilation, have been carried out in many of those below the ground level. With the exception of four, all the notices have been complied with. In the exceptional cases Statutory notices have been served. I can report that the bakehouses are in a state creditable to the parish." Later, I reported that the works mentioned in the notices had been carried out. Customs and Inland Revenue Act.—Certificates were given in the following cases:—Britannia Chambers, Falmouth Chambers, Warren Buildings, Guinness's Buildings, Arcadia Buildings, Pullen's Buildings, Globe Buildings, Palatinate, New Kent Road, Pollock Road, Deacon Street, and Rodney Road Buildings, Munton Road, Manor Place, Chapter Road, and Chatteris Square Blocks, Rockingham Buildings, and Edinburgh Buildings. Cow and Slaughter-Houses.—The following report was made to the Vestry:— "I have to report tnat five cow-houses, and eight slaughter-houses have been inspected. With the exception of the cow-house ai 2, Standard Street, where the water supply is taken from a surface well, and the slaughter-house at 70, Union Road, where the water-closet pan and water apparatus are defective, they 16 were all found in a clean and satisfactory condition."

It is thus evident that the comparatively large amount of organic matter in the Thames-derived water recorded in 1894 was not repeated in the last two years; indeed the proportion was last year lower than in any year since 1890. The maximum organic matter in the Lea was also the smallest observed since 1890. 36 TABLE 11. METEOROLOGICAL TABLE FOR LONDON, 1896.
