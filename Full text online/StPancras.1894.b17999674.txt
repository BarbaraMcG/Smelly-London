THIRTY-NINTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, BEING THE REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1894. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Thirty-ninth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of St. Pancras. The map upon the front page shows the Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras. The statistics of population, births, and deaths relating to the Sub-Districts refer to the areas as shown upon this map. The year J894 has been an exceptionally healthy year; the death-rate of St. Pancras was 18.1 per 1000 living—the lowest rate on record. In the body of the Report will be found a review of the incidence of Diphtheria mortality before and since 1890. A brief account of the hospital accommodation for the infectious cases of the Metropolis, provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, is included under the head of Isolation of Infectious Diseases. For the first year of its use a record of the work commenced to be done in connection with the temporary shelter appears in conjunction with the record disinfection. The difficulties of re-housing displaced persons are discussed in connection with insanitary areas, and some suggestions made. The supervision of drainage being part of the work of the Health Department, the regulations, bye-laws, and procedure are set out in full, and the organisation of supervision will be seen to be complete. Unfortunately, the difficulties that have arisen have been caused by the anomalous condition of the statute law which urgently requires revision, especially with regard to combined drainage. The subjects of cholera and diarrhoea, influenza, and the spread of disease by vagrants, will also be found to be touched upon. As in previous years, the Report is commenced by a summary of the principal meteorological data. 12 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1894. Barometer. Temperature. Daily range of Temperature.

Comparing scarlet fever, diphtheria, and enteric fever in the three previous decennia, the following are the results as recorded in Tables 18 & 19 of the Registrar-General's last Annual Report. Annual Mortality per million living. Decennial England and Wales. London. Periods. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. 1861-70 971 187 (886)* 1133 179 (904)* 1871 80 719 121 326 600 122 244 1881-90 338 163 198 335 259 189 * Includes also Typhus and Simple Continued Fever. It will be observed that the scarlet fever mortality per million for London fell from 1133 in the first to 600 in the second decennium, and in the 47th report (1884) of the Registrar-General, it is suggested that the greater fall in London than in England and Wales may have been due to the provision of greater isolation and hospital accommodation. This would appear to be corroborated by the fact that in the next decennium more isolation hospitals having been provided in the larger towns, the fall in the mortality in England and Wales was greater even than in London, and the two ratios per million were almost equal in 1881-90. The mortality from enteric fever fell in London from 244 per million in the decennium 1871-80 to 189) per million in the last decennium, and in England from 326 to 198 per million, due to improved sanitation. Comparing London with England, exactly the same order of fall in mortality is observed as in the case of scarlet fever. In the decennium 1861-70, enteric fever was embraced under the head of Fevers, which included also typhus and simple fever ; at this period the combined mortality from the three diseases in London was higher than in all England and Wales, the former being 901, and the latter 886. The effect of sanitation first became apparent in London when the mortality from enteric fever, taken alone, in the next decade fell below that in 27 England and Wales ; in the last decade, when sanitary measures outside London had also improved, the ratios for England and for London fell so as to approach each other. Turning to diphtheria, on the other hand. in both England and London the mortality was less in the second decennium than in the first, but in the last decennium it was greater than in the second, and in London had increased to a higher ratio even than in the first. Comparing London to England, in the first decennium the ratio of mortality was about 5 per cent. lower than in England, in the second was about equal, and in the third it was about 60 per cent. higher. Further, whereas the annual death-rates from all causes, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and from enteric fever, have been steadily falling in England and Wales, in the large towns, and in London; the annual deathrates from diphtheria have been rising slightly in England and Wales, more markedly in the large towns, and most markedly in London.

LONDON. —Annual Death-rates per million living. Year. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. 1871 582 105 267 1872 276 80 242 1873 191 95 269 1874 773 122 256 1875 1056 167 235 1876 651 109 217 1877 439 88 251 1878 495 155 283 1879 717 155 229 1880 820 144 186 1881 553 172 254 1882 519 222 252 1833 514 244 247 1884 362 241 234 1885 181 227 150 1886 172 212 154 1887 356 235 151 1888 295 319 169 1889 120 391 130 1890 206 331 146 These figures also show that, whereas the mortality rate of diphtheria is steadily rising, that of typhoid is equally steadily falling pari passu with improving sanitation, and that of scarlet fever is also falling pari passu with increased hospital isolation, no hospital accommodation having been provided for diphtheria until the end of 1889. It is important to note these points because diphtheria resembles scarlet fever in its power of spreading directly from person to person, and also resembles typhoid fever, in that either diphtheria, or some form of throat diseases closely allied with it, may arise from certain insanitary conditions. Comparing the two last diseases, whereas typhoid only occasionally spreads directly from one person to another, diphtheria always spreads with great facility from person to person; and whereas typhoid varies in direct proportion to insanitary conditions, the relationship of diphtheria to insanitary conditions is overwhelmed by the influence of personal infection. So that, whereas the improvement of sanitation markedly decreases the mortality of the former, it appears to have no effect upon the latter; and whereas the 29 increase of general density of population in all districts, of special density in towns, and of aggregation in schools only remotely and indirectly affect typhoid, they closely and directly affect diphtheria. These peculiar increases led me to examine more closely the statistical figures in relation to diphtheria, and to compare those relating to other diseases attacking the palate, uvula, tonsils, pharynx, larynx, and trachea It was not possible to go further back than the beginning of the last decenniun, as previous to 1881 the Registrar-General gave no details of deaths occurring from these diseases in London, For the sike of brevity, I have termed them throat diseases, and in the following table the deaths from these diseases are set out:— LONDON.—Deaths from Throat Diseases.

From this table it appears that there has been a very marked fall in the number of deaths from thrush and croup, a distinct but less marked fall in those from laryngitis and other diseases of the larynx and trachea, and an irregular and slight decrease under the head of sore throat, only observable on comparing the quinquennium 1881-5 with that of 1886-90. All these diseases, taken together, show progressive and very distinct fall in the number of deaths attributed to them. Diphtheria, on the other hand, shows a progressive and distinct rise ; in fact, when compared side by side, the numbers of the two classes proceed in inverse ratio, and when the two classes are totalled together any increase disappears. The ratios are more correct and stand out more clearly in the death-rates per million. 30 LONDON.—Death-rates per million living per annum. Year. Diphtheria. Diseases of Throat other than Diphtheria.

The conclusions that I therefore came to were:— (1) That a slight diminution had taken place in the death-rate from throat diseases taken as a whole; and (2) That the great rise in the mortality from diphtheria corresponded with a great fall in that from other throat diseases. As to the former, it may have been due to diminished prevalence, or to greater vigilance, or to better treatment. Parents, guardians, teachers, nurses, medical men, and the public generally are more alive to the danger of throat diseases than formerly. As to the latter, many causes are possibly at work, and a few words may be devoted to each. 1.—The. effect of the Infectious Disease Notification Act.— This Act came into force in the Metropolis at the end of October, 1889, and has tended to more care and attention being bestowed, not only upon diphtheria. but upon all infectious diseases. On referring to the last table it will be noticed that the great rises in the diphtheria mortality of the last decennium took place from 1881 to 1883, and from 1887 to 1889, antecedent to the introduction of compulsory notification, and that the persistent and gradually progressive fall in the mortality of other throat diseases commenced in 1883, seven years previous to the introduction of compulsory notification into the Metropolis. Furthermore, during the past decennium there have not been any rises in the mortality from other notifiable diseases comparable to that of 31 diphtheria. It will be observed also that ray conclusions are not based upon notifications, but upon deaths, that the fatal—not the benign — forms of disease are in question 2. — The effect of the reception of Cases into the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. — It may be that the admission of cases to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the end of 1888 may have had some slight indirect effect in directing more care and attention to sore throats, but the upward tendency of diphtheria commenced prior to this date, and therefore this effect would be only part of the generally increasing attention already being paid to the disease. 3.—The effect of Sanitary Legislation generally.—This must also be taken into account, for the Public Health Act, 1875, came into force during the very decennium when compulsory education (1871) came into force, and the effect of the Act was to stimulate the recognition and prevention of infectious diseases in England, especially in large towns. This stimulus, doubtless, extended to the Metropolis, and, in conjunction with additional sanitary legislation, directed closer attention to infectious diseases in London also. 4.— The effect of Elementary Schools.—The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, Dr. Thorne Thorne, has so fully and so carefully entered into this subject that his conclusion that increased school attendance has had a material influence in increasing the spread of diphtheria is irresistible 6.—Alt ration Classification.—Any changes made in classification by the Registrar-General are usually commenced at the beginning of a decennium, and therefore would not affect the detailed London figures of throat diseases in this Report. The Superintendent of Statistics, Dr Tatham, has kindly informed me that " membranous croup " was not classed with diphtheria until the commencement of the present year (1894), although " diphtheritic croup " has been classed with diphtheria for a long period, so that classification can have had little or no effect upon the returns of mortality. 6.— Variation in Nomenclature. - Improved medical diagnosis, due to improved medical education and increased knowledge of diseases of the throat, enables these diseases to be more readily differentiated than formerly Now, most forms of infectious sore throat are regarded as diphtheritic, and the fatality of such diseases is recognised, whereas formerly the term was restricted to typical cases. The danger of the earlier practice has been pointed out in the many instances brought to light, in which apparently simple sore throats in schools have culminated in serious and fatal epidemics 7.—Change of Tupe.— In the last place, the question may be seriously asked whether the variation in nomenclature may not be due to a change of type in disease of the throat. Dr. Thorne Thorne says " that there is reason to believe that attacks of so-called sore throat exhibit under certain favouring conditions a progressive development of the property of infectiveness, culminating in a definite specific type which is indistinguishable from true diphtheria." A change of type is probably taking place as the result of increased density of population, especially in towns, more particularly of the aggregation in schools, and of the effects of personal infection consequent on these. There is also a strong probability, and it only remains to be definitely proved, that a sore throat 32 caused by insanitary or other conditions may possess or acquire infective properties, and in passing from person to person may also acquire such virulence as to cause death from infectious sore throat of a type which the clinician would certify as diphtheria, whatever the pathologist might declare it to be as the result of bacteriological examination. Since this Report was written, figures up to a much later date have been obtained, and these are of extreme interest. In the first place, comparison of the mortality rates of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and enteric fever does not coincide with our previous experience. LONDON.—Annual Death-rates per Million Living. Year. Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. 1891 142 340 132 1892 274 462 102 1893 369 760 161 1894 221 614 141 Contrary to our experience, as seen in the previous table up to 1890 quoted from the Report, the last four years show that the mortality of diphtheria has taken to epidemic fluctuation like scarlet fever, and is no longer comparatively steady like enteric fever. Further, unlike previous years, the rise and fall of the mortality of scarlet fever and diphtheria have occurred simultaneously. Again, in reference to the proportion of the mortality from throat diseases caused by diphtheria, the experience of the past four years is not quite according to previous experience.

The deaths per million make the proportions more correct and more readily comparable. LONDON.—Death- rates per Million Living per Annum. Year. Diphtheria. Diseases of Throat other than Diphtheria.

The further conclusions to be drawn are : — 1.—That there appears to be little doubt that a distinct change of type has taken place in a large proportion of disease affecting the throat, accounting in the first place for the diminution in the mortality from other diseases of the throat and its displacement by diphtheria. 2.—That it is very evident that the change of type is from a non-infectious to an infectious form of disease, accounting for the enormous increase of diphtheria mortality over an 1 above the diminution of that of other throat diseases during the last few and quite recent years. 3.—That diphtheria has become an acute epidemic disease with far more sudden variations in extent and intensity of prevalence than formerly, and that we may expect epidemic and. non-epidemic years with marked seasonal prevalence in the future. Recently Mr. Shirley Murphy, the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, has further traced the great influence of schools in the spread of diphtheria in a Report that enters into all the details of the subject, 34 and amongst other points shows clearly that the diphtheria mortality falls during school vacations. Cholera.—In July the following letter was received from the Local Government Board, but as the diarrhoea mortality was less than in any previous year it was decided not to require the notification of this disease:— Cholera.—Notification of Diarrhoea. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 16th July, 1894. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that cholera, from which certain parts of Europe have never been entirely free since the summer of 1892, again shows some signs of recrudescence on the Continent. In the late summer and autumn months of 1892 and 1893 the disease reached our shores. In 1892 it failed to extend to any persons beyond those arriving in our midst from abroad. But last year it led to a number of localised outbreaks which, happily, were of trivial extent compared with previous cholera visitations to this country. In those localities where cholera made some headway it was found that there had been antecedent diarrhœa, generally quite excessive in amount, often choleraic in type ; the existence of this unusual diarrhœa being only discovered when diarrhoea was, under section 7 of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, added to the diseases notifiable under that statute. But notification of diarrhoea was rarely, if ever, adopted until after the advent of cholera, when the information to be derived from it could not be utilised to prevent that disease from gaining a footing whilst in its least recognisable form. Under these circumstances the Local Government Board have thought it desirable to remind sanitary authorities that the utmost vigilance should be exercised within their respective districts, to control any diarrhoea which may be suspicious either in character or in amount during the present and forthcoming season And, with a view of facilitating action in this direction, the Board would give favourable consideration to any applications that may be addressed to them for their approval to add diarrhoea to the list of notifiable diseases, until the termination of the current quarter. In making any such application, each sanitary authority will doubtless consider how far it may be desirable, in the first instance at least, to limit notification of diarrhoea to attacks occurring over one year of age. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) Hugh Owen, The Clerk to the Secretary.

One, the Brook Hospital, at Shooters Hill, Woolwich, another, the Park Hospital, at Hither Green, Lewisham, and a third, the Fountain Hospital, at the Grove, Lower Tooting, are already in occupation. The existing hospitals of the Board are also undergoing enlargement and more or less reconstruction. The additional accommodation will raise the number of beds to about 5,900 for other than small-pox patients. 350 acres of additional land have also been acquired near the Hospital Ships (300 beds) at 36 Long Reach for additional hospital accommodation for small-pox patients. The Managers have also under consideration the question of securing a site for the erection of a permanent convalescent fever hospital in South London, presumably similar to the Winchmore Hill convalescent hospital to the north of Loudon. The eight hospitals of tho Hoard mentioned above are:—The Eastern Hospital at Homerton, N.E.; the Gore Farm Hospital, Darenth, Dartford, Kent; the North-Eastern Fever Hospital. St. Anne's Road, South Tottenham ; the North-Western Fever Hospital, Haverstock Hill, N. W.; tho Northern Hospital, Winchmore Hill, N.; the South-Eastern Fever Hospital, Hatfield Street, New Cross Road, S.E.; tho South-Western Fever Hospital, Stockwell, S.W.; and the Western Fever Hospital, Seagravo Road, Fulham, S.W. In addition to these, but not under tho Managers' control, are tho London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, N., with 170 beds, and the Smallpox Hospital, Highgate Hill, N., with 108 beds, and there are diphtheria wards at University College Hospital, Gower Street, and tho Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street, W.C. But, what is of most interest to St. Pancras is the statement in the Report of the Ambulance Committee of the Board, that "compulsory powers have been obtained, and the consequent negotiations are in progress for tho acquisition of land which will form a site for a station at Hampstead." It is greatly to be regretted that after years of patient waiting some further statement cannot be made to tho effect that building operations are being commenced, seeing that at the new Brook Hospital at Woolwich, which is not yet completed, an ambulance station is in course of erection, whilst the representations of St. Pancras made for many years past receive such dilatory attention. The delay and inconvenience to St. Pancras patients is considerable, as it is necessary to send either to Fulham or to Homerton, some lour to five miles distant, to obtain an ambulance to convey them to the Hospital at Haverstock Hill. The spread of infectious diseases by vagrants.—In accordance with an invitation by the London County Council the Delegates of a large number of Metropolitan and Provincial Sanitary Authorities met in conference at Spring Gardens on the 19th July, to consider "whether means can be adopted to prevent the spread of infectious diseases" by vagrants, at which Conference your Vestry was duly represented. Resolutions passed were to the following effect:— "(1) That common shelters which are not subject to the law relating to common lodging houses should be subject to such law. "(2) That there should be power to the local authority to require medical examination of all persons entering common lodging houses and casual wards, and that each inmate should on admission ahve a bath of fresh water. "(3) That the local authority should have power to order the keeper of a common lodging house in which there has been infectious disease, to refuse fresh admissious for such time as may be required by the authority. 37 "(4) That the local authority should have power to require the temporary closing of any common lodging house in which infectious disease has occurred. "(5) That the local sanitary authorities should have power to require the detention of any inmate of a common lodging house or casual ward who may reasonably bo suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. "(6) That means should bo provided for the detention and isolation of any vagrant found wandering in a public place, if reasonably suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. "(7) That the local sanitary authority should have power to require the disinfection of the person and clothing of any person in a common lodging house or casual ward, whether infected or exposed to infection. "(8) That arrangements should be made by which the occurrence of infectious disease in common lodging houses or casual wards should be made known by the local authority of the district to the local authorities of other districts. "(9) That local authorities should have power to require the vaccination or re-vaccination of persons in common lodging houses or casual wards who are exposed to the infection of small-pox." Epidemic Influenza.—Influenza is becoming less prevalent, but is still more or less fatal, and it is interesting to place on record the opinion of the Medical Officer of the Local Government Hoard with regard to this disease and its prevention. Memorandum on Epidemic Influenza. Influenza became epidemic in England in the winter of 1889-90; it recurred in epidemic form in the spring, 1891, and was maintained up to June of that year ; a third epidemic took place in the winter of 1891-92, and after a minor recrudescence in the spring of 1893, a fifth prevalence on a wide scale took place in the winter, 1893-94. England is now passing through a sixth epidemic period. Two detailed reports have been issued by the Board on the subject. The first was by Dr. Parsons, "On the Influenza Epidemic of 1889-90," with an introduction by Sir George Buchanan, M.D., F.R.S., the Board's Medical Officer at that date. The second was a " Further Report on Epidemic Influenza, 1889-92," by Dr. Parsons, with papers on the Clinical and Pathological aspects of the Disease, by Dr. Klein, F.R.S., and an Introduction by myself. A " Provisional Memorandum upon Precaution advisable at times when Epidemic Influenza threatens, or is prevalent," was also drawn up by me in January, 1892, and was issued by the Board to Local Sanitary Authorities. The further study made by the Medical Department as to the natural history of Influenza, and as to its clinical and bacteriological characteristics, goes to show that it is a disease against which it is most difficult to apply measures of prevention with any substantial prospect of success. 38 Influenza is flighty infective from person to person: its infectious quality is often manifested before the disease is fully recognised; its incubation period is ope of the shortest of all infectious diseases; it varies so much in intensity that many cases are never diagnosed at all—one attack confers no marked immunity against another, and the infection is largely eliminated by means of the lungs, the sputa of the sick being invariably charged, during the acute stage of the disease, with its patho gnomonic micro-organism. The disease calls primarily for measures of isolation and of disinfection ; but there arc difficulties in making any such measures universally applicable. Wherever they can be carried out, the following precautions should, however, be adopted :— 1.—The sick should be separated from the healthy. This is specially important in the case of first attacks in a locality or a household. 2.—The sputa of the sick should—especially in the acute stage of the disease—be received into vessels containing disinfectants. Infected articles and rooms should be cleansed and disinfected. 3.—When Influenza threatens, unnecessary assemblage of persons should be avoided. 4.—Buildings and rooms, in which many people necessarily congregate, should be efficiently aerated and cleansed during the intervals of occupation. It should be borne in mind that the liability to contract Influenza, and also the danger of the attack, if contracted, are increased by depressing conditions, such as exposure to cold and to fatigue, whether mental or physical. Attention should hence be paid at epidemic periods to all measures tending to tho maintenance of health : such as tho use of clothing of suitable warmth, and a sufficiency of wholesome food. Persons who ore attacked by Influenza should at once seek rest, warmth, and medical treatmeut, and they should bear in mind that the risk of relapse, with dangerous complications, constitutes a chief danger of the disease. During the year 1710 rooms were fumigated, stripped, and cleansed ; 30,505 articles were steamed in the Chamber, and 1796 articles were destroyed bv fire in the destructor furnace. R. Thorne Thorne.

House to house Inspections.—The number of streets inspected from house to house during the year was 7, consisting of 141 houses, of which 137 were occupied, and 4 unoccupied and passed over; the inspected houses contained 1124 occupied and 26 unoccupied rooms let to 389 separate families, consisting of 840 adults and 241 children. 86 notices were served upon these houses (Table No. 10 B). 43 Houses occupied in separate dwellings.—The list of blocks of houses constructed in separate and self-contained dwellings is appended to the end of the Report (List 1). The number of houses let in separate dwellings not selfcontained is very large. Registered tenement houses.—The number of houses let in separate dwellings to members of more than one family and registered under the Bye-laws is 174. Registered common lodging-houses —The supervision of these houses has been handed over from the Metropolitan Police to the London County Council, A list of those in St. Pancras will be found appended to the Report (List 2). Underground dwellings.—The number of underground rooms closed against occupation as separate dwellings during the year was 21. Canal boats used as dwellings.—Canal boats moored within the district were inspected periodically and found in a satisfactory condition. UNHEALTHY DWELLING HOUSES. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part II., the following houses were represented as unfit for human habitation:— Date of representation of Medical Officer of Health. Premises. Date and Resolution of Vestry. Date and decision of Magistrate. 1894 April 24th 88, Little Albany Street 13th June, 1894.—Notice to be given to render the premises fit for human habitation. No proceedings. UNHEALTHY AREAS. During the year that part of the Somers Town Insanitary Area lying north of Drummond Street, and known as the Drummond area, has been materially improved. Some 159 notices were served upon owners within this area, and numerous structural and decorative defects were remedied. In those cases where the whole of the notice was not complied with, further notices were served, with the result that practically all the works that the Authority could enforce have been carried out, and in some instances owners have voluntarily made further improvements. Several communications have been made by your Vestry to the Loudon County Council urging them to improve the area west of Chalton Street, in accordance with the decision of the Home Secretary, under Part I. of the Working Classes Act, 1890, but no scheme has yet been decided upon. The improvement of the area east of Chalton Street is under the consideration of the Health Committee of your Vestry. The Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas will in due course also be further considered, with a view to improvement schemes being made. 44 The great difficulty in all improvement schemes is re-housing the persons displaced. Demolition being for the purpose of opening up to light and air, it is often not desirable to re-bouse on all or even part of a site. To measure the amount of re-housing desirable by the number of persons displaced is very misleading, for whereas the old occupiers were housed in a minimum of cubic space, the new occupiers will demand a maximum, the amount of re-housing should therefore be measured by cubic space rather than by number of persons. It would seem a reasonable course to pursue to ascertain the amount of inhabited cubic housing space to be demolished, and to replace as much of this cubic housing space upon as much of the area as is compatible with the London Building Act. If it is absolutely necessary for the Authority to provide the rest of the required re-housing space, it is placed in a difficult position. Surrounded on all sides by crowded areas this can only be accomplished, either by building upon open spaces—such a remedy being worse than the disease—or by erecting dwellings out of town, and this can be done as well, if not better, by private effort as by a Public Authority, It might be worth considering whether a Public Authority could not contract with a private individual to supply the requisite cubic re-housing space as near the site of demolition as possible, or, if need be, out of town. But, after all, however the accommodation is supplied, who is to undertake that the persons displaced shall go into any new buildings provided ? The only reasonable conclusion that can be come to with regard to re-housing after demolition is that it should be made incumbent upon the Authority to utilise the space to the best advantage, and to the fullest extent permitted by the London Building Act. To demand more than this is to demand the impossible. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 & 1891. Certificates have been granted under these Acts in cases where the houses have been found to be constructed in conformity with the Metropolitan Building Acts, the Metropolis Local Management Acts, the Public Health (Loudon) Act, and the following additional requirements in respect of each house : — 1.—That each of the persons inhabiting it is provided with at least four hundred cubic feet of air space. 2.—That each of the living or sleeping rooms is at least eight feet in height, and at least ninety-six square feet in area. 3. —That there is at least one draw-tap and sink, with a sufficient supply of water thereto, for every twelve occupants or less, on each floor. 4.—That there is at least one water closet, properly supplied with water, for every twelve occupants or less, on each floor. 5.—That the drainage of the premises is in accordance with the Regulations recognised by this Authority. 6.—That accommodation for clothes-washing is provided, sufficient for the number of persons inhabiting the house. 45 In future the requirements of the London Building Act, 1894, will also be made part of the requirements for houses constructed in separate dwellings. SCHOOLS. Infectious disease, and more especially diphtheria, may readily spread in schools. In many outbreaks of diphtheria it has been found that the lowered state of health and the resultant abnormal condition of children's throats has been the predisposing, if not the exciting, cause of the spread of the disease. The improved sanitary condition of schools is therefore of material importance in lessening the prevalence of diphtheria. With this object the View Committee of the Health Committee of your Vestry has visited a number of schools and obtained the amelioration of the conditions under which the scholars are placed. During the year the following schools were visited :— Allcroft Road.—William Ellis Endowed School. Brookfield. —Saint Anne's National School. Burghley Road.—Board School. Carlton Road.—Board School. Falkland Road.—Wesleyan School. Fortess Road.— The School of the Church of Our Lady Help of Christians. Holmes Road.—Board School. Lupton Street.—Liddon Memorial School. Maiden Road.—Saint Andrew's National Schools. Southampton Road.—Saint Dominic's Priory School. Wilkin Street.—Middle Class Training School for Children. York Rise.—Saint Mary's School. Camden Street.—Infant and National Schools. Great College Street.—Board School. Islip Street.—National Schools. Kentish Town Road.—British Schools. King Street.—Board School. Medburn Street.—Board School. York Road.—Board School. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon school-teachers how necessary it is to prevent children from licking the slates and sponges, and to cause them to rinse the drinking cups before using, and not to use the handkerchiefs of other children. WORKSHOPS. Workshops, Proper.—Whenever complaints have been received from ratepayers and others, or notices have been received from the Inspectors of Factories with regard to workshops, they have been inspected and the necessary measures have been taken. Bakehouses.—The improvement and regulation of Bakehouses has formed a topic of discussion in most of the Metropolitan Vestries, the result being that in October last a Conference was convened by the Vestry of St. George- 46 the-Martyr, Southwark, which was attended by Delegates from 25 Sanitary Authorities, and after a full debate the following resolutions were declared carried: — 1. That the present state of the Law relating to Bakehouses requires amendment, by the addition of the following clauses to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 : — (a) That uniform Metropolitan Bye-laws regulating houses be made by the London County Council, and be confirmed by the Local Government Board, and that the duty of enforcing these Bye-laws shall devolve upon the various Local Sanitary Authorities. (b) That the portions of the Bye-laws regulating the structure of Bakehouses do not apply to existing Bakeries. (c) That the London County Council be empowered to frame Bye-laws for the construction of underground Bakehouses, and that all Bakehouses erected after the passing of such Bye-laws shall conform thereto. Laundries.—In the few instances where complaints respecting Laundries have been made the rtquwte steps have been taken. WATER-SUPPLY AND WATER-SERVICE. The whole area of St. Pancras is supplied with water at constant high pressure, but nevertheless it is not considered desirable to abolish existing cisterns, as they are useful in order to reserve a supply of water for the flushcisterns of water closets in case the Companies' supply may be temporarily suspended. But it is possible and desirable to remove all draw-taps from cisterns and connect them to the main supply pipe of the house, so that water for purposes of drinking, cooking, etc., may de drawn direct from the main. It has been clearly shown that two gallons is not a sufficient flush for even the best constructed w.c.'s, and the drains and taps through which they discharge. Unfortunately the Regulations under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, limit the flush to two gallons. But the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, gives your Vestry power to make Bye-laws" with respect to keeping water closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action." It would appear to be within the power of your Vestry to make a Bye-law that " every new flushing cistern hereafter fitted to supply a water closet shall not supply less than three gallons at each flush." DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The Special (House Drainage) Committee appointed by your Vestry for the purpose of considering the question of private drainage reported in March, 1894, that the original practice of the Vestry down to 1890 was that all work connected with the remedying of nuisances on private property in relation to drainage was supervised by the Sanitary Inspectors, that the best course would be to revert to the practice adopted down to 1890, and therefore 47 recommended that all drainage work upon private premises be supervised by the Health Department, and that the underground drainage work from the limit of private premises to the public sewer be supervised by the Works Department. This was adopted by your Vestry on the 21st March, 1894, and on the 23rd May your Vestry adopted the following Regulations and Duties in reference to House Drainage: — REGULATIONS AS TO HOUSE DRAINAGE.

Extract* from the Bye-laws made by the London County Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 1.—Every person who shall hereafter construct a watercloset or earthcloset in connection with a building, shall construct such watercloset or eartbcloset in such a position that, in tho case of a watercloset, one of its sides at the least shall be an external wall, and in the case of an earthcloset two of its sides at the least shall be external walls, which external wall or walls shall abut immediately upon the street, or upon a yard or garden or open space of not less than one hundred square feet of superficial area, measured horizontally at a point below the level of the floor of such closet. He shall not construct any such watercloset so that it is approached directly from any room used for the purpose of human habitation, or used for the manufacture, preparation, or storage of food for man, or used as a factory, workshop, or workplace, nor shall he construct any earthcloset so that it can be entered otherwise than from the external air. He shall construct such watercloset so that on any side on which it would abut on a room intended for human habitation, or used for the manufacture, preparation, or storage of food for man, or used as a factory, workshop, or workplace, it shall be enclosed by a solid wall or partition of brick or other materials, extending the entire height from the floor to the ceiling. He shall provide any such watercloset that is approached from the external air with a floor of hard smooth impervious material, having a fall to the door of such watercloset of half an inch to the foot. He shall provide such watercloset with proper doors and fastenings. Provided always that this Bye-law shall not apply to any watercloset constructed below the surface of the ground and approached directly from an area or other open space available for purposes of ventilation, measuring at least forty superficial feet in extent, and having a distance across of not less than five feet, and not covered in otherwise than by a grating or railing. 2.—Every person who shall construct a watercloset in connection with a building, whether the situation of such watercloset be or be not within or partly within such building, and every person who shall construct an earthcloset in connection with a building, shall construct in one of the walls of such watercloset or earthcloset which shall abut upon the public way, yard, garden or open space, as provided by the preceding Bye-law, a window of such dimensions that an area of not less than two square feet, which may be the whole or part of such window, shall open directly into the external air. He shall, in addition to such window, cause such watercloset or earthcloset to be provided with adequate means of constant ventilation by at least one air brick built in an external wall of such watercloset or earthcloset, or by an airshaft, or by some other effectual method or appliauce. 51 3.—Every person who shall construct a watercloset in connection with a building, shall furnish such watercloset with a cistern of adequate capacity for the purpose of flushing, which shall be separate and distinct from anv cistern used for drinking purposes, and shall be so constructed, fitted and placed, as to admit of the supply of water for use in such watercloset so that there shall not be any direct connection between any service pipe upon the premises and any part of the apparatus of such watercloset other than such flushing cistern. Provided always that the foregoing requirement shall be deemed to be complied with in any case where the apparatus of a watercloset is connected for the purpose of flushing with a cistern of adequate capacity, which is used solely for flushing waterclosets or urinals He shall construct or fix the pipe and union connecting such flushing cistern with the pan, basin, or other receptacle with which such watercloset may be provided, so that such pipe and union shall not in any part have an internal diameter of less than one inch and a quarter. He shall furnish such watercloset with a suitable apparatus for the effectual application of water to any pan, basin, or other receptacle with which such apparatus may be connected and used, and for the effectual flushing and cleansing of such pan, basin, or other receptacle, and for the prompt and effectual removal therefrom, and from the trap connected therewith, of any solid or liquid filth which may from time to time be deposited therein. He shall furnish such watercloset with a pan, basin, or other suitable receptacle of non-absorbent material, and of such shape, of such capacity, and of such mole of construction as to receive and contain a sufficient quantity of water, and to allow all filth which may from time to time be deposited in such pan, basin, or receptacle, to fall free of the sides thereof and directly into the water received and contained in such pan, basin, or receptacle. He shall not construct or fix under such pan, basin, or receptacle, any " container " or other similar fitting. He shall construct or fix immediately beneath or in connection with such pan, basin, or other suitable receptacle, an efficient syphon trap, so constructed that it shall at all times maintain a sufficient water seal between such pan, basin, or other suitable receptacle, and any drain or soil pipe in connection therewith. He shall not construct or fix in or in connection with the watercloset apparatus any D trap or other similar trap. If he shall construct any watercloset or shall fix or fit any trap to any existing watercloset or in connection with a soil pipe, which is itself in connection with any other watercloset, he shall cause the trap of every such watercloset to be ventilated into the open air at a point as high as the top of the soil pipe, or into the soil pipe at a point above the highest watercloset connected with such soil pipe, and so that such ventilating pipe shall have in all parts an internal diameter of not less than two inches, and shall be connected with the arm of the soil pipe at a point not less than three and not more than twelve inches from the highest part of the trap and on that side of the water seal which is nearest to the soil pipe. 52 4.—Any person who shall provide a soil pipe in connection with a building to be hereafter erected shall cause such soil pipe to be situated outside such building, and any person wbo shall provide or construct or refit a soil pipe in connection with an existing building, shall, whenever practicable, cause such soil pipe to be situated outside such building, and, in all cases where such soil pipe shall be situated within any building, shall construct such soil pipe in drawn lead, or of heavy cast iron joiuted with molten lead and properly caulked. He shall construct such soil pipe so that its weight, in proportion to its length and internal diameter, shall be as follows Lead. Iron. Diameter. Weight per 10 feet length. Not less than Weight per 6 feet length. Not less than inches 65 lbs. 48 lbs. 4 „ 74 „ 54 „ 5 „ 92 „ 69 „ 6 „ 110 „ 84 „ Every person who shall provide a soil pipe outside or inside a building shall cause such soil pipe to have an internal diameter of not less than three and a half inches, and to be continued upwards without diminution of its diameter, and (except where unavoidable) without any bend or angle being formed in such soil pipe, to such a height and in such a position as to afford by means of the open end of such soil pipe a safe outlet for foul air, and so that such open end shall in all cases be above the highest part of the roof of the building to which the soil pipe is attached, and where practicable, be not less than three feet above any window within twenty feet measured in a straight line from the open end of such soil pipe. He shall furnish the open end of such soil pipe with a wireguard covering, the openings in the meshes of which shall be equal to not less than the area of the open end of the soil pipe, In all such cases where he shall connect a lead trap or pipe with an iron soil pipe or drain, he shall insert between such trap or pipe and such soil pipe or drain a brass thimble, and he shall connect such lead trap or pipe with such thimble by means of a wiped or over-cast joint, and he shall connect such thimble with the iron soil pipe or drain by means of a joint made with molten lead, properly caulked. In all cases where he shall connect a stoneware trap or pipe with a lead soil pipe, he shall insert between such stoneware trap or pipe and such soil pipe a brass socket or other similar appliance, and he shall connect such stoneware trap or pipe by inserting it into such socket, making the joint with Portland cement, and he shall connect such socket with the lead soil pipe, by means of a wiped or overcast joint. In all cases where he shall connect a stoneware trap or pipe with an iron soil pipe or drain, he shall insert such stoneware trap or pipe into a socket on such iron soil pipe or drain, making the joint with Portland cement. 53 He shall so construct such soil pipe that it shall not be directly connected with the waste of any bath, rain-water pipe, or of any sink other than that which is provided for the reception of urine or other excremental filth, and he shall construct such soil pipe so that there shall not be any trap in such soil pipe or between the soil pipe and any drain with which it is connected. 5.—A person who shall newly fit or fix any apparatus in connection with any existing watercloset, shall, as regards such apparatus and its connection with any soil pipe or drain, comply with such of the requirements of the foregoing bye-laws as would be applicable to the apparatus so fitted or fixed if the watercloset were being newly constructed. 14.—Every person who shall intend to construct any watercloset, earthcloset, or privy, or to fit or fix in or in connection with any watercloset, earthcloset, or privy any apparatus or any trap or soil pipe, shall, before executing any such works, give notice in writing to the Clerk of the Sanitary Authority. 28.—Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of Five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further penalty of Forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the Court before whom any complaint may be made, or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if the Court think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law. By order, Vestry Clerk. Note.—The Vestry are empowered to open ground, to inspect any drain, or works connected therewith, that may be covered over. In order to avoid the annoyance and inconvenience occasioned by opening ground aud uncovering work, persons executing such work, when it is ready for covering, should forthwith give notice to that effect to the Medical Officer of Health, when it will be inspected in due course. If on inspection of any work ordered by the Yestry it is found that the order of the Yestry has been departed from in any particular, the person so offending is liable to a penalty not exceeding Ten pounds; and if such person, after notice from the Vestry, neglect to amend such work, the Vestry may amend it at the expense of the person so offending. 54 SAINT PANCRAS, COUNTY OF LONDON. Health Department. Duties of Sanitary Inspectors as to Drainage. 1.—Whenever it shall be necessary to apply tests for the purpose of ascertaining any defect in any drain or apparatus connected therewith, the Sanitary Inspector shall in the first place use approved odour teats; if it be necessary to confirm or to approximately localise any defect, the Inspector may use approved smoke tests; if it be further necessary to more exactly ascertain and localise any defect, the Sanitary Inspector may open the ground, with the consent of the Medical Officer of Health or Chief Clerk of the Health Department, but not otherwise. No water test shall be applied, except by direction of the Medical Officer of Health. 2.—If for the purpose of ascertaining or localising any defect, or for prescribing the remedies requisite to abate any drain nuisance, it be necessary that the ground be opened up and the course of the drain exposed, a written intimation or cautionary notice shall be served upon the owner or occupier to open the drain at points to be specified by the Sanitary Inspector, and to do such work as may be necessary to abate the nuisance. 3.—If this intimation be not complied with, a notice pursuant to statute shall be served upon the owner or occupier of the intention of the officers of the Sanitary Authority to enter and ascertain the course of the drain, and examine any works and apparatus connected therewith, at the expiration of twenty-four hours. If, on examination, any such work is found not to be in proper order or condition, or not to have been made or provided in accordance with the regulations and bye-laws of the Authority, the expenses of the examination shall be required to be repaid by the offender to the Health Committee, and the Health Committee shall enforce payment, or report to the Vestry the reasons against such enforcement. 4.—Whenever a Sanitary Inspector discovers any nuisance which may appear to arise from any drain or work or apparatus connected therewith, within any premises of which the Vestry may be the owner or occupier, or when he shall discover upon private premises the existence of any sewer belonging to the Vestry, he shall report the same to the Medical Officer of Health, without serving any notice. 5.—If unnecessary delay occur in remedying defects in any drain or work or apparatus connected therewith upon private premises, after due notice has been given to the owner or occupier to execute the necessary work, and theHealth Committee or any Magistrate decide in any particular case that delay is inexpedient, the Sanitary Authority shall forthwith carry out the said work in accordance with any bye-laws or regulations of the Yestry. 6.—Cautionary notices or written intimations shall be served upon occupiers or owners for the purpose of abating nuisances arising from any drain or work or apparatus connected therewith. All cases of non-compliance therewith shall be reported to the Health Committee, and upon the instruction of the Committee statutory notices shall be served by the Sanitary Inspectors. All notices shall as far as possible specify the works required to be done. 55 7. —The Sanitary Inspectors shall supervise all drainage work upon private premises, and this supervision shall extend to the limit of such premises. 8.—No ventilating or other pipe shall be allowed to project over any public way without special consent officially obtained. 9.—Whenever it shall be necessary to alter the level or course of any underground drain on private premises, or to lay a new drain from the sewer, the Sanitary Inspector shall instruct the owner or his agent to give notice and furnish a plan to the Health Department in accordance with the regulations and bye-laws relating to house drainage. 10.—The Sanitary Inspector shall, when necessary, instruct an owner or his agent that, before beginning to lay or dig out the foundation of any new house or building, or to rebuild any house or building, and before making or reconstructing any drain for the purpose of draining into any sewer, seven days' notice must be given to the Vestry on forms to be obtained, such notice to be accompanied by a plan, shewing the position and size of the proposed drain and all connections therewith. He shall also instruct every person who shall intend to construct any watercloset, earthcloset, or privy, or to fit or fix in or in connection with any watercloset, earthcloset, or privy, any apparatus, or any trap or soil pipe, that, before executing any such works, he must give notice in writing to the Health Department, Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. 11.—The notice and plan having been forwarded to the Health Department it shall be the duty of the Sanitary Inspector to forthwith verify the measurements and plan of the premises and of the drains and works connected therewith, to check the scale and sign the plan as "examined" and deliver it up to the Medical Officer of Health, who shall forward the same to the Engineer for approval. 12.—Upon the completion of the work as set forth in the plan, the Sanitary Inspector shall sign the plan as "completed." Notice of Construction or Amendment.—By Bye-law 14 of the London County Council, it is made compulsory to give notice to the Authority when any person intends to construct any watercloset, or to fit any apparatus, trap, or soil pipe, the object being that the work shall be supervised by an Officer of the Sanitary Authority, in order that he may see that it is executed in a proper manner in compliance with the Bye-laws and Regulations, and also in order to avoid the necessity of resorting to Sec. 42 of the Publio Health (London) Act, 1891, which runs thus:— If a watercloset or drain is so constructed or repaired as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, the person who undertook or executed such construction shall, unless he shows that such construction or repair was not due to any wilful act, neglect, or default, be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds. Provided that where a person is charged with an offence under this section he shall be entitled, upon information duly laid by him, to have any other person, being his agent, servant, or workman, whom he charges as the actual offender, brought before the court at the time appointed 56 for hearing the charge, and if he proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had used due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence, and that the said other person committed the offence without his knowledge, consent, or connivance, he shall be exempt from any fine, and the said other person may be summarily convicted of the offence. Sewers.— During the year 8181 feet of pipe sewer and 220 feet of brick sewer were constructed, and a number of repairs also executed. Public Sanitary Conveniences.—Section 45 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, regulates these structures, and it will be observed that sub-section (2) gives the Sanitary Authority additional power over urinals, etc., erected by publicans and others. The proper maintenance of these conveniences so that they may not become a nuisance is a matter of considerable importance to the convenience and health of the public. (1) Where a Sanitary Authority provide and maintain any public lavatories, ash-pits, or sanitary conveniences, such authority may— (a) Make regulations with respect to the management thereof, and bye-laws as to the decent conduct of persons using the same; and (b) Let the same for any term not exceeding three years at such rent, and subject to such conditions, as they may think fit; and (c) Charge such fees for the use of any lavatories or closets provided by them as they may think proper. (2) No public lavatory, ash-pit, or sanitary convenience shall be erected in or accessible from any street without the consent in writing of the Sanitary Authority, who may give their consent upon such terms as to the use thereof, or the removal thereof, at any time, if required by the Sanitary Authority, as they may think fit. (3) If any person erects a lavatory, ash-pit, or sanitary convenience in contravention of this section, and after notice to that effect served by the Sanitary Authority does not remove the same, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which the offence continues after a conviction for the offence. (4) Nothing in this section shall extend to any lavatory or sanitary convenience now or hereafter erected by any railway Company within their railway-station yard, or the approaches thereto. REGENT'S CANAL. Several thousands of tons of deposit were removed from the water-way of the Regent's Canal by the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company, and from the lay-byes, docks, and basins of the Canal by the owners or occupiers, and in October the water-way of the Canal was found to be fairly clear from Chalk Farm to the Zoological Gardens, and down to the Cumberland Basin. 57 The sewer constructed conjointly at the expense of your Vestry and the Vestry of St. Marylebone, to divert the drainage of the Zoological Gardens from the Regent's Canal into the main sewers of the District, completes the protection of that artificial stream from pollution, so far as lies within the power of your Vestry. REFUSE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL. The following are the numbers of the dust complaints received each quarter during the past four years:— 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1st quarter 6812 8404 49 16 2nd „ +5170 *1867 60 152 3rd „ 3092 26 2 45 4th „ 3571 38 11 11 Total 18,645 10,335 122 224 † Transferred. * New system introduced. The complaints are mostly due to neglect of the dustmen to call at the proper weekly period, and hence are more numerous at the commencement of the second quarter, when the new contracts come into force. In case of complaint a special default cart is at once sent and the extra cost is defrayed by the defaulting contractor. The liability of the Authority is contained in Sec. 30 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— Sec. 30.— (1) It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority— (a) To secure the due removal at proper periods of house refuse from premises, and the due cleansing out and emptying at proper periods of ash-pits and of earthclosets, privies, and cesspools (if any), in the district, and the giving of sufficient notice of the times appointed for such removal, cleansing out, and emptying, and (b) Where the house refuse is not removed from any premises in the district at the ordinary period, or any ash-pit, earthcloset, privy, or cesspool in or under any building in the district is not cleansed out at the ordinary period, and the occupier of the premises serves on the Authority a written notice requiring the removal of such refuse, or the cleansing out or emptying of the ash-pit, earthcloset, privy, or cesspool, as the case may be, to comply with such notice within forty-eight hours after that service, exclusive of Sundays and public holidays. (2) If a Sanitary Authority fail without reasonable cause to comply with this Section, they shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds. 58 (3) If any person in the employ of the Sanitary Authority, or of any contractor with the Sanitary Authority, demands from an occupier or his servant any fee or gratuity for removing any house refuse from any premises, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings. The ordinary period mentioned in the above Sec. 30 (1) (b) is that named in Bye law 7 of the Bye-laws of the London County Council, under Sec. 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as to the removal and disposal of refuse. "The Sanitary Authority shall cause to be removed not less frequently than once in every week the house-refuse produced on all premises within their district." Some occupiers appear to think that, although a heavy penalty may be imposed upon the Authority for not causing the house-refuse to be removed every week, they, on the contrary, may keep the refuse as long as they think fit; but this is not so, as the following section of the Metropolis Local Management Act shows the intention of the Legislature:— Sec. 126.— Any occupier of any house or land, or other person, who refuses or does not permit any soil, dirt, ashes, or filth to be taken away by the scavengers appointed by or contracting with any Vestry or Board, as aforesaid, or who obstructs the said scavengers in the performance of their duty, shall for every such offence forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding £5. As the Destructor erected by your Yestry will shortly come into use, attention may be called to the following Bye-laws made under Sec. 30 (1) (b) of the Public Health (Loudon) Act. 1891., by the London County Council as to the removal and disposal of refuse:— 8.—Where, for the purposes of subsequent removal, any cargo, load, or collection of offensive refuse has been temporarily brought to or deposited in any place within a sanitary district, the owner (whether a Sanitary Authority or any other person) or consignee of such cargo, load, or collection of refuse, or any person who may have undertaken to deliver the same, or who is in charge of the same, shall not without a reasonable excuse permit or allow or cause such refuse to remain in such place for a longer period than twenty-four hours. Provided (a) that this Bye-law shall not apply in cases where the place of temporary deposit is distant at least one hundred yards from any street, and is distant at least three hundred yards from any building or premises used wholly or partly for human habitation, or as a school, or as a place of public worship or of public resort or public assembly, or from any building or premises in or on which any person may be employed in any manufacture, trade, or business, or from any public park or other open space dedicated or used for the purposes of recreation, or from any reservoir or stream used for the purposes of domestic water supply; (b) that this Bye-law shall not prohibit the deposit, within the prescribed distances, of road-slop unmixed with stable manure for any period not exceeding one week, which may be necessary for the separation of water therefrom. 59 9.—Where a Sanitary Authority, or some person on their behalf, shall remove any offensive refuse from any street or premises within their district, such Sanitary Authority or such person shall properly destroy by fire or otherwise dispose of such refuse in such manner as to prevent nuisance. Provided always that this Bye-law shall not be deemed to require or permit any Sanitary Authority or person to dispose of or destroy by fire any night-soil, swine's-dung, or cow-dung. 10.—A Sanitary Authority, or any person on their behalf, who shall remove anv offensive refuse from any street or premises within their district shall not deposit such refuse, otherwise than in the course of removal, at a less distance than three hundred yards from any two or more buildings used wholly or partly for human habitation, or from any building used as a school, or as a place of public resort or public assembly, or in which any person may be employed in any manufacture, trade or business, or from any public park or other open space dedicated or used for the purpose of recreation, or from any reservoir or stream used for the purposes of domestic water supply. Provided always that this Bye-law shall not be deemed to prohibit such deposit of such refuse for a period of twenty-four hours, when such refuse is deposited for the purpose of being destroyed by fire, in accordance with any Bye-law in that behalf. 11.—For the purposes of the foregoing Bye-laws, the expression "offensive refuse "means any refuse, whether "house refuse," "trade refuse," or "street refuse," in such a condition as to be or to be liable to become offensive. 12.—Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing Bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the Court before whom any complaint may be made, or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence, may, if the Court think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this Bye-law. Private Ways.—In connection with the condition of certain classes of dwellings, workshops, etc., the condition of the approaches has frequently engaged the attention of the View Sub-Committee of the Health Committee. It is somewhat difficult to know whether mews, alleys, courts, yards, etc., are in certain instances private or public places. Usage by several tenants of the same or of different houses does not appear to convert such places into public places Neither does the fact of the Vestry lighting them appear to render them public. There appears to be some doubt as to the effect upon private claims when your Vestry removes refuse from and cleanses such places. On the other hand, when paved by your Vestry it would appear that they then become actually public. The Statutes that bear upon these points are 57 George III., chap. 39, sec. 72, and the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855, sees. 92, 98, 99, and 100. 60 SUMMONSES Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Metropolis Local Management Acts, Factory and Workshop Acts, and Housing of the Working Classes Act.

The feature of the year in sanitary legislation was the passing of the Metropolitan Building Act, which contains numerous provisions of a sanitary character with regard to air-space, ventilation, light, and other matters. These are contained in Part V. of the Act, but sections 13 (5), and sections 69 and 70 are equally important. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN F. J.
