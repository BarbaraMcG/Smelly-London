Gentlemen, I beg to submit for your information the following summary of proceedings for the removal of Nuisances, and the number of Sanitary Works executed during the year ending March, 1867, all independent of and distinct from what has been done under the direction of the Special Sanitary Committee. In consequence of the death of Mr. Kirkham, your late Inspector of Nuisances, I am sorry to say that I cannot give you the number of houses inspected by him during the year. 81 Cesspools have been abolished. 292 proper Water Closets have been erected, all provided with proper trapped soil pans, and properly drained to the Sewers. 160 House Drains have been cleansed and repaired, also a great many yards have been re-paved so as to improvo the surface drainage. Dust-bins have been provided for 34 houses, and 73 houses that had been the seat of contagious disease were thoroughly lime-washed. The number of Sanitary Works executed since the establishment of the Vestry are as follows:—3,521 Cesspools have been abolished; 5,347 proper Water Closets have been erected, and all properly drained to the Sewers; 2,707 House Drains have been cleansed and repaired; 991 Dust-bins have been provided. During the year 1866 there were 1,468 applications to have dust removed, which were all promptly attended to. I am Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN ROBINSON, Assistant Inspector. Vestry Offices, 17th July, 1867. 17 The committee to whom it was referred "to consider if any and what "alterations should he made in the arrangements of the Office of "Inspector of Nuisances," after a very careful consideration of the subject, reported to the Vestry as follows:— They are firmly of opinion that the sanitary duties of the Vestry would require the undivided attention of two Officers, to be entirely under the direction of the Medical Officer of the Vestry, one as Chief Sanitary Inspector, to inspect dwellings, to determine the works necessary, to lay his recommendations before the committee, see to their proper and due execution, &c.; to recover the costs, to take and conduct all proceedings before the Magistrate, to superintend the inspection of Cowhouses, Slaughter-houses, Bake-houses, Firework makers and other dangerous trades coming under the Vestry's supervision, as well as an inspection of the perishable food sold to the poor—a most important matter at all times, especially during the prevalence of epidemics—and to keep all books and records necessary in his department; he should not be over 45 years of age, active and intelligent, and capable of conducting a case before the Magistrate against the legal advisers of the defendant, in respect of which duty it may be observed that the 48th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, authorizes the appointment of such officer by the Vestry, who need not be in the legal profession. And that the salary to be paid to such Officer be £130 per annum. That the other officer should be an Assistant Sanitary Inspector, to make out and serve Notices, and to actually inspect the Works while in progress, whether done by the Owners or the Vestry, and to report all cases of the observance of Vestry's orders, in order that the Chief Officer might take the necessary steps to enforce them, and generally to act under the orders of the Chief Officer and the Sanitary Committee, and that the salary to be given to such Officer be £80 per annum, and that a suitable livery be annually provided. Acting upon this Report, the Vestry at their meeting on Tuesday, the 18th day of June, 1867, appointed Mr. Thomas Dennis, of 95 Paul Street, as a Chief Sanitary Officer, and Mr. John Robinson as an Assistant Inspector of Nuisances, to perform the duties mentioned in such report, and at the salaries as recommended. 18 Bills in Parliament, Session 1866-7.

In July, 1866, the Vestry received an Order of Council, dated the 21st July, giving power for the adoption of measures for the preservation of the health of the inhabitants, and the treatment of Cholera, also that the "Diseases Prevention Act" should, after such date, be put in force in England. The Vestry also received a copy of the Regulations as issued by the Lords of the Privy Council, for the sanitary arrangements to be made with regard to the treatment of Cholera or Diarrhoea. The Vestry, at their meeting on the 31st day of July, 1866, appointed a committee to consist of the Churchwardens and eighteen members of the Vestry, to put in force the regulations contained in the Order in Council, and with full powers to adopt such measures as they might think fit, or as the Medical Officer might advise, for the preservation of the health of the inhabitants of the Parish. The following persons were appointed to form the committee to be called the "Committee of Health," and that three members constitute a quorum. Mr. W. A. H. HOWS Mr. CHARLES PITT The Churchwardens. Mr. OWEN Mr. DEATH Mr. WARREN „ FELL „ WALKER „ C. STEVENS „ SARSON „ T. TURNER „ LARGE Rev. G. P. POWNALL „ ATKINS „ BAKER „ H. KELLY „ LINES „ CHAMBERS Mr. SYER „ EMMS „ E. KING The committee held their first meeting on Thursday, the 22nd August, 1866, and continued their meetings weekly until the 21st day of November, 1866, when the following Report was agreed to and ordered to be presented to the Vestry. 23 SAINT LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. Vestry Offices, 37, Hoxton Square, November, 1860. REPORT Of the Committee appointed to put in force the regulations contained in the Order of Council, of the 21st July, 1860, with full power to adopt such measures as they may think fit, or as the Medical Officer may advise for the preservation of the health of the inhabitants, and for the treatment of Cholera and Diarrhoea patients. An Order of the Privy Council was passed on the 21st July, 1866, stating that the "Diseases Prevention Act, 1855," and the amending Act, 23rd and 24th Vic., cap. 77, should from and after the date of such order, be put in force within the whole and every part of England. The Lords of the Privy Council also issued certain directions and regulations to be in force within the Metropolis so long as the provisions aforesaid should be in force under the said order. In consequence of such order, a special Meeting of the Vestry was held on the 31st day of July, 1866, when the above order was considered 24 and a Report by your Medical Officer, establishing the prevalence of Cholera in the parish, having been read: A Committee consisting of the churchwarden and eighteen members of the Vestry was appointed, with authority to make the necessary arrangements to carry out the regulations as requested by the Order of the Privy Council. Your committee met on Thursday, the 2nd day of August, 18G6, and in order to carry into effect the object contained in the reference from the Vestry, of the 31st July, 1866, proceeded to make the necessary arrangements for that purpose, as follows : 1.—That the parish should be sub-divided into six districts. 2—That a Medical Visitor should be appointed for each district, as follows: Dr. Buss, 56, Holywell-street—Holywell district „ Leonard, Tabernacle-square—Hoxton Old Town ,, Griffith, 79, New North-road—Hoxton New Town ,, Burchell, 2, Kingsland-road—St. Leonard's ,, Wallace, 243, Hackney-road—Haggerstone West „ Greenwood, 26, Queen's-road—Haggerstone East That six Dispensaries, being the surgeries of the six medical visitors, be open day and night, for affording advice and medicines to any persons attacked with Diarrhoea or Cholera. That placards and hand-bills be issued, giving public notice that such dispensaries were open, and also containing other directions as to the course to be adopted for the prevention of disease. 3.—That the remuneration to be given to such medical officers, be at the rate of £l 1s. per day, to include the medicine supplied. 4.—That six Assistant Medical Visitors should be appointed for each of the before-named districts, to make an inspection of the sanitary condition of the parish, and report daily thereon to the medical officer of the Vestry: and that the remuneration to be paid to each assistant, 25 should be at the rate of £1 4s. each per week. The following gent emen were appointed, viz : Mr. Hatch, for the district of St. Leonard's „ Strong, ditto Hoxton Old Town ,, Morgan, ditto Haggerstone East „ Aston, ditto Hoxton New Town „ Berry, ditto Holywell „ Aylwin, ditto Haggerstone West That such assistant medical visitors, under the instructions of the medical officer, had made a house to house visitation, and had reported every place requiring sanitary improvements. That such cases had been copied for the use of the inspectors into a book, provided for that purpose, and the necessary sanitary improvements were being carried out. That medical visitors made daily reports to the medical officer of health of the new cases of diarrhoea, choleraic diarrhoea, and cholera, attended by them. These reports supplied information as to the localities where disease arose, as well as of the extent to which it prevailed. These reports were summarised weekly in the form of tables, which were printed. The first report gave the sickness-returns for the week ending on the 12th August. The last for the week ending on the 21st October, when the services of the district medical visitors were discontinued. During these eleven weeks, the medical visitors attended to 7,449 cases of diarrhoea, 806 cases of choleraic diarrhoea, and 148 of cholera. Many cases applied directly to the dispensaries and many were discovered by the assistant medical visitors in the course of their house to house visitations, and thus received immediate care. During the interval from the 7th July to the 10th November, namely 18 weeks, which includes the entire period of prevalence of the epidemic, 170 deaths from cholera, including choleraic diarrhoea were registered. This number includes, not only the deaths registered in Shoreditch, but also the deaths of persons attacked in Shoreditch and removed to 26 the London, or to the Temporary Cholera Hospital. These amounted to 5 deaths in the London Hospital and 38 in the Temporary Cholera Hospital. The total number of patients admitted from Shoreditch into the Commercial Street Hospital was 80. It is a remarkable fact, that in the epidemic of 1849, the deaths in Shoreditch amounted to 889 out of a population of 83,132, being one per cent. or 10 in a 1,000, which was precisely the same rate of mortality as that which occurred during the same epidemic in Bethnal Green. During that epidemic the mortality from cholera in Whitechapel was 7 in a 1,000, and in St. George's in the East 5 in 1000. During the recent epidemic the loss in Bethnal Green has been about 7 in 1000; in Whitechapel 10 in 1000; and in St. George's 7 in 1000; proportions not materially differing from those of 1849. On the other hand, the loss in Shoreditcli scarcely exceeded 1 in 1000, being only ten per cent. of the loss sustained during the epidemic of 1849. The epidemic of 1854, was less severe than that of 1849. But both differed from that of 18G6, in being more equally distributed over the metropolis. In 1854, the mortality in Shoreditcli equalled 2 in 1000 of population, it was 2 in 1000 in Bethnal Green, 4 in 1000 in Whitechapel, and 3 in 1000 St. George's in the East. The committee think they are justified in regarding it as a subject for thankfulness, that the epidemic which raged so severely in the districts immediately adjoining Shoreditcli, has caused a mortality so small as 170 compared with the loss experienced in former epidemics in this district, they venture to believe that it affords some presumption of an improved sanitary condition and of the operation of an effective sanitary administration. 5.—That the necessary arrangements with regard to the destruction of infected clothing, had been made and carried out, under the superintendence of the assistant-inspector, Mr. Robinson. 6.—That communications had been made to the water companies, 27 questing a better supply of water, and the companies had promised to attend to the requests of the committee. That on the 15th August, 1866, your committee appointed Mr. Thomas Spurin an additional assistant inspector, at 30s. a week, it being considered necessary in consequence of the accumulation of work required to be carried out by the sanitary inspectors. That on the 15th August, by the advice of the medical officer to the Vestry, your committee gave instructions to the Surveyor to the Vestry to provide a temporary Mortuary in the stone yard, in Hoxton street, for the temporary reception of the bodies of persons who had died of cholera, which orders were carried out; the expense of which will be found at the end of this report. That your committee have examined into the several applications that have been made to them from time to time, for compensation for the destruction of infected clothing, and having had the evidence of the inspector, under whose superintendence this duty had been carried out, they have awarded to the applicants the following amounts, viz: Fredk.

Your committee have reported to the Yestry as to the arrears of sanitary business in the parish, with suggestions as to the remedies which in their opinion are expedient; and which report is now under your consideration. Your committee have been informed by the medical officer, that the temporary Hospital for cholera patients in Commercial-street, was closed on Saturday, the 3rd inst.; and they cannot make this report, without expressing to the officers managing the arrangements of that establishment, and all the persons connected therewith, their grateful acknowledg ment for the benefit received by the poor of this parish, and they have instructed the clerk to communicate such acknowledgments to the proper quarter. Your committee have also had their attention drawn to the great benefit that would be derived by substituting in the place of a temporary Hospital, a permanent institution, to be erected as near as possible to the parish of Shoreditch, for the reception of all cases of fever arising within the eastern districts of the metropolis, and which suggestion your committee has forwarded to the Honorary Secretary of the late temporary Cholera Hospital. Your committee feel, at this stage of its proceedings, it cannot help expressing its satisfaction at the manner in which its orders have been carried into execution by the several officers under their control, who have been most assiduous in their efforts to perform the duties entrusted to them. Your committee beg to lay before the Vestry, an account of the expenses 30 incurred in carrying into effect the orders and regulations required under the Orders of the Privy Council, of the 21st July, 1866.

The committee consider that those services are deserving not only of public recognition, but merit pecuniary compensation. The committee have not thought it expedient to suggest any sum for adoption, but recommend the question to the consideration of the Vestry. T. SIMPSON EVANS, Vicar. Chairman.
