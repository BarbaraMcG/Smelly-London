PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, MUNICIPAL OFFICES, SPA ROAD, S.E.16. Borough of Bermondsey. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Bermondsey. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1948. Great changes have taken place during the year resulting from the passage of the National Health Service Act, and I am happy to say that these changes have been accomplished smoothly and easily though no doubt there yet remain a number of adjustments to be made. As a Department, we are sorry to part from those colleagues who have transferred to other services, but their skill and knowledge will be employed, as always, for the benefit of the public, though now in a wider sphere. I wish again to record my thanks to the Members of the Council, to the Chairmen of Committees, and to the staff for their courtesy and help at all times during the year. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, D. M. CONNAN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. AREA. The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres. POPULATION.
