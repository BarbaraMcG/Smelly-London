ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY DAY, 1875. Mb. Chairman and Gentlemen, It is now my duty to place before you another Annual Report. This is the 19th year of your endeavours to improve the health and standing of this District; and if during that time your labours have increased in extent and responsibility, so also have increased the health and position of the District. It has been lifted a stage higher in civilization. For the greater part of the year now ended, no change has occurred, in a sanitary point of view, to increase our hope or to induce our despondency. Always, excepting the overhanging threat that Vestries as now established should be abolished. This the Government may do, but there is one thing neither the Government nor any other power can do, and that is, destroy the work done and the good brought about. This is too deeply written in the improved condition of the Districts ever to be effaced by the ebb and flow of events. The name of Vestries may perish, their work never. Progress in sanitary science is manifest. The health of the people occupies the thought and consideration of an ever increasing number ; and more than this, it has claimed the regard of those high in authority, and to whom power belongs. The necessity for its so doing may not be doubted when we have the head of a strong Government declaring that " the sanitary question lies at the bottom of all national well-being." A statement so true and bo important, we should hope and believe cannot but be followed by the most vigorous action : for what can be more necessary than a nation's well-being ? In this the whole duty of a Government is included. The Bills now before Parliament indicate that the Government are serious in their intentions. Only, I fear the promises made will far outrun fulfilment. There are in them many serious faults both of omission and commission, which will make them as difficult to carry out as those they succeed The Adulteration Bill contains terms and expressions which^will render it almost inoperative. This Bill needed revision in many respects. It 10 Parish of Saint George tlio Martyr, Southward. bears bard upon the Inspectors whose duty it is to carry it out. They have to obtain the articles for analyses in a way that is repugnant to an open and manly mode of proceeding, and which must necessarily bring them into collision and discredit. Then the Analyst often appears at fault, and especially with reference to two of the most important articles of food, viz., bread and milk. The appointed Analyst declares that the sample sent is adulterated ; another then is appealed to, who using the same sample declares that such is not the case, but that it is pure. It is very desirable that Chemists should come to a correct and unanimous decision about the mode in which these analyses should be made; or state clearly that their tests cannot be depended on. Discredit falls upon them, and a wide feeling of doubt is spreading concerning the result of the analyses they make. As matters now stand, it behoves Vestries to be very careful about taking proceedings agninst those who deal in adulterated food, inasmuch as should the Chemist fail to prove his case to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, Vestries have to pay the costs. Dr. Tidy confesses that the analysis of fatty matters is very difficult, and that perfection can only be arrived at by constant practice. The milk question is assuming a widening importance in other respects than its wilful adulteration, or as a medium for the propogation of fever. It appears that germs of fungi which are thrown off from putrefying matter mixing with the air, will if breathed by Cattle infect their milk before leaving the udder. Milk has been found tainted from Cows having passed through sloughs of decomposing vegetable substances; under such circumstances particles of dirt adhere to the udders and other parts of the animal, and which fall off during the process of milking, hence germs are introduced into the milk, which speedily decompose and set up putrefaction. Besides these sources by which milk may be rendered injurious, the same evil consequences will follow from Cows drinking water from stagnant ponds, in which various organisms swarm, .as the milk proceeding from these animals will contain the same organisms*. These facts are of vast importance, and teach the necessity of thorough cleanliness in all that concerns our health, and to a far greater degree than we have yet thought necessary. We must have clean air, clean water, and clean food. They also teach us what a large number of unsuspected influences are at work in the production of disease, and over which Vestries have no control. We do not know how far the condition of the animals which supply us with food influences the health of the community. Such influence I believe extends to a more decided and greater degree than we have yet given credit for. Clearly parasites enter and find lodging within us chiefly with our food, and this fact of itself should lead to the exercise of care in this respect. Much animal food unfit for human consumption is sold and eaten. This kind of business is limited mainly to one class of butchers, and is very profitable. As the sanitary laws at present exist, they are very difficult to carry out; they are often involved, contradictory, and capable of different readings, whilst permission has been allowed where compulsion should have been enforced. The Public Health Bill is brought forward to remedy these evils, and may perhaps do so to some extent. But our knowledge is not sufficiently extensive upon which to form efficiently a Bill of this kind. However it is a wise step, and good must follow therefrom. We shall thus approximate nearer and nearer to what is required. * See Army Medical Report for the year 1872. 11 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1874—5. The Artisans' Dwellings Improvement Bill, threatens more towards the pulling down of "Old Rookeries" than it will ever accomplish. It fails in detail what it presents as a whole. However, we cannot tell what changes and improvements may be made in these Bills before they become law. And whilst laws are necessary, we must bear in mind that there are other things equally necessary. The best laws ever thought out and promulgated by the most far-seeing statesman may utterly fail and prove rather a curse than a blessing when forced upon an uninformed and ignorant people. With the passing of laws there should precede or accompany a knowledge of their necessity, and also of the benefits that will follow. "More light" will help on progress, although we always possess more than we put into practice. These and the like measures occasion trouble, disturbance, and what is considered most grievous, an outlay of money. Present expenditure however trifling, will quite overshadow any future prospect of economy. Time will aid by enlightening ignorance and removing prejudice; whilst slowness of growth predicts strength and duration. TABLE No. 1.

The deaths registered were 1287. The deaths of males were 647 and those of females 640. The mortality has only been less in two years of the last ten, and those years were 1872-3 and 1873-4. In the year 1869-70 the deaths registered were 1740. The range of the death rate from the highest to the lowest in those years was 453. The excess of births over deaths in the year ended was 860. This excess was exceeded only in the last year, and that by 117. The death rate for the District was nearly 23 in 1000 persons living, or one death in little more than 43 persons. This speaks plainly of the improved healthy condition of the Parish, whilst at the same time it shows how much more remains to be done. Taking 17 deaths in the 1000 as our present standard, and which is the death rate of two or three of the healthiest districts in England, but which themselves are capable of improvement, then there have perished prematurely 336 men, women, and children, who had this District been in the condition of those mentioned, would not now have been lying in their graves. 12 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southicark.

The variation of the death rate was 32. The highest weekly number of deaths registered was 43, and happened in the first week of this year. The lowest number of deaths was in the 23rd week of 1874, namely, eleven. TABLE No. 3. SUB-DISTRICTS. POPULATION IN 1871. NUMBERS OF DEATHS IN 1874-5.

The population taken is that given by the census of 1871; it is doubtless greater now. TABLE No. 4. 1874-5. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Quarter ending June 545 287 Quarter ending September 518 297 Quarter ending December 532 326 Quarter ending March 572 377 The seasons necessarily affect the health, and consequently the death rate. The 2167 deaths in the whole year occurred as follows. In the three months ending 4th July, 1874, 287; in the three months ending 3rd October, 297; in the three months ending 2nd January, 1875, 326; and in the quarter ending 3rd April, 377. Thus we learn that the quarter endingJuly, 1874, was the most healthy; and the quarter ending April, 1875, was the most fatal. The excess of deaths in the most fatal quarter was 90. Dr. Farr, (Somerset House), speaking of the results of Sanitary improvements carriod out in London, states that "it is gratifying to find, that while the population has gone on increasing, and has grown denser in parts formerly open, the mortality, on the whole, has not increased; on the contrary, it has decreased." He then goes on to say, "Some disappointment may be felt that the mortality of London, which should be below 20, has not descended permanently to that rate: the reason is too obvious, for the water supply is still drawn from the stream of upper Thames, which drains a populous basin, and receives much of its impurities. Then it has been shown that although the main sewers have been well laid, the branch sewers under the district boards, are still imperfect; they are in places ponds of impurities, even in the West End of London. Fine old houses have had vast cesspools laid in the proecloacal age ; and those cesspools in many cases remain undisturbed, exhaling their fumes through the air. The London Building Act, in some respects worse than the Sanitary Acts applying to the country districts, has no adequate clauses to provide for the effectual purity of the new dwellings erected. There is still a want of thoroughness in the London sanitary work, accounting fully for the higher rates of mortality, which look unfavourable by the side of a high standard of salubrity, but favourable as compared with the rates of other cities left in a worse state." In the South of London there has been a decisive improvement. 14 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southward, TABLE No. 5. 1870—1 1871—2 1872—3 1873—4 1874—5 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter i First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter  Small-pox 1 1 2 49 79 22 11 8 10 7 1 ... ... ... 1 ... ... ... ... ...

The former are considered especially preventable; over the latter, depending as they do upon the state of the weather, we do not possess that control. From zymotic diseases there are recorded about half a million of deaths annually in England and Wales, and it is believed that over one-third of these need not occur, was the knowledge we now possess about their causes and operation carried out into practice throughout the land. If these 125,000 attain their final record in the death register, how many are there who suffer but do not die (Simon) ? Those who recover rarely reach the state of health enjoyed previous to the attack. What numbers suffer from partial deafness: as a result, which disqualifies them for the performance of high and important duties for which their intellectual powers gave promise. In some, the brain is damaged, and fits and idiotcy follow, than which, scarcely anything more distressing can happen to the family group. Their evil effects may also be considered in a business point of view, causing as they often do a serious injury to trade, and in some of its divisions almost putting a stop to it. G. W. Hastings, Esq., the President of the Council of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, stated in an address that he delivered to the British Medical Association, that in Worcester, an epidemic of small-pox broke out, which caused such fear and alarm, that the tradesmen experienced great loss from their customers carrying their demands to the neighbouring towns; dreading to enter Worcester. Precisely the same thing happened at Newmarket last year; the shops were deserted; and the market-place was never seen so forsaken within the memory of the living. The commemoration of the 5th of November last year was passed over at Lewes 15 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1874—5. owing to the presence of fever; which omission was perhaps not a reason for regret; but the holding the assizes at Brighton from the same cause, must have inflicted a serious money loss upon Lewes; besides this, the schools have been ruined, and house property greatly depreciated. Fear and injury to business and property, will prove urgent and important agents in the promotion of sanitary reform. They speak plainly, and act rigorously and impartially. I suppose it may not be possible that this class of disease should ever be utterly extirpated. Very much of the fatality it may produce, however, will depend not so much upon the power of the poison germ, as upon the health and sanitary condition of the community it attacks. The germs of these diseases are thought to be organised and living bodies, just as a seed is an organised and living body, and in like manner they possess the power of reproduction when circumstances are favourable for their developement, and increase a million fold. On examining the above table the first thing that arrests attention is, the absence of death from small-pox. In the year 1871-2 there were registered 120 deaths. The following facts will show the importance of vaccination. An epidemic of this disease occurred in Baltimore, U.S., in the years 1871—3. During this time 1246 patients were under observation. Of the 1246 patients 250 shewed satisfactory evidence of vaccination. Among the unvaccinated the deaths were 53 per cent., whilst among the vaccinated only 2 per cent. No death happened where the patient shewed a good mark from vaccination done after puberty. During the past twelve months 55 unvaccinated persons were admitted into the small-pox ward of the Montreal General Hospital, all except 5 suffered from its worst form. Out of these 55, twenty-eight died, giving a mortality of over 50 per cent. Of those who had been vaccinated and showed two fair marks, there were only i deaths in the 100. Seven had more than two good marks, these had the disease in its very mildest form, making a speedy recovery (British Medical Journal). Dr. Doran in his biography of a Lady of the last century, presents to lis a graphic account of the fears and ugliness produced by smallpox. "There were two events" he writes "to which maidens of that time looked forward to as their probable but not equally desirable lot, namely, marriage and small-pox. It happened that a younger sister of this lady (Mrs. Montague) fell ill of the disease at Horton, near Hythe, and was sent away to a friend's in the neighbourhood. When she had recovered so far as to be able to walk out in the fields, Mrs. Montague was allowed to approach her within speaking distance, so that she might talk with her and be assured of her convalescence. The invalid however was veiled, as it was thought better Mrs. Montague should not be shocked by the sight of the devastation which this foul disease had wrought upon the beauty of the sufferer.'' This disease killed in London alone in the year 1871, upwards of 7,900 persons. The mortality from measles was 47, two in excess of the preceding year. The deaths from scarlet fever returned during the year were 51, against 11 and 8 respectively of 1872—3 and 1873—4. This disease killed in 1874, in England and Wales 24,605 persons. The death rate from whooping-cough and diarrhoea was less in both cases than in 1873—4, in the former by 9, and in the latter by 36. Diarrhoea was the most fatal disease of the zymotic class. To fever were referred 18 deaths, 5 in excess of the year 1873—4; excepting that year the mortality was lower than in any year of the preceding ten. From this disease 128 deaths were recorded in the year 1864—5. 16 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Soutliwark. Tt is a satisfactory sign of the improved sanitary condition of the metropolis, to find that the deaths referred to fever have steadily declined from 3,073 in 1864, to 1,691 in 1871. (Dr. Farr).

Consumption has caused 131 deaths, two more than in the preceding year. This disease as regards mortality stands second on the list. Tabes, the consumption of children, has killed 62; from this disease there died 24 more than in 1873—4. The deaths recorded from brain and nerves were 190; these were 8 in excess of the year 1873—4. Convulsions have proved the most fatal of this class, to them were referred 94 deaths, of which 71 were under one year of age. Lung diseases (including consumption) gave the largest mortality of all classes ; they caused 295 deaths. Bronchitis heads the death column. One hundred and thirty-one were under five years of age, whilst 8 were 80 years and upwards. The deaths trom the digestive organs offer little variation from year to year. They have been 4 in excess of the previous year. Out of the 1287 deaths, there were registered 37 from violence and privation. From premature birth and debility there sank 34. 17 infants were suffocated, their ages ranging from 18 days to 5 months. Seven died from fractures and contusions; six males aged respectively, 2, 35, 44, 49, and 64 years, and one female aged 5 years. Two infants were found dead in the streets. The skull of one was fractured. A child aged 5 months was starved to death. A verdict of wilful murder was returned in the two last cases. A male aged 2 years was choked whilst eating bread and milk. A female aged 19 years was poisoned. A male aged 4 years died from the effects of a scald, by overturning a saucepan of boiling water over himself. A male aged 50 years hung himself. 17 Annual Re/port of the Medical Officer of Health—1874—5. Of those who died 669 were under 5 years of age, 351 were from 40 to 80, and 30 were 80 years and upwards; of these one, a female reached the age of 91, and a male that of 96. The question has lately arisen, as to which is the best method of disposing of our dead. There are throe modes by which they may be put out of our sight. 1. By interment; 2. By casting the body into the sea ; and 3. By burning. The disposal of the dead by the latter method has recently been placed before the public in a practical and systematic way; and the criticisms it has given rise to have been more or less wise. I leave the subject for the present, and merely tell you what a sanitary writer living at Bombay says about it, and who has seen it practised. "The mode of disposal of the dead by burning is, in a sanitary point of view, the very best that can be adopted. Nearly the whole of the organic matter; is decomposed at once, and changed into a state in which it is no longer injurious to human life. It is a fortunate circumstance for the health of Bombay that so large a proportion of its inhabitants resort to this mode of disposal of their dead." Interment as now practised is not the best plan which might be employed. That way by which decomposition is hastened and most thoroughly accomplished, is clearly the one that ought to be followed. Some Savage Tribes have apparently thought about this matter, for they expose their dead to be eaten by the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, lest the air, or the earth, or the water should be polluted by them. Committing the body to the grave by no means signifies that it shall remain there in sacred repose. We have seen wagon loads of human bones removed from where they were laid in pious affection, to a distant Cemetery; and the sight has not been limited to this District, or this Metropolis, but has been witnessed in many other Cities and Towns. It would not be satisfactory to examine with too great minuteness to what extent, and for what purposes human remains have been usod. Traffic is now ceaselessly rolling over what were and what are the graves of the dead. Whilst speaking upon this subject, I cannot pass on without noticing the improvements which have beon made in the Churchyard of St. George's, by which it has been rendered more in unison with the fine old Church that it partially surrounds. An uncultivated, neglected burial ground betokens a want of veneration for"'the dead who lie beneath besides exercising a quiet but continuous injury upon the living, either by promoting a lite neglect and want of order, or by exciting indignation at the absence of such veneration. And one may hope that in due time it will be thrown open to the Public, anyhow, as soon as education 3hall have exercised its influence upon the rising generation, so far as to prevent them breaking trees, pulling up flowers, and committing othe mischiefs alike destructive and disgraceful. The Churchyards will prove useful as lesser lungs to the Metropolis as the Parks prove the greater, when this and the like examples have been followed, and when the last remnants of mortality have been decomposed and absorbed by the earth. Nothing will hasten this process more than planting them with tree, flower, and shrub. That which is beautiful is always useful: and no ono can now look upon that "God's Acre" without feeling grateful to the Vestry for what they have in this case done to promote health, recreation, and reverence. 18 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southward. The Disinfecting Apparatus has been used diligently during the year, and I believe with good effect. Any how cleanliness has been promoted thereby. It has been employed in seventy-four cases, consisting of seven hundred and seventy-eight foul beds, mattresses, and other articles which have been freed from pollution, and rendered wholesome. The articles in some cases were utterly valueless, when they were destroyed. TABLE No. 7. NAME OF WATER COMPANY. TONS. NAME OF WATER COMPANY. TONS. 1874. 1874.

The water as regards purity, is not what it should be, and the source from whence it is taken still remains open for discussion. The Thames water is at present defiled by the sewage of a million of people living on its upper banks. At a deputation the other day to the President of the Local Government Board, Dr. Sandwith sententiously said, that, there was no chance for London obtaining pure water until a severance was made between the "vicious circle of the water-closet, the river, and the mouth." There are means of affording the poorer localities a continuous supply without waste which is worthy of trial, and which will shortly be brought under your consideration. TABLE No. 8. 1874-5.

"Where most these diseases prevail, there as a rule will be found the greatest sanitary deficiencies. Our District in its lowest and obscurest quarters, where there is little traffic and where the passers-by are few, affords a home for what are called [the dangerous class. There they are born, and there unheeded they grow up into manhood, and become one of the "rocks ahead." 20 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. I should be sorry to bear harshly upon this class, and justly so, when we think of the life they have had to live, and from which escape seems to have been impossible. "To believe that" they are here only as a nuisance and a terrour to be abraded and abated, and by some permissable manner to be made away with and swept out of sight, is not an amiable faith." There are two factors which exercise power over us, and over which we exercise none: one is, the temperament transmitted to us at our birth; and the other is, the place and surroundings of our birth. To understand their way of life, and fully to sympathise with them, we should needs hare to pass through their experience; for no man can artificially put himself into the dangers, and temptations, and responsibilities of another. What first reaches their tender and undefiled ears? The foulest oaths and blasphemies which our language can afford. As children they grow up as familiar with these, as with the light which shines around them. They are further brutalised by the treatment they receive from their parents, or from those who hold authority over them. And we may conceive their painful and sorrowful fate, should they return empty handed from their raids upon society. There are thousands of Boys who have no home, nor lodgings, nor food, nor one human being amongst the three millions to give them one kind word, one look of sympathy. Any shelter by day, and a dry arch by night supply their dwelling. "Let us think," says that earnest writer the Rev. Baldwin Brown, "let us think tenderly of those myriads of little ones whom the morning light wakes up to hunger, filth, and wretchedness; while the shadows hunt them into lairs, into which you would not couch your beasts." And homes when they possess them, are as unlike what homes should be as it is possible to imagine. They are, as I have previously said, situated in the most unhealthy, the most joyless, and the most wretched parts of a District. They are neglected and dirty to a degree. In them huddle together in filth and raggedness men and women, young and old indiscriminately, that the practice of morality is set at defiance. Every chink and crevice of the rooms are stopped; no outlet is provided for the foul air, nor inlet provided for the fresh; hence they become vitiated with the exhalations from unwashen, ill-fed, and often diseased bodies, with re-breathed air, and with a putrescent substance which is highly injurious and offensive. It is this latter that produces the smell so characteristic of the rooms and the clothes of the poor. These with other gases engendered and impaired are absorbed into the blood, and thence distributed to the brain and nervous system, and indeed to every part of the body, perverting, and almost if not quite abolishing the moral faculties, stunting the intellect and deteriorating the body. How, under such circumstances, can affection, or kindness, or those tender ties which bind families together be developed? Can we expect gentleness, honesty, or the social courtesies of life from such a source? This class are as ignorant of these qualities as the roaming savage of the prairie, or the lowest specimens of humanity met with in Africa or Australia. "I have seen human nature," says an experienced traveller, "in all its forms; it is everywhere the same; but the wilder it is the more virtuous." Such a class dwelling in our midst in this the nineteenth century is a curse and a humiliation. They have been passed by and neglected, and allowed to grovel in ignorance and house together until they have grown up a body threatning to society. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1874 —5. 21 A writer quoting from May hew on the London Poor, says, that there is disclosed here in London a system of depravity, atrocity, and enormity which certainly cannot be paralleled in any nation however barbarous ; in any age however dark. It is the duty of the Government to punish crime, and with a just inflexible rigorousness; yet, this can only be done at an enormous outlay, and with a wide-spread complicated machinory: how much loss the cost would be, and how much more humane, the endeavour to prevent it. If the laws of nature are ignorantly neglected, or selfishly broken we must suffer the penalty: and crime is one of the bitter results. From this penalty there is no escape. The "laws of nature are nothing but the goodwill of God expressed in facts." I often wonder what many of the owners of property think man was created for, except indeed that he should bo housed in foul wretched dwellings, in order that money may be put in their purses, and so they may reap where they have not sown. A grim kind of harvest that will prove. Surely the owners have neither humanity nor justice on their side, when they allow their houses to become hotbeds for the fostering and spreading of disease moral and physical, and in which it is impossible either to maintain cleanliness, or support health, or practise morality. There are thousands of such houses. I look forward hopefully to the benefits which will follow the carrying out of the Education Act; and if all the good we fondly expect should not follow, yet the passing of such a measure is subject for sincerest congratulation. "Education" asserts the greatest of modern writers, "stands on the basis of everlasting duty. "Heavier wrong" than neglect of this, "is not done under the sun. It lasts from year to year from century to century; the blinded sire slaves himself out, and loaves a blinded son; and men made in the image of God, continue as two-legged beasts of labour; and in the largest empire of the world, it is debate whether a small portion of the Revenue of one day shall after thirteen centuries be laid out on it, or not laid out on it." We may rejoice that the state of things which a few years back called forth this vehement and indignant protest does not exist. But merely reading and writing, and working out a sum in arithmetic will hardly suffice. The developement of the intellect alone will not go far in improving man's character, whilst it may aid him in the practice of higher class crime. Teaching must include the developement of all the moral powers inherent in man; also the demonstrations of those laws by which he is governed as a social being, as well as those by which his health is regulated. He must be shown what is the end and object of life and the way by which they may be]best reached. And, so, the bonds of a stupid and sullen thraldom broken he may advance onwards in the race, "and the raw world be drilled for the march of mind." I would not have you suppose that what I am now stating to you, is foreign to your duties as Vestrymen, and to the purpose for which you meet here. It is the very heart and core of them. The only true and lasting foundation upon which the glory and safety of a nation can be built, must be upon the cultivation of the moral and physical powers belonging to man; and we may remember that sanitary science is capacious enough to embrace the whole of such cultivation, and minute enough to carry out its every detail. With the great Dramatist of the old days the Sanitarian may say, "I deem nothing foreign to me which belongs to man." 22 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. Whatever cause that may be which shall injure the bodily system, let it come in what shape or form it may, will injure alike the moral and intellectual systems, and will often be followed by the most important and unforeseen results. Greville, in his memoirs, writing upon the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832, thus comments upon the consequence of a headache that Lord Harrow by happened to be suffering from. "The Capture of Vandamme was the consequence of a belly ache, and the Metropolitan representation depended on a headache. If the truth could be ascertained, perhaps many of the great events in history turn upon aches of one sort or other." It is utterly impossible that the class under consideration can take just and truthful views of life and its responsibilities. If we would calmly and impartially think about these victims of crime and violence, we should be more induced to give them our pity than fling at them our condemnation. But what makes the reflection more sad and disheartening is, that these physical and mental tendencies are increased and perpetuated. They do not die out with the generation in which they are developed. A bad man will bequeath with increased power and tenacity to his childrens' children, the inheritance of his crimes and vices, as he has probably inherited them from those who preceded him, and who may have ended their days in the hulks, or penal settlements, or who may have passed out of the world by the pathway of the gallows. "The hapless sons of hapless sires." Under the most favourable circumstances, before this class can change their character and become honest, orderly, helpful fellow citizens, time will be required. It cannot take place "within the hour glass of one man's life time," but will require many generations. The late Rev. C. Kingsley affirmed, that the process of degeneration was surely going on in every civilized country in the world, and in proportion to its civilization. I should be loath to take such a dreary view of the prospect of our race as this. If civilization has developed the vices of man, it surely has developed his virtues also. But, indeed, as yet we have scarcely entered on the path of civilization. "In the scheme of Providence it may not be meant that man shall be healthy. Disease of mind and body may be the cross he has to bear, or disease may be the evil against which he has to struggle, and whose shackles he has finally to unlose. The last disease will disappear we may well believe when man is perfect. Whether the world is ever to see such a consummation, no man can say; but as ages roll on hope does in some measure grow. In the midst of all our weaknesses, and all our many errors, we are certainly gaining knowledge, and that knowledge tells us in no doubtful terms that the fate of man is in his own hands. It is undoubtedly true that we can, even now, literally choose between health or disease ; not, perhaps, always individually, for the sins of our fathers may be visited on us, or the customs of our life and the claims of our civilization and social customs may gall us, or even our fellow men may deny us health, or the knowledge which leads to health. But, as a rule, man holds his own destiny, and can choose between good and evil; and as time unrolls the scheme of the world, it is not too much to hope that the choice will be for good."
