TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Last year, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Health, I described in detail the measures you have adopted to carry out your obligations under the Port Sanitary Regulations, 1933. It is unnecessary to repeat this information in the present report, and I have, therefore, in the text, dealt only with the special events of 1934. I have included reports by three of your Sanitary Inspectors in regard to certain aspects of the hygiene of crew accommodation in ships and by two of your Food Inspectors in regard to the inspection of canned foods. In the course of their daily work your Inspectors acquire a great deal of practical experience. It is desirable, both in their own interests and that of others engaged in similar work, that they should be given the opportunity to express the opinions they have formed as to the causes of, and the remedies for, the unsatisfactory conditions which come under their notice. Mr. J. D. Hamer, F.I.C., Chief Chemist of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, has submitted some observations on the use of hydrogen cyanide as a fumigant. The tonnage of vessels entering the Port of London during 1934 was 29,373,605 tons, being 1,278,321 tons more than in the previous year. Of the 14,614 vessels arriving from Foreign Ports, 2,065 were boarded and inspected by your Medical Officers. Two hundred and ninety-one vessels arrived in which there had occurred during the voyage a total of 370 cases of Infectious Disease. This total included 114 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, of which 69 were passengers and 45 seamen on articles. In the Training Ships there occurred 3 cases of Scarlet Fever, 2 of Diphtheria, 1 of Chicken-pox and 1 of Mumps. Fifty-six cases were treated in your Hospital at Denton, of which 5 were Scarlet Fever, 2 Diphtheria, 11 Enteric Fever, 13 Measles, 4 Mumps, 15 Chicken-pox, and 6 were cases which were admitted for observation, but which proved to be noninfectious. No case of Plague arrived, and no Plague-infected rats were found in ships or on shore in the Port. Nine hundred and ninety-seven rats from ships and 1,980 rats from shore premises were bacteriologically examined, but in no case was there any suspicion of Plague infection. Seven vessels arrived in which a total of 11 cases of Small-pox had occurred, but no case was actually landed in the Port. Under the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, 77 Notices were issued in respect of 148 parrots; of these, 3 died, 17 were destroyed at the request of the owners, and the remainder were re-exported. Fifty-six parrots were reported to have died and been disposed of at sea. Nine dead parrots were sent to the bacteriological laboratory of the Ministry of Health, but in no case was death due to Psittacosis. Three hundred and ninety-nine parrots, &c., were admitted under Ministry of Health permits. Your Sanitary Inspectors made 20,856 inspections of vessels and 7,065 inspections of shore premises. 10 Two thousand and fifteen sanitary defects were reported in 1,914 vessels and 1,060 in shore premises (vide Appendices XXYI and XXVII.). Fifteen Statutory Notices were served on the Masters of ships in respect of smoke nuisance. The number of vessels fumigated for rat-destruction under the supervision of your Inspectors was 156: 81 by hydrogen cyanide and 75 by sulphur dioxide. By the former method 1,425 rats and 866 mice, and by the latter 1,611 rats and 264 mice were destroyed. No less than 1,521 of this total of 3,036 rats killed in the fumigation of 156 ships were obtained from 10 Greek vessels engaged in the South American grain trade. The average number of rats killed per fumigation was 19.5. If mice are taken into consideration also, the average number of rodents destroyed per fumigation was 26.7. In addition, 2,244 rats were trapped in ships and 4,856 on shore in the Port. The total number of rats destroyed in ships during the year was 1,373 more than in the previous year. This is probably due to the increase in the number of ships entering the Port. The total number of rats caught ashore again shows a slight decrease (55), demonstrating that the rat-repressive measures applied by the Port of London Authority are year by year reducing the rat-population of the Docks. Intimation Notices were served in respect of 20 cases of infringement of Bye-laws relating to offensive cargoes. In each instance the offender took such steps as to render further action unnecessary, but there is much scope for improvement in the manner in which London's refuse is loaded and transported down the Biver to the dumps. The arrangements made with the Port of London Authority whereby the annual re-registration of water barges is made conditional upon the satisfactory report of your Officers as to the fitness of the barges for the carriage of drinking Avater, worked smoothly during the year. No additions were made and no barges were put out of commission, leaving 12 barges in commission at the end of the year. The Boarding Launch "Howard Deighton" has given satisfactory service during the year. In addition to conveying the Boarding Medical Officers to vessels requiring medical inspection on arrival, transporting cases of infectious sickness to your Isolation Hospital, collecting from ships bedding, &c., for disinfection and carrying the Sanitary Inspector on his visits to ships lying in the Lower Biver district, this launch has on several occasions enabled your Officers to render assistance in cases of sudden illness or injury occurring in ships in Gravesend Beach. First aid has been rendered in these cases and the patients have been landed and taken by motor ambulance to the nearest General Hospital. The Motor Launch "Joseph White" was sold early in the year. This necessitated new arrangements for your Committee's visits of inspection. The Port of London Authority very generously placed their Steam Launch "St. Katharine" at your disposal for your down-river inspections and a suitable Launch was hired for up-river visits. The courtesy of the Port of London Authority has enabled your Committee to visit the lower Biver and the Docks much more comfortably and conveniently than has ever been possible before. During the year your Committee, taking into consideration that your district comprised nearly 70 miles of Biver and over 45 miles of Dock quays, came to the conclusion that your Staff of 12 Inspectors should be increased by 2, 1 additional Inspector to be employed on the Docks and 1 on the Biver. To enable the latter to carry out his duties efficiently and expeditiously you decided to build a small motor launch. This launch was delivered from the builder's yard on 17th November, and on 24th November was named "Frederick Whittingham," the ceremony being graciously performed by Mrs. Whittingham. Up to the time of writing, the new launch has given excellent service and has proved to be admirably suited to the work for which she was designed, and very economical in fuel consumption. 11 In August the condition of the Hulk "Hygeia," your Boarding Station at Gravesend, gave cause for anxiety. The vessel was surveyed by consulting engineers, who reported that she was in a very bad condition both forward and aft; that it would be waste of money to carry out any repairs ; that there was no immediate danger of her sinking at her moorings, but that steps should be taken to replace her within twelve months. There appeared to be some prospect that the Customs Jetty at Gravesend would be reconstructed, and that accommodation for your Boarding Launch might be available at a new and longer jetty, the Medical Officer on duty being berthed ashore; but later it became evident that several years might elapse before this scheme could be put into effect, meanwhile the "Hygeia" would undoubtedly have broken up. You therefore decided that the only course open to you was to purchase another hull and lit it up as a Boarding Station. The Office accommodation of your Inspectors in the West India and the Royal Docks had not been satisfactory as, at the time when the provision was made, there was very limited choice in these two districts. In March more suitable Offices became available, and these your Committee decided to rent from the Port of London Authority. Further improvements have been carried out at your Hospital at Denton. An old ward block, built in 1888 and providing 10 beds, has been demolished, and a new block comprising 8 cubicles has been erected. A large Isolation Hospital is not necessary in the Port of London, but provision must be made for (a) the special isolation of cases of Small-pox, (b) the accommodation of a number of cases of any other infectious disease when an epidemic has occurred on board ship, (c) single cases of the common Infectious Diseases such as Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Measles, &c., and for cases of sickness which must be kept under observation before a definite diagnosis can be made; for on board ship the examination of a patient has frequently to be carried out under very unfavourable conditions, the available history of the illness is often very vague, and the patient may not be able to convey to the Medical Officer any account of his symptoms. Your Isolation Hospital is conveniently situated in close proximity to the Boarding Station, and is now designed to meet the above requirements. Special isolation for Small-pox is provided in a small building surrounded by a wire fence near the Eastern boundary of the Hospital and comprising 2 wards each containing 4 beds. When a small epidemic of any other infectious disease has occurred on board ship the cases can be accommodated in the central ward block, where there are 2 wards containing 8 and 4 beds respectively. The usual requirement is, however, for the isolation and treatment of several cases of several different infectious diseases from as many ships. The patients may be passengers of either sex and of any age, or members of crews, British or foreign, white or coloured. It is for this, the ordinary day by day work of the Hospital, that the Cubicle Ward is particularly suitable. The wards of your Hospital are now suitably arranged, well equipped and provide all the accommodation which past experience has shown to be necessary, but the Administration Block, the Laundry, Sewage Disposal Plant and the Grounds still require attention, and your Worshipful Committee proposes to deal with them during 1935. Through the generosity of the Corporation of the City of London, you have been able to replace the old, unsightly wooden fence along the river front of the Hospital by a reinforced concrete wall 15 feet high of substantial construction and imposing appearance. The inspection of imported food is an important part of the work of the Authority, and during 1934, 1,825 tons of foodstuffs were condemned as unfit for human consumption and were either destroyed or disposed of for industrial purposes. The proportion of carcases of mutton examined for Caseous Lymphadenitis remained at 5 per cent. throughout the year; pieces of mutton continued to be subjected to 100 per cent. examination. A proportion of frozen ox tongues imported from South America was examined on arrival, the percentage found to be affected with Actinobacillosis being 0.61. 12 The draft of the proposed Public Health (Imported Food) Amendment Regulations was issued during the year, and your Worshipful Committee made certain representations to the Minister of Health, which are referred to in another part of this Report. The examination of sardines for contamination by lead was continued, and during the last quarter of the year, when the new pack began to arrive, a marked improvement was observed, showing that the packers are taking steps to prevent contamination. Between 1st January and 30th September, 110 tins from 39 different consignments of sardines were analysed. As a result the re-exportation of 7 consignments was ordered, and in 8 cases it was necessary to advise the Importer that considerable improvement would be expected in future shipments. Between 1st October and 31st December, 26 tins from 12 consignments were analysed. In no instance was it necessary to order re-exportation, and in only 1 case was a warning letter required. Other points of interest in relation to the inspection of imported food are dealt with in the appropriate sections of this Report. In no case were legal proceedings taken, as merchants voluntarily surrendered everything found to be unsound or unfit for human consumption, and there was no instance of any deliberate attempt to import food in contravention of any of the Public Health Regulations. During the Summer your Officers received numerous verbal complaints as to the condition of the water of the Thames, and a few written complaints were sent to your Medical Officer. These were referred to the Port of London Authority, who are the Conservators of the tidal portion of the Thames. The main source of pollution of the River is the enormous volume of only partially treated sewage discharged from the outfalls at Barking Creek and Crossness. When the flow of river water over Teddington Weir is comparatively small the sewage-polluted water from Half Way Reach and Barking Creek is carried up-stream on the flood tide in dangerous proximity to the great commercial and even residential districts of London. On the ebb tide the polluted water is not carried clear away to sea, and so it oscillates backward and forward, the volume of fresh water coming over Teddington Weir determining how far it is carried towards London and how long it remains in that vicinity. If, as appears probable, both the volume of sewage discharged into Barking and Half Way Reaches by the London County Council and the volume of water taken from above Teddington by the Metropolitan Water Board increase, the pollution of the Thames Estuary must become more and more serious. If, in addition, deficiency of rainfall continues or recurs, there will be grave danger of the Thames becoming definitely offensive in its course through London. During the year all grades of your Staff carried out their duties in a highly satisfactory manner. In this connection I should like to make special mention of your Principal Clerk, Mr. E. A. Sorrell, who on the 29th October completed 40 years' service with the Port of London Sanitary Authority, and who during the last 10 years has been very largely responsible for the organisation of the clerical work of the Department. During this period Mr. Sorrell has brought the work of the Central Office to a high pitch of efficiency, and has at the same time won the esteem and affection of the entire Staff. Dr. P. B. P. Mellows was appointed a Boarding Medical Officer to fill the position which had been temporarily occupied by Dr. E. Kean, and Mr. T. L. Mackie and Mr. L. F. J. McDermott were appointed additional Sanitary Inspectors. The health work of so large a Port could not be carried out by a comparatively small Staff without the co-operation of the Officers of His Majesty's Customs, the Port of London Authority, the Pilots and the Members of the Staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants, whose assistance and courtesy is gratefully acknowledged. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES F. WHITE. 18 I.—AMOUNT OF SHIPPING ENTERING THE PORT DURING THE YEAR 1934. Table A. Number. Tonnage.

Principal Exports—Manufactured Goods of all kinds. Countries with which the Port principally trades—The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. III.—SOURCE OF WATER SUPPLY. (a) For the Port:— In all the docks, except Tilbury, water is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. Tilbury Docks take water from the South Essex Water Company. The majority of the wharves are supplied by the Public Water Companies within whose areas of distribution they are situated, but several have their own deep wells and some have no water available for ships, in which case any water required may be obtained from water boats. (b) For Shipping:— Ships usually obtain water from the shore supplies as indicated above, but when no water is available at the berth or if a ship is lying at moorings in the river, supplies are obtained from water boats. 14 The general position is the same as reported last year. The number of water boats working in the Port is 12, all of which have come under the inspection of your Officers during the year, and have been found to be fit for the carriage of drinking water. The following is a report of Mr. T. G. Edwards, the Sanitary Inspector on the Tilbury Docks, on improved facilities for watering vessels in Tilbury Dock provided on his recommendations. The greatest visible point of improvement has taken place at Nos. 82 and 83 Sheds. For sheds measuring 553 feet and 600 feet only three watering hydrant connections were fitted, these being situated one at each end and one at the centre. This naturally entailed very long lengths of hosepipe, especially where two hoses were used for filling at one aperture on the vessel. It is common for large passenger vessels to take in water at one big receiving hopper and then to distribute it throughout the vessel's tanks by means of pipe lines and stop valves. This central point of filling is usually situated amidships, so that if water was required quickly, two or more hoses were connected up to the hydrants. This meant long hoses running from extreme ends of the shed to amidships. These long lengths of hose were undoubtedly subjected to risk of pollution due to the state of the quay, working of cargo, and from men continually passing over and often standing on them. The installation of two more hydrant connections to each shed at a point between the existing ones has greatly reduced the length of hose necessary. Hoses can now be connected straight from shore to ship, and the length of hose lying on the quay is reduced to a minimum. The method of leading the hose to the ship is as follows: A rope is given several turns around the hosepipe and made fast at the shore end to the mooring bit or some other handy anchorage. The other end is made fast to the ship's rail. When this rope is hauled tight it holds the hosepipe quite taut and clear of the quay and presents no obstruction to craft which often work between the ship and the quay. The vessels using other berths in the dock are not usually fitted with central filling hoppers, so that the fitting of more hydrant connections would do little to further the reduction of risk of pollution. Suggestions here have been that no greater length of hosepipe than is absolutely necessary should be used. The Port Authority had their lengths of hose in 100 feet, so it was common to see a ship taking water through a 200 feet length of hose where 120 feet would have been quite sufficient. Varying lengths of hoses are now kept so that only the actual length of hose required is used. This does much to save pollution from extra lengths of hose sagging into the dock, and also lying about the quay. The method of making hoses fast is the same as already described. Hydrant standpipes are stored in Port of London Authority's stores. These are kept quite clean and polished, and Avhen not in actual use are stored in racks enclosed in a large locker. Hoses, after use, are washed in two large half-casks fitted under a fresh-water tap. First of all they are placed in No. 1 tub and scrubbed, which removes any dirt from the outside of the hose, then they are placed in the next tub where they are further cleansed. They are then hung from rafters around a large store, where their drying is completed. When dry they are rolled up and placed in a proper compartment in a large locker. The locker is lime-washed and kept quite clean. 15 When hosepipes and standpipes are taken from stores to ship they are always removed on a hand cart. This is not one of the usual low-wheeled trucks seen in the docks, but is constructed and used specially for watering equipment. All hydrant pits are inspected each week and are found to be kept in quite a good and clean state. All the pits are fitted with a drainage vent, and when not in use are covered with a close fitting, cast-iron cover. The stores are visited at intervals, and the condition of hoses is kept under observation. Where hoses are found to be defective they are scrapped, sound portions are cut out and fitted with couplings, which are then used for making up lengths to suit particular requirements. Recommendations that hoses should be taken out of commission, or any hydrants cleansed or other work done, always receive the prompt attention of the Port of London Authority's Dock Superintendent. The use of armoured hosepipe has been suggested, but its cost and its weight, together with its awkward stowage, are serious objections. IV.—PORT SANITARY REGULATIONS, 1938. Arrangements for dealing with Declarations of Health remain the same as described in last year's Report and are working smoothly. Boarding of Vessels on arrival.—The Boarding Launch "Howard Deighton" has given excellent service throughout the year and, apart from the period of her annual overhaul, has been constantly in commission. Notification to the Authority of Inward Vessels requiring Special Attention.—The Pilots have continued to give assistance in handing a Form of Declaration of Health to the Master of every ship they board. There are still a number of instances in which there is failure to send the prescribed messages. Owing to the close liaison between your Gravesend Staff, the Officers of His Majesty's Customs and of the Port of London Authority and the Masters of tugs, no serious delay has been occasioned to ships, but, while the Port Sanitary Authority make every endeavour to carry out their duties with the minimum of inconvenience to shipping, they cannot be held responsible for any delay which may be occasioned by the Masters of ships failing to read and comply with the instructions which are briefly and clearly set out on page 4 of the Declaration of Health. There is special difficulty in regard to a light signal at night, indicating that the Port Medical Officer is required. Masters are instructed to flash "Q" repeatedly in Morse on approaching Gravesend. The instruction "repeatedly" is important because the view of the approaching ship from the Boarding Launch or the "Hygeia" is from time to time obstructed by other ships, and by the various craft moored in Gravesend Reach. Unfortunately, the signal is frequently given only once, and is not observed. No doubt, when a ship is approaching Gravesend, the attention of the Pilot and the Officers on the bridge is concentrated on navigation, and in looking out for the Pilot Cutter and the Customs Launch. Efforts have been made to arrange a fixed light signal indicating that the Port Medical Officer is required, but have been unsuccessful because the combination of lights available is limited, and the majority have already been allocated for other purposes. Further, it is important that no light signal should be capable of confusion with the port and starboard lights of the ship. The "Red light over a white light not more than six feet apart" prescribed in the third schedule to the Port Sanitary Regulations, 1933, simply means "I have not free pratique," which is really a signal to the Customs, who are the Authority entitled to grant pratique, and therefore cannot be interpreted as meaning that the Port Medical Officer is required. It is desirable that the Ministry of Health should endeavour to arrange a fixed light signal which definitely means that a ship requires the attention of the Port Sanitary Authority. 16 Mooring Stations designated under Article 10:— (a) Within the Docks ; (b) Outside the Docks. These remain the same as reported last year. There has, so far, been no occasion to make use of them. Particulars of any standing Exemptions from the Provisions of Article 14.—None have been made, and the arrangements described in last year's Report have worked smoothly. Experience of working Article 16:— (1) As ships are cleared in the River immediately on arrival, no difficulty has been experienced in preventing the embarkation or disembarkation of unauthorised persons. (2) The arrangements for the surveillance of contacts have been facilitated by the use of the " Business Reply Card "system, described last year. What Arrangements have been made for:— (a) Premises and waiting rooms for medical examination. (b) Cleansing and disinfection of ships, persons and clothing and other articles. (c) Premises for the temporary accommodation of persons for whom such accommodation is required for the purposes of the Regulations. As regards (a), (b) and (c), the arrangements remain as described in last year's Report. (d) Hospital accommodation available for Plague, Cholera, Yellow Fever, Small-pox and other infectious diseases. As mentioned in the Introduction to this Report, the accommodation for patients at your Isolation Hospital at Denton has been improved by the building of a new cubicle ward block comprising eight cubicles, four on each side of a central duty room, from which the nurse on duty can see every patient. The duty room is fitted as a ward kitchen and, in addition, is equipped with a steam steriliser for crockery, cutlery, &c., an instrument steriliser and a cabinet for drugs, instruments and dressings. From the observation windows the nurse can switch on the light in any cubicle. In the cubicles all the furniture is of metal, and in each are hung coats which doctors, nurses and wardmaids must put on immediately on entering and not take off till leaving the room. Curtains, which can be easily removed for disinfection, are provided for privacy as an alternative to ward-screens. Along the north side of the building runs a corridor in which are four lavatory basins where nurses can sterilise their hands before entering and after leaving the cubicles. The taps are arm-operated and the wastes knee-operated. Off this corridor are a bathroom, a sink-room, a soiled-linen room and other necessary sanitary conveniences. On the south side of the ward block is an open verandah on to which convalescent patients confined to bed can be wheeled in favourable weather. The new ward was opened by your Chairman on 24th November, and nearly all the patients who have been admitted to the hospital since have been nursed in the cubicles. The following special instructions to Nurses have been modelled on those in use at the Hendon Isolation Hospital and have been posted in the duty room of the Cubicle Ward Block:— The success of the Cubicle system depends on the care taken to prevent crossinfection. Everything which may have come in contact with a patient must be 17 disinfected before it is allowed to come in contact with another patient. The following instructions must therefore be carefully observed:— 1. In each cubicle an overall coat is provided, which the nurse must put on immediately on entering the cubicle, and which she must continue to wear whilst she is attending upon the patient. On leaving the cubicle the nurse must remove the coat, hang it on the hook provided, open the door and immediately proceed to wash her hands and forearms thoroughly with soap and water at the nearest lavatory basin in the corridor. The only occasions on which a nurse may leave the cubicle wearing the overall are when she takes a patient to the bathroom or the lavatory if he is getting up, or when she is carrying an utensil to the lavatory if he is in bed. The overall belonging to one cubicle is never to be worn by the nurse when entering another cubicle or the duty room. 2. In the serving of meals the nurse is first to go round and prepare each patient. In doing this she is to put on the overall in each cubicle and wash her hands on leaving each cubicle. When subsequently simply handing the patient his food, as also when handing him any other article from outside the cubicle, such as a paper, letter, &c., the nurse is not required to put on the overall or wash her hands, unless she has touched the patient or his bed clothes or anything which has been in direct contact with him. 3. No cubicle Avork is ever to be undertaken with sleeves, cuffs or jeAvellery on the hands or forearms. 4. After use, all cups, saucers, knives, forks and spoons are to be taken back to the duty-room, washed immediately and sterilised in the steam steriliser. No article is to be put away for future use until after it has been through the steriliser. 5. Similarly all instruments, dishes, medicine glasses, &c., taken from a cubicle are to be sterilised before being put away. 6. When patients are to be bathed in the bath-room, each patient is to be taken there separately, wrapped in his own bath-gown and with his own bath towel. After bathing, the patient is to be seen back to his cubicle wrapped as before in his bath-gown. The water is then to be run out of his bath, which is to be well rinsed out. The inside and edge of the bath are then to be sponged over with 1 in 20 carbolic lotion or other equivalent disinfecting solution before another patient is brought into the room for bathing. 7. When a patient who is getting up goes to the lavatory, the same precautions are to be observed. No two patients are to be allowed to meet in the corridor on their way to the lavatory. After use by any patient, the seat of the closet is to be wiped over with a cloth wrung out in a disinfecting solution. 8. Each patient must have a separate urine bottle and bed-pan, which must be washed and carbolised after use. 9. Soiled linen is to be taken direct from the cubicles to the soiled linen bin, whence it will be removed for disinfection by steam. 10. Books, papers, toys, &c., are on no account to be taken from one cubicle to another. 11. Nurses are to see that the wardmaids observe the same strict precautions against cross-infection. 12. On discharge of a patient— Blankets, mattresses and other bedding, bath-gOwns, overalls and curtains are to be removed for disinfection by steam. The patient's soap, flannel, tooth brush and all papers, books and toys must be burned. 18 Brushes and combs must be soaked for half-an-hour in 1 in 20 carbolic lotion or equivalent disinfectant. The bedsteads and all ward furniture must be carbolised. The cubicle must be disinfected by spraying the walls with a solution of 6 ounces formalin to the gallon of water (or such other disinfectant as may be supplied) and be kept closed for six hours. (e) Ambulance Transport. On the Boarding Launch "Howard Deighton" is an ambulance room in which cases of infectious sickness discovered on board ship at the time of arrival are removed to hospital. Occasionally, however, cases of infectious disease develop in ships lying in the docks or at wharves or buoys in the River. These cases may be transferred to your Hospital either by road, an ambulance being hired for the purpose, or by River, if circumstances and the condition of the patient permit. Your two River Launches must, therefore, be capable of carrying cases of illness if necessary. The "James Howell" has a cabin under the forecastle head, but this is not very convenient or comfortable for a stretcher case. The new Launch "Frederick Whittingham" is better equipped, and could carry two cot cases quite comfortably. This Launch was built by Messrs. W. J. Yarwood & Sons, Ltd., of Norwich, to plans and specifications prepared by Mr. R. J. Roberts, Chief Engineer of the Port Sanitary Authority. Her length is 32 feet, breadth 8 feet 9 inches, moulded depth 4 feet 2 inches, draft about 3 feet, and speed 8¼ knots. The engine is a 2L 2, six-cylinder Gardner Diesel of 57 b.h.p., the controls being in the wheelhouse, so that the crew consists only of a driver and a boy. The cabin aft is equipped for the use of the Sanitary Inspector, but the seats can be removed, enabling stretcher cases of sickness or accident to be accommodated when necessary. The top of the engine room and cabin are specially strong, and the deck narrow, so that the Sanitary Inspector can step from the engine-room top or the cabin top on to lighters which frequently surround the ships he is required to board. (f) Supervision of Contacts. The introduction of the double post-card on one-half of which the contact declares the destination to which he is proceeding immediately on disembarkation and the other half of which he retains for the notification of any change of address within the residue of the incubation period, has undoubtedly increased the efficiency of surveillance. Both passengers and crew have their obligations under the Port Sanitary Regulations, 1933, more definitely brought to their notice, and they are put to the minimum of trouble in notifying any change of address. It is an advantage also to have the signature of the contact to the address he gives. Further, the arrangement has reduced the clerical work involved in notifying the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which contacts are proceeding, and thus enables the notifications to be posted earlier—an important point when a ship arrives toward the end of the week, and when the incubation period of the disease has almost expired. Arrangements for the Bacteriological or Pathological Examination of Rats for Plague. Arrangements made for other Bacteriological or Pathological Examinations. Arrangements for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Venereal Diseases amongst Sailors. Arrangements for the Interment of the Dead. All the above remain as reported in detail last year. 19 Table C.

"Pembrokeshire."—The ss. "Pembrokeshire" arrived at Gravesend on 24th January from the Par East and was boarded by Dr. H. Willoughby. It was ascertained that a cadet, E. H. S-had developed Small-pox on 7th December, 1933, the rash appearing on 10th December, on which date he was removed to hospital at Hong Kong. The Port Health Authority at Hong Kong carried out all the necessary disinfection. On the day on which the patient first sickened a new Chinese crew had been signed on and the whole crew, both European and Chinese, had been vaccinated in accordance with the requirements of the United States Public Health Authorities in the Philippine Islands, whither the ship was proceeding. The cadet had probably been infected twelve days previously in Wei-hai-wei or Cheefoo. Vaccination on the day of onset of Small-pox could not protect him, but did protect the other members of the crew, and no further cases occurred. 20 On arrival in the Port of London everybody on board was inspected, and all being found well it was not necessary to arrange surveillance, the incubation period of the disease having expired at least a month previously. ss. "Ranpura."—The above-mentioned vessel arrived at Gravesend on the 16th March, having landed a case of Small-pox at Bombay on 23rd February. The case was Mrs. F-, a first-class passenger aged 45 who had never been vaccinated, being a conscientious objector. She embarked at Yokohama on 30th January, went ashore at Shanghai on 6th February and visited the native city, where she bought a fur coat. On 21st February she reported sick with high fever. The rash appeared on 23rd February, on which date she was landed to hospital in Bombay. From the account of the distribution of the eruption it appears to have been an undoubted case of Variola, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the Port Medical Officer of Bombay. All close contacts were vaccinated immediately, and all the crew and the majority of the passengers were vaccinated within 15 hours. The hospital bedding was thrown overboard and the cabin was disinfected. The ship arrived at Plymouth on 15th March, and a letter was received from the Port Medical Officer to the effect that he had inspected everybody on board and found no further cases. In view of this assurance and of the fact that three weeks had elapsed from the date of landing of the case to the vessel's arrival at Plymouth, the inspection of the passengers was not repeated on the arrival of the ship in London. The inspection would have been repeated in London had the maximum incubation period not expired at the time of the Plymouth inspection. ss. "Moldavia."—Previous Information.—On the 28th March the Medical Superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company telephoned that the ss. "Moldavia" had landed to hospital in Port Said on 26th March a native steward suffering from Small-pox, and that the ship was due in London on 6th April. Eight hundred address cards were despatched by the P. & 0. Courier from London on the 28th March and were put on board the ship at Marseilles. Arrival in London.—The ship arrived in the Port of London at 1 a.m. on 6th April and was boarded at 6 a.m. by myself, Dr. H. Willoughby, Dr. Parry, two Clerks and a Sanitary Inspector. Movements of Vessels—Brisbane 14th February, Sydney 21st February, Melbourne 27th February, Adelaide 1st March, Fremantle 5th March, Colombo 14th March, Bombay 17th March, Port Sudan 23rd March, Port Said 26th March, Marseilles 30th March. History of Case.—On 23rd March a Goanese pantry boy, cet. 28 years, reported sick with a temperature of 102° F. and a vesicular eruption, profuse on the trunk, slight on the face and limbs. There were no spots on the palms or soles. The patient said he had felt unwell the previous day, but had no severe symptoms. He was isolated in the ship's hospital forthwith. On 24th March his temperature was 103.2° F. and a fresh crop of vesicles were stated to have appeared. On 25th March his temperature was 103° F. a.m., and 105° F. p.m. On this date the vessel arrived at Suez in the evening, and the case was seen by two Egyptian Medical Officers, who agreed with the Ship Surgeon's diagnosis of Chicken-pox. On 26th March the ship arrived at Port Said. The patient's temperature had fallen to 100° F. and he felt better. He was seen by the Port Medical Officer, who called in the Chief Medical Officer in consultation. A diagnosis of suspected Small-pox was made and the case was removed to hospital ashore. On 28th March a wireless message was received on the ship that the case had been diagnosed as Small-pox. 21 Preventive Measures taken on Board.—On 23rd March the patient was isolated in the ship's hospital, his bedding was dumped overboard and his quarters washed out with " carbolacene." At Port Said on 26th March, after removal of the patient, the hospital was sprayed with a disinfectant and fumigated with Formalin. On 28th March, after wireless confirmation of the diagnosis of Small-pox, all passengers were mustered and offered vaccination ; some 400 of the 797 on board accepted, and were vaccinated. The crew had nearly all been vaccinated 15 months previously, but those who had not were re-vaccinated. Preventive Measures on arrival in London.—Every person on board was medically inspected. All the passengers and European crew had been given a double post-card, one half for the notification of addresses on disembarkation, the other half for notification of any change of address within 14 days. The immediate addresses were carefully checked, and the necessity for notifying any change of address was impressed on each individual. Eight Goanese stewards who had shared the patient's cabin were taken ashore to Denton Hospital for bathing and disinfection. This cabin was put under disinfection by sulphur candles. The hospital was sealed for disinfection in dock. The hospital bedding had been thrown overboard. Commeyits.—The patient joined the ship at Bombay on 17th March. He was stated to have been successfully vaccinated on 14th March. This did not affect the diagnosis of Small-pox, as the patient must have been infected on or about 8th March. Vaccination therefore took place six days after infection, and so vaccinia and Variola may have run concurrently. The Ship Surgeon's description of the disease strongly suggested Chicken-pox as the diagnosis, but on the other hand, after having the case under observation in hospital for two days, Port Said sent a wireless message confirming their original suspicion of Small-pox. With the history of vaccination there was, of course, just the possibility of generalised vaccinia. The fact that no cases of Chicken-pox developed amongst the remainder of the native crew was in favour of the diagnosis of Small-pox, because in the experience of your Medical Officer Chicken-pox nearly always gives rise to secondary cases amongst natives, who do not appear to be exposed to this infection in childhood and therefore are susceptible in adult life. ss. "Comorin."—The above-mentioned vessel arrived off Gravesend on 13th April. During the inspection of the crew it was noticed that a Distressed British Seaman showed scars of a recent attack of Small-pox. On enquiry it was found that this man had been an apprentice on board the ss. "Red Sea," had developed Small-pox and had been landed to hospital in Hong Kong. Having recovered, he was returning to his home in Leicester on the ss. "Comorin." His clothing had been destroyed at Hong Kong, and he had no infected clothing or effects with him. ss. "King City."—The above-mentioned vessel arrived off Gravesend on 15th April, and it was ascertained that four cases of Small-pox amongst the crew had been landed to hospital at William Head, B.C., Quarantine Station. Fumigation and disinfection were carried out by the Port Sanitary Authorities at William Head, B.C., and in addition the vessel received special attention by the American Port Sanitary Authorities at subsequent ports of call. No further cases occurred on the vessel. 22 ss. "Hesperia."—The above-mentioned vessel arrived off Gravesend at 11 p.m. on 25th May, 1934. On 19th April, 1934, whilst the vessel was at Calicut, a Lascar complained of an eruption on his face and back. He was seen by the Port Medical Officer, who diagnosed Small-pox and ordered immediate removal to hospital ashore. All the native crew, including the above patient, had been vaccinated at Calcutta on 23rd March, but on the occurrence of the above case, 13 immediate contacts were re-vaccinated and the European crew of 13 were also vaccinated. All the living quarters were disinfected under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health of Calicut, and the patient's bedding and effects were removed with him to hospital. At Suez on 13th May a medical inspection of the whole of the crew was conducted by the Suez Canal Medical Authority. No further case occurred. ss. "Pacific Enterprise."—On the arrival of the above-mentioned vessel at Gravesend on 1st June, it was ascertained that a fireman of the ss. "Hambledown" had contracted Small-pox in Shanghai in February, 1934. The patient was admitted to hospital at Raymond, Washington, U.S.A., on the vessel's arrival there. He remained in hospital for one month, and was shipped home to Barry as a Distressed British Seamen in the ss. "Pacific Enterprise." He was inspected by the Boarding Medical Officer at Gravesend, and was permitted to proceed to his home. Chicken-Pox. ss. "Mongolia."—On the 5th March the Medical Superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. reported by telephone that the "Mongolia" was due in London on 9th March with a case of Small-pox on board, in the person of a female child passenger aged 9. Arrangements were made to send 500 address post-cards to the ship by the pilot who was to board her at Dungeness, as she was not calling at Plymouth. Your Medical Officer spent the night of 8th and 9th March on board the "Hygeia" at Gravesend, and boarded the "Mongolia" Avith the Boarding Medical Officer, Dr. Kean, at 6 a.m. The patient was found to be a little Eurasian girl, 9 years old, on her way from a Roman Catholic Convent in Bombay to England, accompanied by her father and sister. She had no prodromal symptoms, but while she was being bathed by a stewardess on 28th February a papular eruption was noticed, and the Ship's Surgeon was called. He took another doctor on board into consultation, and Small-pox was diagnosed. The patient Avas isolated promptly, and some 300 of the 450 passengers were vaccinated. Most of the crew of 300 had been vaccinated 18 months previously, but those who had not were re-vaccinated. Your Medical Officer considered the case to be one of Chicken-pox, the distribution of the rash being centripetal and the lesions very superficial. The child was well vaccinated and had five good scars, three said to date from infancy and two from a vaccination two or three years ago, when she entered the Convent. However, in view of the fact that Small-pox had been diagnosed in the earlier stages of the disease and that everybody on board had been told the case was Small-pox, your Medical Officer proceeded as for that disease, sending the case to Denton Hospital and all the close contacts ashore for bathing and disinfection; inspecting all passengers and crew and correcting all names and addresses. It was, however, decided not to send the names and addresses forward to Medical Officers of Health of districts of destination, as it was felt certain the disease was Varicella. 23 Subsequently on the 14th instant, exactly 14 days from the date of isolation of the case on the "Mongolia," the Medical Officer of Health of Woolwich notified a child in his Borough who had been a passenger on the "Mongolia" to be a definite case of Chicken-pox, and the same day we removed a native steward from the "Mongolia" to Denton Hospital suffering from Chicken-pox. The native was a bedroom steward, and a contact with the original case. On 19th March a telegram was received from the Medical Officer of Health of Belfast to the effect that he had seen a child from the "Mongolia" whom he considered to be suffering from Chicken-pox, but that the parents had reported to him that Small-pox had occurred on board. He was informed that the case in the ship was Chicken-pox. There were no further developments. Typhoid Fever. The ss. "Modasa" arrived off Gravesend on 14th April, and was boarded by Dr. Willoughby. The Ship's Surgeon declared 11 cases of Influenza (7 passengers, 2 European crew and 2 native crew). Of these, 9 were reported to have recovered and 2, although not yet recovered, were considered to be fit to proceed home. The diagnosis of Influenza was accepted, and no special action was taken. On 19th April a notification was received from the Medical Officer of Health of Ealing that one of the above-mentioned passengers who had proceeded to her home in his district had been definitely diagnosed as a case of Typhoid Fever. Your Medical Officer forthwith notified the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which the other passengers and crew who had suffered from Influenza had proceeded, and also got into touch with the Seamen's Hospital in regard to a cadet who had suffered from Influenza and who had been recommended to attend the Hospital for the examination of his chest. This enquiry elicited the information that, not only was this cadet suffering from Typhoid Fever, but that there were in hospital four other similar cases from the same ship. Later, one further case was notified. Thus 7 cases of Typhoid developed, 4 of which were included amongst the cases notified as Influenza. No other passengers were infected, but the incident illustrates how easy it is to miss mild cases of Typhoid Fever, particularly in the early stages. V.—MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS. These were dealt with in detail in last year's Report. Your Officers continue to recommend rat-proofing both in ships and on shore, and a great deal of useful work has been accomplished in this direction during the year. Mr. J. D. Hamer, F.I.C., Chief Chemist of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, who is responsible for the fumigation of the Orient Liners, and who has therefore much practical experience in the fumigation of large passenger ships with Hydrogen Cyanide, has contributed the following article entitled "Some Observations on the use of Hydrogen Cyanide as a Fumigant":- Some Observations on the use of Cyanide as a Fumigant. (By J. D. Hamer, F.I.C., Chief Chemist to the Orient Steam Navigation Company.) In the early Spring of 1927, we treated a vessel at Tilbury with Cyanide. The accommodation received a charge equivalent to 0.5 per cent. HCN. A large number of beds and pillows were stowed in the side pockets of a' tween deck, and received 0.5 per cent. HCN. The atmospheric conditions were cold with humidity approaching dew-point. After eight hours' contact the ship was opened up for 24 ventilation, windsails were lowered down all hatches and trimmed. Twelve hours later the whole of the ship was free from gas, with the exception of the side pockets containing the bedding. As this area was clearing too slowly, the windsails were adjusted so as to send a current of air well into the side pockets, but 24 hours later this area was still unsafe, a benzidine acetate test paper showing a strong blue in five seconds. The operators, equipped with gas masks, then distributed the beds and pillows round the sides of the hold so as to give free ventilation, but a further 24 hours had elapsed before this space could be passed as safe, making the time for ventilation 60 hours. We learnt from this lesson to avoid packed masses of bedding and, when giving special treatment to large quantities, to arrange it in staggered formation both for the purpose of quick treatment and speedy ventilation. We find it is nearly always necessary to give linen stores 12 to 24 hours more ventilation than is necessary for other parts of our ships. Quite recently we had the case of a linen locker which was clear of gas except one shelf holding 50 eiderdowns. A test paper anywhere in this heap showed a deep blue in four or five seconds. These had to be removed and beaten in the open air before they were clear. It is always our practice to examine again all such rooms the following day, to make certain that no residual gas has accumulated if they have been closed up over night. We have been frequently asked by Medical Officers questions concerning the lethal concentration in the atmosphere outside a treated space during the ventilation period. Normally on the weather side of a ship no trace of gas can be detected, but on the lee side the atmosphere is highly dangerous for some hours after "opening out." One well-remembered incident was during the ventilation of one of our largest vessels after treatment. It was in December, 1928. There was no wind, and the temperature outside was 38° F.; it was also inclined to be foggy. The ship had been under 0.7 per cent. concentration HCN for eight hours. All the canvas had been removed from the ventilators and the door and windows of the upper structure were all open. The ports of D, E, F, G and H decks were still closed. As there were no parts of the decks that were safe we went on to the quayside in order to remove our masks, and were surprised on testing the atmosphere to find it was quite dangerous even on the quayside. Our tests showed a deep blue in ten to fifteen seconds, to a depth of six feet from the ground, and 30 feet from the hull along the whole 700 feet length of quay occupied by the ship in question. For at least one and a-half hours this area was distinctly unsafe, and prompted us to improve our technique by arranging to fence off the quayside approaches to vessels under fumigation. We have already written regarding the care needed in interpreting the Copper Benzidine Acetate test in very cold weather. The incident which prompted us to warn you then has been repeated several times since, and can be looked for when the atmospheric temperature falls rapidly overnight during free ventilation. One of our very early experiences was the finding of heaps of Zyklon frozen solid. The material had been dumped in heaps and not spread out evenly, and the rapid evaporation at the surface of the heap froze the interior. Where the heaps were still freezing six or eight hours later, the ventilation had little effect, and unless the frozen and other residues were removed the clearing of such areas was slowed down considerably. The cure was to make certain that the Zyklon was spread out evenly to a depth of not more than one inch. We do not consider that any part of a ship is safe for occupation during the use of Cyanide in any other part. It was the custom at one time to allow the Officer-inCharge to occupy his quarters on the boat deck during fumigation, until the ventilation period commenced. This was altered after the following incident. The putting down of the gas had just finished, and the usual final "look round" was in progress to ensure everything was gas tight, when an examination of the Officers' quarters showed that there was a trace of gas getting in. We at once turned him out, and a careful examination of the quarters showed the gas to be entering by way of the electric wiring conduits from the deck below. Had we neglected to test these quarters the Officer would have slept through the afternoon, probably with fatal results. 25 On one occasion a cat slept on a hair-stuffed chair after fumigated quarters were passed as safe. The cat did not wake up. Time does not permit us to give similar details of all the incidents which are almost a commonplace to us in our cyanide treatment of ships, but we hope we have said sufficient to emphasise the very great need for care in the clearing of spaces after treatment with HCN and the importance of reliable, experienced operators.

In some it is excellent, in others it is deplorable, and between these extremes there are many ships in Which the crew's quarters may be regarded as tolerably good, provided that there is discipline on board; that the officers take an interest in their crew; that defects due to wear and tear are promptly remedied, and that the crew are prepared to keep their accommodation clean and tidy. The Association of Port Sanitary Authorities have for many years pressed for a greater minimum cubic space per man, better ventilation, lighting and heating, separate mess rooms and better provision for washing, for the drying and storage of clothes and for the storage of food. The Manning Committee of the Shipping Federation have made recommendations which are substantially in agreement with those of the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities. Depression, unfortunately, still continues in the Shipping Industry, and there is no money available for reconstruction of crew quarters in existing ships; but it certainly appears that in new ships it is not greater expenditure on crew accommodation that is required, but rather interest, imagination and appreciation of modern standards of hygiene, comfort and convenience on the part of the designers and builders of ships. It is true that in the maintenance of sanitary conditions on board ship depends a great deal on the officers and the crew, but if the accommodation is ill-designed, uncomfortable and inconvenient, they are disheartened and discontented. The following report is made by two of your Sanitary Inspectors, both of whom are Master Mariners who have, within the last three years, left the Merchant Service to take up Port Health work. Their criticisms of the conditions they have observed in certain classes of ships, and particularly of the absence of discipline and lack of interest on the part of officers, are not made without careful consideration and full justification. 27 Report on Crew Accommodation in Vessels inspected in the Upper and Middle Districts of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. (By L. R. Hundy and L. McDermott, Sanitary Inspectors.) In dealing with this subject, and in order to obtain the correct perspective, vessels have been divided into three categories. (1) The small type of coastwise vessel with a crew of usually ten. (2) The regular collier type of usually twenty crew. (3) Ocean-going vessels of the tramp class. The facts set out in this report may be regarded as the general conditions prevailing. Exceptions have not been overlooked, but are not embodied herein. (1) The small type of Coastwise Vessel.—To say that the general conditions in this type of vessel is appalling, is a comparatively mild statement. Invariably the crew accommodation is situated in the bows of the ship, which is a most unsatisfactory position. Due to this, the forecastles are very dark, and in many instances natural light falls short of the minimum requirements laid down in paragraph 17 of the B.O.T. Handbook. Furthermore, directly attributable to position, the port glasses are cracked, and the hawsepipes which lead through the forecastle are a continuous source of trouble, inasmuch as they create dampness. The latter cannot be permanently remedied owing to the vibration of the windlass directly overhead. Reference must also be made to the relative positions of the forecastle and galley. The latter is right aft, necessitating the men walking the whole length of the vessel each meal time, irrespective of weather conditions at sea and the littered conditions of the decks in port, i.e., beams, hatches, cargo gear, &c. The first impressions conveyed on inspecting the forecastle of this type of vessel are that one has suddenly entered a "marine store dealer's" of the worst type. The reasons for this may be very briefly stated as follows:— (a) No provision for the storage of clothes, oilskins and working gear. (b) Small inadequate food storage accommodation. (c) No means of storing fresh meat. (d) No wash place. Heat is provided by means of bogey stoves, but no coal locker is provided. Clothes are littered all over the forecastle. Food, including meat, is to be found lying about even in the bunks, and occasionally in the W.C. apartment. The table, if any, is small, in a filthy state and covered with used and dirty utensils. The men's bedding consists of a filthy straw mattress and a few blankets. The paintwork, which is sometimes fair, is seldom washed, and a film of dirt, dust and soot lies over everything. W.C. accommodation is generally provided for by an iron compartment outside the forecastle. It is damp, often rusty, badly lighted, badly ventilated, and upon inspection is found to be used as an overflow deck store. The W.C. pan is an iron trough or hopper, and is definitely an insanitary fitment. In conclusion, after careful study, we attribute these conditions to bad design of the living quarters, undermanning, and lack of discipline. (2) Regular Coastwise Vessels, Colliers, &c.; Crew approximately 20.—As previously described in the smaller type of coaster, the original construction of crew accommodation in these vessels leaves a great deal to be desired. Due to this, little incentive is given to the men to take a personal interest in their accommodation. At this stage it is necessary to outline very briefly the conditions under which vessels of this type are employed. They are for the most part very hard run, 28 frequently doing between sixty and seventy voyages between the Thames and NorthEast Coast ports annually. The nature of their cargoes, and the weather existing for two-thirds of the year on the British Coast, must also be borne in mind. According to North-East Coast rules, when these vessels are lying at the buoys in the Thames awaiting their turn for a berth, the men only work in the forenoon (8 to 12), the remainder of the day being free. Bearing this in mind, one might reasonably expect to find their quarters in a comparatively clean and well-kept state, but, unfortunately, this is quite exceptional. On boarding these vessels during the afternoon, it is common to find the men turned in, complete with working clothes and sometimes boots. From this it can be easily understood that the condition of the bedding is filthy, and the quarters themselves dirty, ill-kept and untidy. It is amazing to see men apparently perfectly content to live in such conditions, and making no effort of their own to establish something even bordering on cleanliness and comfort. To go into the matter more thoroughly, it has been found necessary to approach the officers in charge of the vessels with a view to ascertaining the reasons why such conditions do exist and why the men are permitted to be so slack. All manner of excuses are readily brought forward, the main ones being that, due to the trade and to the hard running of the ship, there is no time to devote to the cleansing of the crew's quarters. Sometimes the excuse is that Saturday morning is given to the crew for this purpose. This is, of course, totally inadequate, and the most that is ever done is the swabbing of the forecastle deck. It needs but little thought to be convinced that these excuses are absurd, as a very well-known and well-organised firm, whose vessels are run equally as hard, and in the same trade as those in question, leaves nothing to be desired as far as the quarters of the crew are concerned. This is due solely to the interest shown by the owners, who compel strict supervision by their shipmasters and senior officers. To emphasise this two concrete examples are given. (a) The chief officer of a collier when approached considered that he must be willing to overlook dirty forecastles as long as the men were reliable, sober and good seamen. From this it is apparent that the cleanliness of the quarters is a very minor consideration; in fact, one might almost say it is the last consideration of all. (b) Another company, whose vessels run equally hard and are engaged in the same trade, find it no hardship to employ men who, in addition to being reliable, sober, and good seamen, are prepared to devote some of their spare time to a systematic cleansing of their quarters. The men are encouraged in this by good accommodation, mess-rooms and shower-bath rooms. It is a rule of the company that the master shall, at the time of engagement (in addition to the clause in the Articles), inform the crew that if they intend to remain in the employment of the company they must be prepared to maintain the standard described above. Daily routine inspection of the crew's accommodation by the master is also compulsory. The crews generally stay in these vessels for many years, and it is a pleasure to inspect these ships. To remedy the conditions described above, it is of paramount importance that interest be shown by the owners, to the extent of placing the onus of the welfare of the crew on their shipmasters, and rigidly enforcing systematic supervision of all accommodation by them. Until such steps have been taken and are enforced, one is led to conclude that little improvement may be expected. (3) Ocean-going Steamers of the Tramp Class.—The ocean-going steamers met with during inspections on the Biver are usually of the tramp class, and generally speaking the accommodation is poor. As previously mentioned, a great deal of this is due to the original construction, no attention having been paid to detail. By this is meant, absence of clothes lockers, inadequate food storage accommodation, poor heating and lighting arrangements. These vessels present a totally different aspect from those of the coastwise trades, as the crew are usually paid off and leave the ship at the termination of each voyage. The usual type of quarters seen consists of a large compartment, generally forward, divided by a wooden bulkhead for sailors and firemen. The bunks are usually iron, and are arranged in tiers around the forecastle. The men provide their own beds, which are of the cheapest type, viz., straw mattresses. These are sometimes 29 verminous when brought aboard. Food cupboards are provided, but are small, unventilated, and inadequate. The forecastles are dark, dirty, untidy and, in most cases, due to the absence of a messroom, littered with food and dirty utensils. The W.C. is frequently foul and choked and, if of the old trough type, offensive and insanitary. In spite of these difficulties, it should be a comparatively easy matter to bring vessels of this type to a desirable standard if daily routine inspection was carried out in the same manner as in first-class shipping companies. Ample opportunity is afforded for painting and cleansing the quarters on the long passages between ports, as the men can easily be accommodated under awnings in tropical weather. Unfortunately, this is far from being the case at present, and it is most exceptional to find a vessel where the master is personally interested in the welfare and cleanliness of his crew. There is no excuse whatsoever for vessels of this type to arrive in home waters with their crew accommodation in anything but a reasonable state of cleanliness It is amazing to find that it is only under pressure brought to bear by Port Sanitary Authorities that such accommodation is made habitable, when all that is required is a standing order from the owners to their shipmasters rigidly enforcing the responsibility of keeping the crew's accommodation up to a definite standard of cleanliness. To quote a very recent case of a vessel which arrived from the River Plate. Upon inspection the most appalling conditions were found. The forecastle was badly infested with vermin, some of the men had no proper bunks, and had made their own from pieces of timber. The sides of the forecastle were damp, not cork dusted, very rusty, badly in need of paint, and dirty, and the deckhead was leaking badly through defective caulking. In addition to this, no electric light was provided for the men, though fitted on the ship. The master and chief officer had not inspected these quarters on the homeward voyage, or many of these hardships could have been remedied. A ship's carpenter was carried who could have repaired the defective caulking. The forecastle could have been fumigated, cleansed, painted, and efficient bunks made had a minimum of interest been taken by the master of this vessel. Yet one found the vessel's plates and decks chipped and painted, and many other routine works had been and were being done. Once again the remedy lies in compulsory systematic supervision of crew accommodation in the case of vessels already engaged in their various trades. With regard to future vessels, more attention should be paid to detail. A mess-room apart from the sleeping quarters, steel clothes lockers, ventilated food cupboards, adequate lighting, both natural and artificial, efficient heating arrangements, a place for the men to wash, and a W.C. of a modern type should be regarded as a minimum. A routine inspection of the men's bedding when they join the ship should also be enforced. N.B.—A record of vessels typical of the types mentioned has been kept, with the dates of inspection, to corroborate the statements set out in this report. Mr. J. S. Beattie, your Sanitary Inspector on the Lower River District, has submitted the following short reports on the need for clothes lockers in crew's quarters, and for special food lockers in coasting vessels:— Crews' Clothes Lockers. (By J. S. Beattie, Sanitary Inspector.) The absence of accommodation for clothing is one of the causes of unhygienic conditions in crews' quarters. On entering any forecastle the first thing that meets the eye is the assortment of garments distributed about the place, from bulkhead to after corner. Even where a definite attempt at orderliness is evident, or when supervision is the rule of the company, the total lack of clothes lockers defeats the efforts of the crew to keep their quarters clean and tidy, and disheartened, they give up the struggle. Garments hung up for any length of time are a potential breeding ground for vermin and are invariably attacked during the early stages of infestation. Shore 80 suits hung to prevent creasing usually remain so until needed again. When ports and doors are closed during bad weather the presence of damp clothing swinging across a white bulkhead increases the atmosphere of depression, decreases the amount of reflected light, stains the paintwork and adds to the general gloom of the compartment. The provision of properly ventilated steel or wooden lockers (3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet by 1 foot 6 inches) would avoid the necessity for storing clothing on pegs, spare bunks or the floor, and at once the forecastle would be brighter, cleaner, more ship-shape and consequently more hygienic. Such lockers would fulfil a long-felt want, would make conditions more hygienic, and encourage the crew to a seamanlike respect of their quarters. In fitting, due regard should be taken of the lay-out of the forecastles. Lockers should not be erected against an unsheathed side or placed in a badly lighted or badly ventilated corner. Crews' Food Lockers in Coasting Vessels. (By J. S. Beattie, Sanitary Inspector.) One of the most unsatisfactory features of the crew accommodation in coasting vessels is the unhygienic storage of food. The lockers provided for seamen are of the type fitted in foreign-going vessels, in which they are only used for small articles of clothing and other personal effects. In "coasters" it is a common practice to keep food in wooden cases on the floor and in spare bunks, while on one or two occasions meat has been found hanging in the water-closet. All alternative accommodation of a makeshift design is usually handed down from crew to crew. Down-below forecastles have ample room below the forecastle head, much of which is wasted. In this space could be built a locker of sufficient dimensions to carry food for both seamen and firemen. Where ships have alternative space adjacent to the galley it can be utilised for this purpose. Dimensions of a suitably divided, ventilated and locked safe would not be prohibitive in any compartment, but the position would depend upon the class or build of coaster. VII. FOOD INSPECTION. Imported Meat. During the year the draft of the proposed Public Health (Imported Food) Amendment Regulations, 1934, was carefully considered by your Worshipful Committee, and you reviewed the present position in regard to the inspection of imported meat. You were impressed by the fact that large quantities of meat arrive in such form that it is impossible for your Officers to carry out any useful inspection, and accordingly you appointed a Sub-Committee to consider the matter in detail, to see specimens of boneless and other unexaminable meat, and to discuss with the Minister of Health the question of putting the inspection of imported meat on a more satisfactory basis. At the request of your Sub-Committee your Medical Officer prepared the following statement of the position as it appeared to him:— DRAFT PUBLIC HEALTH (IMPORTED FOOD) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS. "Efficient meat inspection requires:— (1) inspection of the animal alive before slaughter, because in some cases illness may be obvious ante-mortem which would be very difficult to discover post-mortem; 31 (2) after slaughter, careful inspection of the internal organs, viz., lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, &c., because these organs are often affected by disease, of which there may be little or no evidence in the rest of the carcase; (3) examination of the serous membranes, that is, the smooth glistening membranes lining the chest cavity (pleura) and the abdominal cavity (peritoneum), because these membranes readily show evidence of inflammation and of tuberculosis; (4) examination of the lymphatic glands, because these also show evidence of inflammation, tuberculosis and other diseases; (5) examination of muscular tissue (or flesh) and of the bones. There are certain diseased conditions which produce obvious effects in the muscular tissue or the bones or the bone marrow, but in general these tissues are much less likely to show naked-eye evidence of disease than are the internal organs, the serous membranes (pleura and peritoneum) and the lymphatic glands. The Inspector of imported meat in this country obviously has not the advantage of the information to be derived from ante-mortem inspection, nor has he the opportunity of inspecting the internal organs in relation to the carcase from which they are derived. Lungs and spleens are never shipped, while livers and kidneys arrive separately as individual organs. Therefore, even if meat is imported as whole carcases, the Meat Inspector in an English port cannot have more than the serous membranes, the carcase lymphatic glands and the muscle and bone to examine. His inspection at best is, consequently, of much less value than the inspection of home-killed meat in a public abattoir. If the carcase is cut up into pieces before shipment the value of inspection is further diminshed. When the pieces all contain some readily accessible glands and/or some serous membrane he may examine these and may be justified in concluding that, whatever the condition of the animal at the time of slaughter or of the organs, the parts of the carcase under inspection are not affected by any disease. But when the pieces contain neither readily accessible lymph glands nor serous membrane he has virtually nothing on which to base any opinion, particularly as disease is in any case less easy to detect in frozen than in fresh meat. When meat is boned another difficulty arises even if lymphatic glands and serous membranes are present, because the meat is often so folded and pressed that it is almost impossible to identify the anatomical land marks which enable the Inspector to locate the lymphatic glands which he wishes to examine. Thawing out the meat causes much delay and deterioration, and is not justifiable as a routine procedure, because even after the meat is thawed the inspection which is then practicable is of only very limited value. To sum up, the inspection of imported meat even under the most favourable conditions is necessarily much below the standard obtainable in the inspection of home-killed meat in a public abattoir. If the cutting up of carcases before shipment is permitted the value of inspection is diminished more or less in proportion to the size of the pieces in which the meat arrives. To turn to legislation, Regulations dealing specially with Imported Meat were first issued in 1908. From the beginning the Ministry of Health (Local Government Board at that time) recognised that inspection on arrival in this country could only be of limited value, and they therefore instituted the Official Certificate, which is a certificate affixed to overseas meat by a competent authority in the country of origin, and which is recognised by the Minister of Health as evidence that the meat is derived from animals which were free from disease at the time of slaughter. Until 1933 the Official Certificate was only required with pork, but since the Public Health (Imported Food) Amendment Regulations, 1933, beef and mutton must also be certified. The draft Amendment Regulations, 1934, propose to require meat products, i.e., canned meat, meat pastes, &c., to bear the Official Certificate. It is thus apparent that the Ministry of Health have progressively extended the principle of requiring inspection and certification in the country of origin. 32 But the Ministry have not been prepared to depend entirely on the inspection abroad, because they have always prohibited the importation of certain classes of meat such as scrap meat, meat from the chest or belly from which the serous membrane has been detached, and meat from which any of the lymph glands usually inspected have been removed. The idea obviously has been to prohibit meat in such small pieces that examination is not practicable, and also meat from which evidence of disease may have been deliberately removed. But this object is not attained, firstly, because of the definition of scrap meat. If a piece of meat, however small, can be identified with a definite part of a carcase it is not scrap meat and is admissible. Experienced inspectors and butchers can say exactly from what part of a carcase quite small pieces of boneless meat are derived. Therefore many pieces of meat which are quite unexaminable must be admitted if they bear an Official Certificate of inspection in the country of origin. Secondly, though serous membranes may not be detached, pieces of meat are cut from the chest or abdominal wall which comprise only a very small portion of pleura or peritoneum, and we are again absolutely dependent on the inspection abroad. Finally, though the removal of certain lymphatic glands is prohibited, it is not illegal to cut so as to exclude lymphatic glands from the piece of meat. Meat arrives so cut as not to include any of the specified glands, but we cannot reject it unless we are satisfied that the glands have been deliberately taken out. Again, therefore, we are absolutely dependent upon the Official Certificate. As regards the issue of the Official Certificate in the meat inspecting countries there are the following possibilities:— (1) The standard of inspection, the organisation and the system of certification may be entirely satisfactory, in which case inspection of imported meat for disease would be unnecessary in this country, and inspection could be confined to the detection of conditions arising during transport, viz., decomposition, mould growths and brine staining. (2) The standard of inspection may be high, but the organisation and/or the system of certification may be unsatisfactory, thus vitiating to some extent the value of the inspection. In such case a check in this country is desirable. (3) The standard of inspection may be unsatisfactory. This, I think, is unlikely, but I would point out that by the definition of Official Certificate certified meat should be derived from animals free from disease at the time of slaughter. There are a number of localised diseases of animals which do not render the whole carcase unfit for food; the Meat Inspector abroad cannot, therefore, take the definition of Official Certificate literally, and must to some extent use his discretion as to what he should pass for export to this country. I submit that it would be better to prescribe the same standards of inspection abroad of meat destined for the English market as are recommended to Meat Inspectors at home. (Ministry of Health Memorandum 62/Foods.) We come, therefore, to this point, either we must rely absolutely on the inspection in the meat exporting countries or we must be able to check such inspection when the meat arrives here. If the former policy is to be adopted there is no need for a prohibited class of meat in the new Regulations. If the latter is to continue to be our policy, then meat should arrive in such form that it is possible by inspection to form an opinion as to its freedom from disease. It may be argued that the major part of the imports of meat is examinable, consisting as it does of quarters of beef and carcases of mutton and pork. This is true, but it is the best meat, and therefore meat which least needs inspection, which arrives in this form. There also arrive a number of cuts of first-class meat, but it is, generally speaking, the inferior meat which is unexaminable. If we are going to accept the inferior meat blindly we might as well accept the better meat without inspection. This is not a new problem, but the Quota system of controlling imports has brought it to a head because of the increase in the number and variety of cuts and in 33 boneless meat. No doubt this boneless meat does make a supply of cheap meat available for the poorer classes in the form largely of sausages and mince. If the prohibition of the importation of boneless and other unexaminable meat would cause deterioration in the standard of nutrition of these people it would certainly be exchanging a small doubtful risk for a certain serious one, an adequate diet being the first essential for the maintenance of health. But I am inclined to think that it would be possible to put the inspection of imported meat on a more satisfactory basis and yet ensure an ample supply of cheap meat. There appear to me to be three possible courses of action, viz.:— (1) Concentrate on ensuring a high standard of inspection and organisation in the abattoirs abroad and discontinue the inspection for disease of imported meat arriving in this country, or (2) restrict the importations of carcase meat to quarters of beef, whole carcases of mutton and whole carcases or sides of pork, or (3) restrict importations to (2) above, plus the cuts recognised in the London wholesale meat market. Inspection under (3) would not be so efficient as under (2), but practically all the cuts do present some tissues which may be usefully examined and boneless meat would be eliminated. Wholesale cuts vary slightly in different parts of the country, but at the present time we are accepting all sorts of strange cuts with names unrecognised in the home trade. Surely the London wholesale cuts could be accepted as a standard for imported meat. The problem is a difficult one, but the position of the Port Sanitary Authority is at present illogical in that they are the Authority responsible for the inspection of imported meat, yet they can only inspect the best because inferior meat arrives in unexaminable form. It seems, therefore, that some effort should be made to put the inspection of imported meat on a better basis." Having witnessed a demonstration of unexaminable meat, kindly arranged by Dr. W. M. Willoughby, the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London, and staged by Mr. Grace, Veterinary Surgeon at Smithfield Market, your Sub-Committee decided that the inspection of imported meat could be satisfactorily carried out only if imports were restricted to quarters of beef, whole carcases of mutton and whole carcases or sides of pork, except that internal organs such as livers, kidneys, &c., might be imported separately, since they would in themselves show evidence of disease and, provided they were suitably packed, could be adequately inspected. This view your Sub-Committee expressed very strongly in a subsequent interview with representatives of the Ministry of Health. CANNED FOODS. On 19th October, 1934, your Medical Officer read the following Paper before the Medical Committee of the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities. The points raised are still under consideration by the Committee:— Inspection of Canned Food. "When the Port Sanitary Regulations, 1933, came into force the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities was able to secure a very large measure of uniformity in Quarantine procedure in the Port of the United Kingdom, and more recently the Association have endeavoured to ensure that the standards of inspection of imported meat should be as nearly uniform as possible. I have already made some further suggestions in regard to the latter, and now I would ask you to consider some problems in connection with the inspection of canned foods. The following points appear to me to merit consideration:— 1. Inspection in relation to Customs Examination.—Article 7 (5) of the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, provides that the Food Inspector shall 34 not, "without the consent of the Customs Officer, examine an article of food in regard to which the duties of the Customs Officer have not been wholly discharged. This leads to a great deal of difficulty, particularly when a Food Inspector has a big district to cover. He sees a consignment of food, but cannot examine it because the entry has not been passed. When he returns later he may find that in the meantime the entry has been passed and the goods have been removed. Of course, a great deal depends on the relations between the Customs Officer and the Food Inspector, but at the best this article of the Regulations leads to a great deal of waste of time. 2. Proportion of Foodstuffs examined.—It would probably be impracticable to examine a definite minimum proportion of every consignment of canned food, but I think we might agree on the proportion of unsoundness found on sampling which should result in:— (a) the passing of the consignment; (b) further sampling; (c) sorting of the whole consignment. 3. Action to be taken in regard to blown tins.—We are all aware that in some cases the contents of blown cans could be consumed without danger to health, but we cannot be certain of the wholesomeness of the contents of any blown can till we have opened the can and examined the contents. Moreover, it is possible to land canned food in this country in such condition as to cause no suspicion as to its soundness. If a can is blown then there is some fault somewhere, either in the nature or quality of the product canned or in the can or in the process of canning or in the subsequent handling and storage. If we release blown cans of food for human consumption in any form we place the careless or inexpert canner on the same footing as the careful expert one. I hold very strongly the view that so far as the Food Inspector is concerned every blown can is a bad can and should be condemned, and that the contents should not be allowed to be used for human consumption in any form. Having said so much I would ask you to consider the following questions:— (a) Should any argument be admitted as to the fitness for human consumption under any circumstances of the contents of a blown can? e.g., Hydrogen swells for ordinary consumption, condensed milk for toffee-making, pulp for jam-making. (b) Should odd blown cans found in routine sampling be condemned or returned to the cases? In some districts it is, I believe, the practice to return blown cans to the cases when the proportion of unsound cans is not sufficient to warrant a complete examination of the consignment, the argument being that since on examination the whole consignment is to be passed none of the cans should be removed. While I admit that there will be in the unexamined portion of the consignment a proportion of unsound cans approximately equal to that in the sample examined, and therefore I am knowingly allowing a few unsound cans to go forward, I take the view that such unsound cans as actually come under the notice of the Sanitary Authority should be removed and condemned. 4. Action to be taken in regard to "repaired" cans (i.e., cans showing evidence of re-soldering of seams or vents).—From time to time cans which are apparently sound are found to show soldered perforations or re-soldered seams or edges. The contention is that such soldering is done in the factory before the goods are shipped. This may be true, but if we admit such cans how are we to stop cans which have been blown, vented and re-soldered, or which have leaked and been repaired? My own view is that if we have reason to suspect that any can has been unsealed at any time we should unhesitatingly condemn it, admitting no plea that our action should be based on the results of bacteriological or other examination of the contents. 5. Action to be taken in regard to so-called "Slack Cap" cans.—In trade examinations of canned goods a term "Slack Cap" is used indicating that the top and bottom, of the can spring up and down when pressure is applied by the fingers. The suggestion is that this is a structural defect in the can and that the contents are perfectly sound. I take the view that in the majority of these cases the condition indicates an early 35 stage of blowing, that is to say, there is a slightly positive instead of a negative pressure in the can. I would suggest that so-called "slack caps" or "springers" should be treated as blown cans unless the Pood Inspector is absolutely satisfied that there is not a positive pressure in the can. 6. Action to be taken in regard to cans opened for examination by Customs Officers, Merchants, &c.—The usual practice is to re-solder these cans and return them to the cases. But the cans have been unsealed and air has been admitted; they are very likely to blow subsequently, and I suggest that re-soldering should be prohibited, and that the cans should only be allowed to go for immediate consumption. 7. Action to be taken in regard to cans showing slight evidence of leakage.—It not infrequently happens that cans show evidence of having leaked slightly at the seams, but the leakage has become sealed by drying of the exuded material. It is sometimes argued that the contents are perfectly sound. I would suggest that any can showing any evidence of having leaked, however slightly, at any time, should be condemned as unsound. 8. Notifications to the Sanitary Authority of Trade Examinations.—A percentage of the majority of consignments of canned food is examined by or on behalf of the merchants. I would suggest that the Sanitary Authority should be notified of the time and place of all such examinations. This would often enable the Sanitary Authority to judge the condition of consignments more efficiently and with less inconvenience than by a separate but probably more limited inspection. 9. Action to be taken on application of merchants to remove goods to another district for sorting or reconditioning.—Applications of this nature are often made. I would suggest that in every case the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which the goods are to be removed should be asked if he is prepared to supervise the process and notify the Port Medical Officer of Health of the result. 10. Methods of control of foodstuffs released for industrial purposes.—Much unsound food is not destroyed, but is used for various purposes other than human consumption, e.g., the manufacture of soap, grease, poultry food, &c., or for the feeding of cattle or pigs. In the Port of London it has been the practice to obtain guarantees from the ultimate users, but in my opinion it would be better not to release the goods until the Medical Officer of Health of the district of destination has signified his willingness to receive the goods into his district and to supervise their disposal. 11. Method of control of sweepings of flour, rice, sugar, &c.—I would suggest that these should always be controlled and should not be allowed to be used for human consumption, except in the case of sugar, which may be so used after refining in a sugar factory. 12. biterchange of information.—It is impossible to sample all imported foodstuffs in any one Port, and I would suggest that when unsatisfactory conditions are, found, particularly such as can only be detected by chemical or bacteriological examination, the information should be circulated to other Ports likely to receive similar consignments. I hope you will consider these various points, which are all raised as the result of difficulties which have been experienced in the Port of London. We can only sample the enormous quantities of foodstuffs which are imported, but if we all work on similar lines, and if we exchange information freely, I feel sure that unsatisfactory conditions will not long remain undetected." The following Report is presented by Mr. R. Clifford, who, as your Food Inspector on the London and St. Katharine Docks, has much practical experience in the inspection of canned foods and who has taken a particularly keen interest in this branch of the work Slack-Capped Tins. (By R. Clifford, Food Inspector.) Much controversy has centred around the question of slack-capped tins (or "slacks" as known by the Trade), a type of tin occasionally met with during the examination of canned goods. The term is generally understood to mean a tin having 36 a cap too large for it, and believed by some to be due to defects in the capping machinery. I do not think this has any connection with the production of these tins. When the ends of these tins are pressed with the hand a slight up and down movement of the cap is obtained, but there is no impression of internal pressure as in the case of a tin commencing to blow. When a container made of light tin plate is knocked on the rim the ends may be forced up a little, giving this slight up and down movement characteristic of a slack cap. A knock so slight that indentation of the tin may be hardly noticeable will sometimes produce this condition. When a tin which is well packed (or called by the Trade "over packed") is processed the ends may bulge, especially if the contents were cold when the capping took place. In this case the corrugations of the caps are likely to be strained, and thus the ends keep their convex appearance after processing and the tin appears to be blown. The ends can be forced back into their normal position, but a reasonable pressure is required to overcome the resistance of the ribs or corrugations which have been strained by the expansion of the contents. There is no up and down movement in this case, but the caps, having been increased in size by the strain, have a convex appearance. In this type of can it is possible to press in the caps half-way round, so that part is slightly concave, leaving the other half convex. With a slightly blown tin this would not be possible, as on pressure the cap would spring in ; providing it was not too far blown. When examining canned goods care should always be taken in passing judgment on tins showing any movement of the ends when pressed with the hands. During examinations carried out, whether for trade purposes or at the request of the Medical Officer of Health, slack tins should not be passed until the Medical Officer of Health is satisfied they are not in the early stages of blowing. On one occasion a person interested in canned goods actually asked the question, "How long does it take for a slack tin to develop into a blown condition?" On a further occasion I was asked to examine 10 cases of canned fish which had been classed as slacks by the examiner. These were found to be in an early stage of blowing, as was shown by the fact that some of the tins, when pierced under water, gave off bubbles of gas. On enquiries I found that approximately 40 cases of the same parcel were obviously blown and had been classed as such by the same examiner. I assume that he called the 10 cases slack because of the belief amongst people that a tin in the early stage of blowing is a slack. There is one thing which must be made quite clear, there is no connection between a slack-capped tin and one which has commenced to blow. Both may have the same external appearance, but whereas one is a defect of the container itself, the other is due to micro-organisms, or to the presence of hydrogen generated by the action of the acid contents on the tin plate. The usual method of converting a slack into a normal can is to strike the top of the can sharply with a rubber-faced wooden mallet, causing a permanent strain inwards in the ribs. This is a practice which should not be encouraged, and one to which no firm of repute would resort. The so-called "slack cap" may be found in any shape or size of can, and the causes of genuine " slacks " may be summarised as follows:— (1) Capping when contents are cold. This undoubtedly accounts for a large percentage of slacks. (2) Overfilling. (3) Badly ribbed or corrugated ends. (4) The use of light tin plate. (5) A knock on some part of the tin due to bad handling. (6) Machinery defects. This accounts for very few, if any, "slacks." A combination of any of these may result in producing slack-capped tins. 37 Mr. P. W. Coombe, your Food Inspector on the West India and Millwall Docks, submits the following Report on "reconditioned tins," of which a considerable number have come under his observation during the year:— Canned Goods. (By P. W. Coombe, Food Inspector.) During the examination of canned goods the Inspector frequently meets the reconditioned and re-soldered tin. There has been considerable controversy as to what action should be taken in dealing with this class of goods. The vast majority of the canned foods we get to-day are capped on the "Sanitary Cap" principle, where no solder other than for the side seam is used. Reconditioned tins are usually found a few in a case. There may be one or two solder marks on the cap or a small solder mark under the cap flange or rim showing where the tin has been pierced and re-soldered or the cap flange or rim may be soldered round or partly round, because the "crimping" machine has failed to turn in and after processing the tin was found to be a "leaker." It is sometimes difficult to determine whether the goods are old stock, and in the course of time have become "blown" and "leaky," as the tin may be of a bright and rust-free appearance. On the other hand, newly canned products may turn out defective, due to the "crimping" machine being defective or through bad processing. No doubt prior to re-soldering at the cannery the tins receive a second "processing," but there is no means of knowing whether a tin has blown during the "in stock" period or at the time of canning. Any tins showing evidence of re-soldering should, therefore, be treated with suspicion. There is always the possibility that the "blowing" has been due to micro-organisms which may have produced toxins of a harmful type. In any case there is an element of risk in eating the contents of any tins where there is any suspicion that "blowing" has taken place. In addition, when a tin has been pierced after blowing to release the gases and been subjected to a re-processing there is doubt as to whether a sterilising temperature has been employed and micro-organisms may have survived and developed when conditions became suitable. While there is always an element of doubt as to the soundness of these tins for human consumption, I think, in fairness to the importer and the public generally, such tins should not be allowed to be distributed. The canning of foodstuffs has been brought to such a high state of efficiency that the importation of reconditioned tins is quite unnecessary and should not be permitted. Meat Importations. Chilled Beef from the Antipodes. A number of experimental consignments of chilled beef from both Australia and New Zealand have arrived in the Port of London. The consignments from New Zealand have been carried successfully both with and without the addition of carbonic acid gas to the atmosphere of the chambers. The voyage from Australia is longer, and though one or two consignments carried in the ordinary way have arrived in fairly good condition, it appears that the presence of about 10 per cent. of carbonic acid gas in the chambers is a very great advantage. 38 Consignments which arrived in chambers specially equipped to maintain a constant concentration of carbonic acid gas were in excellent condition at the time of arrival, and the meat was very favourably commented upon in Smithfield Market. We may undoubtedly look forward to the establishment, in the near future, of a regular trade in chilled beef from the Antipodes. Caseous Lymphadenitis.—During the year the proportion of carcases of imported mutton examined for Caseous Lymphadenitis, irrespective of the country of origin, remained at 5 per cent., and that for pieces of mutton at 100 per cent. The results of the examination during the year of mutton and lamb, weight 43 lbs. and over, from Australia, New Zealand and South America were as follows:- Where from. Carcases examined. Carcases found to be diseased. Carcases found to have Lymphatic Glands missing. Australia 5,464 4 — New Zealand 8,328 4 1 South America 6,818 17 — Totals 20,610 25 1 Percentage condemned. From Australia 0.07 „ New Zealand 0.05 „ South America 0.25 Pig Carcases.—A careful examination was made of a percentage of pig carcases arriving in the Port, the number of carcases examined being 2,632. Five carcases were found to be diseased. Actinobacillosis in Ox Tongues.—A percentage examination was made of every consignment of ox tongues arriving in the Port. 181 consignments were put in dock store, where careful examination was made by your Officers of 14,238 tongues, and 97 tongues were found affected with Actinobacillosis. During March two consignments of bacon representing 1,208 sides arrived from Hamburg and were condemned on account of bone taint and decomposition. Boracised hams arrived in fairly large quantities from U.S.A. and Canada, and went forward to the Southwark district, where their distribution for export or ship stores was controlled by the Medical Officer of Health of Southwark. Canned Goods. The results of the examination of consignments of sardines for contamination by lead are given on pages 45 to 55. During the latter part of the year a number of samples of canned sild were found to be contaminated with tin. Investigation of this matter is being continued. A consignment of 240 cases of canned mutton from Australia arrived in December, and 40 cases, representing 480 tins, were found to be blown and leaky, and were destroyed. A number of consignments of grape fruit juice arrived and were found to contain an excess of sulphur dioxide preservative. These consignments were, however, released under Section 11 (1) (iii.) (b) of the Public Health (Preservatives, &c., in Food) Regulations, the importers guaranteeing that the juice would be "so treated before it is sold or exposed for sale by retail as to comply with the provisions of the Schedule as regards the proportion of sulphur dioxide contained." A consignment of pineapple chunks in water arrived from Singapore. On examination a large percentage of the tins were found to have been re-soldered. The attention of the importers was drawn to this undesirable practice and all tins showing more than one puncture hole were destroyed. 89 At the commencement of the year a number of large consignments of sultanas and raisins arrived showing an excess of sulphite preservative. These were all re-exported under guarantee that the goods would not be returned to any Port in the United Kingdom. During the year approximately 350 tons of over-ripe and under-ripe bananas from the Argentine and Canary Islands were destroyed. Action taken under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1935, resulted in 1,825 tons 14 cwts. 2 qrs. 10 lbs. of unsound food being destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption.

For action under these Regulations, reference is directed to the list of foodstuffs submitted for analysis. FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ACT, 1926. During the year sixty-three samples were examined by the Authority's Agricultural Analyst in accordance with the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act. No samples were found to contravene the Regulations made under the Act. In cases where there was no statutory statement with the consignment as it lay on the quay in the Port of London, a copy of the Analyst's report was forwarded to the Local Authority of the area in which the registered office of the importer was situated, for comparison with the statutory statement when it became available. 44 (2) SHELLFISH. The shellfish layings on the North side of the Estuary of the Thames continue to be subject to the Order issued by the Port Sanitary Authority in November, 1916, under the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1915. In December the Ministry of Health issued the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934, which come into operation on 1st January, 1935, and which will permit your Worshipful Committee to vary your Orders of 1916 which you have for some years desired to do, but for which there was no provision under the 1915 Regulations. In the schedule to the new Regulations is a model form of Order as follows:— Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934. Order made by the* *Insert name of Local Authority. In pursuance of the powers conferred on them by the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934, the* herebv make the followins Order †Insert description of Area. 1. In this Order, "prescribed area" means:— † **These words should be varied according to circumstances. ***Omit any of the following words which may be unsuitable. 2. A person shall not sell, or expose or distribute or offer for sale or have in his possession for the purpose of sale for human consumption any (**shellfish, mussels, cockles) taken from within the prescribed area***, unless such **shellfish, mussels, cockles have been— (i.) subjected to a satisfactory process of cleansing at an establishment which is for the time being approved by the Minister of Health for the purpose ; or (ii.) relaid in pure water for such period and in such place as may from time to time be approved for the purpose by the said Council; or (iii.) subjected to a process of sterilisation by steam under pressure for at least six minutes in an apparatus which is for the time being approved by the said Council. 3. This Order shall come into operation on the day of 193 . Given under the Common Seal of the this day of , 193 . When the draft of these Regulations was under discussion between the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities and the Ministry of Health, it appeared that the system of dealing with polluted shellfish layings by closure was far from satisfactory from the point of view of both the protection of the public health and the interests of the shellfish industry. Your Medical Officer was accordingly requested to make some suggestions as to other lines of approach towards the solution of this problem, and at the Meeting of the Medical Committee of the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities on 30th November, 1934, he read the following short Paper:— "I submit that the present system of closure of polluted layings is ruinous to the shellfish industry and unsatisfactory from a public health point of view. "Most of the shellfish beds in the British Isles are more or less exposed to contamination by sewage. Some are so grossly polluted that closure has been necessary; in regard to others, though there is topographical and, indeed, bacteriological evidence of pollution, they have never been definitely incriminated in connection with any outbreak of disease, and therefore such drastic action as closure has never been taken. Nevertheless, such layings are a constant source of anxiety, as being a potential danger to the public health. There are a few, a diminishing number, yielding shellfish which will pass a rather generous and purely arbitrary bacteriological standard. 45 ''Thus the position is that the general public have little or no confidence in shellfish, and many are definitely afraid to eat them. To close layings destroys a local industry yet does not altogether eliminate danger because it is in most cases very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent unauthorised persons from taking shellfish clandestinely and disposing of them for human consumption. "The problem should be dealt with, not by the negative action of closing shellfish layings, but by the positive action of making shellfish safe as an article of diet, thus re-establishing public confidence and so resuscitating the shellfish industry. "The work carried out by Dr. Dodgson at Conway has shown that mussels and oysters can be efficiently cleansed, and that the process can in time be made to pay its way. The Public Health (Cleansing of Shellfish) Act, 1932, enables Local Authorities to provide or contribute towards the provision of means for cleansing shellfish, but it appears that both private and public enterprise needs some encouragement to embark on the capital outlay involved in the establishment of cleansing apparatus. "It is therefore suggested that the necessary encouragement should be given by the issue of Regulations by the Minister of Health prohibiting the sale for human consumption of any shellfish which are not certified by a responsible Authority to have been cleansed at an approved station in this country. Even imported shellfish would have to be cleansed between their arrival in this country and their distribution. "The process of cleansing in the case of oysters and mussels would presumably be washing and relaying in sterile sea-water, as practised at the Conway station. Cockles and winkles would probably be sterilised by steaming, but in my opinion even this method should be carried on only in approved stations, either established and operated by Local Authorities or at least under their close supervision. "I believe that, though this suggestion may appear to involve very drastic restrictions on the sale of shellfish, it is the only way in which the public health can be safeguarded, and at the same time the shellfish industry of this country be saved from extinction. "I therefore submit for your consideration the following Resolution:— "'That, in the opinion of the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities of the British Isles, the present system of control of shellfish layings by closure is unsatisfactory as a public health measure and ruinous to the shellfish industry ; that it has now been proved that shellfish can be efficiently cleansed by relaying in the case of oysters and mussels and by steaming in the case of cockles and winkles; that the necessary apparatus can be established and operated on a self-supporting basis, and that therefore the time has now arrived when legislation might be introduced with advantage to both the public health and shellfish industry, requiring that only such shellfish (whether home-produced or imported) should be sold for human consumption as are certified by a responsible Authority to have been cleansed in this country by an approved method in a recognised establishment.'" The suggestion is still under consideration by the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities. (3) SAMPLES OF FOOD EXAMINED DURING THE YEAR. (a) BACTERIOLOGIST Date. Sample. Result of Analysis.

Unblown can:—This sample was found to contain tin and tin compounds equivalent to 0.25 grains of tin per pound. In the case of this tin the contents showed signs of fermentation and the fruit was somewhat tasteless. The liquor contained 2.17% of proof spirit and some yeast cells were detected under the microscope. With regard to the solder points, the punctures in these covers have been made in each case from without. What has probably happened is that both tins have been blown twice and both were punctured and the gas released when the first blowing occurred. When the second blowing took place, only the second tin was punctured, quite probably the first can did not show signs of a big blow at the time.

Medical Certificates under the Aliens Order were issued in respect of 16 Aliens as follows:— Lunatic, Idiot or Mentally Deficient 7 Physically incapacitated 9 Total 16 DANGEROUS DRUGS. On 4th July your Medical Officer certified that the Surgeon in Charge of the Health Department of the Training Ship "Almirante Saldanha" was authorised to purchase and be in possession of :— Cocaine Hydrochloride 2 grammes. Morphine Hydrochloride 5 „ Codeina 20 „ Miamorphine Hydrochloride 2 „ Dionia 5 „ for the use of the ship until it reached its home port. On 25th October a similar authorisation was issued to the Master of the ss. "Betan Curia" in respect of:— Morphine Hydrochloride 50 tabs. ¼ gr. Cocaine Hydrochloride 25 tabs.½ gr. Tincture Opii 1 oz. These Certificates were issued under the Dangerous Drugs (No. 3) Regulations, 1923, amending the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921, Regulation 15 of which is as follows:— "If a foreign ship in any port in Great Britain requires to obtain a supply of any of the drugs in order to complete the necessary equipment of the ship, the Master of 60 the ship is authorised to purchase and be in possession of such quantity of any of the drugs as may be certified by the Medical Officer of Health of the Port where the ship is (or in his absence by the Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port) to be necessary for the purpose, the quantity not to exceed what is required for the use of the ship until it next reaches its home port. The certificate given by the Medical Officer or Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port shall be marked by the supplier with the date of the supply, and shall be retained by him and kept available for inspection." HOUSEBOATS. Early in the year your Medical Officer completed a preliminary draft of Bye-laws for the control of houseboats under the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1938. This draft was submitted to the Port of London Authority, who, as the Registration Authority for houseboats lying within their district, drafted separate Bye-laws dealing with such registration. It thus appeared that there were likely to be three sets of Bye-laws, one made by the Port of London Authority regulating the registration of houseboats lying within their district, another made by the Port Sanitary Authority for the registration of houseboats lying outside the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority but within the district of the Port Sanitary Authority, and a third made by the Port Sanitary Authority dealing with the sanitary control of all these houseboats. After consultation with the Secretary of the Port of London Authority, your Medical Officer undertook to draft a single set of Bye-laws which could be made jointly by the Port of London Authority and the Port Sanitary Authority. This draft was, on the instruction of your Worshipful Committee, passed to Mr. Solicitor to be drawn up in due legal form and to be submitted officially to the Port of London Authority and the Ministry of Health. Several points have arisen in discussion with the Port of London Authority, and it appears that it will be some time before the Bye-laws receive the final approval of both the Port of London Authority and the Ministry of Health. Meanwhile the unsatisfactory conditions, particularly in Leigh and Benfleet Creeks, continue. LIVE CATTLE—LANDING AT TILBURY DOCKS. Only three shipments of live cattle arrived during the year, as follows:— ss. "Prospector" from Canada arrived on 8th February, 1934, with 402 head of cattle.

In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority during the year ended 31st December, 1934. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a "canal" for the purposes of the Acts "includes any river, inland navigation, lake or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb and flow of the tide." The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the right bank— From Teddington downwards:— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Dock. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). The entrance to Gravesend Canal. Cliffe Creek. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Part of the River Medway and of the Swale. On the left bank— From Teddington downwards:— The entrance of the River Brent. Hammersmith Creek. Chelsea Creek. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Bow Creek (River Lea). Barking Creek (River Roding). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). Mucking Creek. Thames Haven and Hole Haven.
