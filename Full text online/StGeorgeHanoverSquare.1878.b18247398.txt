The Sanitary condition of the Parish, has been watched over by Dr. Corfield, the Medical Officer of Health and Analyst, who has presented monthly reports to the Yestry upon the subject. Complaints of nuisances have been examined into by the Inspector of Nuisances. The Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health will be found at page 68. 35 Water Companies Accounts. A Statement of the Accounts of the Grand Junction Water Works Company, and the Chelsea Water Works Company, for their financial year, ended in March last, has been forwarded to the Yestry Clerk in accordance with the Provisions of "The Metropolis Water Act, 1871," and may be inspected by any Ratepayer, free of charge. Charities. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1878, of the Rector and Churchwardens, of their expenditure as trustees for Charities belonging to this Parish, is printed in Appendix No. 8. St. George's Church. The Yestry having had under consideration the question of the right of the Earl of Harewood to hold, free of rent, three pews in the South Gallery of St. George's Church, and having referred to the resolution of Yestry of 1725 and 1810 thereon, Resolved— That a letter be written to Lord Harewood calling his attention to the correspondence of 1810, between the Yestry and the then Lord Harewood, and the representative of General Steuart, and the resolution of the Yestry thereon, of the 10th February in that year; and further, to the fact that neither the then Lord Harewood, or any son of his, is now a Parishioner—that, under these circumstances, the period, pointed to by the before-named resolution, is at an end, and that, therefore, the time has arrived at which rent in the usual way should be paid for the pews (numbers 42, 43, and 44). That these pews be offered to Lord Harewood at the rent of £19 10*. per annum. 36 The Vestry have pleasure in reporting that, after inquiry, Lord Harewood forwarded, through his agents, a cheque for one year's rent of the three pews, and that the pews are now let to his lordship on the same terms as similar pews in the church are let. Erection of Parish Mortuary. The Vestry having for a long time past considered it desirable that a public Mortuary should be erected in the Parish, to which the bodies of persons dying in the Parish could be removed, Resolved— That having in view the fact of a Faculty having been recently obtained, for the erection of a Mortuary, in a disused burial ground in Bethnal Grreen, the Vestry apply for a Faculty to erect a Mortuary in the old burial ground at the rear of Mount Street. The Rector and Churchwardens having acquiesced in this Resolution, a joint application for a Faculty was made to the Chancellor of the Diocese. The application was opposed by some of the Ratepayers living in the immediate neighbourhood of Mount Street; but the Faculty has been granted. Perambulation of the Parish Boundaries. The boundaries of the Parish were perambulated by some of the Members of the Vestry, accompanied by the Sidesmen and Vestry Officers, and boys from several of the National Schools of the Parish, on the 4th June, 1878. The last occasion on which the boundaries were previously perambulated was on May 9th, 1872. Treasurer of Metropolitan Board of Works. The following Resolutions were passed by the Vestry on the 20th February, 1879:— 37 That in the opinion of this Vestry, it is desirable that the Metropolitan Board of Works should appoint the Governor and Company of the Bank of England to be their Treasurers and Bankers; and that a copy of this Resolution, if carried, be forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works. That a copy of the Resolution, just carried, be forwarded, under the seal of the Vestry, to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, and that they be asked to receive a deputation from the Vestry in support of the Resolution. The Vestry, on the 11th March, 1879, waited upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and spoke in support of the Resolution as above. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in reply promised to give the matter his consideration. No reply has yet been received. Flooding of Houses from Overflow of the King's Scholars' Pond Sewer. The basements of several houses in Tachbrook Street and the neighbourhood thereof having been flooded in the early morning of the 2nd January, 1879, the Vestry again called the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works to this overflow, and to the injury to health likely to arise from the frequent overflows from this sewer. The Vestry have continued to urge on the Metropolitan Board of Works the necessity of some steps being taken to stop a repetition of the serious annoyance and nuisance to many of the ratepayers arising from these overflows, and the matter is now engaging the attention of the Board. Music License. Notice of an intended application to Quarter Sessions, for a Music License for 316, Oxford Street, having been given 38 to the Vestry, they instructed the Parish Solicitors to oppose the application. The applicant failed to appear to support his application, and no license was granted. Lists of the Duties of the Medical Officer of Health, Inspector of Nuisances, Gas Inspector, Assistant Surveyor, Wharf Clerk, Horse Keeper, Wharf Foreman (Belgrave Wharf), Clerk of the Works (In-Wards), and Yard Foreman (In-Wards), having been drawn out by the Vestry and printed, are to be found in Appendix No. 9, together with a List of the duties of the Lamplighters. Funds Available for Educational Purposes. The Yestry received a copy of the following resolution from the Yestry of St. James:— "That the several Parishes in the Metropolis, the Corporation of the City of London, the Livery Companies of London, and other public bodies now possess large funds available for educational purposes, for the relief of the poor, and for other public objects, and that, in view of the constantly increasing burdens imposed on the Ratepayers of the Metropolis by the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Yestries, and the London School Board, in the carrying out of their varied and increasing powers, it is desirable for a full inquiry to be made, under the authority of a Royal Commission, into the character and circumstances of any such funds, in order to ascertain how far they may be rightfully directed to the relief of such Ratepayers, and to all or any of the objects served by the several governing bodies and rating authorities of the Metropolis. That a copy of the 39 above Resolution be forwarded to the Home Secretary, to the several members of the Cabinet, to the Corporation of the City of London, to the several Guilds of the City, to each Yestry and District Board, and to the several Boards of Guardians in London." The Yestry approved of the resolution of the Yestry of St. James, and appointed three Delegates to a Conference called by the St. James' Yestry upon the subject. The matter is still under consideration. PARLIAMENTARY. Artizans' Dwellings Act (1868) Extension Bill. This Bill having been considered by the Yestry, the following resolution was come to thereon, viz.:— "That the provisions of the Act should be carried out by the various Yestries and District Boards of the Metropolis as heretofore, and not by the Metropolitan Board of Works as proposed by the Bill." "That the last paragraph of Clause 12, as follows:— 'Fourthly, that pending such appeal, no work shall be done nor proceedings taken, under such order, until after the determination of such appeal unless such appeal cease to be prosecuted'— should be omitted from the Bill." The Yestry petitioned Parliament for an alteration of the Bill, in accordance with the above resolutions. The Bill was considerably amended by a Select Committee, and passed into law. Contagious Diseases (Animals) Amendment Bill (1878). The attention of the Yestry having been particularly 40 called to Sub-section 2 of Section 9 of this Bill, they resolved as follows, viz.:— "That the Vestry petition Parliament against Sub-section 2 of Section 9 of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Bill, and that the Borough Members be asked to present the Petition, and to support its prayer. That a copy of the Petition be forwarded to Colonel Hayter, M.P., and that he be asked to support the views of the Vestry in Parliament." The Bill, in an amended form, passed into law. Notices of intended applications to Parliament for private Acts in the Session of 1878-9, were given as under. Metropolitan and District Tramways. (To lay tramways in Pimlico Road, Buckingham Palace Road, &c.) West London Tramways. (To lay tramway in Uxbridge Road.) South Western Metropolitan Tramways. (To lay tramways in Pimlico Road, Buckingham Palace Road, Vauxhall Bridge Road, &c.) The Vestry dissented from each scheme, and resolved to petition Parliament against the Bills—neither of the portions of the Bills affecting this Parish were proceeded with, and consequently further action in the matter was unnecessary. Valuation Bill (1879). This Bill was again introduced into Parliament by the Government, and the Vestry, having considered the same, passed the following resolutions with regard to some of the clauses which they forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board, viz.:— Clauses 9, 11, 64.—That it is desirable that, as regards the service of notices, provision should be made 41 for the service of a notice of assessment or objection in the case of an unoccupied house, by its being left within the house so unoccupied. Clause 65.—That Assessment Committees in the Metropolis should be composed of Members elected, from the Parishes in Union, by the respective Vestries, instead of by the Board of Guardians of the Union. The Bill was subsequently withdrawn. District Auditors' Bill. The Vestry petitioned Parliament against the Clauses of this Bill, proposing to impose a charge for stamps on the audited financial statements of Local Authorities, on the ground that the Auditor is an officer appointed by the Local Government Board, and not by the Local Authority. The Bill, however, has become law. Coroners' Bill. With regard to this Bill the following resolutions were passed by the Vestry, viz.:— "That a clause should be introduced into the Bill for preventing, in all cases where another room can be found for the purpose, the holding of Inquests in Public Houses." "That the election of County Coroners should, in future, be by the respective Courts of Quarter Sessions, or by the newly-appointed County Board, if the County Boards Bill, now pending, be passed." "That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to the Home Secretary and to Mr. Reginald Yorke, M.P." The Bill was withdrawn. 42 During the year 32 communications have been received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, notifying the applications made for the consent of the Board to the erection of porticoes, bay windows, additions, or other alterations to property within the line of area in this Parish.

Pest House Charity. This Parish, together with the Parishes of St. Martinin-the-Fields, St. Clement Danes, St. James, Westminster, and St. Paul, Covent Garden, are interested in this Charity, which was founded by Earl Craven, in 1687. The Charity, in 1868, consisted of property at Craven-hill-gardens, Cravenhill-mews, and Craven-mews, let at rents realizing £183 14s. per annum; and £15,537 cash, being the purchase-money due for premises belonging to the Charity, taken for the purposes of the Metropolitan Railway Company; and £395 7s. 8d.

The Charity was originally demised by the Earl Craven, for the benefit of poor persons suffering from the plague. A scheme for the management and regulation of the Charity, and for the application of the income thereof, was approved by orders of the Court of Chancery, on 30th May, 1864, and 19th February, 1868. Under this Scheme, the Incumbents of each of the Parishes interested, are by virtue of their offices, always to be Trustees. In addition to which, Trustees have been appointed by the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, upon the nominations of the several Vestries, in the following proportions, viz.:— St. Martin-in-the-Fields 2 St. George, Hanover-square 2 St. Clement Danes 4 St. James, Westminster 4 St. Paul, Covent Garden 4 48 One of the appointed Trustees from each Parish is to go out of office every fourth year, but shall be eligible for reelection. The duties of the Trustees, Receiver, and Clerk are laid down in the Scheme, and the application of the income is as follows, viz.:— "After providing for any costs or expenses which may from time to time be directed by any Court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be paid out of the funds of the Charity, and paying the current expenses of the management and administration of the trust, in pursuance of this Scheme, the Trustees shall, until the further order or direction of the Court of Chancery, from time to time pay three-fifth parts (not exceeding £600) of the net annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of King's College Hospital in Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and the remaining two-fifth parts (not exceeding £400) of such net annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of Charingcross Hospital in Agar-street, Strand, such payments to be received by the said Hospitals respectively on the conditions hereinafter mentioned:— "I. The Governors of King's College Hospital shall set apart twenty-four beds, and the Governors of Charing-cross Hospital shall set apart sixteen beds, in a convenient part or parts of their respective Hospitals, and shall receive therein such patients (herein called in-patients), being sick and otherwise qualified according to the provisions hereof, as shall be sent by the Trustees with in-patients' orders as hereinafter provided. "II. The said Governors respectively shall also receive 49 and supply with advice and medicine as outpatients all poor persons resident in the said several Parishes who shall be sent by the Trustees with out-patients' orders at the customary times for the attendance of out-patients. "III. The Secretaries of the said Hospitals respectively shall give immediate notice to the Clerk of all vacancies in the number of the in-patients, and of any person being rejected as an inpatient. "IV. All in-patients requiring medical or surgical aid, and being fit cases for Hospital treatment, shall be received by both Hospitals indiscriminately, whether suffering from contagious or infectious disorders or not (small-pox alone being excepted), and shall be treated in all respects in the same manner as the other patients received into the Hospitals respectively." The orders for admission as in-patients or for treatment as out-patients in the Hospitals, are granted by an Order Committee, consisting of five Trustees, one member of the Committee being elected from each Parish interested. A new Scheme is to be obtained, if by the falling in of leases or otherwise the net income of the Charity shall exceed £1,000, or if at any time, from change of circumstances or otherwise, Her Majesty's Attorney-General should be of opinion that further arrangements are desirable, Samaritan Fund. In the year 1862 the sum of £50 was left by Lady Williams to the poor of this Parish. The sum having been D 50 handed to the Clerk of the Governors and Directors of the Poor, they, under the authority of the 13th section of "The Parish Local Act" (7 Geo. IV., cap. cxxi.), on the 21st May, 1862, resolved:— "That a book be provided, called the Samaritan Fund Book, in which the amount should be entered; that the money be kept in the Clerk's hands, and disposed of, from time to time, by this Board, the sums given being signed by the presiding Chairman of the day." Subsequently the Board further resolved:— " That a box be placed at the House in Mount-street, with the following inscription,—' Samaritan Fund of St. George, Hanover-square, for the Relief, by Gift, of such Poor Persons as the Poor Board cannot, by law, assist with Money and "That the Governors and Directors of the Poor, for the time being, constitute a Committee for the distribution of the Samaritan Fund." Upon the formation of St. George's Union, the Fund was handed over to Trustees, for the benefit of the poor of this Parish. The box is retained at the Mount-street Workhouse, and the funds arising therefrom are distributed by the Trustees, upon the recommendations of the Board of Guardians of St. George's Union.

(as per Stock Book). On the 25th of March, 1878, the number of horses in stock, the property of the Parish, was twenty-seven. Since 65 then two horses have been sold by auction, and one destroyed, and have realized £51 18s. 10d. Three horses have been purchased, at a cost of £252. The number of horses in stock, therefore, at the end of the past year (Lady-day 1879) was twenty-seven; the value of which I estimate at £2,000. Stable Arrangements. The cost incurred, under this heading, in the maintenance of the Parish Plant, together with the keep of the above horses, including all labour and expenses for the year ended Lady-day 1879, has been £4,346 2s., viz.:— Particulars. £ s. d.

Sewers. Serious accidents to the workmen employed in cleansing the sewers having resulted from the accumulation of foul gas therein, the Committee of Works instructed me to report upon the matter, with a view of suggesting some remedial means to prevent such accidents in future. In my Report to the Committee, of the 13th November, 1878, I suggested the use of "Davy lamps," instead of the ordinary open lamps; the Committee having approved of the suggestion, these lamps are now used by all men employed in sewer work throughout the Parish. It affords me very great pleasure to be in a position to state that notwithstanding the fact that several works have been carried out during the year which were not estimated for, the annual expenditure has not exceeded the estimate.

LIVINGSTONE, C.E., 1, Pimlico Road, s.W. Surveyor. June 1879. 68 REPORT on THE SANITARY CONDITION OF The Parish of St. George Hanober Square, FOR THE YEAR 1878, by W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (Lond.), Medical Officer of Health (Being his Seventh Annual Report). To teh Vestry of the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, The year 1878 has been a very healthy one, although the mortality has been higher than the exceptionally low rate of 1877. Table I. shows that although the gross total of deaths registered in the Parish, viz., 2,007, was considerably higher than that in any one of the last ten years, with the exception of 1870, when it was 2,030, this was owing to the unusually large number of deaths which took place in Public Institutions in the Parish, viz., 741. I estimate the population of the Parish, at the middle 69 of the year, at 91, 242, which is to the estimated population of London, about as 1 to 39 1/5. The number of deaths which took place in the Public Institutions throughout London in the year was 15,381; of these, our share according to population was 392, instead of 741, the number registered in the Parish. Our corrected total of deaths was therefore, as shown in Table I., 1,658, while the average for the last ten years, was Table I. YEAR. Gross Total of Deaths. Deaths in Public Institutions. Proportional Share of Deaths in Public Institutions. Corrected Total of Deaths (52 weeks).

This is a lower rate than that recorded for any year, except 1877, when it was quite exceptionally low, and 1873, when it was 1816, or practically the same as in 1878, and it is considerably lower than the average of the last ten years, which was 18.92. That the causes which made the death-rate of 1877 so low, were general, is shown by the fact, that not only the death-rate of London was exceptionally low, viz., 21.9 in that year, but also that the average death-rate of the 23 large towns of the United Kingdom mentioned by the Registrar-General was unusually low, viz., 23, and that these low rates have not been preserved in 1878, as shown by the following table:— Table Ia. Death Rates per 1,000 per Annum. 1874. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. Twenty-three Towns 26.3 26.4 23.7 23.0 24.4 London 22.6 23.7 22.3 21.9 23.5 St. George's, Hanover Square 18.56 19.05 18.20 17.46 18.17 Indeed, the causes which have operated to make the death-rate of the Parish somewhat higher than in 1877 have affected London and most of the other large towns still more, for, whereas the Parish death-rate has gone up 0.7, that of London has gone up 1.6, and that of the 23 large towns 1.4. 71 But if we take 1876 instead of 1877, for comparison with 1878, the results are still more favourable to this Parish, for, whereas the death-rate in London generally was 1.2 per thousand higher in 1878 than in 1876, in this Parish it was slightly lower in 1878 than in 1876. That all these are very low rates may be seen from the Registrar-General's calculation, that, according to the density of the population in London, "the mortality should be 35.2 per 1,000, were not special systems of drainage and cleanliness in use in London by which the mortality in the years 1874-8 is reduced to 22.8." The death-rate in Greater London was 22.3 per 1,000 per annum in 1878, as against 20.7 in 1877, and 21.3 in 1876: these rates closely correspond with those for London proper. In 1877, one of the large towns of the United Kingdom, viz., Portsmouth, had a lower death-rate than this Parish, and Brighton came very near to it; but for 1878, the deathrate of Portsmouth, although still lower than that of any other large town, was 19 per thousand, while that of Brighton was 21.2, as against 18.17, the rate for this Parish. Dublin, with a rate of 29.6, and Liverpool with 29.4, afforded the highest death-rates among the large towns; Manchester, which has had a higher death-rate than any other large English town during each of the past three years, having been one of the few towns the death-rate of which increased only slightly in 1878, while that of Liverpool increased from 26.5 in 1877 to 29.4 in 1878. Among Foreign towns the lowest death-rates recorded are those of Philadelphia, U.S., 18, and Christiania 18.5 per thousand per annum; and the highest, Madras, 48, and St. Petersburg 47.1 per thousand per annum. 72 Table II.

The highest birth-rates recorded were these of Salford 42.2, Hull 42.1, Birmingham 41.9, and Sunderland 41.5, and the lowest among the large towns that of Brighton 29.6. The number of deaths of children under one year of ago was 309, exactly the same number as last year; but the percentages of these deaths to the registered births, and to the gross total of deaths, were considerably less than in either of the five preceding years. Indeed, the percentage of deaths of infants under one year of age to the registered births, viz., 1304, was decidedly less than in any one of the large English towns, the nearest to it being Portsmouth, in which the percentage was 15: that for London was 16.4, while in 1877 it was only 14.6. The diminution of infant mortality in the Parish, in 73 spite of a somewhat increased general death-rate, and in spite also of the fact that the infant mortality in London generally has increased, is a very satisfactory fact, as infant mortality is one of the best indicators of general sanitary condition.

The number of violent deaths bore a smaller proportion to the total deaths than it did during the two preceding years, but gave, as usual, a higher percentage than in London generally. The number of inquest cases, 123, was higher than in 1877, but bore a smaller proportion to the total deaths, giving also a smaller percentage than in London generally. 74 Table IV. SUB-DISTRICT.

From the figure in Table IVa., I have calculated, by means of Dr. Bristowe's Formula,* the mean duration of life, in the Parish and in each of the Sub-Districts during 1878, with the following results:— Mean Duration of Life. Hanover Square Sub-District 54.41 years Mayfair ,, 58.92 ,, Belgravia „ 40.87 „ Whole Parish 48.03 „ These are all rather less than in 1877, when the mean duration of life in the whole Parish was 49.52 years. The mean duration of life in London generally has also decreased, for, whereas in 1877 it was 35.44 years, in 1878 it has only been 34.24 years; this fact being explained by the increase in the death-rate, with an almost stationary birth-rate. The mean duration of life in this Parish, during the last four years, has been as follows:— In 1875 it was 46.67 years. „ 1876 „ 47.96 „ „ 1877 „ 49.52 „ „ 1878 „ 48.03 „ So that in 1878 it has still been higher than in 1876, or in 1875. Of course in these calculations no allowance has been made for movements of the population. where x = mean duration of life b = birth-rate of one unit of the population d = death-rate „ „ ,, and r = b — d = increase of unit in one year. 76 Table V.

It was also much less proportionately than the number for London generally, for, whereas the deaths from these diseases were 4.1 per thousand of the population in London, in this Parish they were only 2 per thousand of the population. When we look at these diseases separately, we find that the number of deaths from small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, and diphtheria have all decidedly decreased, being in no case half as many as last year, and being in each case far below the average number for the last ten years, in scarlet fever very remarkably so, for there were only nine deaths in the Parish from that disease during the year, whereas the average number is nearly 43. The diseases, the deaths from which are more numerous than in 1877, are whooping cough, fever, and diarrhœa. Whooping cough has been epidemic, having caused more deaths in the Parish than in any year since 1872; this disease caused in London 1,665 deaths during the year more than the average number. Fever (chiefly enteric, there being only 4 cases registered as typhus) caused more deaths than last year, but less than in either 1875 or 1876. This, however, is partly explained thus: out of the 24 registered deaths, from enteric (typhoid) fever, 6 were those of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, one that of a nurse in the same Institution, four were imported cases, one was that of a vagrant, and one a doubtful case, registered as "Gastritis." With regard to the death of a nurse in St. George's Hospital from enteric fever, I would remark that, although cases of this disease are received into every general hospital in London, and mixed with the other patients, with the idea 78 that the disease is not contagious, I hold that the practice is wrong, as I have known the disease communicated to medical men, in one instance fatally; I have known a patient contract the disease in its worst form, and die of it, after having been in the wards of a hospital for two months for another complaint, a patient with typhoid having been brought in meanwhile; and lastly, nurses sometimes contract the disease, and occasionally, as in this instance, fatally. The four deaths registered as from typhus fever are thus accounted for:—One was imported from Liverpool, one was that of a vagrant who died at the Union Infirmary, Fulham Road, one was really from malignant scarlet fever and not from typhus at all, and the fourth was a death from true yellow fever, registered as "contracted on board mail, steamer from Rio Janeiro." Diarrhoea caused 54 deaths, or more than in either 1876 or 1877, but less than the average for ten years which is 63 per annum. Small-pox.—The Registrar-General gives 5 as the number of deaths from this disease occurring in the Parish during the year, and so I have put 5 in the table, but there were really only 4, one having been erroneously registered as small-pox in February, as I pointed out in my Report for that month. Of these 4 fatal cases, 2 occurred in May, one being that of a child prematurely born, the mother being at the time ill with small-pox, and the other 2 in June, "one that of an unvaccinated child, 3 years of age, and the other that of a man, 32 years old, who had not been re vaccinated." Small-pox in London. The epidemic of this disease, which began in 1876, has continued through 1877 and 1878. 79 It caused 110 deaths in the summer, and 592 deaths in the winter quarter of 1876 in London; 2,544 deaths in 1877, being most fatal in the first quarter; and 1,416 in 1878. Dr. Wm. Gay ton, in his report as Medical Superintendent of the Homerton Small-pox Hospital, gives the statistics of 6,553 cases of small-pox admitted into that Hospital from February 1st, 1871, to December 31st, 1878, by which the following facts are shown:— Class. Mortality. Vaccinated—good marks 3.32 per cent. „ imperfect ditto 11.10 „ „ said to be, but without marks 27.23 „ Unvaccinated 45.76 ,, The above are the results, taking both sexes and all ages; but among the unvaccinated, the mortality is affected by age as follows:— Class. Mortality. Unvaccinated, under 5 years of age . 55.38 per cent. „ over „ „ 41.48 „ so that more than half of the unvaccinated children under 5 years of age, who were admitted with small-pox, died. Or, to give the actual numbers, no less than 455 confessedly unvaccinated children under 5 years of age were admitted with small-pox, and of these, 252 died! Whereas there were only 48 cases of vaccinated children under 5 years of age, with good marks, and not one of them died; and, indeed, of the 211 cases of children under 10 years of age who had good marks only one died. To show how the number of marks affect the mortality, I have compiled the following table from Dr. Gayton's results:— 80 NUMBER OF MARKS. MORTALITY PER CENT. One. Two. Three. Four, or More. Combined Mortality. Males, good marks 4.80 3.53 3.09 2.15 3.54 Females „ „ 4.78 2.71 2.94 0.80 3.03 Males, imperfect marks 16.06 12.34 8.12 5.14 12.04 Females „ „ 14.85 8.75 7.32 5.91 9.94 It will thus be seen that both with good and with imperfect marks the mortality in each instance decreases with the number of marks. Lastly, there were 112 cases of persons under 15 years of age with four or more good marks, and not one of them died. This epidemic has thus added to the mass of evidence in favour of vaccination. Sanitary Work. For the Year ending March 31st, 1879. The following Table has been compiled for me by Mr. Joseph Snook, your Sanitary Inspector, from the Report Book. Table VI.

The total number of complaints of nuisances attended to was larger than in the year ending March 31st, 1877, although the number in that year was nearly double the number in the previous year; but the number of houses and of articles disinfected was less, as infectious diseases have not been prevalent during the greater part of the twelve months. A much larger number of notices than usual were served, viz., 161, but only one summons had to be taken out, and that was in a case of non-removal of manure. The summons was permitted to be withdrawn (the manure having been removed) upon payment of costs by the defendant. The Markets have been regularly inspected, and this year it has not been necessary to seize nearly so many articles as last year. 83 The slaughter-houses, cow-sheds, and bakehouses have been regularly inspected and kept clean. No application for a license was opposed by the Vestry at the annual licensing of slaughter-houses and cowsheds; nor was either of the applications for licenses for slaughter-houses opposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. This Board has now obtained similar powers with regard to cow-sheds, dairies, and milk-shops, and has issued bye-laws for their regulation. This fact, however, in no way interferes with the powers of your Sanitary Officers in these matters. By the Factory and Workshop Act (1878) the Bakehouse Regulation Act (1863) is repealed, and the Inspection of bakehouses becomes one of the duties of the Inspector of Factories; but any nuisance at a factory, "punishable or remediable under the law relating to Public Health," is still within the province of the Medical Officer of Health, and it is provided that in such cases the Inspector under the new Act "may take with him into a factory or a workshop a Medical Officer of Health, Inspector of Nuisances, or other Officer of the Sanitary Authority." Having been requested by the Vicar and Churchwardens to give my opinion as to the eligibility of the site in the Burial Ground at the rear of the Vestry Offices in Mount Street for the proposed Public Mortuary, "and whether there would be any sanitary objections thereto," I reported favourably on the site, and the Faculty for the erection of a Public Mortuary there has since been granted by the Chancellor of the Diocese of London, notwithstanding a certain amount of opposition from the owners of the neighbouring property. Dr. Tristram, in giving judgment, "alluded to the evidence given as to the danger of allowing the bodies of persons who had died from infectious diseases to remain in 84 the sleeping rooms of the inhabitants of a Parish where the higher and lower classes resided; and, after referring to the evidence of the Medical Officers, said he had come to the conclusion that it was for the interest of all classes of society that, as far as possible, the danger should be avoided. It should be borne in mind that many of the working classes, who had only limited accommodation in the Parish, were employed in making articles of clothing for the higher classes, and were brought into contact with the households of the upper classes, and in that way disease might be communicated." Compared with other sites, he " was of opinion that there was less cause of complaint against the erection of mortuaries in closed churchyards, provided due precautions were taken to prevent them being injurious to health or creating an unnecessary annoyance to the neighbourhood, than against other places." He was of opinion that the evidence given by Dr. Tidy and myself "showed that with proper safeguards there would be no danger, but a benefit conferred." " He would give directions that disinfectants should be placed in the coffins, and the same be screwed down, and that the removals should not be made between 8.30 in the morning and 8.30 at night." [From Report in the Times.] Table VII. shows the results of my Analyses of the water supplied to the Parish by the Grand Junction and Chelsea Companies. On an average, the quality of the Grand Junction Company's water has not been quite so good, and that of the Chelsea Company's water not nearly so good as during the preceding twelve months. Generally speaking, however, the Chelsea Company's water has been better than that supplied by the Grand Junction Company. I have, on one or two occasions, drawn the attention of the Companies to the quality of the water supplied. 85 As I have before remarked, it is not the average quality which is of importance, but the inferior water which is occasionally supplied. I also analyzed a sample of water from an underground tank, and one from a butt in a cellar, both supplied by the Grand Junction Company, but did not consider it necessary to take any steps beyond having the butt cleansed.

For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases is kept at the workhouse, in Mount Street; but these who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply at the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington; or, in case of small-pox, at the Highgato Small-pox Hospital, whore they can be accommodated on favourable terms.

Of doubtful Quality. Adulterated. Total. Milk 15 7 2 24 Bread 19 — — 19 Butter 3 1 2 6 Tea 14 6 — 20 Coffee 5 — 3 8 Mustard 8 — 7 15 Pepper 6 2 3 11 Flour 8 1 — 9 Sugar 8 — — 8 Tapioca 1 — — 1 Sago 2 — — 2 Arrowroot 7 — — 7 Vinegar 4 — — 4 Whisky 5 — — 5 Anchovy Sauce 2 — — 2 Catsup 3 — — 3 110 17 17 144 88 Also three samples of "cocoa," which were, as usual, mixtures of cocoa, sugar, and sago, or arrowroot; and one sample of "sherbet," which contained nothing of a deleterious nature. In all 148 samples. Of these only two were submitted for analysis by private purchasers, viz., one of whisky, which was genuine, and one of flour, which was genuine, but of inferior quality, and contained flour mites. One sample of milk was brought by the Inspector of the Metropolitan Dairymen's Association; it was adulterated with 11 or 12 per cent. of water, and I gave a certificate to that effect; no prosecution was, however, undertaken at the time, pending the decision of an Appeal Case on the question as to whether an Inspector could be "prejudiced" by the sale of an adulterated article; on the decision of this question, the vendor of the above sample was prosecuted, convicted, and fined. It has been decided that the words "to the prejudice of the purchaser" refer to the purchaser generally, and not to any particular purchaser, so that an adulterated article sold to an Inspector, though not prejudicing him, is sold to the prejudice of the purchaser generally, i.e., to the prejudice of the public. The samples of tea classed as of doubtful quality, had not been adulterated in this country, but contained small quantities of "lie" tea. The adulterated butters contained "butterine," a substance harmless enough in itself, and were sold at low prices. The adulterated coffees contained chicory; one was labelled to that effect, and was purchased on account of a complaint. The samples of adulterated mustard contained wheat 89 flour and turmeric, generally in small quantities. Such should be sold as "mustard meal," or by some other name indicating that they are mixtures. The adulterated peppers contained rice flour, and a small percentage of sand, no doubt from the use of dusty peppercorns. The small proportion of adulterated articles, many of which were very slightly adulterated, shows the great amount of good that has been effected by the carrying out of the Acts passed for the purpose of preventing adulteration.
