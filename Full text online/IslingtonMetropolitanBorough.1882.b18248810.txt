This is the smallest birth-rate recorded in our parish since the year 1858. I now give in tabular form the birth-rates for the last twenty-one years, with certain statistical details arising therefrom. 4 Table No. III. Showing Births.

The death-rate of the district during the past year has been 18.0 per 1000 of the population. There has been a total of 5264 deaths recorded in the parish, of which 2591 were males and 2673 females. Of the total deaths, 2222 cases occurred in the western, and 3012 in the eastern, division of the district. Although the actual number of deaths this year rather exceeds the total number of the previous year, nevertheless, taking the increase of the population into account the death-rate remains the same. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. In the following table I have arranged according to ages the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1878 to 1882, inclusive:— 1878. 1879. 1880. 1881. 1882.

Measles, Scarlatina, and Whooping Cough were again decidedly epidemic. Of these Whooping Cough was the most severe, and caused the largest number of deaths. To Measles 153 deaths were attributed as against 161, 48, and 219 in the three previous years. 103 of the deaths out of 153 from this disease were recorded during November and December. Scarlatina caused 142 deaths against 116, 198, and 135 in the three previous years. The deaths, however, referred to this disease in the epidemics of more recent date, compare favourably with 392 deaths recorded in 1863, 313 in 1869, and 465 in 1870, in each of which years Scarlatina was most fatally epidemic. As is generally the case, the fatality from Scarlatina was specially marked during the months of September, October, and November, more than one-half of the total deaths occurring in the three months named. Whooping Cough, which was the most severely epidemic, caused 299 deaths, the highest number (with the exception of 1880, when the number was the same) ever recorded in any one year as referable to this disease. In the case of Whooping Cough, the first six months of the year were the most fatal, 219 deaths (or more than two-thirds of the total number) having been recorded during that period. The deaths during the previous five years from the same disease amounted to 172, 299, 229, 296, and 165 respectively. The deaths attributable to Fever generally amounted to 77. This is two less than occurred in the previous year, although the number was rather above the average. The mortality from Diarrhoea (as is usual during a wet summer) was exceptionally low, 149 deaths only having been referred to this disease. In 1877 the deaths recorded were identical, whilst in 1879 there were only 104. With these two exceptions, the actual mortality from Diarrhoea has never been so low during the last twenty years, and this notwithstanding the vast increase in the population during that period. 8 SMALL-POX. The epidemic of Small-Pox, which had gradually subsided during the last three months of 1881, did not entirely disappear with the advent of 1882, but lingered throughout the whole of the year. 142 cases of sickness were recorded against 797 in the previous year, the monthly numbers commencing with 11, 7, 8, 3, 7,7,11, and culminating in August and September with 43 and 38 respectively, again diminishing to 4, 2, and 1 in the last three months of the year. 73 of the 142 cases were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 10 were admitted upon payment to the Highgate Hospital, and 59 were treated at their own homes. Of the 69 who remained in the Parish 11 died, and their deaths are included in the 14 recorded in the Mortality Table, the three remaining deaths being really attributable to Varicella. Of the 73 cases which were removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board 11 died. It is only right to add that this dreaded enemy has been very quiet during the present year, 10 cases of sickness only having been reported during the six months, and of these 8 went to Hospital. Such happy calms, however, be it remembered, are often followed by great storms—seasons of dormancy giving place in the history of disease to periods of unwonted activity. The terrible outbreak of 1871, with its 386 deaths, was preceded by a similarly peaceful lull. We should not, therefore, act wisely to wrap ourselves up in any fancied security, lest while we sleep the enemy take us by surprise, and we awake to find ourselves unprepared and unarmed. Knowing as we do from long experience the treacherous character of this disease, its insidious working in some secret focus, and the swiftness with which it subsequently appears and spreads amongst us, it is to me, I confess, no small source of satisfaction to know that ihe Islington Small Pox Camp Hospital premises remain intact. The tents and stores being apparently in good condition, we should, in any sudden emergency, have the immense advantage of being ready at a moment's notice to face the enemy with the best of all weapons— a sufficiency of Hospital accommodation, so much needed at the commencement of an outbreak by the sufferers first attacked. In concluding these remarks I must run the risk of being charged with repeating myself by saying that the Vestry would in my opinion act wisely in never being without such invaluable resources. 9 WATER ANALYSIS.

During the twelve months ending December, 1882, I examined 116 samples of food, 114 of which were submitted to me by your Inspectors, and 2 by the public. This makes in all 1,123 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. The 114 samples submitted by your Inspectors consisted of— 34 Milk 2 Chicory 6 Port Wine 2 Black Tea 6 Gin 2 Moist Sugar 6 Brandy 2 Jam 6 Rum 2 Mustard 2 Whisky 2 Black Pepper 6 Fourpenny Ale 2 Cayenne Pepper 6 Porter 2 Lard 2 Bread 3 Flour 4 Butter 2 Oatmeal 2 Cheese 2 Pickles 2 Arrowroot 2 Sweets 2 Cocoa 1 Lime Juice 2 Coffee 1 Lemon Juice 1 Tinned Rabbit. Of these I certified 14 samples of Milk to be adulterated, but otherwise I had no occasion to find fault with the quality of the various articles submitted to me for analysis by your Inspectors. I have, however, taken this opportunity of publishing in an Appendix attached hereto, for the information of the Vestry and the public, my Reports as Analyst for the whole of the year in ext.enso, together with their several accompanying Schedules, and for further remarks upon this subject, I refer the reader to these detailed Reports. The results of the 14 Summonses will also be found elsewhere. Of the two samples submitted by the public, it will be seen that one was genuine Flour, and that the other was Butter adulterated with a large excess of water. 12 THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1882-83. From the 1st April, 1882, to 31st March, 1883, 707 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being l.9i against 1.72, 1.56 and 1.71 in the three previous years. 396 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £59 12s. Gd. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 7.52 per cent, for the whole year, a large proportional increase being apparent as against the 635 per cent, of the previous year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1882-83. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the district Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion, the amendments effected. In addition, the district Inspectors have also reported the premises from which they found removal of dust to be necessary. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, carbolic acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. McDougall's Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway Roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. 13 THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON. 1882—83. At the Annual licensing of 1882 there were 85 applications for renewal of licenses to slaughter houses, 84 of which were granted. In the case of the one that was refused, the slaughter-house had not been used as such since the previous licensing. For the renewal of licences to cow-houses 48 applications were made. In one case, the applicant not being in attendance, the licence was not granted. One fresh application for a licence to keep cows was granted without opposition. 84 slaughter-houses and 48 cow-houses were, therefore, licensed. My annual inspection of these places prior to the licensing was perfectly satisfactory. SUMMONSES. During the year ending the 31st December, 1882, 14 summonses for the adulteration of milk were taken out, by direction of the Sanitary Committee upon certificates given by me as Public Analyst. The prosecution was successful in each case, the total amount of the penalties recovered and paid to the Vestry being £41 10s. The adulteration certified in every instance was that a certain quantity of water had been added in excess of that normally present in milk. The percentage of added water, the penalty inflicted, and the costs incurred in each case are stated in the following table. 14  Penalty.

Three of these were in respect to defective drainage, in two of which the magistrate made an order with costs, and the required works were subsequently carried out. In the third drainage case the works were finished before the summons could be heard. Two summonses were issued for the recovery of money paid by the Vestry for disinfection work carrried out in default of the owners of premises complying with the usual Statutory notices, the amounts due— 17s. 6d. and £1 15s. respectively— being recovered with costs in each case. The last summons was issued against a tradesman for exposing rabbits for sale which were unfit for human food, and which were seized upon his premises by one of your Inspectors, who had them condemned by one of the magistrates at the Clerkenwell Police Court, who afterwards, upon hearing the summons, fined the defendant £3 and 2s. costs. In all, 20 summonses were taken out. 15 THE DUSTING OP THE PARISH, 1882— 83. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady Day, 1883, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 9,518 applications received from residents during the year, 6,795 were by letter or postal card, and 2,723 were made personally, or by messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 9,518 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 25'1 per cent, of the number of the assessments in the parish against 34-8 per cent, in 1881— 1882. The applications were, therefore, about 25 per cent, less than in the previous year. I have now laid before the Vestry the Life and Death statistics for the past year of the immense Parish over which they possess authority, and the works that have been carried out under their supervision for preserving the Public Health. Of course it is easy enough to say that many things should have been done that have not been done— or that things have been done which might as well have been left undone. Of nothing is the charge more common than that Sanitary Officers "strain at gnats and swallow camels." We are frequently compelled, moreover, to be satisfied with wincing under the charge, knowing how impossible it is to prevent such accusations, or to show their injustice. In the case of the Parish of Islington, however, your Sanitary Officers are not a little indebted in refuting all such statements to the active and intelligent support accorded to them by the Vestry, and particularly by your Sanitary Committee. I desire to express my obligations to your Sanitary Superintendent, for the painstaking accuracy he has shown ever since I have been connected with your Vestry. It is only right that I should further add that your Inspectors, one and all, have performed their duties to my entire satisfaction. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. 30th June, 1883. TABLE No. V. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING (Deaths of Non-Residents Wegt S.D. East S. D. Causes of Death, At all Ages.

TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, Your Inspectors have submitted to me during the past quarter 28 samples of Milk for analysis. In the case of 16 samples of variable quality there was no such evidence of adulteration as to justify me in advising any prosecution. I gave certificates of adulteration, however, in the 12 remaining cases, and the vendors were fined in amounts varying from 20s. to £10. I have the honour to remain, Your obedient Servant, C.

Report of the Public Analyst appointed for the Parish of St. Mary, Islington, upon the Articles analysed by him under the above Act during the Quarter ending the 30th December, 1882. TO THE VESTRY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. 15th January, 1883. Gentlemen, During the quarter ending December 30th I have examined 29 samples submitted to me by your Inspectors, and one sample submitted to me by the public, viz.:—by the Holborn Guardians—This last mentioned sample was one of butter which I certified to contain an excess of water. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR 1882. During the past year 116 samples in all have been submitted to me for analysis—of these 114 samples were submitted to me by your Inspectors, and 2 samples by the public for which I received a fee of 10/6 each. These 116 samples included the following articles:—Port Wine, Brandy, Gin, Whisky, Rum, Ale and Porter, Bread, Flour, Milk, Jam, Cheese, Mustard, Cocoa, Arrowroot, Tinned Rarbbit, Oatmeal, Cayenne Pepper, Chicory, Lard, Pickles, Tea, Confectionery, Butter, Pepper, Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, Coffee and Sugar. The details arc duly given in the schedules attached to the quarterly reports. Of these 116 articles I certified 15 as adulterated, 14 of which were samples of milk. A prosecution in each of the Milk cases was instituted, and all being successful the fines during the year amounted to £41 10/- (and costs) which amount has been duly paid to the Vestry account. 33 In the samples of Port Wine the presence of artificial but innocuous colouring matter was noted. Of the spirits the Gin varied from 30 to 36 under proof. The Act allows it to be diluted to 35 under proof. This was only exceeded in two cases and that only by 1 degree or less, an excess of dilution capable of explanation. The Brandy varied from 20.6 to 25.8 under proof, the Rum from 20.6 to 24.6 under proof,and the Whisky 20 6 to 21 degrees under proof. The Act allowing these spirits to be diluted to the extent of 25 per cent, under proof, there was no cause for prosecution. It is manifest however that certain publicans dilute the spirits sold by them as nearly as possible to the very limit sanctioned by Act of Parliament. In some of these spirits innocuous colouring matter was used to supply the colour lost by dilution. Of the four samples of butter examined (all of which were rancid when delivered to me), one contained water rather in excess, and another I regarded as of doubtful quality, but the evidence of adulteration was not sufficient to justify prosecution. One was genuine butter (although exceedingly rancid), whilst the fourth sample although genuine butter fat, contained no less than 18 per cent, of water. I gave a certificate in this case upon which a prosecution might have been instituted, but the sample having been submitted to me by the Holborn Guardians it remained with them to take action. I have now examined, as your Analyst, 1123 samples. I desire to record my conviction that there is but little cause for the inhabitants of Islington to complain of the purity of the articles of food sold in the parish. Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY. "The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875."—Appendix IV. No. Article submitted for Analysis.
