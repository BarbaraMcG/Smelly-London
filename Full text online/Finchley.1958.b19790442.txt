In accordance with my statutory duty as your Medical Officer of Health I have the honour to present the Annual Health Report for the year 1958. This report is prepared according to the Ministry of Health circular 22/58 and preceding relevant circulars. VITAL STATISTICS : (1) Population: According to the Registrar-General's estimate as at 30th June, 1958, the population has fallen by 300—69,080 as against 69,380 for the year 1957. It appears difficult to explain this fall when one notes a natural increase of 77 together with the fact that the number of inhabited houses at April, 1958, was 20,295 as against 20,115 at April, 1957. The explanation appears to lie in the fact that a surprisingly large number of families have moved to new and expanded towns. Some 415 families have moved from Finchley. The fact that we have more dwellings occupied I trust indicates an easing of congestion, although the degree of congestion and statutory overcrowding in the Borough cannot be estimated accurately. Certain details, however, are given later on in the body of this report. (See page 35). (2) Birth Rate: The birth rate (13.1) was slightly lower than the birth rate (13.3) for 1957, a total of 902 as against 925 live births in 1957. (3) Death Rate: The death rate (11.9) was higher than the death rate (11.3) in 1957, a total of 825 as against 781 deaths in 1957. (4) Infantile Mortality Rate: The infantile mortality rate, i.e., the deaths of infants under one year, was 20.0 as compared to 17.3 for the year 1957, a total of 18 5 deaths as compared to 16 for the year 1957. Despite this increase in infant deaths, the figure of 20 deaths per thousand live births compares very favourably with the national average of 22.5. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES: The sanitary circumstances of the Borough, housing, slum clearance, the inspection and supervision of food are fully recorded in the following pages and make interesting reading. This work is never ending and makes a considerable contribution to the health and wellbeing of our citizens. Apropros of this it is pleasing to record that all dwelling houses in the Borough are now supplied with water from the public water mains direct to the houses (see page 61). Thus we see the culmination of one very important aspect of the public health which has been proceeding quietly and unobtrusively for several generations. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956: We are now on the threshold of commencing a task of quite the same magnitude as the provision of a water supply and that is the clearing of smoke from our atmosphere. Technical details can be read on page 62 of this report. This work will involve the visiting of every dwelling house in the Borough and plans have been made to make Finchley a smoke free area by 1971. Statisticians have estimated that the annual cost of air pollution to the nation as a whole is in the region of £500,000,000 basing this figure on various items such as the inefficient burning of fuel with the production of smoke, laundry costs and the defacement of buildings, but a more important and incalculable factor has emerged in recent years and that is the effect of air pollution on health. Bronchitis, particularly chronic bronchitis, or the English disease as it is sometimes known, has been related to air pollution. Investigations carried out in various parts of the country have indicated that the more polluted the area, the greater the number of bronchial illnesses that occur. COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE: I am pleased to report that 1958 was a healthy year from the point of view of notifiable infectious diseases, there being no cases of diphtheria, enteric fever or smallpox—but one case of poliomyelitis occurred and this was of a very mild type. This compares favourably with 12 cases notified in 1957. As will be seen in the body of this 6 report, vaccination is proceeding against poliomyelitis, and reports from many parts of the world have been favourable concerning the value of the vaccines in use. Research efforts are now being directed to the production of an oral vaccine which, if successful, should prove of the greatest value in encouraging persons of all ages to avail themselves of what might be a life-saving measure in the prevention of this disease. TUBERCULOSIS: Two persons died from tuberculosis during 1958. This is the lowest number of deaths ever recorded. Ten years ago in 1948, 17 persons died. The numbers recorded here are small and do not convey their full significance, but quoting national figures brings the full picture to light. Deaths from respiratory tuberculosis (England and Wales) have fallen to 4,000. Ten years ago the figure was over 19,000. This remarkable achievement has been due in the main to the development of new drugs, earlier case finding and thus earlier treatment. However, any complacency engendered by these figures is rudely shattered when one considers that 7 in every thousand of the population of England and Wales still suffer from tuberculosis, and the number of new notifications continues to be high. In Finchley, 29 new cases were notified in 1958—a similar total to 1957. The continuing high rate of notification is, of course, due to the continuing efforts of all concerned in the field, the General Practitioners, Public Health workers and Chest Physicians, aided by modern methods of case finding and mass radiography. The earlier the case is discovered, the quicker and more permanent the cure. This is the ideal to be aimed at and has resulted in a tendency to treat patients at home after a short period in hospital. The growth of domiciliary treatment is, of course, reflected in a reduction of the number of hospital beds with resultant saving to the national economy. It follows from this that local authorities as housing authorities still have a major part to play in the provision of suitable housing for the tuberculous, not alone to further the cure of the patient but to prevent him spreading the disease to others. GENERAL: While the problem of infectious disease appears to be largely controlled, other problems are still with us and new ones are appearing. 7 Care of the Elderly: This is a problem which is much in the public eye. Improving social conditions and modern medical methods have led to a vast increase in the number of elderly in the community. The table below shows the increase in Finchley alone—a figure almost doubled in 20 years. Population of the Borough: 1931. 1951. Males 25,762 31,174 Females 33,202 38,817 Total 58,964 69,991 Population of Elderly Persons: Males—65 years of age and over 1,575 3,168 Females—60 years of age and over 4,317 8,038 Total 5,892 11,206 Total number of elderly persons expressed as a percentage of the total population 9.99% 16.01% Fortunately, the majority of our elderly are 65 years young rather than 65 years old ! This increasing problem has been recognised, and efforts both national and local are being taken to deal with it. I am pleased to record that in Finchley a number of large houses have been purchased for conversion into old people's accommodation and several sites are being considered for the erection of old people's dwellings. The activities of the statutory and voluntary bodies in the district are most praiseworthy and cover a considerable amount of work in this field, but I often wonder if efforts are being channelled in the right direction. In medicine the care of the elderly has been recognised as a speciality, but unfortunately there is a tendency to place the elderly in the community in a similar special category. I feel a re-appraisal of the problem might reveal the desirability of building on the family unit, the directing of our services both social and financial to keep the elderly in their own family group, for example, the re-planning of flats or houses to accommodate 8 ously the aged grandparents and the young family. It is well known to all working in this field that the lonely aged form the greatest problem. Lung Cancer: Much has been written about the rising incidence of cancer of the lung. The weight of medical evidence points to the fact that heavy tobacco smoking, particularly of cigarettes, is a factor in its causation. To all, therefore, the answer is apparent, but to some of us who are heavily addicted—the national consumption of tobacco appears to be on the increase—the solution is not easy. I would therefore recommend that all smokers should endeavour firstly to cut down on the amount of tobacco consumed, and secondly to obtain a medical examination including chest X-ray, twice yearly, and at least annually. It must be realised, however, that this preventative measure does not imply that one would then be perfectly safe. No such guarantee can be given. Apropos of this medical examination, it must be pointed out that such a routine examination is not a duty of the family practitioner under the National Health Service Act, but chest X-rays can be obtained through mass radiography units. CONCLUSION: I must mention here the help of the family doctors to this Department throughout the year. Their co-operation and assistance is much appreciated. In conclusion, may I thank you for your warm and cordial welcome to me on coming to the Borough of Finchley in July, 1958, and for the support and encouragement of the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee. I would draw your attention to the loyalty and fidelity of the staff of this Department, and I would also like to thank the Chief Officers and members of other Departments, without whose help this report could not be completed. I am, Your obedient servant, J. G. HAGAN, Medical Officer of Health 9 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,478 Population, 1958 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 69,080 Number of Inhabited Houses (at 1st April, 1958) 20,295 Rateable Value (at 1st April, 1958) £1,387,989 Product of a Penny Rate, year 1958/59 £5,630 Total Live Births 902 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 13.1 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 16.4 Total Stillbirths 14 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 15.3 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births (England and Wales) 21.6 Total live and stillbirths 916 Infant Deaths 18 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births—total 20.0 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births—legitimate 18.8 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births—illegitimate 40.0 Infant Mortality Rate—(England and Wales) 22.5 Neo-Natal Deaths 9 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 10.0 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate—(England and Wales) 16.2 Illegitimate live births percent, of total live births 5.54% Maternal Death (including abortion) 1 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live and stillbirths 1.09 Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.43 Total Deaths 825 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 11.9 Standardised Death Rate 10.8 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.7 Live Births:Males Females Total Legitimate 438 414 852 Illegitimate 27 23 50 465 437 902 Birth rate 13.1 per 1,000 estimated home population. 10 birth and death rates Males Females Total Stillbirths 5 9 14 Rate 15.3 per 1,000 (live and stillbirths).

This work was necessary in connection with the re-laying of the road to the new Disinfecting Station which was being built on adjoining land. During this period, bodies were taken to the Hendon Mortuary. 14 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1958 Deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year of age CAUSES OF DEATH Under 1 week 1-2 weeks 2-3 weeks 3-4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 3 months 3-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months TOTAL Smallpox - - - - - - - - - - Chicken Pox - - - - - - - - - - Measles - - - - - - - - - - Scarlet Fever - - - - - - - - - - Whooping Cough - - - - - - - - - - Diphtheria & Croup - - - - - - - - - - Erysipelas - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculous Meningitis - - - - - - - - - - Meningitis (not Tuberculous) - - - - - - - - - - Convulsions - - - - - - - - - - Laryngitis - - - - - - - - - .- Bronchitis - - - - - - - - 1 1 Pneumonia (all forms) - - - - - - 1 - - 1 Diarrhoea — — - - - - - - - - Enteritis —. - - — - - - - - - Gastritis - - - - - - - - - - Syphilis - - - - - - - — — - Rickets - — - - - - - - - - Suffocation, Overlying - - - - - - - - - - Injury at Birth — - - - - - - - - - Atelectasis 1 1 - - 2 - - - - 7 Congenital Malformations 3 - - - 3 1 1 1 - 6 Premature Birth 1 — - - 1 - - - - 1 Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus - - - - - - - - - - Accidents - - - - - - - - 1 1 Leukaemia - - - - - - - - 1 1 Tumours - - - - - - 1 - - 1 Other Causes 2 1 - — 3 - 1 - - 4 TOTALS 7 2 - - 9 1 4 1 3 18 15 VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS Year Total Births Birth Rate Total Deaths Death Rate Total Infant Deaths Infantile Mortality Rate Deaths from Measles Deaths from Whooping Cough Deaths from Diarrhoea (under 2 years) 1934 712 11.5 658 10.7 42 59.0 1 13 4 1935 807 12.9 656 10.5 39 48.5 - - 17 1936 833 13.0 643 10.0 36 43.2 2 1 6 1937 895 13.8 704 10.8 36 40.2 - 1 7 1938 927 14.2 662 10.2 33 35.6 4 1 5 1939 951 14.5 705 11.1 35 36.8 - - 3 1940 725 12.1 806 12.9 27 38.0 1 - 2 1941 721 12.4 734 12.7 15 21.8 - 3 1 1942 891 14.9 751 12.5 48 53.9 1 7 3 1943 1035 17.1 790 13.0 57 55.1 1 2 4 1944 1037 17.4 830 13.9 34 32.8 - 5 5 1945 987 16.1 725 11.8 36 36.4 1 - 1 1946 1207 17.6 774 11.3 30 24.9 1 1 5 1947 1319 18.7 830 11.7 27 20.5 - 1 4 1948 1086 15.3 763 10.8 30 27.6 - 1 2 1949 981 13.9 834 11.8 19 19.3 - - 2 1950 962 13.6 819 11.6 16 16.6 - - - 1951 915 13.0 877 12.5 22 24.0 - - - 1952 953 13.6 782 11.1 11 11.5 - - - 1953 902 12.9 765 10.9 20 22.2 - - — 1954 877 12.5 747 10.7 16 18.2 - - - 1955 894 12.8 746 10.7 19 21.3 - - - 1956 910 13.0 831 11.9 12 13.2 - - - 1957 925 13.3 781 11.3 16 17.3 - — - 1958 902 13.1 825 11.9 18 20.0 - - - 16 INFANT DEATH AND NE0-NATAL DEATH RATES CAUSES OF, AND AGES AT DEATH DURING THE YEAR 1958 No. CAUSES OF DEATH.

During the year, 16 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 392 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. In addition, 347 children were immunised by General Practitioners with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Three hundred and seventy-seven children were given " booster " doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone and 30 children were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Scarlet Fever There were 58 cases of Scarlet Fever, 13 less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis One case of poliomyelitis occurred towards the end of the year, but it was not notified until early in 1959 when the patient's illness was finally diagnosed. 23 Octopus Club The Council have continued to grant to the Octopus Club the use of the Indoor Bath at Squires Lane on alternate Sundays from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. The total membership of the Club is about 50 and the average number of members who attend each session is about 26. The Club does not confine itself to those who have suffered from Poliomyelitis. Persons who have suffered from any kind of disablement may attend at the Bath, providing that each can produce a certificate from his family doctor stating that he is free from infection, and would benefit from attending the swimming sessions. The cases are collected from a wide area by ambulances and cars (such arrangements being made by the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship) and are assisted in changing and also in the water by voluntary helpers. Vaccination against Poliomyelitis During the year, the offer of vaccination was extended to include, among other groups, persons who had reached the age of six months and were under 26 years, and expectant mothers. The number of persons vaccinated in the Middlesex County Council Area No. 4, which comprises the Boroughs of Finchley and Hendon, during 1958, is shown as follows:— (a) With two injections 26,241 (b) With three injections 9,968 It is hoped that separate figures for Finchley will be available for 1959. Measles The number of notifications was 206 compared with 957 in 1957. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 22 in 1958 and there were no deaths. During the year, 352 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. One child was given a "booster" dose of whooping cough vaccine. 24 Pneumonia Only two forms of pneumonia, namely, acute primary and influenzal, are notifiable. Thirty-five such cases were reported to me during the year. In the table of deaths, all forms of pneumonia are included in the classification (No. 23). It will be seen that 53 deaths occurred and of these 46 were persons of 65 years of age and over. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 29, all of which occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue. Food Poisoning Three persons were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year. Two of them were members of one family. Salmonella typhi-murium was discovered to be the agent in each case, but the source of infection could not be established. Infective Hepatitis An outbreak of infective hepatitis occurred amongst pupils attending a private school in the Borough. Infective hepatitis is a virus disease causing liver damage together with jaundice. A total of 13 cases was confirmed but there were no deaths, although one case was admitted to hospital. This disease is not notifiable and the total of 13 cases may not represent the whole picture of the outbreak. The outbreak was brought to my attention by the Head Teacher of the school on the 15th November, 1958, by which time, 6 cases were known, the first having occurred late in September. Investigations showed that the school was overcrowded and lacked adequate sanitary facilities, wash basins, water closets, etc. These defects were pointed out to the Head Teacher who was requested to have additional facilities installed, but agreement could not be reached on the number of fixtures. In the meantime, the Ministry of Education was notified of the outbreak together with my observations that the spread of the disease was being facilitated by overcrowding, etc. This resulted in a very thorough inspection of the school by senior medical and lay officers of the Ministry in company with the Chief Public 25 Health Inspector and myself. A Joint Report was drawn up which led to the Registrar of Private Schools making certain recommendations to the proprietors concerning various defects. The last known case occurred on the 24th December, 1958. Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified:— Dysentery 4 Erysipelas 4 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 4 Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was seven hundred and fifty-eight. Three hundred and twenty persons were re-vaccinated. International Certificates of Vaccination Persons travelling to certain foreign parts have to provide themselves with certificates of vaccination or inoculation which must have been completed by their own medical practitioners before proceeding. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a medical officer in the Government or local authority of the country of issue. A form of authentication which has been accepted by the health authorities abroad is that given by public health authorities and identified by a rubber stamp impression placed by them on the certificate. The rubber stamp in this office bears the words "Finchley Corporation—Signature of doctor authenticated." The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. During the year over 800 certificates were authenticated. Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1958:— 26 Tuberculosis Two persons died from tuberculosis during 1958, giving a death rate of 0.029 per 1,000 population. This is the lowest number of deaths recorded. Twenty-nine new cases were notified and this figure is the same as in the previous year, when it was reported as the lowest number per year of new notifications on record. The case rate per 1,000 population was 0.42. One child of school age and two under school age were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs. Close co-operation between the Public Health Department, the Area Health Office and the Chest Clinic in the constant search for possible sources of infection in new cases of tuberculosis continues. 27 Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs: Diphtheria Bacilli 284 Haemolytic Streptococci 50 Vincent's Angina 7 Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci 6 Fæ ces: Sonne Dysentery 6 141 Salmonella 16 Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci 7 Sputum: T.B.

One thousand and ninety-seven persons were X-rayed, and of these 8 were referred to Chest Clinics, and one case of lung cancer and one case of sarcoidosis were detected. No case of active tuberculosis was found. Medical Examinations Twenty-four persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 12 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. In addition, 8 employees were examined for the purpose of extending sick pay, and, in the case of elderly employees, for proposed extension of service. Housing Applications During the year, 11 housing applications, accompanied by medical certificates, were submitted by the Borough Housing and 28 TUBERCULOSIS (ALL Forms) Town Planning Officer to ascertain if additional points (up to 5) could be recommended on medical grounds. The following shows how the applications were dealt with: — Applications Points Awarded in each Case 5 0 11 1 2 2 3 2 5 On receipt of these applications, it was often necessary to visit the family concerned and to discuss various aspects of each case with the family doctor and with the Housing Officer. I am indebted to the doctors for their continued co-operation in this matter. In addition, a number of applications were considered on account of overcrowding and sanitary defects. Much work is involved in investigating these cases in order to be certain that deserving cases are given full consideration. In special cases where the medical condition of the applicant merited urgent rehousing but the award of extra "points" would not give immediate help the case was brought before the Housing Lettings Committee of the Council, for their decision, and in every instance the medical reports were taken into account. Health Education Health Education has been, until recent years, a relatively neglected subject, possibly because the public generally did not wish to have unpleasant facts kept before them. However, wiser counsel has prevailed and the importance of health education is now reaching its true place in medical work, particularly in the public health field. Of recent years we have seen campaigns in connection with food hygiene and the handling of food, and in 1958, there was a national campaign with particular reference to the guarding of fires in the home. Reference is made elsewhere in this report to educational activities in regard to food hygiene and clean air. Apart from these, talks dealing with various aspects of the work of the Public Health Department and on the prevention of accidents in the home were given by the Medical Officer of Health and other members of the staff to local organisations. 31 National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47—Removal to Suitable Premises of Persons in need of care and attention Cases concerning persons who were living in insanitary surroundings and who were not receiving proper care and attention continued to be brought to the notice of the Department. On each occasion it was possible to make satisfactory arrangements for these persons without having to resort to compulsory removal to suitable premises under the provisions of the above Section. (b) Section 50—Burial or Cremation of the Dead It is the duty of the Local Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears to the authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or arc being otherwise made. In these circumstances, the deceased persons are buried in the St. Pancras Cemetery. The expenses incurred in each case amount to a total of £18 15s. 6d. This charge is inclusive of the undertaker's fee and the cemetery fee, and may, of course, vary from time to time. The Local Authority may be able to recover part or all of this sum from the estate of the deceased person. Three burials were carried out by the Council in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Ofticcr of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Five copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the public health inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. 32 Laundry Service for the Incontinent The laundry service, which commenced in 1957, continued to operate in the Borough. The service has been set up to assist in the problems concerning incontinent persons. It operates in accordance with the provisions of Section 42 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, which deals with, amongst other things, the cleansing of soiled articles. The washing machine is installed at the Disinfecting Station and arrangements are made for articles to be collected and delivered twice weekly. The practice is for collections to be made on Tuesdays and Fridays, and for deliveries, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The cost of the service is borne by the local authority. The only stipulation made is that the garments or bedding involved must not be of a type which could be accepted by a commercial laundry. During 1958, 260 collections of articles were made. The number of persons for whom the service was recommended, and subsequently authorised by the Medical Officer of Health or by the Public Health Inspectors, was 17. Five persons were continuing to receive assistance at the end of the year. Requests were received from Edmonton and Friern Barnet to assist those Authorities as they were unable to provide their own services. Owing to limited resources in Finchley, it was found possible to offer assistance to Friern Barnet only, and at the end of the year, arrangements were being made so that a service could be operated in 1959. 33 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1958:— Housing Statistics 1.

This area was represented to the Council at the beginning of the year and a Compulsory Purchase Order was made with a view to using it as a car park. The decision of the Minister is awaited. (b) 1291 & 1293, High Road, N.20; 1—8 (inclusive), Solomons Terrace, N.20 (10 houses). Following an appeal at the end of the previous year, the Minister confirmed the Clearance Order respecting the above with the exception of 1291, High Road, N.20, which premises were used mainly for business purposes. (c) 1—10 (inclusive), Belgrave Terrace, N.12; 4—10 (even), Stanhope Road, N.12 (14 houses). This area, which was represented in the previous year, is being purchased from the owner with a view to using the site as a car park. (d) (i) 306-324, Friern Barnet Lane, N.20 (10 houses). (ii) Vine & Oak Cottages, Totteridge Lane, N.20 (2 houses).

All the houses in these three areas have now been demolished. Housing Act, 1957, Part II—Individual Unfit Houses 794a, High Road, N.12. These premises, consisting of rooms over a shop, were found to be in a very dilapidated condition and incapable of being made fit for human habitation at reasonable cost. A Closing Order was made, the premises vacated and the tenants rehoused by the Council. 36 26, Manor Park Road, N.2 (Lower flat). This flat was a part of a three-storey building comprising the basement and first floor rooms. They were in a very dilapidated condition and the basement rooms were dark and damp. A Closing Order was made, the rooms vacated and the tenant rehoused by the Council. 1, 2 & 3, Prospect Cottages, Summers Lane, N.12. These three houses owned by the Local Authority were found to be unfit for human habitation and a Certificate of Unfitness was presented to the Council. The premises were vacated and the Council rehoused the tenants. 45, Gainsborough Road, N.12. This house, which was closed during the previous year, was one of a terrace of three old houses. The owner died and the property was purchased by a builder who submitted plans to the Council for the re-conditioning, alteration and conversion of the premises into 4 maisonettes. An underaking given by the owner was accepted by the Council. The work was carried out and the Closing Order rescinded. This work of conversion was well carried out, modern amenities including bathrooms, etc., were provided and four useful housing units preserved. Rent Act, 1957 Set out below is a table in connection with applications for certificates of disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957. This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, and for the six-month period ending 31st December of that year 60 applications had been received, but it will be seen from the figures for 1958 that only 50 applications had been received for the whole year. The effect of the increase of rents has been noticed especially in the cases of two large estates of houses and flats where a considerable amount of work has been done, the property having been overhauled, and new front boundary walls and gates erected, where they had been removed for scrap metal during the war. Number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 50 Number of applications outstanding at beginning of year 30 37 Number of Certificates issued 37 Number of Certificates not issued (becausc work had been done or undertaking already given by landlord) 5 Number of Certificates refused 2 Number of Undertakings given by Landlords 32 Number of applications outstanding at end of year 4 Number of applications for Cancellation of Certificates for Disrepair 16 Number of objections by tenants to cancellation 8 Number of Certificates cancelled 3 Number of cancellations refused 5 Number of applications outstanding at end of year 8 Number of applications for Certificates as to the Remedying of Defects which the Landlord had Undertaken to Remedy 19 Number of such Certificates issued 11 Number of Certificates not issued 4 Number of applications outstanding at end of year 4 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 14,303. At 383 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 983 were discovered, and at the end of the year 1,020 including a number outstanding at the end of 1957 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 114 was in hand and 1,473 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 750 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:— 38 Inspections under Housing Acts 68 Other Inspections including Inspections under Public Health Act, 1936 4,242 Re-inspections 2,979 Inspections under Rent Act, 1957 339 Inspections of Works in Progress 750 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouse and Restaurant Kitchens) 271 Visits to Slaughterhouses 29 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 2 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 128 Inspections of Meat, Fish and Other Food Shops 643 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 156 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 319 Visits re Rodent Control 3,166 Visits re Overcrowding 106 Visits re Hawkers 6 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 6 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 9 Visits re Heating Appliances—Fireguards 40 Visits re Clean Air Act, 1956 106 Visits re Pollution of Streams 236 Miscellaneous 702 14,303 39 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Premises redrained 2 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 30 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 218 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 168 Length in yards of iron drains laid 14 Manholes provided 23 Manholes repaired 5 Manhole covers provided 15 Intercepting traps fixed 14 Caps to intercepting traps provided 38 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 2 New gully traps fixed 25 Gully curbs provided or repaired 3 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 5 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 7 Water tests applied 56 Smoke tests applied 24 Air tests applied 2 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C. basins fixed 23 W.Cs. unstopped, cleansed or repaired 16 New flushing cisterns fitted to W.Cs 11 Existing flushing cisterns repaired 15 New W.C. accommodation provided 4 New W.C. apartments provided 2 W.C. apartments altered 4 W.C. apartments cleansed 8 Lavatory basins provided 25 Baths provided 5 New impervious sinks provided 16 New waste pipes fixed 24 Waste pipes trapped, repaired or unstopped 17 Urinals provided Urinals cleansed or repaired 5 40 Miscellaneous Roofs repaired 81 Eaves gutters renewed, cleansed or repaired 41 Stack pipes provided, repaired or unstopped 24 Damp walls remedied 51 Walls repointed, repaired or underpinned 26 Ventilation under floors provided or unstopped 4 Paving of yards repaired 5 Floors of rooms relaid 2 Floors of rooms repaired 27 Rooms cleansed, distempered or repapered 98 Plasterwork repaired 103 Windows repaired and/or made to open 61 New windows provided 12 New sashcords provided 54 Window cills provided or repaired 22 Doors provided or repaired 21 Doorsteps provided or repaired Staircases repaired 6 New stoves and ranges provided 4 Stoves and ranges repaired 12 Storage cisterns provided 1 Storage cisterns repaired, cleansed and covered Water service pipes repaired 10 Hot water supplies provided 6 Movable sanitary dustbins provided 30 Nuisances from keeping of animals abated 3 Smoke nuisances abated 2 Accumulations of refuse removed 14 Ventilated food store provided 1 New boilers provided 2 Various 44 Notices Served Informal Notices 385 Statutory Notices 12 41 Enquiries—Outstanding Sanitary Notices Two thousand three hundred and forty-four letters were received during the year from the Town Clerk enquiring whether or not there were any outstanding notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Housing Act, 1949—Section 4 (Power of Local Authorities to make advances for increasing housing accommodation including the converting, altering and enlarging of houses.) One hundred and twenty-three enquiries were dealt with regarding premises which were the subject of applications for advances under Section 4 of the Housing Act, 1949. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 35 Number of articles disinfected 657 Three hundred and nineteen visits were made by inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year:— Premises Bugs 6 Fleas 7 Cockroaches 4 Ants 11 Wasps 60 Bees 8 Moths 8 Crickets 1 Clover Mites 1 Silver Fish 2 Spider Beetles 1 Frogs 1 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was 60, compared with 10 in 1957. 42 Sanitary Conveniences There are 31 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Complaints One thousand three hundred and ninety-seven complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz.: — Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 8 Accumulations of refuse and manure 41 Blocked or defective drains 250 Defective roofs 41 Defective W.Cs 43 Flooding 30 Foreign matter in food 6 Insanitary or defective condition of houses162 Noise 8 Non-removal of refuse 4 Nuisances from dampness 40 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 17 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 9 Pollution of brook 3 Premises infested with insects 63 Premises infested with rats or mice 480 Smells from public sewers 1 Smoke nuisances 23 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 22 Unsound food 10 Verminous condition of houses 10 Wasps' nests 47 Bees 9 Foxes 2 Shops Act 1 Drinking Water 1 Other complaints 66 43 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of the complaint. Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. Six defects were discovered as a result of these inspections and were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Twenty-three premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council which is the licensing authority. Factories Acts, 1937-1948 1.

The following table shows, by trades, the number of outworkers residing in the district:— Wearing apparel 30 Artificial flowers 1 Lampshades 8 Handbags 1 Imitation Jewellery 1 Feather sorting 2 Making of brushes 1 47 FOOD FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 Food Hygiene Regulations The food hygiene regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises and stalls, and of apparatus and equipment, the hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction of food premises, their repair and maintenance and the facilities including sinks and wash basins to be provided; and the temperature at which certain foods are to be kept. A complaint was received regarding a cigarette end found in a loaf of bread. Investigating this complaint, an inspection was carried out of the bakehouse where the loaf was made and an employee was found to be smoking when operating a dough mixing machine. Summonses were issued against the employee for smoking whilst handling open food and against the occupier for failing to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance with the provisions of the Regulations. Particulars of these offences will be found under the heading "Legal Proceedings." 1. Number of Inspections: The Public Health Inspectors continued a survey of food premises and during the year, 804 visits were made to shops and other premises in order to ascertain compliance with the Regulations, and arising therefrom 75 contraventions were found, and 15 letters sent and 21 verbal notices given in connection therewith. The following is a summary of the works done during the year:— Bag rest provided 1 Butchers' benches provided 3 Ceiling made 1 Cement fillet made 1 Clothing lockers provided 3 48 Coal bunker moved 1 Cold Store provided 1 Doors repaired 3 Drainage improved 1 Draining boards provided 6 Dustbins provided 1 Fan provided 1 First-Aid Kits provided 6 Floors renewed or repaired 4 Flue altered 1 Food Store made 1 Frying pans cleansed 1 Glass covers provided 1 Hot and Cold Water installed 20 Impervious tabletops provided 4 Insect repellent provided 1 Lavatory Basins provided 18 Light provided or improved 1 Mincer provided 1 Nailbrushes provided 13 Ovens repaired 1 Premises cleansed 14 Rain-water pipe provided 1 Redecorations carried out 38 Refrigerators installed or repaired 3 Roof provided 1 Room made for preparation of food 1 Rubbish removed 1 Screen Wall provided 1 Sinks provided 17 Sneeze Screens provided 2 Stalls provided 2 49 Towels and Soap provided 3 Ventilated lobbies provided 6 Ventilator provided 1 Walls repaired 2 Walls tiled 2 Waste Pipe provided 1 W.C. apartments provided 4 W.C.

Educational Activities in relation to Food Hygiene: During the early part of the year the Medical Officer of Health addressed some 50 members of a Church organisation in North Finchley, and the Chief Public Health Inspector gave a talk to 21 members of a women's organisation in East Finchley. 7. Method of Disposal of Condemned Food : Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared continued to receive special attention. There were no new registrations of hawkers during the year. The number of barrow boys operating in the district at the end of the year was 4. 51 Slaughterhouses There is only one slaughterhouse in the district, which has been regularly inspected.

This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Acts also provide that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Two persons were licensed during 1958. Butchers' Shops There were 49 butchers' shops in the district, all of which are provided with glass fronts. All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. 56 Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough at the beginning of the year was 22. Three closed and one opened, leaving 20 at the end of the year. At 19 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the Public Health Inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. At one bakehouse a new addition was built and the bakehouse remodelled and oil firing equipment installed. In another, the old bakehouse was reconstructed and modernised. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 8 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1958, as follows :— Dealers1 Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 17 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 20 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 27 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 9 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 9 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 8 Food Sampling The following information has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955:— 57 List of Samples procured in the Borough during the year Article Total Samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Milk (new) 232 20 Milk (various) 42 — Butter 6 — Cakes 9 — Cheese 13 — Cooked Meat 8 — Cream 18 — Drugs 16 — Fish and Fish Products 21 — Ice-cream 4 — Liver 7 — Margarine 5 — Meat and Meat Products 19 — Sausages, etc. 10 — Spirits 6 — Vinegar 13 — Miscellaneous 20 1 Totals 449 21 Regarding the samples noted as unsatisfactory, the following comments are added:— " Milk. The 20 samples of new milk were taken from churns consigned to milk receiving depots in your district. They formed parts of consignments from 12 different dairy farmers. In the case of each consignment the average composition of the whole quantity of milk, contained in a number of separate churns, was satisfactory and no further action was taken. " Miscellaneous. A glass jar in which cream had been sold was found to contain foreign matter consisting of mortar. A caution was given to the packers concerned." The Public Control Department also reported upon the following matters:— 58 " Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887—1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926, and which relate to the marking with an indication of origin of certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold, are complied with. Inspections were made at 171 separate premises of 414 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, butter and dried fruit. " No serious infringement was detected. " Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and with the names of the ingredients of a compounded food. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. "A total of 587 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 143 premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above Regulations. "It was necessary to write a letter of caution to a firm manufacturing Fruit Juice Cocktails, the labels of which did not correctly state the ingredients and were not printed so as to be clearly legible. "False or Misleading Descriptions. As in previous years food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false or misleading statements and descriptions. Much of this scrutiny of food labels can be combined with inspection work under the Labelling of Food Order. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action was secured in relation to descriptions applied to 4 milk block,' ' Double Tea,' an imitation cream powder, cakes filled with a mixture of butter and sugar, canned mixed vegetables, raspberry syrup, powdered soup mixes, medium red salmon, gorgonzola cheese spread and cheese spread. "Special Designated Milk. During 1958 my Council issued two Dealer's (Pasteuriser's) and one Dealer's (Steriliser's) licences in respect of premises within your area where milk is processed. These 59 premises were regularly inspected, and compliance with statutory requirements was well maintained. A total of 77 samples of designated milk were taken, all of which were certified as being satisfactory. "Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, 57 samples of raw milk were procured within your borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated." Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as " complete cold mix." Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 160 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Coffee Stalls There are now no coffee stalls in the district, the last remaining one was closed and demolished in 1957. Fish Friers At the end of 1958 there were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out, one having been opened during the year. Game Licences Fifteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. 60 Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows:— Number on Register at beginning of 1958 957 Number closed 20 New Shops 13 Number on Register at end of 1958 950 Changes of Occupancy 46 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was eleven. Swimming Pools In co-operation with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, samples of the water at the Adult and Children's Open Air Pools were taken during the summer months and all were satisfactory. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 12 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses, the last of those which were served by standpipes having been dealt with in a Clearance Area and demolished. Pollution of Streams and Watercourses Further investigations have been carried out regarding the pollution of streams in and adjoining the district and in connection therewith, a number of soil fittings were found to be connected to the surface water sewers and appropriate action was taken for these to be made to discharge into the soil sewers. 61 Clean Air Act, 1956 The above Act deals with the control of dark smoke, smoke from furnaces, smoke control areas and special cases of smoke emission, which include special processes to be dealt with under the Alkali Act, colliery spoil-banks, railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. It also makes provision for the establishment of a Clean Air Council for England and Wales. Certain sections of the Act came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, including those relating to the height of chimneys and to smoke control areas. The remaining provisions came into operation on the 1st June, 1958, and included those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisances and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. With regard to the making of smoke control areas, any local authority may make an Order, which must be confirmed by the Minister declaring the whole or any part of its district as a smoke control area. Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of chimney smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused only by the burning of an authorised fuel. If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area, has to incur expenditure for adapting his heating arrangements, the local authority shall repay him seventenths of the cost, four-tenths of which is recoverable from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In October the Council passed a resolution instructing its officers to prepare a programme for making orders under the Clean Air Act, 1956, for submission to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation, whereby, within the next 10 years the whole of the Borough will be declared a smoke control area. A certain amount of publicity has been given to this subject, and during the year, lectures were given by members of the staff to organisations in the district, on clean air, in general, and more particularly, with regard to smoke control areas. 62 Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Twenty-three complaints were received during the year concerning industrial and domestic chimneys. In one case a smoke nuisance was noted and upon investigation it was found that there was a breakdown of the mechanical stoker. This was remedied the same day and no further nuisance arose. In addition, 17 complaints were received with regard to the burning of garden and other refuse and action was taken in a number of cases where it was considered that burning was habitual and causing a nuisance. A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, arc being converted or installed for oil burning. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil lired plant and for the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes refused in the absence of the necessary legislation to control this matter. Atmospheric Pollution Arising from the Council's interest in atmospheric pollution, two deposit gauges were purchased and placed in position on the 1st March, 1958. The sites selected were:— (1) Sewage Disposal Works, Summers Lane, N.12. (2) Moss Hall School, Moss Hall Grove, N.12. Later in the year, authority was granted to purchase two more gauges and these were placed in their respective positions on the 1st October, 1958. These were:— (3) Roof of Gaumont Cinema, High Road, N.12. (4) Lyttelton Playing Fields, N.2. A summary of the monthly analyses of the deposits collected is shown below:— 63 A summary of the monthly analyses of the deposits collected is shown below:— 1958 SITES (1) (2) (3) (4) March 9.37 10.16 - - April 7.68 8.31 — — May *4 95 *8.0 — — June 9.02 9.22 — — July 10.23 7.90 — — August 10.47 5.93 — — September 8.32 8.69 — — October 7.51 5.28 9.38 6.46 November 5.62 5.56 8.24 7.12 December 12.31 9.19 11.87 11.38 The figures show total solids (tons per square mile per month). * These figures arc not accurate because of a minor accident during the carrying out of modifications to the equipment. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Forty visits have been made to premises to ascertain that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. No contraventions of the Act were found with regard to the sale of new fires, but in the case of a second-hand dealer it was ascertained that some of the fires exhibited for sale did not comply with the Act. A warning letter was sent and the fires withdrawn from sale. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The number of persons licensed at the end of the year was 6. All the premises have been inspected. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances:— (1) Public Health Act, 1936—Sections 39 and 92. The owner of some flats was summonsed for failing to comply 64 with Court Orders to carry out repairs to abate nuisances. A penalty of £50 was imposed (with an alternative of three months' imprisonment). The fine was paid. (2) Food & Drugs Act, 1955—Section 2. Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955—Regulation 9(e). The occupier of a bakehouse was summonsed under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, with regard to the sale of a loaf of bread containing a cigarette end, for which offence he was fined £5. Arising from an inspection of this complaint an employee was found smoking in the bakehouse, and both he and the occupier were summonsed under the Food Hygiene Regulations, the employee being fined £3 and the occupier £5 together with 3 guineas costs. (3) Food & Drugs Act, 1955—Section 2. A dairy firm was prosecuted under the Food & Drugs Act for selling a bottle of milk containing foreign matter (i.e., flies). They were fined £10 and 10 guineas costs.

One complaint was received from Friern Barnet Ratepayers' Association regarding a rat infestation said to be emanating from the 65 Sewage Farm. After a considerable period of investigation this complaint was not confirmed. The Sewage Farm is treated at frequent intervals. Twenty-three smoke tests were applied to rat runs which revealed defects in drains and/or sewers in 5 cases. One of these defects had caused considerable trouble for a very long time.
