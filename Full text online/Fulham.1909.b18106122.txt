To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the borough for the year 1909. The statistics of births, deaths, and infectious diseases relate to the fifty-two weeks ended January 1st, 1910. POPULATION. A correct estimate of the population becomes increasingly difficult, the further we get from the census year. As enumerated at the census taken on April 6th, 1901 the population was 137,289, having increased from 113,781 during the previous five years, and, estimated in the usual way on the assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed between 1896 and 1901 has been maintained since, the population of the borough was in the middle of 1909, 176,406. This is unquestionably too high a figure as very few houses have been built in the last four years, and probably a more accurate calculation may be made by multiplying the number of rated houses by the average number of persons occupying each house at the census of 1901, which gives a population of 158,560, and on this the statistics in this report are based, although as there are at the present time a large number of empty tenements, even this may be too high an estimate. 6 The following table shows the increase of the borough in the last sixty years: — TABLE I.

The number of marriages registered during the year was 1,182, compared with 1,205, 1,308 and 1,203 in the three preceding years. The marriage-rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 14.9, the average rate for the previous ten years being 16.0 TABLE II.

The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column it. By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons Drought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The "Public Institutions " taken into account for the purpose of these tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account The births are not corrected by the distribution of those occurring in Lying-in Institutions.

Average number of persons per house 7.4 8 BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The births registered in the borough numbered 4,199,—2,188 males and 2,011 females—and were equal to an annual rate of 26.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is 5.4 below the mean rate of the ten years 1899-1908. Births in Lying-in Institutions. Of the births registered, 115 took place in the Fulham Workhouse, and the mothers of seven of these children had resided, before admission, outside the borough, while the births of 114 children, whose mothers belonged to Fulham, occurred in Lying-in Institutions situate in other boroughs, so that the net number of births was 4,306, and the corrected birth-rate 27.1. The birth-rate of the County of London was 24.2, being the lowest recorded since civil registration was adopted, and among the several metropolitan boroughs the rates, after being corrected by the distribution of the births occurring in Lying-in Institutions to the boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission, ranged from 13.6 in the City of London, 14.1 in Hampstead, and 16.2 in Westminster, to 31.6 in Bethnal Green, 31.7 in Shoreditch, and 32.3 in Bermondsey. The following table gives the number of births and the birth-rates in the various wards, corrected by the distribution of the births in Fulham Workhouse, and inclusive of those occurrir:r in outside Maternity Institutions:- TABLE III.

The illegitimates numbered 227, or 5.3 per cent. of the total births. Of the births registered in the borough, 198 or 4.7 per cent. were illegitimate as were 29 or 25.4 per cent. of those born in outside institutions. Still-born Children. Two hundred and twenty-one still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every nineteen living. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population of the borough by the excess of births over deaths was 2,191, compared with 2,553, 2,422, and 2,636 in the three preceding years. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The deaths of 1,940 persons, 979 males and 961 females, were registered in Fulham during 1909, but of these 154, 100 males and 54 females, were of persons not belonging to the borough, who died within it, while the deaths of 329 residents in Fulham, 187 males and 142 females, occurred outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 2,115 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham, 1,066 males and 1,049 females, representing an annual rate of 13.34 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is the same as that for 1908, and 2.2 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding ten years. The death-rate of males was 14.2 and of females 12.5, assuming the sex constitution of the population to be the same as in 1901. The death-rate of the County of London was 14.0 per 1,000, and among the several boroughs the lowest death-rates were 8.9 in Hampstead, 10.3 in Lewisham, and 11.3 in Stoke Newington, while the highest were 19.0 in Shoreditch, 19.2 in Finsbury, and 20.3 in the City of London. The death-rate of England and Wales in 1909 was 14.5, and that of the seventy-five large provincial towns 14.9. 10 11 TABLE IV. Causes of, and Ages at, Death during Year 1909. Causes of Death.

Death-rates vary considerably in different localities according to the age constitution of the populations, and in a district with a population comprising a large number of infants or very old people the death-rate, other conditions being similar, would of necessity be higher than that of one containing a large proportion of people of middle age. For the correction of the differences due to age and sex constitution, factors of correction have been published by the Registrar General for the provincial towns, and by the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council for the metropolitan boroughs, and the multiplication of the recorded death-rate of a district by its factor of correction gives the death-rate which would obtain, if the age and sex constitution of the population were in the same proportion as it is in the whole of England and Wales, thus eliminating the differences due to age and sex. In the following table the crude and corrected death-rates of Fulham may be compared with those of the adjoining boroughs, the County of London, England and Wales and the large and small towns.

In Table II. will be found the number of deaths and the death-rate in each of the ten preceding years. The difference between the rate for 1909 and the average of the ten years 1899-1908 represents a saving of 365 lives. Distribution of Deaths.

Infantile Mortality. Of the 2,115 deaths registered, 466, or 22 per cent., were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered in Fulham, was 111 per 1,000, and 108 per 1,000 after the inclusion of the births in the metropolitan maternity institutions. This is the lowest infantile death-rate yet recorded, and is 33 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding ten years. The corresponding rate of the County of London was the same as that of Fulham, and in eleven metropolitan boroughs the infantile mortality was higher, and in seventeen lower, than in Fulham, the rates ranging from 75 per 1,000 in Hampstead to 140 per 1,000 in Shoreditch. England and Wales had an infantile mortality rate of 109 and the seventy-live large provincial towns one of 122 per 1,000. The decline in infantile mortality of recent years will be seen from the subjoined table, and although climatic conditions have doubtless been an important factor in the reduction, and especially so in 1909, there are grounds for thinking that the administrative measures aiming at the instruction of nursing and prospective mothers have been attended with some measure of success.

PREVENTION OF INFANT MORTALITY. Notification of Births Act. Three thousand two hundred and sixty-five notifications were received under the above Act, 3,196 of living and 69 of stillborn children, 75 per cent. of the births registered being notified. Of these, 1,896, or 58 per cent. were notified by wives, 1,058, or 32.4 per cent. by medical practitioners, and 311, or 9.6 per cent. by the father or some other relative. Three hundred and twenty-five mothers were visited by the Sanitary Inspector, Mrs. Davies, and 679 by voluntary helpers who worked in connection with the Fulham School for Mothers, but as has been repeatedly urged there is need for the 19 vices of at least one lady who could devote her whole time to this work, and as power is now given by the London County Council General Powers Act, 1908, to sanitary authorities "to appoint suitable women (to be known as health visitors) for the purpose of giving to persons advice as to the proper assistance, care and management of young children, and the promotion of cleanliness," I trust that the Council will now make such an appointment. Mention was made in the report for 1908 of the inauguration of a scheme for the reduction of infantile mortality by the systematic instruction of nursing and expectant mothers on the lines of the St. Pancras School for Mothers, and it is satisfactory to record its success. From July, 1908, to June, 1909, a weekly consultation was held at St. Augustine's Hall, to which mothers brought their babies who were seen by the Hon. Medical Officer, Miss Alice Benham, M.B.Lond., and advice was given on their feeding, nursing and clothing, and as the numbers attending continued to increase, and promises of adequate financial support were received, the Committee decided to extend the scope of their work, and with this object took permanent premises at 92, Greyhound Road and engaged a lady superintendent. Medical consultations are now held at this address twice a week, dinners are provided for nursing and expectant mothers at a charge of 2d. a meal, and cookery, dressmaking and other classes are held. In all 362 babies have passed through the school who have made 1,320 attendances, and the results as given in the report of the School recently published are most encouraging. Deaths of Illegitimate Infants. Sixty-seven of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 295 deaths per 1,000 births, against 98 per 1,000 among children born in wedlock. B 2 20 In calculating the illegitimate death-rate the illegitimates born in outside institutions have been included, but in previous reports this was not the case, as information as to their status was not obtained. If the illegitimates born outside be excluded, the death-rate in 1909 was 338 per 1,000, which compares with an average of 342 per 1,000 in the previous ten years, so that the decline in infant mortality does not seem in Fulham as yet to have extended to the illegitimates. The provision of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1907, requiring notice to be given to the local authority by all persons receiving more than one child under the age of 5 years has been extended by the Children's Act, 1908, which requires notice to be given where a person undertakes for reward the nursing and maintenance of one or more infants under the age of seven years apart from their parents or having no parents. The local authority under the Act in the County of London is the London County Council, and the sections dealing with nurse children are administered not by the Public Health Department, but for some not very obvious reason, by the Public Control Department, which deals with the storage of petroleum, the registration of motor cars and kindred matters. With the view of co-operating if possible in its administration, application was made to the County Council for a list of persons registered in Fulham under the Act, but this information was refused. The following table gives the causes of deaths among illegitimates, and it may be noted that the death-rate from diarrhœal diseases alone is equal to that from all causes among legitimate children. 21 TABLE XII.

Between the ages of one and five years 260 deaths were recorded, so that the deaths of children under the age of five years numbered 726, or 34.3 per cent. of the deaths at all ages. The number corresponds to a death-rate of 35.4 per 1,000 of the children estimated to be living at that age, which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, were issued in respect of 372 children under five, 51 per cent. of the children dying at that age period being insured. Mortality at School Age. At the ages of five to fifteen years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were sixty-seven deaths, or 3.2 per cent. of the total number, representing a mortality of 2.1 per 1,000 of those living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. Between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five years, seventynine, or 3.7 per cent. of the total deaths, were recorded, the rate at this age period being 2.8 per 1,000. Mortality at Maturity. Seven hundred and sixty-six, or 36.3 per cent. of all the deaths, occurred between the ages of twenty-five and sixtyfive years, the mortality being at the rate of 10.7 per 1,000. Mortality at Decline. At the age of sixty-five and upwards there were 477 deaths, or 22.6 per cent. of those at all ages, corresponding to a deathrate of 92.4 per 1,000. DEATHS FROM EPIDEMIC DISEASES. To the seven principal epidemic diseases 272 deaths were ascribed, representing a death-rate of 1.71 per 1,000 inhabitants, which is 0.87 per 1,000 below the mean rate of the decennium 1899-1908, each of the seven diseases showing a lower mortality. 23 The corresponding rate of the County of London was 1.3 per 1,000, and in the metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 0.5 in Hampstead to 2.7 in Bermondsey. In Table XIII. will be found the number of deaths from each of the principal epidemic diseases in 1909 and the ten preceding years, and in Table XIV. the death-rates from them per 1,000 of the estimated population of each ward in 1909. 24 TABLE XIII Deaths from the seven principal Infectious Diseases. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908.

Forty-one persons were notified as suffering from enteric fever, of whom 34, or 83 per cent., were removed to hospital. Fatality.—There were four deaths, giving a case mortality of 9.8 per cent. In three cases mussels, and in two, oysters had been eaten within a fortnight of the commencement of the illness. In one case the disease was due to infection by a previous case in the same house. In three instances the disease was contracted outside the borough. The following table shows the prevalence of enteric fever in the borough since 1899. TABLE XXVI. Notified Cases of Enteric Fever.

Researches made during the last few years have shown that a certain number of typhoid patients, more especially women, continue to harbour in the biliary passages and to excrete by the bowel numbers of virulent bacilli for months 38 and even for years after recovery from the disease, and several outbreaks have been traced to these carriers. It has been found that the bacilli disappear from and reappear in the feces in a very irregular manner, so that a single negative examination of them is inconclusive, and with the view of ascertaining what proportion of patients remain infective after recovery and the length of time the infectivity continues, Dr. Theodore Thomson arranged last year, on behalf of the Local Government Board, that when a patient was discharged from a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board who was excreting typhoid bacilli, the Medical Officer of Health should send samples of his stools and urine monthly, during the first six months after discharge, to the Lister Institute forexamination, and should all prove negative, that a further sample of each should be sent at end of'the next period of six months, and this year the scheme lias been extended to include all patients discharged from the Asylums Board's hospitals after recovery from enteric fever. In 1909 one patient, a man aged 59, was reported to be still excreting typhoid bacilli from the bowel, but five monthly examinations proved negative, as did three examinations of the excreta of a girl, aged 5, who had been notified by the Medical Officer of Health for Chelsea as a "carrier" who had moved into Fulham. Errors of Diagnosis in Notified Infectious Diseases. Of the patients certified as suffering from scarlet fever 28, or 5.5 per cent., from diphtheria 38, or 11.8 per cent., and from enteric fever 6, or 14.6 per cent., were subsequently ascertained not to be suffering from those diseases. Puerperal Fever. Thirty-four cases of puerperal septicaemia, or 8.1 per 1,000 births, were notified, of which 13, or 3.1 per 1,000 births, proved fatal. The number of cases in 1909 was much higher than in any previous year, and it will be seen on reference to Table XV. thajt there has been a marked increase in notified cases since 1905, the notifications in the five years 1905-1909 being twice as numerous as in either of the three previous quinquennia. 39 This is the more remarkable as the Midwives Act, which aims at securing the efficient training and supervision of midwives, was passed in 1902. No doubt, owing to midwives being obliged to send for medical assistance on the occurrence of a rise in the patient's temperature, some few cases are now notified which formerly would not have been, but this only accounts to a very limited extent for the increase. Arrangements were made for all midwives and nurses who had been attending septic cases to have several free baths at the Council's baths, and their clothing and instruments were sterilised at the disinfecting station. Erysipelas. One hundred and fifteen persons were certified to be suffering from erysipelas, and five deaths were attributed to this cause. Cirebro-Spinal Meningitis. Three cases were notified with one death, that of a child five months old, in Victoria Hospital. In London 110 cases of cerebro-spinal fever were notified, with fifteen deaths. DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. The deaths from measles in the four quarters of the year were:— No. of Deaths. 1st Quarter 19 2nd ,, 29 3rd „ 25 4th ,, 1 74 The death-rate was 0.47 per 1,000, as compared with 0.48 in the County of London, and an average of 0.55 for the ten years 1899-1908. 40 The disease was most prevalent in Munster Ward, 370 of the 740 cases reported from the schools belonging to that ward. Although largely spread by schools, the fatality of measles is mainly among children under school age. Thus of the seventy-four deaths sixty were of children under school age, fourteen being under one year, thirty-five between one and two, and eleven between two and three years, No fewer than nine children died from measles who lived in Ileckfield Place, probably the worst street, sociallv, in the borough, and the effect, in localities of this class, of dealing with infectious diseases by notification and isolation, is shown bv the fact that whereas for many years past there has been no excessive prevalence in Heckfield Place of the notifiable diseases, diphtheria and scarlet fever, the mortality among its residents from the non-notifiable diseases, measles, whooping cough, and diarrhoea, has been invariably much higher than in the rest of the borough. The cases of measles reported from the schools are visited by the inspectors, who give printed and verbal instructions respecting the precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, but it is found as a rule that the patient has been ill for a week or more before the information reaches the Medical Officer of Health. Whooping Cough. Forty-eight deaths were ascribed to whooping cough, or ten below the average number of the preceding ten years. Forty-six of the deaths were of children under the age of five years. Diarrhœa. The deaths in the four quarters of the year ascribed to diarrhoea and zymotic enteritis were:— No. of Deaths. Death-rate. 1st Quarter 7 0.18 2nd ,, 8 0.20 3rd ,, 62 1.56 4th ,, 20 0.51 97 0.61 41 In the County of London the death-rate from diarrhoea was 0.33 per 1,000, and only four of the metropolitan boroughs had higher rates than Fulham. DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOUS DISEASES. Two hundred and six deaths were registered from phthisic (tuberculosis of the lungs), 104 of which occurred in Public Institutions, the decennial average corrected for the increase of population being 230; and 65 deaths were ascribed to other tuberculous diseases, such as tuberculous meningitis, tabes mesenterica and general tuberculosis. In the several wards of the borough the death-rates from phthisis and other tuberculous diseases were as under:— TABLE XXVIII. Deaths per 1,000 of the population of each Ward from Phthisis and other Tuberculous Diseases. Death-rate from Phthisis. Death-rate from other Tuberculous Diseases. Death-rate from all Tuberculous Diseases. Baron's Court Ward 0.98 0.23 1.21 Lillie Ward 1.74 0.34 2.08 Walham Ward 1.19 0.44 1.53 Margravine Ward 1.91 0.62 2.53 Munster Ward 1.15 0.37 1.52 Hurlingham Ward 1.20 0.22 1.42 Sands End Ward 1.10 0.61 1.71 Town Ward 1.00 0.23 1.23 The Borough 1.30 0.41 1.71 42 In the County of London the death-rate from phthisis was 1.31 per 1,000, and the rates in the several metropolitan boroughs ranged from 0.61 in Hampstead to 2.22 in Finsbury. Notification of Phthisis. The order of the Local Government Board, making it compulsory for all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring among poor people, who are in receipt of indoor or outdoor relief, to be notified by a Poor Law Officer to the Medical Officer of Health came into force on January 1st, 1909. Under this order the following notifications respecting poor persons who are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis are required to be sent to the Medical Officer of Health: — (а) A notification by the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution respecting any inmate of the Institution showing symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, who resided immediately before his admission to the Poor Law Institution at a place in the area in which the Poor Law Institution is situate, and in the case of any inmate who resided immediately before his admission at a place elsewhere than in the area in which the Poor Law Institution is situate, the notification must be sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the said place is situate. (б) A notification by a District Medical Officer respecting any poor person showing symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis upon whom he is in medical attendance according to his agreement with a Board of Guardians. (c) A notification by the Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution within forty-eight hours after the departure from the Institution of a poor person, who has been an inmate of the Institution and whose case has been notified by the Medical Officer of the Poor Law Institution, together with the intended residence of the poor person, such notification to be sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the intended residence is situate. 43 (d) A notification by a Relieving- Officer within forty-eight hours after he has obtained information respecting a change of residence of a poor person residing in his relief district, whose case has been notified bv the District Medical Officer, such notification to be sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the changed residence of the poor person is situate. The object of this compulsory notification of Poor Law patients is to enable the Medical Officer of Health, on behalf of the Sanitary Authority, to take preventive measures against the spread of the disease, but it is expressly laid down that nothing in the regulations shall authorise the Medical Officer of Health, or the Council, to put into force, with respect to any poor person in relation to whom a notification has been given under the regulations, any enactment which renders the poor person, or a person in charge of the poor person, or any other person liable to a penalty, or subject the poor person to any restriction, prohibition or disability affecting himself or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood or residence, on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Subject to this proviso the Board points out that it is desirable that Sanitary Authorities acting on the advice of their Medical Officers, should utilise their powers for the purpose of preventing the spread of infection from tuberculosis by: 1. The destruction or disinfection of infected articles, and the cleansing and disinfecting of premises; 2. The safe disposal, or destruction, of infectious material produced and discharged as the result of pulmonary tuberculosis, and the taking of all other necessary measures the prevention of infection from any such material; 8. The obviating, removing, or diminishing the risk of infection arising from the conditions affecting the use or occupation of any room when used or occupied by the poor person as a sleeping apartment; 44 4. The furnishing for the use of the poor person, on loan, or otherwise, any appliance, apparatus, or utensil which will be of assistance for the purpose of any precaution against infection; 5. The providing and publishing or distributing in the form of placards, handbills, or pamphlets suitable summaries of information on instructions respecting pulmonary tuberculosis and the precautions to be taken in preventing the spread of that disease. The following notifications under these regulations were received during 1909:— (a) Notifications respecting Inmates of Poor Law Institutions suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. 1. In Institutions in Fulham 233 2. In Institutions outside Fulham 29 262 Renotifications 34 Total number of Inmates of Poor Law Institutions notified 228 (b) Notifications of persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis received from District Medical Officers 174 Number of persons, notified bv District Medical Officers, who were removed to Fulham Infirmary and are included among the notified inmates 133 Number of persons notified by District Medical Officers not removed to Infirmary and not included under (a) 41 45 (c) Notifications received respecting persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis leaving Poor Law Institutions From Institutions in Fulham 92 From Institutions outside Fulham 11 103 Renotifications 12 Total number of persons notified as leaving Poor Law Institutions 91 Number of persons notified as leaving Poor Law Institutions who had been previously notified as Inmates 82 Number of persons notified as leaving Poor Law Institutions who had not been previously notified as Inmates 9 (d) Notifications by Relieving Officers of removals of persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. From outside the Borough into Fulham 1 Within Fulham — Total number of notifications received 540 Total number of persons notified 279 One hundred and sixty-five of the persons notified were males and 114 females. The fees paid amounted to £22 11s. 9d. Of the patients notified in Fulham Infirmary 59, ox 30 per cent., died during the year, and there were eight deaths among the cases notified bv the District Medical Officers, and four among those discharged from the Infirmary, the mortality of all notified cases being 25.4 per cent. Of the persons notified as leaving Poor Law Institutions for Fulham, four were transferred from one institution toanother, the intended residence of nine was not known, and in twelve cases the address given was found to be incorrect. Of the remaining G7, four have died and ten have left Fulham. 46 In addition to the above, forty cases were notified from Brompton, three from Margaret Street Hospital (six of these being also notified under the Poor Law Tuberculosis regulations), and eighteen cases were voluntarily notified by private medical practitioners. Among the hospital cases there were three and among the private cases eight deaths, making a total of eighty-two deaths out of 334 notified cases, so assuming the proportion of deaths to cases to be the same in unnotified as in notified cases, there are among the residents in Fulham 482 unnotified cases of recognisable tuberculosis of the lungs. Notification of the Poor Law cases enables the Sanitary Authority to cleanse and disinfect, after their removal, the rooms that have been occupied by tuberculous patients, and by special instructions regarding the conditions under which tuberculosis is transmissible to lessen the risk of the patient infecting other members of his family or his fellow workers, and may also lead to the recognition of cases of incipient phthisis in the household, but it should be supplemented by other measures. The patients discharged from the Infirmary are found as a rule to have derived benefit from the treatment, but the home conditions to which they return are generally thoroughly unsatisfactory, as, when the patient is the breadwinner, the poverty which results from his diminished earning capacity, renders it impossible for him to obtain even sufficient nourishment, let alone proper housing accommodation, and he goes steadily down hill until again compelled to go into the Infirmary, nor on visiting these cases do we feel that we are being very helpful, when to a man who really wants good food, we offer on behalf of the Sanitary Authority a spitting flask and some paper handkerchiefs. Sanatorium treatment is the most promising method of combating the evil, having a powerful educational as well as, in suitable cases, some curative influence, and looking at the enormous loss entailed on the community by consumption, since, besides the loss of earnings, it is estimated that one- 47 tenth of the total cost of Poor Law administration is due to tuberculosis, it is hoped that, on economic as well as on humanitarian grounds, largely increased sanatorium accommodation will be provided, either by combinations of local authorities or by the State. Given, however, even this, it must be remembered that the health regained by a consumptive after a few months' treatment in a sanatorium will not permit his resuming without restraint his former occupation, and that the after care of these patients presents another extremely difficult problem. With regard to local measures the most suitable would be the establishment in Fulham of a tuberculosis dispensary modelled on the lines of the Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumptives in Edinburgh, founded by Dr. R. W. Philip. Its object is the guidance, supervision, and assistance of the tuberculous poor. It co-operates with the hospitals and undertakes the visitation of out-patients at their homes so as to ensure the medical instructions being carried out, while contacts are examined by the physician and early cases detected while in the curable stage. The dispensary also works in close co-operation with the various charitable societies so that suitable cases can receive assistance in some form or other. The Edinburgh Dispensary has now been working for many years with very successful results, and at the beginning of 1909 a similar institution was opened in the Borough of Paddington, at which 867 patients attended during the year. DEATHS FROM OTHER DISEASES. Influenza. Twenty-nine deaths were certified to be due to influenza, the numbers for the three preceding years being 33, 33, and 30. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 143 deaths, the average of the preceding ten years corrected for the increase of the population being 148. 48 Diseases of the Respiratory System other than Phthisis. From these diseases there were 419 deaths, 19.8 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 68 below the corrected decennial average. Other classes of diseases caused the following deaths:— Venereal Diseases 28 Diseases of the Nervous System 92 Diseases of the Circulatory System 249 Diseases of the Digestive Orgarns 90 Diseases of the Urinary System 91 CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 2,115 deaths registered, 1,954, or 92.4 per cent., were certified by registered medical practioners, and the remainder by coroners after inquest, no death being uncertified. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. In 1909 the deaths of 436 persons, 220 males and 216 females, occurred in the Infirmary, and of 28, 19 males and 9 females, in the Workhouse.

The vigorous action, too, of your Food Inspector has had the effect of reducing the amount of fraud practised in the butter business, only 8 per cent. of the samples purchased in 1909 being adulterated, compared with 20.4, 17.1, 27.0, and 18.3 per cent. in the four preceding years. 60 Prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts were instituted by the Council in the following cases:— Defendant.

Notices were served in respect of 52 rooms under section 20 of the London County Council Genera] Powers Act, 1904, which gives power to the sanitary authority to require the cleansing of any house infected with vermin. CERTIFICATES UNDER THE REVENUE ACTS. Applications were received for certificates in respect of 409 dwellings, of which 43 were granted; 294 were given after certain specified works had been completed, and 72 were refused. Certificates in respect of 205 dwellings, which had been granted for a limited period, were renewed. DRAINAGE OF BUILDINGS. During the year the following drainage plans were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee : — Plans of drainage of new houses 16 Plans of drainage for additions to existing buildings 32 Plans of the reconstruction of the drainage of existing buildings 122 Combined Drainage. Eight systems of combined drainage for portions of which the Council was liable, owing to certain of the pipes which received the drainage of more than one building, forming " sewers " within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were reconstructed during the year at a cost to the Council of £146 13s. 3d., the work being carried out by a contractor under a schedule of prices. The sum of £106 11s. Od. was also paid to owners in respect of work executed by them in compliance with notices served by the Council at eleven houses in connection with house drains, which were " sewers " as defined by the Metropolis Management Act. REMOVAL OF REFUSE. The weekly service for the collection of house refuse has been well maintained, and but few complaints of non-removal were received. 64 Refuse is now removed twice a week from flats as the storage facilities in these dwellings are very limited and a week's accumulation causes considerable nuisance. Proceedings were taken against the occupier of a stable near New King's Road for failing to comply with the Council's notice to remove the manure, and a penalty of £3 with 2s. costs was imposed. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. Nine hundred and one complaints were received and dealt with by the Inspectors, and 1,867 intimation and 351 statutory notices were served. In three instances proceedings were instituted for failing to comply with the Council's notice, but the summonses were withdrawn on the payment of the costs, the works necessary to abate the nuisances having been completed before the date of hearing. The following summary has been prepared at the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council: — PREMISES. NUMBER OF PLACES. Number of Inspections, 1909.
