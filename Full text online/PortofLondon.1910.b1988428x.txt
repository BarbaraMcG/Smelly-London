LONDON: Printed by Charles Skipper & East, 49, G&eat Tower Street, E.G. 1911. STRONG, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, 011 Thursday, the 6th day of April, 1911. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Port to the 31st December, 1910; which was read. And a Motion being made and Question put, That this Court doth agree with the Committee in their said Report, the same was resolved in the Affirmative. Ordered, That the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Eight Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. We whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation, as the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London, by the Local Government Board, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Herbert Williams, the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London, for the year ended the 31st December, 1910, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work carried out in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. In dealing with the details of medical inspection, attention is drawn to the further increase in the number of vessels it has been found necessary to examine in view of the continued presence of cholera in Europe. Owing to the abolition of the Coast-guard at Sheerness, the Medical Officer stationed there has to examine the vessels in the Customs boat, an arrangement which, up to the present, has acted very well. The Sanitary Inspection of Shipping has been well maintained in spite of the enormous increase in relation to Food Inspection, in the course of which there have been important developments. The most important of these appears to be the discovery of the presence, in certain imported frozen beef, of a parasite, which was found to infest certain portions of the fore-quarters of beef to a considerable extent. One of the effects of this parasite was to cause in the meat numbers of cysts or swellings which, on being opened, were found to contain quantities of foullooking matter or lymph. Many of these cysts were quite large, and there was little difficulty in your officers coming to the conclusion that the meat was entirely unwholesome and unfit for the food of man. It was soon found that beef is arriving in this country in large quantities, and the work of examining these quarters, involving, as it did in most instances, cutting in order to locate the parasite, called for all the resources at the disposal of your Committee. In the end the result has been an arrangement with the Commonwealth of Australia whereby it is hoped that no more of this infested meat will be imported into this country. The general conclusions to be drawn in connection with food examination would appear to show that this branch of the work is liable, at any time, to considerable pressure from the introduction of extraordinary circumstances from without. The presence of Plague in dead rats continues to be demonstrated from time to time in various parts of the country, and the history of those outbreaks which have occurred among rats in London shows that careful observation continues to be kept. Any rats found dead, for which no obvious cause is shown, are examined bacteriologically with a view to establishing whether or not they have died from plague. So far the precautions adopted have been quite effectual in preventing any spread of the disease. With regard to Infectious Diseases generally, the number of cases is somewhat less than was reported during the previous year. With regard to the arrival of Alien Passengers in the port, particulars of these arrivals are set out in the form of a table, together with the number of passengers who were rejected by the Medical Inspectors on grounds of medical defect. Nuisances from smoke and other sources have received the careful attention of your Committee, and in those cases where legal proceedings were ordered, convictions were duly obtained. In accordance with the order of your Honourable Court, an Account of Receipts and Expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary Authority for the year ended December last is appended for the information of the Court. All which we submit to the judgment of this Honourable Court. Dated this fourth day of April, 1911. Geo. E. Ellis. W. W. Green. Fredk. Geo. Mellows. H. Roper Barrett. Edgar E. Bond. George Briggs.

TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report for the year 1910, being the ninth of the series. In a general review of the work of your officers, as shown by the tables accompanying this report, several points become prominent. In the first place the number of vessels arriving from foreign ports shows for the first time in recent years a slight upward tendency, though it is still substantially below the mean of the preceding ten years—(Tables I.-II.). All of these vessels were visited by your Medical Officers. The efficiency of the work of your Sanitary Inspectors, as shown by Tables III., IV., XXXI. and XXXII., has been well maintained, notwithstanding the strain put upon this branch of the work by urgent developments in connection with the inspection of foreign meat. With regard to Infectious Diseases (Table V.), I pointed out last year that there was a noticeable reduction in the number of cases reported on incoming ships, and also in the number admitted to the Hospital. The reduction is continued in a marked manner during the past year. I have dealt at length under separate headings with the movements of Cholera, Yellow Fever and Plague in various parts of the world, showing how the Port of London by reason of its universal foreign trade is especially exposed at times to invasion by one or other of these diseases, and Cholera in particular, while as regards Plague, which has been demonstrated to be a disease of rats, I have given some details of outbreaks of the disease amongst these creatures in different localities, with particulars of the precautions adopted in the Port of London for their destruction. The principal Infectious Diseases have also been separately dealt with, though during the year under review there has been in regard to these, little or nothing of public interest to record. The work of Food Inspection under the Regulations relating to the Inspection of Foreign Meat and Unsound Food, has increased to a remarkable extent, and has been a serious drain upon administrative resources. I have 8 dealt with this subject at some length with a view to showing not only the enormous amount of material to be dealt with, but also the necessity for the constant attendance of your officers at all hours, dav or night, and on Sundays, owing to the continuous discharge of cargo from vessels. I have also described some special features in connection with parasitical disease discovered on an extensive scale in certain foreign meat. With reference to alien immigrants, I have set out as in previous years, in table form, figures relating to the number of such immigrants entering the Port of London. The Staff, except for some minor changes, remains the same, there being no additions to the executive during the past year, and it is my pleasant duty to record that, owing to the willing co-operation of all concerned, the stress of work, which was at times very great, was met without difficulty. To this Report is appended as usual my Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and a statement of General Income and Expenditure. MEDICAL INSPECTION. The total number of vessels arriving at Gravesend from foreign ports was 9,699, which is an increase of 128 on the number for the preceding year. All of these were visited by your Medical Officers, while of the total, 2,756 were examined in detail, this involving the medical inspection of 15,243 passengers, and 59,993 persons forming the crews of vessels. Absolute vigilance on the part of your Medical Officers has been necessary in view of the presence of cholera in Europe, and two suspected cases were removed to hospital from vessels arriving, as were also two cases suspicious of plague. At Sheerness the number of vessels arriving from " foreign " was 337, exactly the same number as in the previous year. 284 of these were visited by your Medical Officer, Dr. Legge. Some modification of practice in relation to the arrangements for medical inspection has occurred at this station. The Coastguards have been superseded by Customs' officers, and the former " look out " kept by the Coastguard, abandoned. Consequently your Medical Officer has been at some disadvantage in getting timely notice of the arrival of vessels. The telephone in Garrison Point Fort, by prohibition of the Military Commandant, was no longer accessible to civilians, therefore some fresh arrangement became necessary. Another position has been found for it, which will enable the Customs to telephone your Medical Officer, and this arrangement, so far, has worked without serious inconvenience, though the absence of an elevated look-out may of necessity result in some vessels getting through before your Medical Officer can reach them. 9 TABLE I.

The summary of the work of your Sanitary Inspectors, as regards the number of visits paid by them, will be found in Table III., from which it will be seen that the total number of inspections of all kinds was 38,567. Of these, 13,710 were to vessels arriving from foreign ports—the total number of such arrivals being 9,699. Coastwise vessels, barges, &c., numbered 22,870, while 1,987 visits were paid to various premises on shore. Of the vessels visited, 2,843 required cleansing of crew's quarters, which in every case was carried out under the supervision of the inspector concerned. Particulars are given of the number of inspections in each dock, and also in the river—the river for the purpose of inspection being divided into three districts, known as the Upper, Middle, and Lower. Of the nationality of vessels inspected, 57.67 per cent. were under the British flag, Swedish and Norwegian coming, as usual, next in order of number with 13.35 per cent., whilst German vessels represented 9.23 per cent., other nationalities showing, of course, a lesser proportion. Table IV. gives a summary of various sanitary works carried out and in course of construction under the supervision of your officers. This is an important and growing part of their work. In Tables XXXI. and XXXII. will be found details of the various classes of nuisance which are reported upon and dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors. These nuisances show a total number of 3,911, and, as will be seen by a reference to the Tables, comprise sanitary defects in great variety in connection with both vessels and premises on shore. 11 TABLE III.

In my previous Annual Reports I called attention to the reduced number of cases of infectious disease reported on vessels arriving in the port. The total number for the year now under review shows a still further reduction, with a corresponding reduction of the number of cases admitted to hospital. I am without any information as to whether this reduction is due to particular causes, but it seems reasonable to assume that the strictness of medical inspection which at present prevails, not only in this country but in many ports abroad, may have some influence in this direction. The total number of cases of infectious disease reported on vessels arriving in the port was 144, and of this the largest number were, as usual, cases of Enteric Fever, namely 39, Measles and Scarlet Fever coming next with 23 and 21 respectively ; whilst of Smallpox only eight cases were reported, and of Cholera and Plague five and six cases respectively. Of the five cases of Cholera reported, two which were suspicious were landed at Denton Hospital, as was also the case with two of the six suspected cases of Plague, the other cases having been removed to foreign hospitals. Of the eight cases of Smallpox reported, only two were found on vessels on arrival, and both of these were removed to Denton Hospital. With regard to Scarlet Fever, the bulk of the cases were furnished by training ships in the River Thames, most of them occurring on the training ship " Warspite." Of the 39 cases of Enteric Fever reported on vessels, 17 were admitted to Denton Hospital. This disease is, as will be seen, of fairly frequent occurrence on vessels, more especially on those carrying passengers. 14 TABLE V. INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

Cholera has, as was expected, become epidemic in Russia. The Northern parts of Russia, especially St. Petersburg, Cronstadt, Riga, and other ports of the Baltic, were infected. Southern Russia was also infected, the ports on the shores of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov being especially visited. Infection spread into the interior of Southern Russia, and the Asiatic provinces of Russia. Cholera was also carried to Italy and Sicily, and to the Island of Madeira, where, at the end of the year, it was still causing a number of deaths. Cases of Cholera occurred at Tripoli, Constantinople and Turkey generally, Persia, India, and the Far East, where it was, of course, as usual, endemic. The presence of Cholera in Russia., Italy, Sicily and Madeira, is of particular importance. The history of Cholera is that it remains comparatively quiescent during the winter months, and breaks out with increased virulence at the onset of hot weather in the summer months. Climatic conditions during the past year have not been favourable to the existence of this disease ; nevertheless, it has spread, and great vigilance will be necessary on the part of Port Sanitary Authorities during the coming year, should the weather be fine and warm. The presence of cholera at St. Petersburg and Baltic ports has entailed much work on the part of your staff. All vessels arriving thence have had to be medically inspected, the names and addresses of all persons arriving taken and notified to the Medical Officers of the districts to which they were proceeding. In many cases satisfactory addresses were not provided on arrival of the vessel at Gravesend, and the persons have been detained until inquiries could be made, and the persons were allowed to land on my being satisfied that they were proceeding to a satisfactory address. The s.s. "Belgien," of Copenhagen, left St. Petersburg on the 26th August, 1910, where Cholera was epidemic. On the 30th August, one of the crew (the cook) was taken ill with vomiting, diarrhoea and severe cramps, symptoms of a mild attack of Cholera. He was isolated, and on arrival at Gravesend on the 3rd September, he was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton with all his effects. The vessel was disinfected, and the names and addresses of all persons leaving the ship taken and notified to the medical officers of health of the respective districts to which they were proceeding. 16 There were no symptoms of Cholera after the patient's admission to hospital. A specimen of excreta was submitted to the Local Government Board for bacteriological examination by Professor Klein, who reported that his results were negative as regards Cholera. The Danish s.s. "Perm," arrived at Gravesend on the 24th October, from Libau, with one of the crew who had been taken ill the same day with diarrhoea, and pains in the limbs. In view of the fact that the vessel had arrived from a "suspected" port, the man was removed to Denton Hospital. The case did not, however, prove to be one of Cholera. TABLE VI. (Cholera.) Date.

This disease can only exist in countries where the mean temperature is sufficiently high. This disease has prevailed in Brazil, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Trinidad Port of Spain. There are grounds for believing that this disease has been endemic in West Africa for many years—the clinical characters have been, however, modified in many cases. Vessels have arrived at Lisbon and Liverpool, on which cases of Yellow Fever have occurred during the voyage, and it is, therefore, important that vessels arriving from ports infected with Yellow Fever should be carefully investigated. 17 PLAGUE. During the year, Plague has been widely prevalent. It has caused large numbers of deaths in India, and cases have occurred in the Straits Settlements, Siam, French Indo China, China, Japan, New Caledonia, Hawaiian Islands, South America—including the Argentine Republic, Brazil, Chili, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Island of Trinidad. A few cases occurred in North America in the State of California, where ground squirrels were found to be extensively infected with Plague. Africa.—Egypt was also affected—cases occurring at Alexandria, Port Said, Damietta and Ismailia, and in some of the internal provinces; also in German East Africa, Zanzibar, Mauritius, Tunis, and a few cases occurred in Morocco. Europe.—Southern Russia, Lisbon, Asia Minor, Persian Gulf, and two cases occurred in the Port of London, whilst four persons are alleged to have died from this disease in East Anglia. The recent occurrence of Plague in human beings in East Anglia, together with the existence of this disease amougst rats, hares, and other rodent animals in that locality, has naturally drawn the attention of the public to the danger arising from this dread disease, which has not been epidemic to this country since 1679. In 1900, and two subsequent years, small outbreaks occurred at Glasgow, and in Liverpool, Cardiff, and Leith during the past 10 years. The widespread existence of Plague throughout the world during the past year, with regular and constant communication by vessels from infected ports, naturally has exposed this country to the risk of the introduction of plague. It has been definitely proved that this disease particularly affects rodent animals, such as rats, mice, hares, rabbits, squirrels, &c., and that it is communicated from the animal to man by means of the fleas, e.g., when an animal dies it becomes cold, its blood no longer circulates and affords sustenance for the fleas, consequently the flea leaves its host and attaches itself to another rodent, or even to man. When a flea requires nourishment it pierces the skin with its pricker, at the same time injecting an irritating acrid fluid which causes the well-known irritation associated with the bite of these insects. If the flea had previously been feeding on the blood of an animal the subject of plague, the stomach would contain numerous plague bacilli in a living condition, by a regurgitation of the stomach contents through the mouth the bacilli being then injected with the saliva or on rhe pricker, or being rubbed into the wound made by the pricker. 18 The danger of the introduction of Plague by means of rats was recognised by your Medical Officer in 1901, and in that year a circular letter was sent to the various shipowners, &c.—this pointed out that "Rats are largely responsible for the conveyance of Plague "—and asked them to co-operate with this Authority in certain measures of precaution which included :—- "The careful observation of any unusual variation in the number or "habits of rats on their vessels, and the presence of any dead rats on "board should be noted and at once reported." "That so fur as practicable all rats on board should be destroyed by "competent rat-catchers and their bodies burned in the ship's furnaces, or "by filling the holds with sulphur di-oxide gas." "The mooring ropes when lying at foreign ports should be fitted with "brushes, futinels, or other guards to prevent rats getting on board," The Dock Companies were also urged to take measures to destroy rats in the docks, and each Sanitary Inspector received instruction to pay especial attention, and to obtain a return of all rats destroyed in the docks and on board vessels. The Dock Companies readily co-operated with this Authority in regard to the destruction of rats, and the numbers killed were reported to the Port Sanitary Committee each month. At this time a virus was discovered which seemed at first sight to be just what was required to efficiently destroy rats. This consisted of a bacillus which could be grown in quantities in suitable media, and when eaten by rats, it was claimed would infect them with a fatal disease which was communicable to other rats, so that an epidemic would break out amongst the rats and cause their complete destruction. Some of this virus was obtained from the discoverer, and it was given a fair trial in a warehouse in one of the docks which was infected by rats, but alas ! anticipations were not realised. The virus spread on bread was eaten readily by the rats, but there was no observable mortality amongst them; and the numbers showed not the slightest sign of diminution. Professor Klein was consulted, and the virus made more virulent; guinea pigs were killed by it, and their bodies when placed in the warehouse were devoured by the rats, but the results were absolutely negative. It was, therefore, decided to rely on the ratcatcher with his traps and chemical poison. Instructions were given in 1905, that vessels from certain ports should be specially visited each day during the discharge of cargo, and the Sanitary Inspector should satisfy himself by inquiry and personal observation, that no dead rats had been discovered on board. 19 In 1907 the regulations of the Local Government Board were issued relative to Plague, Yellow Fever and Cholera, in which for the first time, powers were given to the Port Sanitary Authority to deal with rats on board vessels. The foliowing hand-bill was, therefore, printed in English, French and Spanish, and a copy was handed by the Assistant Medical Officer to the Master of each vessel arriving at Gravesend from a plague suspected port. PORT OF LONDON SANITARY AUTHORITY. The Local Government Board have issued Regulations for the prevention of the introduction of Plague, Yellow Fever and Cholera into this country, and whereas by such Regulations it is provided, inter alia, as follows:— Regulation 24 (2). " The master of a ship which by reason of plague is an infected ship, or " a suspected ship, or which has come from, or has, during the voyage, called " at a port infected with plague, or in which there are rats infected with " plague, or in which there is or has been during the voyage an unusual " mortality among rats, shall, under the direction and to the satisfaction " of the Medical Officer of Health, take all such precautions or employ all " such means for effectually stopping the access of rats from the ship to the " shore as in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health are measures " reasonably necessary for the prevention of danger arising to public health " from the ship ;" This is to give Notice that, in my opinion, given under the Regulation aforesaid, the following precautions are reasonably necessary for stopping the access of rats from the ship to the shore:— 1. All ropes and mooring tackle for securing the vessel either to the shore or mooring buoys, shall be fitted with metal brushes, funnels, or other effective guards, the portions of such ropes and mooring tackle leading from the vessel to a distance from the vessel's side of at least four feet shall be coated each night with fresh tar. Ropes may, if desired, be protected by a covering of canvas or yarns before tarring. 2. When not engaged in discharging cargo, one gangway only shall be permitted to afford means of communication between the ship and the shore. 3. The end of the gangway near the ship shall be whitened for a length of 10 feet, and the watchman shall keep the gangway pulled in board after sunset, or it shall be guarded in some approved manner. 4. When alongside the quay, the ports on the side of the vessel nearest the quay shall be kept closed after sunset. 5. All empty cases and barrels, especially those from the store rooms, shall be examined before being landed, to ensure that no rats are contained therein. 20 6. It is recommended that all possible means be adopted for catching and destroying rats, both on the voyage and during the stay of the vessel in port. Any rats so caught shall be killed, then placed in a bucket of strong disinfecting solution, and afterwards burnt in the ship's furnace. 7. No rats, alive or dead, are to be removed from the ship without my permission in writing. " If any person wilfully neglects or refuses to obey or carry out, or " obstructs the execution of this Regulation, he shall be liable to a " penalty not exceeding ONE HUNDRED POUNDS, and in the case " of a continuing offence, to a further penalty not exceeding FIFTY " POUNDS for every day during which the offence continues." December, 31 st 1907. Herbert Williams, M.D. London, Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London. Office— 51, King William Street, Greenwich, London, s.e.

The bodies of rats which had died from Plague were found in different parts of one of the quays which was over 900 yards long. It was practically confined to rats inhabiting the basement of the warehouses, the floors containing numerous rat holes and runs. On November 11th, 1909, seven dead rats were found underneath some pieces of wood in a warehouse in the South-West India Dock. They were more or less decomposed, but one which had apparently only been dead a few days was examined by Professor Klein, and found to have died from Plague. A thorough search of the warehouses in the dock was made, but no other dead rats were found. TABLE VII. (Plague.) Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official Number. Where from.

"Himalaya," of Greenock, 99,776, left Bombay on August 27th last, and arrived at Tilbury on September 18th. During the voyage there were several cases of Malaria Fever, and one death occurred in a member of the Native crew, who was taken ill on September 9th, and, as certified by the ship's surgeon, died on the 12th, of Cardiac Syncope following malignant Malaria, and was buried at sea between Marseilles and Gibraltar. The vessel left London for Bombay on October 5th. Before sailing, a member of the Native crew, who had been ailing for a week with symptoms of Bronchitis, was sent on shore to do temporary duty in the shore office. 22 Finding he was not fit for work, he was sent to the Branch Seamen's Hospital in the Royal Albert Dock on October 5th, where he was admitted as an in-patient, and he was diagnosed to be suffering with Broncho-pneumonia. He became rapidly worse, and died on the 6th October. A Post-mortem examination was made, and the appearance of the internal organs was very suspicious of Plague. Specimens were submitted to the Local Government Board for examination by Professor Klein, who pronounced that the man had died from Plague. I communicated with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. on October 7th, informing them of the suspicious circumstances, so that warning might be sent to the surgeon of the vessel, but found that the vessel had already left the Thames on October 5th. On arrival at Marseilles, it is stated that three members of the crew had been attacked with Plague (two had died, and during the next twenty-four hours, three other persons were attacked), making seven cases in all, including the case of the man who had died in the Seamen's Hospital. The vessel subsequently arrived at Port Said and entered the Suez Canal, all persons on board being well, but three cases were landed at Aden, and a further case occurred between Aden and Bombay, making eleven cases in all. It was subsequently ascertained that several dead rats had been found in one of the holds, the mortality being ascribed to the eating of a certain bean which formed part of the cargo. The s.s. " Oceana," of Belfast, 93,170, left Bombay on September 10th, 1910, arriving at Gravesend on October 2nd, and proceeded to Tilbury Dock. Several cases of Malaria had occurred during the voyage, and one man, on arrival at Gravesend, was found suffering from Pneumonia. He was examined by the Medical Officer on duty, who pronounced the case to be not of an infectious character, and the man was allowed to proceed with the vessel into . dock, where he subsequently recovered. On October 5th, a member of the Lascar crew complained of fever, for which he was treated. On the 7th, he was found to have a bubo which Dr. Willoughby reported to me as suspicious, and I directed him to remove the case to Denton Hospital for observation. The bubo was incised and a specimen of the fluid sent to the Local Government Board for examination by Professor Klein, who reported that the case was one of Bubonic Plague. I ordered the vessel to be removed from the Tilbury Dock into the river and moored at one of the buoys. 23 The crew and their effects were thoroughly disinfected, and the vessel was fumigated throughout with sulphur di-oxide gas, and large numbers of rats were destroyed. I arranged for the crew to be kept daily under medical observation, and for any suspicious case to be at once reported to me, but nothing even of a suspicious character occurred. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. have since appointed a Medical Officer permanently for dock duty ; he visits each ship daily, examines and treats the sick, and furnishes me with a daily certificate, especially mentioning whether any dead rats have been found on board. In the event of any case of illness presenting suspicious symptoms, he will telephone direct to me, and I shall proceed to the vessel and see the case with him and remove it to hospital for observation, if necessary. On October 31st, the body of a recently dead rat was discovered in the grounds of the Seamen's Hospital in the Royal Albert Dock, examination revealed Post-mortem appearances of Plague, and on further detailed examination by Professor Klein, this diagnosis was confirmed. On November 1st, a dead rat was found outside the Hospital grounds, and bacteriological examination was also positive as regards Plague. On November 3rd, another dead rat was found, some 300 yards away on the banks, this also was positive. The number of rats examined up to the end of the year was 199, but only the three above mentioned were found affected ; the outbreak was, therefore, a very small one, and as it was found early, the measures of precaution taken appear to have been successful. The recurrence of Plague in the summer months for three years in succession indicates that especial vigilance is necessary at that time of the year in the future. Arrangements have been made for a bacteriological examination of dead rats, so that Plague may not occur amongst the rats unknown to me. PLAGUE HAVING OCCURRED AMONGST THE RATS IN THE DISTRICT FOR THREE YEARS IN SUCCESSION, AND having regard to the importance to maritime commerce of keeping London free from infection, the precautions with regard to rats have been carefully revised. The Inspectors were instructed to visit daily each vessel arriving from a Plague infected port. Each Sanitary Inspector receives by first post every morning a return of the arrivals of vessels at Gravesend. Each vessel 24 is marked by the Assistant Medical Officer accordingly as it arrives from a port where Plague, Yellow Fever or Cholera exists, so that the Sanitary Inspector may know and act accordingly. He was also to make enquiries and personal search in his district for the presence of dead rats. The facts with regard to the rat plague were reported to the Port of London Authority, and they were asked to :— 1. Destroy as many as possible of the rats in the docks : the same to be disposed of by burning. 2. Daily search for dead rats : utilising, if possible, the same men whose names and addresses were furnished to me, paying especial attention to the warehouses, spaces between, and also the banks. 3. All accumulation of dunnage, rubbish, &c., to be collected and burnt. 4. The disposal of refuse on the banks to be discontinued and a ' destructor ' provided. 5. Ingress of rats to buildings should be. dealt with by having the floors laid on concrete, and if buildings are not constructed of iron, a piece of iron sheeting should be fitted round the lower part of the building quite close to the concrete and extending into the ground for at least two feet. 6. The primitive nature of the sanitary conveniences was again alluded to, these being undermined with rat runs. I had a conversation with the Dock Manager on the subject, and he assured me the question of providing better sanitary conveniences was receiving the special attention of the Authority. At the same time he gave a copy of some draft Bye-laws which thev were submitting for the sanction of the Board of Trade. These when sanctioned will supplement and support the Port Sanitary Authority in dealing with the passage of rats between the ships and the shore. The Bye-laws are as follows :— PORT OF LONDON AUTHORITY. Bye-laws for the prevention of an outbreak of Plague amongst rats in the Docks. " 1. All rope and mooring tackle for securing any vessel, either to " the shore or to mooring buoys, shall be fitted with such effective guards " as will prevent access of rats from the vessel to the shore. For any " breach of this Bye-law the master of the vessel shall be liable to a " penalty not exceeding 5l. 25 " 2. All possible means shall be adopted for catching and destroying " rats during the stay of any vessel in dock. All empty cases and barrels " shall be examined before being landed to ensure that no rats are " contained therein. Any rats caught onboard the vessel shall be killed, " then placed in a bucket of strong disinfecting solution, and afterwards " burnt in the vessel's furnace. No rats, alive or dead, shall be removed " from the vessel. For any breach of this Bye-law the master of the vessel " shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding 5l. '' 3. When the discharge of cargo or the landing or embarking of passengers is not proceeding, one gangway only shall be permitted to " afford means of communication between the vessel and the shore. " The end of the gangway near the vessel shall be whitened for a length " of 10 feet. For any breach of this Bye-law the master of the vessel " shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding 51.

" I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that, in " consequence of the occurrence of cases of Plague in rats in certain " parts of England, they have deemed it desirable to confer upon local " authorities in England and Wales, powers Avith regard to the destruc" tion of rats in districts where Plague in rats is present or suspected, " or in which there is an unusual mortality among rats. 28 " The Board have accordingly, in pursuance of their powers for the " prevention of epidemic diseases, issued an Order, copies of which are " enclosed, authorising the local authority to take measures for the " destruction of rats and for preventing their entrance into buildings and " other premises. " The Board are glad to learn that in many localities active steps are " being taken by owners and occupiers for the extermination of rats. " They trust that these steps will not be abated, and that all individuals " will do their utmost to co-operate with and assist the local authorities " in carrying out the Regulations. " The Order refers not only to the destruction of rats but to the " prevention of their entrance into buildings and other premises. " Inasmuch as the . risk of infection from Plague-stricken rats arises " mainly through fleas, it is obviously to the interest of all persons to do " what they can to prevent their entry into dwellings, and to remove " from the proximity of dwellings accumulations of material or rubbish " which may harbour them. In this way as well as by action by the " local authority under the Regulations, much may be done to further " the object in view. Copies of a Memorandum on Plague which has " been prepared by the Board's Medical Officer will be forwarded in " a day or two." " Memorandum. " Article I.—The expression " Distinct" means the district of a " local authority. " Article II.—In any district in which a representation is made to " the local authority, that rats in the district are infected or threatened " with Plague, or that there is an unusual mortality among rats in the " district, the local authority shall report the matter to us, and shall " take measures :— " (a) for the destruction of all rats in the district ; and " (6) for preventing the entrance of rats into buildings and other " premises in the district. " Article III.—For the purposes of these Regulations the local " authority may appoint such additional officers or servants as they may " deem necessary, and may delegate to such officers or servants any " powers under these Regulations. " Article IV.—The expenses incurred by a local authority in the " execution of these Regulations, shall be defrayed by the local authority " as part of their expenses in the execution of the Public Health " (London) Act, 1891." 29 The powers possessed by the Port of London Sanitary Authority to destroy rats within their district are :— " (1) On ships under the Regulations as to Cholera, Yellow Fever " and Plague, dated 9th September, 1907 ; and " (2) On shore premises under the Order of the Local Government " Board, dated November 10th, 1910." (1) On ships. A ship "infected" with Plague is where a case of Plague has occurred on board a vessel within seven days of arrival. A " suspected " ship is where Plague has occurred on board either in the port of departure or during the voyage, but not within seven days of arrival. " Article XXIII.—The master of a ship certified to be an "infected" " ship by reason of Plague, shall under the direction and to the satis" faction of the Medical Officer of Health, and at and within such time " as the Medical Officer of Health, by requisition in writing addressed to " the master, prescribes, employ suitable means for the effectual " destruction of rats in the ship." The master of a ship certified to be a "suspected" ship by reason of Plague shall, if the Medical Officer of Health makes requisition to that effect, employ by and under the direction and to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, and at and within such time as the Medical Officer of Health by his requisition prescribes, suitable means for the effectual destruction of rats in the ship. " Article XXIY.—Where the Medical Officer of Health certifies " in writing that a rat in the ship is infected with Plague, the master of " the ship shall employ suitable means for the effectual destruction of the " rats in the ship." Where the Medical Officer of Health is satisfied, and certifies in writing, that as a precaution against the introduction or threaten of Plague, the master of a ship, which though not infected or suspected by reason of Plague, has come from or has during the voyage called at a port infected with Plague, shall at such time as the Medical Officer of Health by his certificate prescribes, employ suitable means for the effectual destruction of rats in the ship. The cost of destroying rats on board an "infected " or " suspected" ship, and where rats are found on board infected with Plague, is to be borne by the master of the ship. In the third instance where the ship is not "infected" or "suspected " but has only come from a Plague-infected port, the expenses have to be paid by th 2 Port of London Sanitary Authority. 30 " (2) Shore premises.—In any district in which representation is " made to the local authority, that rats in the district are infected or " suspected with Plague, so that there is unusual mortality among rats " in the district, the local authority shall report the matter to the Local " Government Board, and shall take measures :— " (a) for the destruction of all rats in the district ; and " (b) for preventing the ingress of rats into buildings and other " premises in the district." The barge " Thomas " with fumigating plant is in good working order, and is likely to be used more regularly for the fumigation of vessels with regard to the destruction of rats, so that vessels may comply with the Regulations of the Commonwealth Government and save themselves the inconvenience and expense of being fumigated on arrival at the port of destination. The Dock Authorities and the shipowners "are co-operating with this Authority in the work of the destruction of rats. The following experiment was carried out in one of the docks :— November 6th.—A healthy rat was caught and fed on bread covered with a much advertised virus, and then placed in a cage with eight other healthy live rats. This rat died on November 18th ; but the others remained alive and healthy until December 18th, on which date they were fed with ½lb. tin of virus. One died on December 29th, and was partially eaten by her companions. December 30th.—The remainder were fed on another ½lb. tin of virus, but remained alive and well until January 9th, 1911, when they were destroyed. The experiment shows that the use of virus cannot be relied on. The Local Government Board have issued a memorandum on Plague, making certain recommendations as follows :— I. Persistently and Systematically destroy all Rats. Owing to the natural fecundity of the female rat and the early age at which they begin to breed, this is impossible. They have several litters during the year, each litter comprising from six to fourteen young. The Board of Agriculture state, in a leaflet recently issued, that in India where rats breed all the year round, the offspring of a single pair would, if supplied with sufficient food and left unchecked, amount at the end of one year to 35,000. Such favourable conditions are fortunately not present in this country. The Port of London Authority have appointed professional rat-catchers for each of their docks. Traps and chemical poisons are chiefly employed. 31 II. Remove and Obliterate their Nests, Burrows and Habitual Haunts. III. Make each Dwelling, as far as practicable, Rat-proof, and remove all known harbourage for Rats in or near Dwellings. The Port Authority have been urged to make their buildings ratproof by laying the floors on concrete ; and where they are not constructed of iron to sheath the lower part of the building with sheet iron, which should extend for two feet into the ground to prevent them burrowing. IV. At the same time do not allow Waste Food (whether for Human Beings, Chickens or other Animals) to accumulate in or about the house. The dock warehouses always contain abundance of food for rats. This naturally attracts them, so that it is not possible to observe this precaution in the docks of the Port of London. 32 TABLE IX. General Return of Rats caught and destroyed during 1910.

The captain of the vessel informed the Inspector that he had been in communication with his Board, and under his instructions he did not feel justified in giving any further particulars without instructions from the Board. I also learned that several cases of Scarlet Fever occurred on the vessel during 1909, which were not notified to me. The matter was referred to Mr. Solicitor, and after some correspondence, and under the threat of legal proceedings, the Board gave instructions for dangerous infectious diseases to be notified to me as required by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 37 TABLE XV.

I give particulars of these cases, and also the history of Small-pox on a barge showing how this disease is conveyed from point to point by means of " contacts." 38 The s.s. " Highland Rover," of London, Official Number 129,067, from Buenos Ayres, arrived at Gravesend and reported a case of Small-pox on board. The patient, a first-class passenger, was taken ill on the 23rd June, and the rash appeared on the 24th. The patient was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton with his bedding and effects. The necessary disinfection of the vessel was carried out, and the names and addresses of all the passengers and those members of the crew who left the vessel in London were notified to the medical officers of health of the districts to which they were proceeding, and those remaining on board were kept under daily observation while in London. Vaccination was offered to the passengers and crew, and refused. The s.s. "India," of Greenock, Official Number 105,572, from Bombay, arrived at Gravesend on the 5th February, when the Master reported having landed a case of Small-pox at Marseilles on the 29th January. The names and addresses of all the passengers and members of the crew who left the ship in London were taken and notified to the medical officers of health for the districts to which they were proceeding. The s.s. " Caledonia," of Greenock, Official Number 102,390, from Bombay, arrived at Gravesend on the 18th March. On the 27th February, a first-class passenger complained to the surgeon of feeling unwell ; he had been ailing for one or two days before. On examination he was found to be suffering from Small-pox, and was at once isolated, and landed at Aden on the 2nd March. On the 13th March, one of the second saloon stewardesses complained to the surgeon, and on the 14th a rash came out on the face and forehead. The patient was isolated, and on arrival of the vessel at Gravesend the surgeon reported the case as one of Chicken-pox. On examination by the Boarding Medical Officer, the patient was found to be suffering from a very mild form of Small-pox, and was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton. I saw the patient, and agreed that the case was one of Small-pox. It is always difficult to diagnose very mild cases of Small-pox from Chicken-pox unless one has had considerable experience, and it was with a view to detecting such cases that Chicken-pox was made a notifiable disease by your Worshipful Committee. The infected quarters were disinfected, the names and addresses of all persons landing in London were taken and notified to the medical officers of health of the respective districts to which they were proceeding. On the 19th February, I received information from the Medical Officer of Health for Grays, Essex, that he had removed a case of Small-pox to hospital from the barge " Whitwell," of London, 45,338, lying in the River Thames off Grays. The patient was master of the barge " Atlantic," of London, lying in Margate Harbour. The barge " Whitwell," 39 o£ London, of which the patient's father is master, was also lying there. The patient visited his father on board the latter's barge, and remained on board until the arrival of that barge off Grays on the 18th February. The master of the " Whitwell " and temporary master of the " Atlantic " were vaccinated, the other members of the crews refusing. Both the barges were disinfected by this Authority, and the crews, all of whom reside in Grays, were kept under observation by the medical officer of health for that district. On the 4th March it was reported to me that the mate of the barge " Whitwell," of London, 45,338, had been removed to hospital at Margate on the 2nd March, suffering from Small-pox. The master of the barge " Atlantic " of London, was removed from the barge " Whitwell " at Grays on the 19th February, suffering from Small-pox. The mate of the barge had been occupying the same cabin as the patient, but obstinately refused to be vaccinated. He ailed on the 1st March at Margate, and was removed to hospital there, suffering from the same disease, together with a boatman who had been in attendance on the barge. The mother of the mate of the barge " Whitwell " also contracted the disease. TABLE XVI. (Small-pox.) Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official Number. Where from. No. of Cases.

The authority now possesses two disinfecting machines ; one for fumigating the holds and interior parts of vessels, and the Washington Lyons steam disinfector for bedding and effects at Denton Hospital. For fumigating the holds of vessels, a special apparatus has been in use on several occasions. It has been used in each case for the destruction of rats, and with remarkable success where these existed ; and arrangements have been entered into with certain shipowners for the regular fumigation of their vessels. The total number of vessels disinfected on account of infectious disease during the year was 91, whilst the steam apparatus was in use 74 times for disinfecting 79 different lots of effects. • TABLE XXL Vessels and Premises Disinfected, from 1st January to 31st December, 1910.

IMPORTATION OF PIG CARCASSES, &c., FROM CHINA. The s.s. "Graf Muravjef" arrived in the River Thames on the 18th January, 1910, and moored at Greenwich Buoys. The vessel came originally from Siberian ports, where she had been collecting salmon, called at Shanghai, and there shipped amongst other cargo 3,647 pig carcasses for London. These were stated to have been bred in the country district of Hainan (some 300 miles above Hankow), transported down the river to Hankow, there killed, frozen and conveyed to Shanghai for transport to London. On arrival in the Port of London, some of the pig carcasses were examined by your Medical Officer, when it was found that the backbones of the carcasses had been removed, and that they were not accompanied by any official certificate approved by the Local Government Board. The Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908, require that in the case of the edible parts of the pig imported into this country in a fresh or frozen condition, they shall be imported either under official certificate, or in the form of the entire carcass of the pig with the head in its natural state of attachment to the carcass, and with the lymphatic glands about the throat, or any other part of the carcass in their natural position. The Local Government Board's Circular (Foreign Meat) No. 2, dated 12th December, 1908, states that:— "The carcasses of pigs which are not imported whole, with the head in "its natural state of attachment, and with lymphatic glands about the "throat and elsewhere in situ, come under the category of the Foreign "Meat, Class II. Carcasses which the Medical Officer of Health ascertains "to belong to this class are required to be dealt with by Notice, forbidding "their removal for any purpose other than exportation, as in the case of "Foreign Meat, Class I." The carcasses clearly came within the meaning of the Foreign Meat of Class I., inasmuch as:— (1) They were not imported under an official certificate approved by the Local Government Board. (2) They were not imported whole. Your Medical Officer, therefore, had no option but to serve a Notice upon the importers, forbidding the removal of the carcasses for any purpose other than exportation, in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Foreign Meat Regulations. 47 In addition to the pig carcasses, there were 65 cases described as "pig's bungs." These proved to be portions of the intestines of pigs, and it was stated that they were imported solely for the purpose of being used as sausage skins. On examination, many of them, although they had been turned inside out and scraped, were found to be studded with numerous small ulcers. These ulcers were the usual signs found in the intestines of pigs suffering from Swine Fever:— Some of these "bungs" were sent to Sir J. Macfadyean, M.R.C.V.S., for examination, and he reported thereon as follows:— "The parts sent are apparently the rectum and part of the colon which "have been turned inside out. It is, as you will understand, difficult to "give a perfectly certain opinion as to the nature of the lesions owing "to the fact that the mucous membrane has apparently been not only "washed but also scraped. I can only say that the lesions have exactly "the appearance that I should expect Swine Fever ulcers to show in a "piece of intestine that has been so treated. I have no doubt that the "lesions are Swine Fever ulcers." A Notice, forbidding the removal of these goods for any purpose other than exportation, was also served upon the importers under Article V of the Foreign Meat Regulations. Your Medical Officer also wrote to the importers as follows:— "January 20th, 1910. "3,647 Pig Carcasses on board the s.s. "Graf Muravjef," lying off "Greenwich. "I have carefully examined several pig carcasses on board the s.s. " 'Graf M\iravjef,' which I am informed are typical of the whole "consignment. "These pig carcasses do not comply with the requirements of the "Foreign Meat Regulations, and I, therefore, have to serve you with a "Notice in accordance with Article V thereof. "These Regulations provide by Article XVII that with regard to "anything done under these Regulations, the difference may, on the "application of the parties affected, be referred to the Local "Government Board for determination. "For my part, I am willing that such application should be made, "and if you decide to do this, I suggest that the application be made "forthwith. "Your obedient Servant, (Signed) "HERBERT WILLIAMS, "Medical Officer of Health, Port of London" 48 The importers wrote to the Local Government Board on the subject, and the Local Government Board communicated with your Medical Officer as follows:— "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W. "22nd January, 1910. "I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your "letter of the 21st inst., addressed to Dr. Buchanan, and to forward for "your information the enclosed copy of a letter from Messrs. Vestey "Brothers, of Nos. 13-16, West Smithfield, together with a copy of the "Board's reply. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, (Signed) "F. J. WILLIS, "Assistant Secretary." "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W. "22nd January, 1910. "Gentlemen, "I am directed by the Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letters "of the 20th and 21st instant with reference to the action of the Medical "Officer of Health for the Port of London Sanitary District in regard to "a consignment of pig carcasses from China per the s.s. ' Graf Muravjef.' "In reply I am to state that, as the Board understand, the carcasses "have had the backbone removed, the Board could not regard them as "coming under any other category of the Public Health (Foreign Meat) "Amending Regulations, 1909, than that of 'Foreign Meat of Class I,' "and thus endorse the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health. "Under the circumstances, the Board doubt whether there could be "any advantage in any formal steps being taken under Article XVII of "the Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908, for the "determination of the difference on the subject. "I am, Gentlemen, "Your obedient Servant, (Signed) "F. J. WILLIS,. "Assistant Secretary. "Messrs. Vestey, Bros." The importers applied to your Medical Officer for permission to remove 100 of the pig carcasses from the vessel to the Victoria Dock Refrigerator for a special purpose. This was sanctioned on the understanding that the carcasses were not to be removed without the permission of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. 49 The s.s. "Peshawur" arrived from Hankow in the Royal Albert Dock on the 27th January with 2,621 pig carcasses and 52 packages of "pigs' bungs" on board. It was stated that about 800 of the carcasses were in the form of the entire carcass of the pig, and as such would have been allowed to land, provided that on detailed examination they were found to comply with the requirements of the Foreign Meat Regulations, but the importers decided to export them. The remainder of the carcasses were not imported under an official certificate approved by the Local Government Board, and were without the backbone (as in the case of the pig carcasses in the s.s. "Graf Muravjef)," and therefore came within the category of the Foreign Meat of Class I. A notice was accordingly served upon the importers, under Article V. of the Foreign Meat Regulations, forbidding the removal of the carcasses for any purpose other than exportation. An examination of some of the "pigs' bungs" disclosed the fact that many of them presented the intestinal lesions of Swine Fever. A Notice was served upon the importers requiring the exportation of these also. The pig carcasses and the casks of "pigs' bungs" on the s.s. "Peshawur" were transferred to the s.s. "Graf Muravjef," and both the consignments of pig carcasses and casks of "pigs' bungs" sailed from London in the latter vessel. I ascertained that the destination of the vessel was Liverpool, and particulars of the consignments were, therefore, forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health for that Port. During the latter part of the year, pig carcasses from France were despatched, via Ostend, and arrived in the Tilbury Dock. As these carcasses did not bear the official certificate of the Belgian Government, approved by the Local Government Board, each carcass had to be carefully examined. The total number of carcasses which arrived was 425; of these, three were found to be affected with tuberculosis, and were seized and destroyed. Two were without the lymphatic glands about the throat, and were exported in accordance with the requirements of the Foreign Meat Regulations. 50 ONCHOCERCIASIS IN IMPORTED MEAT. In the beginning of the year it was found that the fore-quarters of frozen meat arriving from Australia contained round, yellowish masses which were found to contain a parasitic worm commonly known as Spiroptera Reticulata. When the first consignment was examined, it was thought that this parasite existed only on the surface, but a more careful examination of subsequent consignments revealed the fact that it was also to be found embedded in the deeper connective tissues, especially on the flanks and briskets. The practice was adopted of removing the flank or brisket, or both, according as worms were found in either part, or in both. The quantity of frozen beef coming from Australia during the past year has far exceeded that of previous years, and some idea, therefore, may be formed of the additional work which for some months was placed upon the inspecting staff of this Authority, when it was realised that practically every fore-quarter had to be examined, and the affected parts cut away, under supervision. It was found possible to allow a certain number of these quarters to proceed to stores situated within the jurisdiction of the City of London and the four Metropolitan Boroughs in respect of which an order had been made by the Local Government Board requiring joint action by the Port of London Sanitary Authority and the Sanitary Authorities respectively under the Unsound Food and Foreign Meat Regulations. This also necessitated a large amount of correspondence, the checking and tracing of large importations of meat, also the serving of Notices and Certificates in order to comply with the requirements of the Regulations, the effect being that when a consignment of beef was allowed to go into one of these areas, the service of a Notice made the Regulations applicable within those areas in the same manner as if the beef had been landed within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. A meeting of the chief importers concerned with the Australian beef led to the decision that they would, for the future, have the flanks and briskets cut off in Australia ; and with regard to those quarters on the way or in the store, they would also have the flank and brisket cut off and handed over to the Sanitary Authority for destruction. That this was necessary may be judged by the fact that on a minute examination by cutting up a number of flanks and briskets it was found that the percentage of those affected was in many cases over 80 per cent., and in some cases reached 100 per cent. 51 The hind-quarters, on careful examination, were also found to be affected chiefly in the vicinity of the stifle or knee-joint, and a few scattered nodules on the surface of the meat. The percentage found affected is also very high, as will be seen from the following examination of the consignments from only two vessels:— Of 4,617 hind-quarters examined, 2,839 or 61.49 per cent. were found to contain the parasite Spiroptera Reticulata. Of 805 hind-quarters examined, 564 or 70 per cent. were found to be affected. In consequence it has been found necessary to examine each hind-quarter of Australian beef, and to remove any worms together with the tissues surrounding them. An inspector working eight hours per day can examine and supervise the removal of worms from 200-250 hind-quarters per day. Many vessels arrive with between 6,000-7,000 hind-quarters on board for London, so some idea may be formed of the time which has been occupied by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with the importation of beef from Australia. Under the Local Government Board's order for joint action referred to, it has been possible to allow large numbers of hind-quarters to go into the Sanitary areas for examination, otherwise the Port Sanitary Staff would have had to be much increased in order to inspect the consignments arriving. The worm in the hind-quarters is generally situated deeply, requiring considerable cutting in order to find the worm, and when found, to ensure that the whole of the worm with the surrounding tissues, has been removed. A report has been issued by the Local Government Board, by Dr. MacFadden and Dr. Leiper. They were provided with specimens by the Food Inspectors of the Port of London, for examination. In their opinion the worm is incapable of developing within the human body, but there can be no question that the worm with the meat in the immediate vicinity, is quite unfit for human food. I am informed that the Commonwealth of Australia have instituted a rigorous system of inspection of beef for export, and that in future all flanks and briskets from fore-quarters will be cut off before being allowed to leave the country, and if this be done it will considerably lessen the work of the Officers of this Authority in connection with this importation. It will, however, be necessary to examine salt beef and perhaps tinned meat, to ensure that the flanks and briskets when removed are not exported to this country under those forms. Dr. Leiper's conclusions are as follows:— (1) The parasitic nodules in Australian beef are, without exception, due to the presence of long thread-like worms of the genus Onchocerca, 52 (2) The diseased condition, Onchocerciasis, is not peculiar to Australian cattle, but occurs also in other animals and in various parts of the world, including the United States of America. (3) The parasites belong to a group of worms that require to be taken up by a biting insect, and to undergo a certain degree of development therein before they can be transmitted to another warmblooded animal. (4) The worms and their young do not appear to be capable of surviving for more than a few hours the death of the cattle. No evidence of vitality of the worm or its embryo has been met with in the case of Australian beef reaching this country. (5) From (3) and (4) above, it follows that the direct development of the parasite in man as a result of eating the affected meat is impossible. (6) The nodules are the product of changes taking place in the tissues as a result of some acrid toxin excreted by the worms. In my opinion their presence in meat intended for human consumption is undesirable for this reason. Dr. Leiper considers it important not to minimise the objections, which must on other grounds be taken to meat affected by this parasite. Certain parasites present in meat food are of a dangerous communicable character, and it would be very undesirable to encourage any attitude of indifference towards the presence of any parasitic conditions in meat. There can, moreover, be no question that meat affected by Onchocerciasis must be classed as "unsound"; both the worms and the local inflammatory products which result from this invasion are foreign to sound meat, and are objectionable to the meat consumer. I append herewith a copy of a report, which has been forwarded to me by the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Australia:— Uniformity of Standard in respect of Carcase Meat for Export. The Conditions under which Briskets might be allowed to be Exported. As regards the disposal of Briskets we consider that any Brisket (from a carcase passed as otherwise free from disease) proved by searching examination on the lines indicated below to contain no worm nests, should be approved for corning or canning for export. While any Brisket (from a carcase otherwise free from disease) in which, after searching examination, three or four nodules only have been found might reasonably be approved for corning or canning after complete removal of the part containing the nodules, we consider that as a matter of policy it may be advisable, in view of the present ferment of opinion in Great Britain, none of those Briskets should be allowed to be treated for export. The position in this regard should, however, be reviewed in twelve months. 53 The recommendation regarding clean Briskets is conditional on the Brisket being boned and sliced under the control and supervision of the Inspecting Officer, who should, if necessary, be empowered to fix the hours for the handling of all Briskets. It may not be out of place to indicate our opinion that there is no difficulty with proper inspection in removing all nodules from the finely sliced Briskets. It may also be pointed out with regard to the worm nests that though they may be confused with tubercular lesions by inexperienced Inspectors, they are of much less importance, as they are mainly objectionable owing to their unsightliness. There would, in our opinion, be no danger to man from their presence in meat. (Signed) J. A. Gilruth. J. Douglas Stewart. W. Perrin Norris. It may be true that there is no danger to man from the presence of these parasites in meat, but I feel very strongly that only perfectly sound meat, free from any disease or parasite, should be sold for human consumption, and I hope the Colonial Authorities, if only in the interest of their meat trade, will decide that none of these flanks and briskets shall be sent to this country in any shape or form for human food. The presence of the parasite in Australian beef has been known for 18 years under the name of "worm nests" or "worm kernels," Dr. Gibson, of New South Wales, having described them in 1892 ; and it had been the practice of these nodules to be removed by the butchers when dressing the carcass, probably only those on the surface would be noticed and removed, which would account for the time which elapsed before it was found in the meat on its arrival in this country. It has not been the practice to cut up quarters of beef without reason or suspicion, as it would have meant considerable loss to the importer had the results of the examination not justified the procedure. DISEASED OX-LIVERS. In my Report for the year 1909, reference was made to large numbers of ox-livers which had been found, on examination, to be diseased. During the past year the total number of diseased ox-livers found was only* 1,389, and of these 846 came from the Argentine Republic and 543 from Australia. 54 This should not be taken to indicate that the ox-livers imported during the past year have been less affected with disease, inasmuch as very few consignments have been landed in the Port of London. In the case of some of the consignments which where landed, the results of the examinations were as follows:— Name of vessel. Where from. Number of diseased livers found. Percentage of consignment. "Guardiana" Argentina 127 — "El Argentine)" „ 348 36.06 "Amiral Jaureguiberry" „ 55 18.3 "Amiral Troude" „ 122 12.76 "Star of Ireland" „ 186 66.42 "Durham" Australia 6 25 "Suffolk" „ 38 33.3 "Durham" „ 499 28.40 Many vessels which previously brought consignments of ox-livers consigned to London, have during the past year arrived with these goods on board, but consigned to some other port or ports in the United Kingdom. Whenever it has been known to your Medical Officer that such goods were on board a vessel sailing from London for another port in the United Kingdom, the information has been forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health for the port concerned. UNSOUND COFFEE. On the 31st May, the s.s. "Emerald" arrived in the East India Dock, having on board a large quantity of coffee beans, salved from the s.s. "Minnehaha," which was stranded on the Scilly Isles in the previous month. The coffee was more or less saturated with sea water and heated. Your Medical Officer communicated with the underwriters, who asked to be allowed to take the coffee to Ipswich, where there were better facilities for dealing with a large quantity than in London. Accordingly permission was given for about 337 tons to be taken to Ipswich to be dried and dealt with under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health for Ipswich. That which remained in London was dried and garbled, with the result that about 568 bags, and tons of loose coffee was set aside as unfit for human food, and was seized by one of your Food Inspectors. The owners were given the opportunity of dealing with this for the extraction of caffeine, provided such extraction was carried out in this country under proper supervision. 55 The owners wished to export the coffee for the extraction of caffeine, or to be used as manure. Much correspondence ensued, and as no satisfactory arrangement could be arrived at, an application, supported by Mr. T. Gr. Vickery, the Assistant Solicitor, was made on the 27th September, before Mr. Dickenson, at the Thames Police Court, to condemn and order the destruction of the coffee (about 36 tons), lying in the East India Dock, The Assistant Solicitor asked for the condemnation of the coffee if the magistrate was satisfied it was unsound and unwholesome, and in the absence of proof that it was not intended for human consumption. Inspector Spadaccini gave evidence of the deposit of the coffee in the dock for sale—that it was intended for human consumption—and as it was unsound, unwholesome and totally unfit for human consumption, he seized it. He produced a sample. Your Medical Officer stated that when he inspected the coffee it was covered with mould, heated, fermenting, and burning black, and that in his opinion it was quite unfit for human consumption. If the coffee was exported it might come back to this country in another form. The Solicitor for the defence contended that the coffee was never intended for human consumption, and under those circumstances could not be condemned. The owner of the coffee stated that he considered it absolutely unfit for the food of man, but before he purchased it he thought some of it was fit for human consumption. He had attempted to sell the coffee for shipment to the Continent, both for caffeine and manure. He had been offered 45s. a ton for it as manure and 60s. a ton as coffee. The price of coffee for human consumption was from 40l. to 45l. a ton. He gave the name of a firm in Mannheim, Germany, as the buyers of the coffee, and stated he was prepared to mix 5 per cent. of slaked lime with the coffee. Your Medical Officer stated that five years ago the owner of this coffee purchased a large quantity of coffee beans (which had been seized as unfit for human food) and having mixed 5 per cent. of slaked limed with it and furnished your Medical Officer with written guarantees that it should not be used for human food, he was allowed to ship it to Antwerp, where it was sold to a merchant, 56 who established special installations, and the coffee was cleansed, sifted, sorted, washed, dried and roasted, and there was no doubt that it was subsequently sold for human consumption. The expensive process to which it had been subjected was quite unnecessary if the beans had been used as manure or the extraction of caffeine. Having listened to the whole of the evidence the Magistrate decided that the coffee was unsound and unfit for human consumption, and that there was an absence of proof that the coffee was not intended for sale as human food. He therefore condemned the coffee, and ordered it to be disposed of under the supervision of the Medical of Health by such means and in such a manner as to prevent it being used for human consumption. It was eventually destroyed, with the approval of His Majesty's Customs, by shooting it on a mud field and burying it. FOOD INSPECTION AT QUEEN BOROUGH. The inspection of foodstuffs arriving at Queenborough from Flushing has been carried out by Dr. E. Y. Legge, with the assistance of a Food Inspector sent down occasionally. The importations consist chiefly of fresh meat— pork, veal and offal. The pig carcasses had affixed the official certificate of the Netherlands Government as approved by the Local Government Board, and it has been usual to examine a percentage of the carcasses arriving to see that they bear the official certificate, and also to examine the glands about the throat to see that they have not been removed and show no signs of disease, only occasionally a carcass is found in which the presence of tuberculosis has escaped the observation of the veterinary inspector in Holland. The offal, on the other hand, has received special attention, especially when it bore the label of certain slaughterhouses in Holland, where apparently the inspection was not so rigorous as could be desired. All offal showing signs of disease was seized and destroyed, and as a result the condition has considerably improved. The total amount of offal seized as unfit for food and destroyed during the year was about 32 cwts. 57 TABLE XXVI. PUBLIC HEALTH (FOREIGN MEAT) REGULATIONS, 1908.

It will be seen that these number no less than 3,911, of which 3,523 were on vessels, 387 on shore premises, and 1 related to the river. Of the general nuisances on vessels, and also on shore, the largest number related to general dirty, insanitary conditions arising from neglect. In the majority of cases a nuisance of this kind is remedied as soon as official notice is taken of the matter. Other nuisances involving a certain amount of structural alteration, were found on 240 vessels, and 29 different premises on shore. These involved the sending of 423 written intimations, the majority of which were successful in securing abatement of the nuisance. The total number of vessels and premises on which nuisances were thus reported as having been carried out was 280; this number including a certain number of arrears from the previous year. The one nuisance relating to the river was with reference to the discharge of foul liquid into the river water, and was abated without legal proceedings. Legal proceedings were recommended in seven cases, but only became necessary in two, in both of which a conviction was obtained. (See Table XXXIII.) For the past six months barges have been in the habit of loading bones, &c., in Limekiln Creek. These bones, &c., are generally in a very offensive condition, and the process of loading into barges causes much annoyance to the inhabitants, &c., in the vicinity of the Creek. The locality has been kept under observation with a view to seeing that the Bye-laws relating to the carriage of offensive cargoes have been complied with. These require that:— " Every person who shall load or carry to any ship, boat or vessel within the district of the Port Sanitary Authority any dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or other matter or thing liable to become offensive or to cause a nuisance if exposed to the open air, shall, except while actually engaged in loading or discharging the same, at all times, keep such dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or 67 other such matter or thing, properly and securely covered so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom, and no such dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or other such matter or thing shall be loaded above the coamings or hatches of any such ship, boat, or vessel." And further that:— "Where, for the purposes of removal within, or carriage through, the district of the Port Sanitary Authority any cargo, load, or collection of fœcal or offensive matter or liquid has been put into or upon any ship, boat, or vessel, the owner or consignee, or any person who has undertaken to deliver such cargo, load, or collection, or who is in charge o£ the same, or of such ship, boat, or vessel, shall not without a reasonable excuse permit or allow or cause such ship, boat, or vessel containing such cargo, load, or collection, or any undischarged portion thereof, to remain within the said district for a longer period than 48 hours." The locality was kept under close observation, and there was no doubt that some nuisance was caused to the persons in the vicinity during the actual discharge of the bones, &c., from the cart into the barge. It was not possible to take any further action so long as the barges were kept covered when not actually engaged in receiving bones, and did not remain unnecessarily long in the creek. The person concerned in the trade undertook to do this, and I have had no further complaints. It is probable, however, that during warm weather the nuisance will be more noticeable. For some years past the Thames Conservators have been corresponding with the Gravesend Corporation in respect of the discharge of crude sewage into the Thames from several houses in that town, and ultimately a notice was served under Section 94 of the Thames Conservancy Act, 1894, requiring the pollution to be discontinued. The facts were that crude sewage flowed into the River Thames from a sewer which was vested in the Gravesend Corporation as the Sanitary Authority, and that this sewer conveyed the sewage not only from the premises of private persons but also from premises belonging to the Corporation. The case was finally decided in the Divisional Court of King's Bench, and it was held that as regards this sewage, which came from the Corporation's premises, they had caused or suffered the sewage to flow into the Thames within the meaning of Section 94 of the Thames Conservancy Act, 1894, but that as regards the sewage coming from the premises of private persons the Corporation had not done so. 68 TABLE XXXI.

This boat, for which Messrs. Rennie and Co.'s tender was accepted, was laid down in May, and completed in November. Her dimensions are 80 feet by 13 feet 6 inches, and the vessel is propelled by twin screws and by compound engines, the boiler being of the water-tube type. The launching ceremony was attended by Alderman Sir George Wyatt Truscott and Lady Truscott; the boat was launched by her Ladyship, and named in her honour the "Lady Truscott." The boat was constructed at a cost of £2,950, and is intended for work particularly in the lower reaches and estuary of the river, where her improved speed and seaworthy qualities will render her of considerable use and better adapted for the weather conditions there met with than any of the boats previously possessed by your Committee. CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith my Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, during the year ending 31st December, 1910. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority, including the river and docks—as a "canal," for the purposes of the Act, includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or is not within the ebb or flow of the tide. The navigation in addition to the enclosed docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the South side from Teddington downwards:— Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Docks. Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). The entrance to the Gravesend Canal. Cliffe Creek. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Part of the river Medway, and of the Swale. 72 On the North side from Teddirigton down:— The entrance to the river Brent. Chelsea Dock. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Bow Creek (River Lea). Barking Creek (River Roding). Rainham Creek (River Ingesbourne). Mucking Creek. Thames Haven Hole Haven. Potton and Rushley Creeks. River Roach as far up as Rochford. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as the Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows:— RIVER. Upper District. Teddington to Limehouse. Inspector Massie 104l. per annum. Middle District. Limehouse to Erith. Inspector Burr 201l. 10s. per annum. Lower District. Erith to seaward limits of the Port of London (including part of River Medway). Inspector Shepherd 110l. 10s. per annum. The Docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend district. It has been found advisable to sub-divide these districts, and instead of one Inspector to each, two have been appointed to the Western, and two to the Eastern district, as follows:— Central District. West India Dock. South West India Dock. Poplar Dock. Millwall Dock. Inspector Lambe 182l. per annum. 73 Eastern District. East India Dock. Royal Victoria Dock. Inspector Garland Royal Albert Dock. Inspector Wetjen 208l. per annum. 201l. 10s. per annum. Western District. London Dock. St. Katherine's Dock. Regent's Dock. Inspector Hopkins Surrey Commercial Dock. Inspector Elward 201l. 10s. per annum. 130l. per annum. Gravesend District. Tilbury Dock. North shore, from Purfleet down. South shore, from Erith down. Inspector Rolfe 182l. per annum. The address of each Inspector for official purposes is the office of the Authority at No. 51, King William Street, Greenwich, S.E. (2) The total number of inspections for the year is 878. The number of boats conforming to the Acts and Regulations is 807, or 91.9 per cent. of the total, the percentage for the previous five years being 92.2 per cent. In addition to the above, 30 boats were visited and the cabins, found to be locked, there being no person on board. Inspection was, therefore, impossible, and they are not included in the number of boats inspected. (3) With reference to the various infringements of the Act— (a) Three unregistered boats were found, and registered. (b) No notifications were received with regard to change of master. (c) Certificates: These were absent in 20 cases, and in 13 of these cases the Certificates have subsequently been placed on board, and the infringement remedied. In no case was a Certificate found which did not identify the owner with the boat. (d) Marking and numbering—Nine boats were found to be incorrectly marked and numbered. (e) Overcrowding occurred on two boats. The "Buzzard," registered Berkhamsted, No. 451, was found to have one lad occupying the fore cabin which has not been certified for occupation. 74 The "Sarah Ann," Reading, No. 34, registered for three adults, was found to be in occupation by the master, his wife and three children—one of these being a newly-born baby. (f) Partition separating sexes—One case of infringement was found during the year. (g) 14 boats were found infringing with regard to cleanliness, and of these—10 have been since reported as cleansed. (h) Defective ventilation was found on three boats, and 27 were found to require some repair. In 20 cases these alterations have since been certified as carried out. (i) Painting was found to-be required in nine cases. (j) Five Boats were found without proper water vessels. This has been provided in the case of two boats. (k) Removal of bilge water—Nil. (l) Notification of Infectious Disease—Nil. (m) Admittance of Inspector—Nil. No difficulty was experienced in regard to the visits of the Inspector. (4) No legal proceedings have been necessary. (5) The total number of infringements found was 95. In each case formal notice has been given to the owners of the infringement, which in many cases has been remedied without further trouble. The number of such notices was 33, and the number which has been certified as attended to was 46, this number including 16 which were arrears from the previous year. Of the complaints issued in the year now under review, 73'8 per cent. were remedied. The canal boat "George and Jane," registered Brentford, No. 42, was inspected on the 3rd February, 1910, when it was found to have no Certificate of Registration on board. The owner was communicated with on the 4th February. The boat was again met with on the 30th May, 1910, still without a Certificate on board. The matter was reported to your Committee, who instructed the City Solicitor to communicate with the owner of the boat. As a result the owner informed the Solicitor that the Certificate had been duly placed on board. This boat has not since been inspected in the port. 75 The canal boat "George and Annie" was met with on the 20th June, 1910, and found to be not lettered, marked and numbered. The ventilation was insufficient, skylight defective, and cabin in filthy condition. The after cabin was illegally occupied by a female above the age of 12 years—no partition separating the sexes. No Certificate of registration was produced. Notice was sent to the owner in respect of these infringements, but on the boat being again inspected on July 12th, nothing had been done to comply with the Acts and Regulations. The matter was reported to your Committee, and by them placed in the hands of the City Solicitor, who wrote to the owner. It was subsequently reported to me, through the Brentford Urban District Council, that the necessary repairs had been executed, but that the canal boat is no longer used as a dwelling—and further, that the boat was not registered with that Authority. (6) Infectious Disease. No case of infectious disease has been reported on any canal boat in the Port of London during the year. Double bulkheads. There were no infringements with regard to the provision of these. (7) No boats have been detained for cleansing. (8) On December 31st, 1910, there were 252 boats on the Register:— (9) Three boats were registered in 1910. Two were new boats, and one was re-registered on account of change of ownership, and alterations. In the several instances in which the defects are apparently not remedied, this only means that the boats have not been seen in the Port of London since the date of the complaint. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London, 76 TABLE XXXV. SUMMARY OF CANAL BOATS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31st DECEMBER, 1910. January. February.
