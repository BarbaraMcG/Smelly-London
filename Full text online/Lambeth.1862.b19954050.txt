Pursuant to the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act,'' the Vestry have to Report their proceedings under the Act, and the Works completed during the year. ended the 25th day of March, 1863. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House Drainage, &c., at page 4; Sanitary Matters at page 6; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 11; and Lighting Matters at page 18. The Report also contains an Account in Abstract, showing the Receipt and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year ended at Lady-day last; also a Summary Statement of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These Accounts have been duly audited and allowed, by the Auditors elected by the Parishioners. 4 For the purpose of efficient publication, an Abstract Account of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board, from the 25th day of March, 1862, to 25th day of March, 1863, as set forth at pages 38 and 39. The Accounts of the said Board have been duly audited, as evidenced by the certificate appended thereto. SEWERAGE, HOUSE DRAINAGE WORKS, &c.

The progress of the Main Drainage Works, under the Metropolitan Board, has not yet enabled the necessary connections to be made for constructing the New Sewers which have been ordered by the Vestry at Norwood and in other places. The Repairs and General Works during the past year include the repair and maintenance of Sewers, Drains, and Gullies, and comprise items of the ordinary character. lushing Flushing and Cleansing has been carried out as before, and the Sewers, both covered and open, are in a fair 5 state of cleanliness. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects have been promptly examined and remedied as far as possible, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. The House Drainage has been less than in previous years, from the circumstance of fewer new sewers having been constructed. The applications for house drainage are for 420 houses—upon which about £500 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by the applicants is £4000, which has been executed under the inspection and general supervision of the officers of the Vestry. New buildings.—The Vestry have received notices for building 357 new houses, the drainage of which, and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the sewers have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. Thirty-eight applications, made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred to the Vestry, and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given, for the formation of twenty-two new streets. 6 SANITARY MATTERS. Between March 25th, 1862, and March 25th, 18G3, there were 3328 cases of nuisance brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, by the Medical Officer and Inspectors. 1358 of these cases referred to the state of dwelling houses rendered unwholesome by reason of their filthy and dilapidated condition, or their foul cesspools, or their defective drains. The particulars of these, and of the remaining cases are shown in Table I. The general sanitary state of the Parish, as indicated by its mortality in the year 1862, is shown in the following Table, No. II, which gives the total number of births, the total number of deaths, the deaths under five years of age, and the deaths in the workhouses, which occurred in the entire Parish, and in each of its eight subdivisions, during the entire year, and during each particular quarter of the year.

Both the births and deaths were more numerous than in 1861, in which year the births were 5781, and the deaths 3450. There were 1714 deaths under 5 years of age during 1862, or in the proportion of 45 per cent of the entire mortality. Of the births, 1499 were in the first quarter, 1640 in the second quarter, 1428 in the third quarter, and 1400 in the last quarter. During the year there were 581 births in the Waterloo Road, 1st part district; 830 in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part district; 775 in the Lambeth Church, 1st part district; 1256 in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district; 1131 in the Kennington, 1st part district; 606 in the Kennington, 2nd part district; 590 in the Brixton district; and 258 in the Norwood district. The deaths during the first quarter were 1044, of which 4.18 were under 5 years; in the second quarter 880, under 5 years 372; in the third quarter 813, under 5 years 404; in the fourth quarter 1022, under 5 years 480. Of the deaths, 348 took place in the Waterloo Road, 1st part district; 387 in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part district; 483 in the Lambeth Church, 1st part district; 1047 in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district; of which 312 occurred in the Workhouse; 080 in the Kennington, 1st part district; 347 in the Kennington, 2nd part district; 329 in the Brixton district; and 138 in the Norwood district, of which 20 occurred in the Workhouse. 10 TABLE III Shows the Deaths from Epidemic Diseases in the whole Parish, and in each of it3 Sub.divisions.

Scarlatina contributed, as usual, the greatest number, 368 deaths, of which 63 occurred in the first quarter; 147 in the second quarter; 60 in the third quarter; and 98 in the last quarter of the year. The Lambeth Church and Norwood districts suffered most from 11 this disease. Typhus caused 154 deaths, of which 61 occurred in the first quarter; 30 in the second quarter; 29 in the third quarter; and 34 in the last quarter. This disease, which is so closely connected with over.crowding, was, as might be expected, most fatal in the Lambeth Church and Waterloo Road Districts; where, in consequence of the removal of so many houses for the construction of railways, the poorer classes are crowded together in an unprecedented manner. Measles caused 116 deaths, of which 63, or more than half, occurred in the last three months of the year. Diarrhœa was less fatal than usual. The 116 deaths occurred almost exclusively amongst children under 2 years old; 64, or more than half the deaths, were in the third quarter. Diptheria caused 28 deaths, 10 of which occurred in the first quarter Small Pox caused 6 deaths, a small number compart with previous years,—the deaths having been 58 in 1860, and 11 in 1861. 12 TABLE IV.

The death.rate of Lambeth being 22¾ per thousand, the whole of London 23½, and the South Districts nearly 22¾. 13 In six out of the eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish the death-rate was below that of the Metropolis, viz. Bkixton 15¾ per thousand. Kennington- 2nd Part 16¾ Norwood 17 Waterloo Road—2nd Part 20¾ „ Kennigton — 1st Part 21 ½ „ Waterloo Road—1st Part 22 ½ „ In the other two Divisions the death-rate was high, viz.— Lambeth Church- 1st Part 24 1/4per thousand. Lambeth Church—2nd Part 35 „ But, in estimating the comparative mortality of the several Sub-divisions, it is right to make allowance for the Adult and Infant Workhouses. The average number of inmates of the Adult Workhouse during the year was 820, and the deaths 312 ; that of the Infant Workhouse at Norwood 350, and the deaths 20. Excluding then the population and deaths in the Workhouses, the death-rate of the Norwood District would be 15½, instead of 17 1/4 per thousand; and the Lambeth Church, 2nd Part District, 25½, instead of 35 per thousand. 14 REPAIRS TO HIGHWAYS, &c. During the past year a great improvement has been effected in the condition of all the main lines of roads in the Parish, and the large expenditure required for this purpose has necessitated the study of sparing economy, where practicable. During the present year it is anticipated that much will be done towards the establishment, in good repair, of all the roads under the charge of the Vestry, and then the lessened expenses in this respect, will enable other improvements to be accomplished without increasing the rates. The work of raising and forming the roads in proper shape, which was done last year, has stood well and realized every expectation, The condition of the paved foot-ways, and the necessity for extensive repairs and renewal has been considered, and as much as could be applied to this purpose, during the year, has been expended in placcs of the greatest traffic, viz.:—from "The Horns" to Westminster Bridge; York Road, Waterloo Road; Stamford Street; and Gibson Street. In carrying out these works the renewal has been confined to parts where the stones were worn out, but all that were fit, were relaid; the whole of the expenditure upon this kind of work during the year has been £1200. Watering and Cleansing have been carried out by Contract,—some of the Contractors have neglected to fulfil their Contracts; the Vestry have, consequently, enforced the penalties thereby incurred, the result being that more attention is given, and the work is more efficiently executed. 15 NEW WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS. The following New Works and Alterations have been carried out:— Loughborough Road.—New 12x8 flat Devon granite kerb on the North side; the roadway and footpath widened, and the junction with Brixton Road improved; the additional ground being given to the public use by Mr. Slade. On the South side and at the corner of Angel Road, new Devon kerb has been laid by the Vestry, and the whole width of the footway paved at Mr. Jones' cost. Grifeen Street, York Road.—New granite.edge kerb; footways paved, and the roadways regulated, the owners paying £30 towards the cost. Willington Road and Cottage Grove.—New granite.edge kerb; footways and carriage.way thoroughly made up, and formed with hard core and faced with rough and fine gravel. A contribution of £150 was paid into the Vestry towards the cost of this work. Regency Square.—New granite.edge kerb; footways and carriage.way made up, and formed and faced with fine and rough gravel. Cornwall Road, Brixton Hill.—New granite.edge kerb, the surface excavated so as to make up and form the carriage.way and footpaths with hard core and fagots, and faced with rough and fine gravel. Towards this work £300 was paid into the office. Bolton Street.—New granite.edge kerb; footpaths and roadway thoroughly made up and formed and faced with rough and fine gravel. A contribution of £60 was paid in towards the cost of this work. Barrington Crescent.—Purbec kerb completed, and 16 the footpath made up and gravelled in front of houses on the East side. Prince's Street, Stamford Street.—New 7*4 granite crossing laid on concrete. Love Lane.—Carriage-way and footpaths thoroughly made up and formed with hard core, and faced with line and rough gravel and flints; a great improvement has been made here by the additional width thrown into the road by the owners of the ground. Gresham Place, Cold Harbour Lane.—Paving relaid and made good and kerb reset. Triangle, Cold Harbour Lane, Denmark hill.— Two new crossings 7*4 laid on concrete. Duke Street, Stamford Street.— New paving along flank wall of St. Patrick's School; kerb reset. Effra Road and Water Lane.—Making .up and thoroughly repairing roadway and footpaths after formation of sewers by the Metropolitan Board of Works, to meet the cost of which, £200 was paid to the Vestry by the Contractor. During the year several proceedings have been taken against persons obstructing the public way, by setting goods and articles for sale; and in all cases the magistrates have ordered the practice to be discontinued. The inconveniences arising from the irregularity of numbers in streets, and the same name being applied to several streets, has been under consideration by the Committee, and they are now carrying out an order of the Metropolitan Board of Works for abolishing all names of places, terraces, &c., in the Waterloo Road, and numbering the houses consecutively with the odd numbers on one side, and the even on the other. 17 £ s.

In the past year 46 memorials and applications have been received for improved lighting in various parts of the parish, 25 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new lumps or removals, and 21 refused. There have been 28 new lamps erected, 4 discontinued, and 38 removed to improved positions. The total number of public lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 2263, and the cost of lighting, including the removal of lamps, new columns, and sundries, for the year ending the 25th day of March last, amounted to £10,402 0s. 8d. The price paid to the Gas Companies for lighting the public lamps, remains the same as last year. The Chemical Examiner of Gas employed by the Vestry, continues to present to the Lighting Committee a monthly Report as to the illuminating power and purity of the different Companies Gases; and in order that more frequent and satisfactory experiments may be made, the Vestry are about to have fitted up at the Vestry Offices a Photometer and other appliances of the most improved character, so that the illuminative power, purity, and pressure of the Gas will be tested almost daily.
