The mid-year population of the District for 1954 was assessed at 72,070 and the number of inhabited dwellings was 20,981. The vital statistics can on the whole be regarded as satisfactory; the corrected birth rate of 12 99 and the corrected death rate of 8 9 both comparing favourably with the national rates of 15.2 and 11,3 respectively. The infant mortality rate of 2C.8, while lower than the national rate of 25.5, still gives cause for much thought. A table is included in the report shewing the causes of death and age at death of those infants who died under the age of one year. From this it will be seen that the majority of these infants succumbed to conditions which in the present state of knowledge are not preventable. There is obviously great need for much research into these conditions and, indeed, this is being actively carried out in many places. It is becoming clear that a number of conditions which may lead to still-birth may, also, in other cases, lead to death in the first few hours or days, and that in future, to get a more clear idea of what is occurring, it may be necessary to classify still-births and early deaths together as having a common causation. Once again, there has been no case of diphtheria in the District. This encouraging situation is likely to 3 continue only so long as the level of immunity is kept as high as possible. Each year, as the number of people with experience of, or even with knowledge of diphtheria declines, it bec omes more and more difficult to persuade parents of the really urgent need to have their children immunised. Parents are no longer afraid of something they have not experienced. Whooping cough, however, is still with us and in recent years a vaccine has been developed which offers good protection against the worst features of this disease. It is easy to combine diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation in one series of injections, and all parents are strongly advised to take advantage of the protection offered. There was no case of smallpox in the area; this can be regarded as fortunate in view of the proximity of major airports and the continued increase in international travel at ever increasing speeds. The only certain means of protection against this disease is effecient vaccination, and the most satisfactory time to have this done is in infancy. Once it is done, then re-vaccination, whether for business, services or travel purposes becomes a simple and safe procedure. The general level of vaccination is not high enough for safety and here again, parents are advised to take advantage of the facilities offered and have their infants protected. The measles incidence declined-that was to be expected as 1954 was a 'trough' year in the usual bi-annual epidemic wave of this disease. The whooping cough incidence also declined and it is gratifying to note that the great majority of the cases were mild and, in fact, it was not necessary to have any whooping cough cases admitted to hospital. The routine work of the Department was carried on satisfactorily during the year. As usual, special attention was paid to food hygiene matters and efforts were constantly made to educate food handlers in hygiene methods. In the last resort, however, satisfactory food hygiene is in the hands of the general public. If purchases are only made where hygienic conditions are obviously good, then the general level of hygiene among food traders will soon be raised; even now it is beginning to be realised that good food hygiene is also good business. 4 Another aspect of the work, namely home safety, has also had special attention during the year, particularly after the introduction of the regulations made under the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. These regulations should do something to reduce the number of incidents due to accidental burning in the home, but they make no provision for the guarding of many gas and electric fires already in use. It is to be hoped that householders will themselves take steps to see that their gas, electric and open fires are all adequately guarded. No regulations, however, will prevent accidents in the home if there is carelessness; the best preventive measure is the exercise of ordinary common sense. The work of the Chief Sanitary Inspector and the other members of the Staff of the Public Health Department has been of a high order during the year and thanks are due to them for their great efforts. The co-operation and encouragement of the Public Health Committee also has been most valuable and is very greatly appreciated. I am, Your obedient Servant, O. C. DOBSON Medical Officer of Health April, 1955. 5 STATISTICS ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 2,088 acres Eastcote Ward 1,231 acres Ruislip Ward 1,757 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,507 acres 6,583 acres POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the mid-year:- 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 67,090 69,640 71,220 72,130 72,070 Population Census, 1951 68,288 Number of Inhabited Dwellings 20,981 BIRTH RATE No. of Births M.

Proceedings were taken in respect of the sample containing added water and the bench granted an absolute discharge on Payment of Â£2.15.0d. costs. The third unsatisfactory sample was one of new milk taken from a churn and which was slightly deficient in fat. Associated samples from the same seller were satisfactory and no further action was taken. 28 A sample of coffee was deficient in coffee contrary to the Food Standards Order. It transpired that the tin was of very old stock and had been distributed before the order was promulgated. An official caution was sent to the retailer. One sample of fish which was unsatisfactory relates to a sale of smoked cod for smoked haddock. The trader in this case also received an official caution. Two of the unsatisfactory samples of vinegar relate to sales by one trader on two separate occasions of non-brewed condiment when vinegar was asked for. He was prosecuted and fined Â£2. and ordered to pay Â£1.15.0d. costs. A third sample of vinegar noted was genuine vinegar but deficient in acetic acid. It had been stored for a long period and upon it being evident that the cause of the deficiency was natural deterioration no further action, save a warning to the trader to limit the period of storage in such a case, was taken.
