VITAL STATISTICS. The birth-rate is the same as last year, but there has been a small increase in the death-rate mainly due to more deaths from cancer, coronary disease, angina, and bronchitis. There were 15 accidental deaths, compared with 8 last year. It is important to observe that not one of the 6 road deaths included in this figure was of a child, whereas of the 9 remaining deaths, no less than 6 were children under the age of 12 years; 2 of these were infants suffocated in bed; 2 were the result of falls; 1 was due to the inhalation of a toy balloon, and one resulted from carbon monoxide poisoning from a gas appliance. It is well that the lessons of Road Safety have been learned with such good effect, but the statistics serve as a sharp reminder of the less obvious dangers to which children may be subjected. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Mild measles was prevalent during the early part of the year, but otherwise the incidence of infectious diseases was very low. The Council paid compensation to a carrier of Salmonella Typhimurium, whom I required to cease his occupation as a food handler for a period of 6 weeks under the Public Health (infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1953. Similarly, a contact of paralytic poliomyelitis was compensated for loss of part-time earnings as a food handler for two weeks under Section 99 of the Essex County Council Act, 1952. RADIOACTIVITY. Your Council has shared the general concern engendered by the ever-increasing importance of radioactivity in our lives. The desire for accurate and up-to-date information concerning the local hazards from fall-out and from the uses of radioactive substances in medicine, industry and research, has been strongly and repeatedly voiced. On my recommendation, a utility Geiger Counter has been purchased. It is intended for use in the event of any unknown radioactive source being reported or suspected in the District. The most /that -2- that can be expected from such an instrument is to indicate what immediate action, if any, should be taken in the public interest pending more accurate and skilled assessments by outside experts. The Radioactive Substances Bill now before Parliament provides for copies of Registrations of users of radioactive materials to be passed to Local Authorities, but the Minister has powers to omit the transference of this information in certain cases, on grounds of national security; also there is no provision in the Bill for power of entry to premises by a Medical Officer of Health for the purpose of informing himself on the disposal of radioactive wastes and on other health hazards. In the meantime, personal liaison with local experts has been established, and it is hoped that eventually a comprehensive information service with powers of inspection, will become available to Medical Officers of Health to enable them to deal effectively with all local enquiries. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Arising out of my observations in the Annual Report for 1958 (page 4), the Council obtained an assurance from the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police that the traffic patrols had been issued with standing instructions to give attention to pollution from the exhausts of motor vehicles, and that the police would be prepared to prosecute where appropriate, and if satisfactory supporting evidence could be obtained. Consultations were subsequently held with the Divisional Police Superintendent on the definition of "satisfactory supporting evidence". The essential requirement is a proof that the amountand duration of smoke emission was enough to render overtaking dangerous on a road suitable for overtaking under normal circumstances. It is presumably the stringency of this requirement which makes action under the existing Regulation 79(b) (Motor Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations 1955) so difficult to apply. FLUORIDATION. During the year, the subject of fluoridation of public water supplies came under discussion. Although it is accepted by most expert opinion that the addition of fluorides to public water supplies can be expected to improve the dental health of the population without detriment, there is still a body of organised public opinion which is strongly opposed to the idea - both in principle and through fear of some possible harmful effects of long-term usage. I have been in correspondence with both the Ministry of Health and /with -3- with the "anti-fluoridation league" on the matter, and I am of the opinion that until the controlled observations at present being conducted in this country by the Medical Research Council have been completed, and all prejudices, and misgivings have been effectively removed, it would probably be unwise to press for any extension of existing schemes; in the meantime, education and discussion on the subject are being encouraged. SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951. 12 cases have been under observation during the year. Two of these were admitted to hospital under the provision of National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, 4 others were admitted to hospital voluntarily. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made, H. FRANKS, M.B., B.S., B.Hy., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health. May, 1960. -4- SECTION A STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

Water The water supply of the District is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board except for one house in the District where it is drawn from a well. This house is in the ownership of the Conservators of Epping Forest and is situated in the forest a long way from the mains supply. The water is piped and has been generally satisfactory both in quality and quantity. The number of houses is 17,434 and the estimated population at mid-year was 62,070. Four samples of water were taken during 1959 from a watercourse in Chigwell. The results were reasonably satisfactory. 2. Drainage and Sewerage Soil drainage from the greater part of the District is by gravity to the main disposal works at Luxborough which were modernised in 1938, considerably enlarged shortly after the war, and are in process of further improvement. The construction of four additional primary sludge digesters has commenced, and the remainder of the scheme will proceed during 1960. It is the intention to complete these improvements by introducing extra treatment of the final effluent to ensure that a higher standard of purity in the discharge to the River Roding is maintained. In the meantime, the Works have operated reasonably well and given a fair effluent. A scheme for a new Southern Outfall Sewer, designed also to provide relief for overloading of the existing Northern Outfall has received Ministry approval and will be commenced during 1960. There is one small subsidiary works at Millers Lane, modernised after the war, which maintains a good effluent. One small area drains to the sewers of Wanstead and Woodford, thence to Chingford and the East Middlesex scheme. Most of the Hainault Estate drains to the sewers of the Dagenham district and the Works of that Authority. There are four outlying pumping stations lifting flow from low lying areas up to main gravity sewers. One of these stations has recently been replaced by a new one; a second is to have new machinery increasing its capacity during 1960; a third will be replaced by a new one as part of the Southern Outfall Sewer scheme /in -11- in 1960; replacement of machinery in the fourth is under consideration for 1960 or 1961. There is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. 3. Rivers and Streams. The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area within this district which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex River Board. Flooding of fields in the valley has been very limited for a number of years. Some flooding occurred in 1958 but there was virtually none in 1959. 4. Closet Accommodation and Cesspools. Number of Cesspools and Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 2 Chigwell 85 Loughton 15 Number of Earth or Chemical Closets in Houses: Chigwell 35 Loughton 2 Number of Chemical Closets in Caravans: Buckhurst Hill 3 Chigwell 18 Loughton 2 Premises which have earth closets, chemical closets, cesspools and septic tanks are in areas where no sewer is, available. One house previously drained by a cesspool has been connected to the Council's sewer during the year. Every opportunity is taken to connect premises to main drainage and schemes are in hand with this in view. 5. Public Cleansing. Domestic refuse has been collected once weekly throughout the district by the Council's vehicles and labour.A fleet of seven covered lorries is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a service of removing bulky articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. Trade refuse has also been collected, a charge related to actual cost being made, but with the definition confined to refuse the character of which is clearly not domestic. Replacement of the previous side-loading vehicles by 12/20 c. yd. "Compressmore" rear-loaders (Fordson chassis) has proceeded and is expected to be completed during 1960. Refuse is disposed of by controlled tipping at a tip provided -12- /by by a contractor. Payment to the firm is per load and includes levelling, compacting and covering, a bulldozer and the covering material being provided in the price. The area exposed at any one time is kept to a low minimum and measures are taken against flies and vermin as necessary from time to time. Salvage of paper and rags produced sales during the year of about 470 tons. Road gullies (in adopted District roads) have been emptied and re-sealed with clean water by machine three times during the year by contract. 6. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. An outline of the work of the Public Health Inspectors is as follows:- 1959 1958 Complaints received and dealt with 1,268 738 Inspections and visits 7,718 7,222 Nuisances abated 786 360 Informal notices served 45 59 Informal notices complied with 46 50 Statutory notices served 38 13 Statutory notices complied with 35 11 Legal Proceedings 14 5 Summary of Nuisances. Cesspools, overflowing 2 Dampness 33 Drains Blocked or defective 158 Defective water closets 24 Defective water supply pipes 2 Nuisances from birds and animals 11 Polluted ditches, watercourses and ponds 6 Accumulation of refuse and defective dustbins 21 Vermin (bugs and fleas) 5 Cellars flooded 3 Insect infestations 89 Wasps 407 Air pollution 25 7. Verminous Premises. Five houses were reported as verminous during the year, bugs (4) and fleas (l). All the houses were successfully treated, three with "Fumite" and two with "Gammexane". Four of the houses were private dwellings and one a London County Council house. Number of visits - 11 /Rodent Control -13- RODENT CONTROL PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PEST ACT. 1949. 1,856 inspections and visits were made in 1959 as against 1,497 in the previous year. Yearly figures since the passing of the Act are:- 1957 2,010 1952 2,011 1956 1,080 1951 1,924 1955 1,548 1950 2,020 1954 1,308 1949 1,833 1953 1,388 The highest figure recorded is 2,020 in 1950, and the lowest 1,080 in 1956. The figures have remained fairly constant as the average is 1,697• I think the public are more than ever conscious of the rodent menace which results in a very high percentage of the infestations being reported to this department. The number of mice infestations in houses still remains high. Warfarin is exclusively used for treatment, and the results obtained are excellent. Treatment of the Council's sewers took place in the Spring and Autumn. The results rere:- May 1959 October 1959 Manholes treated 230 197 Poison part takes 5 1 Poison complete takes 30 6 For some reason we seem to get smaller takes in the October treatments and this may be due to build-up in the rat population in the sewers during the winter months. -14- SECTION D HOUSING STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1959 Number of new houses erected, rated and occupied during the year:- Permanent Houses, London County Council 56 Chigwell Urban District Council 119 Private Owners 309 484 Inspection of Dwelling Houses during the year:- 1.
