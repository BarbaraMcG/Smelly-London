REPORT on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch in the County of London for the year 1964 by R.Broadbent, M.A , M.B., M.R.C.S., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health 1 To the Mayor Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch Mr Mayor Ladies and Gentlemen,, I submit herewith the final Annual Report on the Health and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, in the form requested by the Ministry of Health. The various statistics were well within the averages of recent years, except for the relentless spread of cancer (which presumably one must expect in a population living to old age when cancer is more prevalent - and in a population smoking cigarettes so heavily!). It is interesting to note that only one person died of natural causes between the ages of 5 and 25 years, only 5 from tuberculosis (all but one over 55),and none in childbirth. The Social Welfare Services for the elderly prospered as did the Holiday Hotel at St Leonard s on Sea and altogether it would appear that the Council and its staff forestalled and prevented illness in every way open to them. In fact during my 17 odd years with the Borough there has been no spread of any serious disease although many threats occurred In this connection I am indebted to the general practitioners for calling me in early, with their first suspected patient. Also though I know it is invidious to mention names in view of the sterling work done by every member of the staff but I feel bound to acknowledge the work of Mr Marshall (whose worth has been acknowledged by the Council of the London Borough of Hackney who have appointed him as their Chief Public Health Inspector) Mr Earthrowl (who continues as the Pood Inspector for the whole of the new Borough). Mr Leigh (who, though classed merely as senior clerk helped me enormously in the administration of the Department), Mr Christian (who kept a firm grip on the I D. situation) Mr Pope (who filled so many other clerical gaps), Mr Molyneux (who picked up the reins of administration very rapidly after his appointment to the Social Welfare Section) and even young Robert Bradford (who proved worthy of his Duke of Edinburgh s gold medal award). Others who proved their capability and initiative were Mrs Pike and Miss Graver for their work among the old people while outside the Borough itself the most popular people were Mr and Mrs Stimpson at the Holiday Hotel. All these people are worthy of even more senior posts and should do well by the citizens of the new Borough I was also pleased to find that Mr Bryant the official Rodent Officer had been appointed to the same post in the new larger Borough The amount of work done on the Offices Shops and Railway Premises Act before I left was very gratifying and strongly indicates the value of Technical Assistants as an aid to our sadly depleted staff of Public Health Inspectors It is pleasing to know that the enlarged Public Health Department for the new Borough will be in Shoreditch so that it is hoped that Shoreditch will go from strength to strength in Health matters Lastly Mr Mayor I would like to thank you and the Chairmen of my late Committees for your help in the past as well as those other members who assisted me in my work and to wish prosperity to all linked with the new Borough Yours faithfully Wynforrs B.

The density of the population is 58 persons per acre. The Area Comparability Factors for the Borough are Births 0.98 and deaths 1.04 and the rates shown in this report have been adjusted accordingly. BIRTHS The numbers of registered live births allocated to the Borough during the calendar year 1964 were as follows - Total live births (legitimate and illegitimate) Males 291 Females 275 Total 566 Illegitimate live births - Males 34 Females 25 Total 59 The birth rate for the Borough was 14.97. For England and Wales the rate was 18 4 and for London 20.0. The illegitimate births represented 10.42 per cent of all births in the Borough, STILLBIRTHS The number of registered stillbirths allocated to the borough was 10, or 1.73 per cent of all births. MARRIAGES The number of marriages during the year was 369 and the marriage rate was 19.9 per 1,000 population The marriage rate for the Metropolis was 20.6 and that for England and Wales 15.1. DEATHS The number of deaths registered in the borough in 1964 was - 479. Transferable deaths - Non residents registered in Shoreditch - 192 Shoreditch residents registered elsewhere - 175 The number of deaths allocated to the borough is therefore - 462, This gives a death rate for the borough of 12.47 compared with 11.3 for England and Wales and 11 0 for London. In connection with these deaths 15 inquests were held. 358 or 75% of the people belonging to Shoreditch who died during the year died in hospital. The table on page 5 showing causes of death at all ages has been supplied by the Registrar-General INFANTILE MORTALITY The deaths of infants under one year numbered 13 of which 7 were males. These deaths amounted to 2.81 per cent of the total net Shoreditch deaths from all causes as compared with 3.87 per cent in 1963. The infantile mortality rate (death rate of infants under one year per 1,000 live births) for Shoreditch was 22.96 the rate for England and Wales being 20.0 and that for London 21.2. One illegitimate infant died The number of deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age was 11, which gives a neo natal rate of 19.43. 7 INFANTILE MORTALITY IN THE BOROUGH DURING 1964 Cause of Death Ages Sex Total deaths under l year Under 1 day 1 day to 1 week 1 2 weeks 2 3 weeks 3 4 weeks Total under 1 month 1- 3 months 3 6 months 6 9 months 9- 12 months Male Female Bronchitis - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 i Congenital malformation - 2 - - - 2 - - - - 2 - 2 Prematurity 5 - - 1 - 6 1 - - - 3 4 7 Atelectasis 1 1 - - - 2 - - - - 1 1 2 Pound in canal 1 - - - - 1 - - - - 1 - 1 Total 7 3 - 1 - 11 1 1 - - 7 6 13 MATERNAL MORTALITY 1964 No maternal death was recorded during the year.

COMPULSORY REMOVAL OF AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act. 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to the Court for an Order for the removal to hospital or other institution of a person who is aged infirm or physically incapacitated, and who is living in insanitary conditions and "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention". In addition, during 1951, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act came into force. Under this Act, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and another practitioner, emergency removals of such people for periods not exceeding three weeks may be enforced by the Courts, No action was necessary under this section during the year. BURIAL OF THE DEAD Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1948, the Borough Council is responsible for arranging for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made During 1964 four cases occurred where the Council had to arrange for burial. The Council have not yet carried out any cremations, as although it may appear at the time of death that there are no surviving relatives, there is always the remote possibility that at some future date, one may come forward and start enquiries which might result in the Council's action being disputed. INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES During the year 355 notifications of infectious diseases were received. SMALLPOX AND VACCINATION No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year and no vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations 1917. 8 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING 1964 (confirmed diagnoses) Notifiable Disease Total number of confirmed cases Ages Under l year 1-5 years 5 15 years 15- 25 years 25-45 years 45-65 years 65 years+ Deaths Diphtheria - - - - - - - - - Dysentery 26 - 9 13 2 2 - - - Acute encephalitis - infective - - - - - - - - - post infectious - - - - - - - - - Enteric (paratyphoid) - - - - - - - - - Erysipelas 6 - - - 1 - 4 1 - Measles 188 8 105 74 1 - - - - Meningococcal Infection 1 - 1 - - - - - 1 Ophthalmia Neonatorum - - - - - - - - Pneumonia 6 - - - - 2 2 2 - Acute Poliomyelitis paralytic - - - - - - - - - non paralytic - - - - - - - - - Puerperal Pyrexia - - - - - - - - - Scabies 8 - 2 1 1 2 1 1 - Scarlet fever 52 - 9 43 - - - - - Whooping cough 36 3 19 14 - - - - - Tuberculosis pulmonary 14 - 1 - 3 1 6 3 5 non pulmonary 5 - - 1 1 1 - 2 - Pood Poisoning 13 - - - - 5 4 4 - Total 355 11 146 146 9 13 17 13 6 The following diseases are notifiable in this Borough - Disease Authority for notification Acute encephalitis Public Health Act, 1936 (Section 143) Reg, No. 2259 made by Minister of Health, 1949 (1.1.50).

PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS 1925 These regulations prohibit a person suffering from tuberculosis and who is in an infectious condition, from following any employment or occupation in connection with a dairy which would involve the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of vessels used for containing milk. No formal action was necessary during the year 12 SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES Through the Health Department the Council have provided opportunities for old people in the Borough to receive amenities and assistance which are aimed at maintaining their health, if possible, but in any case to make their declining years more comfortable and less boring than it would be if they were left entirely alone in their varied accommodation. The three lady welfare officers have again been fully occupied visiting the aged in their homes and at the four full time Clubs which the old people continue to attend in steadily increasing numbers. It is the "family atmosphere" at the Clubs which seems to prove a great attraction, although the outings parties and Club activities such as handicrafts, old time dancing, T V., newspapers and the inevitable cup of tea all contribute to the success of the Council s policy to run all day Clubs, Half the average 200 meals a day provided through the Town Hall Canteen are eaten by the Clubs, members, and a bath recently installed in the Bell Club is proving an asset both to those who require assistance from the Welfare Officers and also to the Club members who wish to take advantage of the facility for their weekly "soak". Even if they are lucky enough to have one in their homes, many older people are apprehensive about using a bath in case of accident. Having a coach to take handicapped aged persons to the Clubs means that, with the exception of those confined to their bed or wheel-chair, most old people in Shoreditch who want to belong to a Club can attend at least once a week with marked reduction in their deterioration. The demand for the "meals on wheels" service increases steadily, and again the Salvation Army have provided transport and an Officer to deliver some of the 100 hot meals taken to housebound old people each day at a charge of 10d for each two course meal. The free laundry service for the incontinent is a boon to those who have difficulties in washing and drying clothes, whether for the elderly person or for the relation struggling to cope with an aged parent. Once again outside organisations have helped to provide (among other things) a shoe repair service Harvest Festival gifts, Christmas parties and parcels. summer outings clothing, entertainment, etc. etc. The Northampton College of Advanced Technology have regularly asked for pensioners to act as "guinea pigs" at their lectures. The old person spends two hours in the College having his eyes examined by students under the supervision of a lecturer Any defects diagnosed are taken care of, tea is provided and at the end of the session 5/- is paid to the patient. So far there is no queue. but we have always been able to meet the demand for "specimens" In June the Shoreditch Holiday Hotel at St, Leonards on Sea was reopened after a period of eight months during which time extensive structural alterations were carried out. Although the installation of a lift resulted in a slight reduction in the number of beds available for the guests, 38 residents of Shoreditch (mostly pensioners) were accommodated each week during the Summer season It was hoped that the new central heating system and improved kitchen facilities would encourage people to make use of the Hotel during the Autumn and Winter months but apart from Christmas and the New Year the bookings were disappointingly low despite publicity within the Borough, During the period June 1964 to March 1965 there was a total of 763 persons accommodated at the Hotel of whom 727 were of pensionable age and 13 children under the age of 15 years The following table shows the average attendances at the Old People* s Clubs during the year 13 (1) Old People' s Clubs (2) Average number of attendances (4) Average weekly number of Sex Mon.

The Council was sufficiently impressed to vote £500 towards starting the Club and it seems already to be proving its worth. THE ABOLITION OF NOISE FROM ROAD BREAKING APPLIANCES It is now two years ago since, at the invitation of the Chief Public Health Inspector, what has become to be known as an historical meeting, took place in Shoreditch Town Hall, when every important manufacturer of pneumatic road breakers and compressors in the British Isles and several from' other countries met in a spirit of compromise and co-operation to determine what could be done to reduce the annoyance and irritation from pneumatic road breakers and compressors and to see if a standard of noise could not be defined acceptable to the users of equipment and to local authorities. In two years the results of a small working Committee formed at this meeting have had repercussions not only in this country but in many other parts of the world including America Canada Australia Austria and Japan and important research work much of it financed by the manufacturers of the equipment (the remainder being provided by the Government), is continuing at the Building Research Station at Garston with what appears to be most encouraging results In the early days every effort was made to persuade contractors to equip road breakers with muffle covers (the only equipment then available to minimise the noise from road breakers) but after bitter opposition from contractors complaining that whilst muffle covers reduce the noise, automatically the efficiency of the road breakers in greatly reduced At the instigation of the Chief Public Health Inspector energetic efforts were made to devise equipment which would fit any type of road breaker capable of reducing annoyance and irritation to a minimum at the same time not reducing the efficiency of the tools. Success has been achieved in this direction in what is known as a 'Noise Converter', and it is encouraging to find that all the principal manufacturers in this country and in other parts of the world have taken up this as standard equipment for their road breakers The principle of the 'Noise Converter' is in reducing those high frequency sounds which annoy and irritate, into low frequency sounds thus making the sum total of noise more acceptable. 14 A great deal of publicity by the national and local Press, on both B.B.C, and I.T.V. channels and in the B.B.C. News and Radio Newsreel and information broadcast to many parts of the world on the B.B.C. Overseas Programme in 57 languages has undoubtedly influenced public opinion. The results of such publicity have been so encouraging that the Board of Trade expressed great satisfaction that this British Product was receiving so much attention overseas. The interest shown throughout this country is very evident in that requests for information and demonstrations came from many areas including Glasgow Gloucester Leeds Bath Bristol and Brighton and it is encouraging to note that several London Boroughs together with other local authorities throughout the country have followed the example of Shoreditch in inserting a clause in all contracts let out by them that pneumatic road breaking equipment shall be provided with effective silencers. So much success being achieved in the field of road breakers that attentions have now been turned to reducing annoyance and irritation from compressors, and several important manufacturers are now producing compressors capable of operating at maximum output immediately adjacent to premises with little nuisance. Subjective tests carried out by the Chief Public Health Inspector have proved beyond doubt that it is possible for normal conversation and working to be carried out in offices when compressors are working on the road immediately outside the premises It must be realised that although so much success has been achieved in the reduction of unnecessary noise from road breakers by the application of noise converters and like equipment efforts must still continue to devise some other form of road breakers which will reduce the noise at the source and no longer require the application of suppressing equipment. At the same time one must realise that we must do all we can to silence existing equipment until such new designs have been developed and applied. 15 FOOD & DRUGS ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCTION The effective method of control in relation to Pood & Drugs Administration should enable the operatives to keep abreast of modern processing techniques Legislative policy could assist if it were formulated in anticipation of manufacturers' development plans Such a policy could have beneficial influences, in that it would encourage development of producers particular commodities along lines to give priority to health giving properties rather than purely sales gimmicks The more unscrupulous adulterations of Pood stuffs of the past have disappeared but their place has been taken by the deliberate addition of chemicals and additives with all their associated claims, With the introduction of prepacked and prepared foods of every kind, the need for Know how to prepare an entire meal is fast becoming a lost art to housewives It is not intended to suggest that this is a retrograde step but rather to emphasize the need to review the system of control in the knowledge that chemicals and additives are introduced into foods for reasons other than health giving value Additives may serve a useful purpose when applied correctly, but the connection between their use and the possible sensitizing effect on some people could be studied more closely, The effects of an allergen in one person could be the effects of food poisoning in 'another and confusion couldbe misleading A product that undergoes such characteristic changes when subjected to a particular method of preservation as to require additives in an endeavour to restore it to something resembling its original state should be forbidden to be subjected to that type of preservation this would encourage research into other methods. The whole field of food and drugs administration could benefit greatly by being carefully reviewed collectively and a closer relationship formulated at national if not international level, to establish agreed bacteriological chemical and quality standards The terms of reference of the standing committee suggested in the Milne Report to advise the Minister of the risk of infection which may arise from the consumption of any particular food could be phrased to to advise the Minister of the possible dangers to health which may arise from the consumption of any food Opinion is held that more stress should be paid to bacteriological sampling at points which may prove to be reservoirs of infection, but until existing laboratory facilities are made more readily available this phase of sampling must be held in abeyance NEW LEGISLATION Bread & Flour Regulations 1963 These Regulations which re enact the Plour (Composition) Regulations 1956, came into operation 1st September 1964 and lay down requirements as to the composition of and ingredients in a wide range of bread They also prohibit the use in flour and bread of colouring matter except caramel. The permitted bleaching and improving agents are specified as are the labelling requirements of bread exposed for sale. 16 Liquid Egg (Pasteurization) Regulations 1963 These Regulations came into operation 1st January 1964 and require the pasteurization of liquid egg used in food intended for sale for human consumption The document also contains prescribed methods of pasteurization and the tests to be satisfied Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1963 These Regulations re enact with Amendments the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960 the principal change being that on and after 1st October 1964 Untreated' replaces Tuberculin Tested as a special designation for raw milk and dealers licences will require to be renewed in accordance with the amended Regulations Meat (Treatment) Regulations 1964 These Regulations which came into operation 2 3rd January 1964 prohibit the addition to raw and unprocessed meat intended for sale for human consumption of any of the following substances Ascorbic Acid Erythorbic Acid Nicotine Acid Nicotinamide and any salts or other derivatives of these substances and the sale of any such meat so treated Soft Drinks Regulations 1964 These Regulations revoke the Soft Drinks Regulation 1963 and re-enact with amendments the Pood Standards (Soft Drinks) Order 1953 and the Amendments Order 1954 and come into operation part in June 1964 and part in June 1965 The principal changes are (a) Standards of composition have been introduced for semi-sweet and low caloric soft drinks and labelling provisions for these drinks are laid down (b) The use of cyclamic acid and its sodium and calcium salts is permitted as artificial sweetness in soft drinks in place of or in conjunction with saccharin (c) The description of soft drinks sold from vending machines and where appropriate a declaration of the artificial sweetener content must appear on such machines Egg Products Routine visits were made to all bakehouses to enquire the type of egg used in the making of confectionery In all cases where liquid egg was being used it was of a brand conforming to the requirements of the Liquid Egg (Pasteurization) Regulations 1963 Meat Products In administering the new Meat (Treatment) Regulations 1964 all Butchers shops and meat processing establishments in the Borough were visited and enquiries made regarding the additives if any being used in meats The majority of butchers were not using any substances at all but samples of five different products were taken for chemical analysis and one was reported upon as containing a prohibited substance In this case the plea of ignorance was accepted and the product immediately withdrawn from use. Re visits have been made during the year to ascertain any further changes in products used. 17 Routine Inspections There are 902 types of food businesses and food stalls in Shoreditch designated as follows Cafes and Restaurants 101 Dining Clubs & School Meals Service 30 Factory & Warehouse Canteens 76 Ice Cream Shops 121 Butchers Shops and Stalls 48 Milk Shops and Depots 70 Fried Fish Shops 9 Wet Fish Slops 6 Bakers 16 Food Warehouses 15 Grocery & Provision Shops 85 Confectioners' Shops 82 Public Houses 104 Food Stalls 89 Coffee Stall 1 Greengrocers 27 Chemists 17 Off Licences 5 The number of routine Inspections made to all premises in the Borough which are in any way connected with the preparation, distribution, handling, storage, or sale of food were as follows - Basic routine inspections made 1739 Re inspections made 1176 Total number of inspections 2915 SAMPLING Whilst the quite useful data correlated from routine sampling cannot be ignored, the main policy in connection with food sampling has again been pursued along lines from which it was planned to obtain information relevant to the particular commodity in relation to current legislation During the year two food commodities were subjected to special scrutiny and a series of sampling was conducted for the purpose of establishing information on food standards of one commodity and purity of the other. The Food Standards (Preserves) Order 1953 contains a list of jams with the percentage of fruit content required. During a series of sampling this commodity the laboratory reports from the Public Analyst showed that in the case of Damson Jams the percentage of Damsons of average composition was below the fruit content requirement in the Order. From investigations made there appears to exist slight confusion in relation to the interpretation of prepared ingredients and the percentage of fruit content in the finished product. Correspondence that followed did little to clarify the situation, but rather confused the issue so that any thought of further action in these cases was not recommended. The Lead in Food Regulations 1961 restricts the amount of lead which may be present in food intended for sale for human consumption The quantity of tea imported into this country is staggering, something in the region of 600 000.000 lbs per year - and strange though it may seem neither the importers nor blenders concern themselves with its lead content. 18 With the transhipments and transportation systems that are operated nowa-days it is not outside the bounds of possibility for a consignment of tea to enter the country and arrive at a blender's premises without its having been sampled for purity by a Port Health Authority. The liaison with other Authorities is such that where a tea is found upon importation by the Port Health Authority to contain excess amounts of lead, the particular chest in question may be allowed to go forward to the blenders under guarantee that it will be used in conjunction with other tea so that the final blend will satisfy the requirements of the Regulations. The local authority in whose area the blending takes place is supplied with the necessary information to identify the chest, and final sampling is carried out to ensure that the lead content does not exceed the proportions laid down. This year 48 different blends were sampled and only one was found upon analysis to contain quantities of lead in excess of the amount allowed by law. The blenders were informed and the whole stock was immediately withdrawn from sale and an undertaking was given by the Company concerned be reblend the unsatisfactory stock with other suitable tea to give a blend conforming to the Regulations, This in fact was done and, before the stock was released for sale, samples showed that lead content was well within the permitted proportions. A very important aspect in connection with the performance of duties under the Pood& Drugs Act involves economics and requires thoughtful planning. Some of the everyday commodities which are sampled for chemical analysis require lengthy laboratory process to complete particular examinations which become necessary in order to establish infringements. These examinations cost more in time and money and some of the equipment essential to them is very expensive. The sampling officer is thus restricted in his choice of sample range, particularly in the field of drugs for fear of exceeding budgetary allocations Quite a strong case could be made to support either centralising laboratory work, or monetary assistance from the Ministry to augment sampling programmes. During 1964 the following foods and drugs were sampled for chemical examination - Additives 5 Almonds (Ground) 1 Butter 3 Batter Mix 2 Cream (canned) 4 Curry Powder 2 Coffee (Instant) 3 Cinnamon 1 Colouring (Food) 3 Drinks (Soft) 17 Drugs & Medicines 28 Fish (Canned) 2 Flour 3 Fruit (Fresh) 1 Fruit (Dried) 1 Fruit (Canned) 2 Flavouring Essences 6 Ginger (Ground) 1 Ice Cream 4 Jams 18 Jelly 2 109 c/f 19 B/f 109 Lard 4 Lemon Curd 6 Milk (Fresh) 25 Milk (Condensed) 1 Mincemeat 1 Meat Paste 2 Miscellaneous 3 Non brewed Condiments 2 Nutmeg (Ground) 2 Pepper 1 Sausages 4 Suet 2 Sweets 8 Sauces 1 Spirits 13 Tea 48 Vinegar 2 Vegetables 4 238 ICE CREAM The majority of the 120 premises that are registered for the sale of ice cream sell prepacked varieties of the well known reliable brands. Where ready mixed gallon cans are supplied necessitating the use of servers it is here that contamination takes place and is responsible for the reports from the laboratory of low grades Re visits are made and methods introduced to ensure improved standards The Standard of Soft Ice Cream from the two machines has been maintained at a satisfactory level. Bacteriological Samples of Ice Cream GRADE 1-7 " II - 9 " III - 8 " IV - 7_ 31 MILK The new designations for milk are now Pasteurized Sterilized and Untreated One distributing centre in the Borough which deals in a small quantity of raw milk was required to re register but under provisions contained in the new regulations, the re registration of dealers selling milk other than Untreated may be postponed until normal expiry of existing licences There were, however the following number of licences issued this year - New licences 3 Transfers - 5 The taking of milk samples to the exclusion of other foods has always been considered to be in conflict with good sampling policy especially when the fact is realized that all milk distributed in Shoreditch is processed at three dairies 20 Therefore milk sampling has continued along those lines which have been considered to provide such safeguards against deterioration of the product as are thought adequate. Not one of the 44 samples of milk taken this year has been adversely reported upon either chemically or bacteriologically. General SchooIs Vending machines Total Chemical 7 13 5 25 Bacteriological 3 14 2 19 44 School Milk During the year six schools within the Borough being supplied by one of the milk distributing companies changed from a bottled to a cartoned milk supply, A survey was conducted with the object of obtaining information which might throw some light on a reported claim that children were not drinking their school milk since it had been supplied in cartons, because of the taste of wax School principals who were interviewed were naturally watching the Changeover with interest and had some constructive criticism to offer, but the general opinion was that the advantages of cartoned milk far outweighted the disadvantages, and nothing was discovered which could justify the statement that because of the taste of wax children were not drinking their milk, - in fact at two schools milk consumption had increased The laboratory report on the examination of school cartoned milk showed no foreign wax or hydrocarbons and no foreign taint was detectable by smell or taste.

This requirement covers a wide field of eventualities and is enforced by the Port Health Authority, but after the foodstuff has been imported it is the duty of the local authority to follow it through and ensure that it does not at a later date prove to be unwholesome or unfit for human consumption. The importation of new products may have to pass through a trial phase, during which period it may be found necessary to condemn varying quantities of the particular product before a situation is reached whereby the commodity complies with the fitness standards. The increase in the consumption of pickled products has opened up a market here for the importation from Poland and other Eastern European countries of a variety of ingredients. The causes for the condemnation of the considerable amount of cucumbers has been leaking barrels, mould contamination and deterioration of the cucumbers due to insufficient brine strength The quantity of pickled onions was condemned for similar reasons. Gammon is a commodity imported from Poland smoked, cooked and rolled with a synthetic covering Not always under refrigeration, it is a product that does not lend itself to long storage, and once discolouration is detected the substance deteriorates rapidly and becomes unfit. The quantity of bacon both imported and home produced found unfit for human consumption included bits and trimmings After inspection it was allowed to go to approved premises for the extraction of fats and oils. The required form was signed and presented by the purchaser in every instance, guaranteeing that the amounts will be used only for technical fat extraction by him Suspicion arose concerning a consignment of imported canned fruit salad at a wholesale warehouse A percentage examination of the consignment disclosed a high proportion of blown and otherwise unsound cans; this was followed by a 100% examination of the 500 cartons. The percentage of unfit cans was so high as to warrant the surrender of the total consignment for destruction. The importation of dried mushrooms from Eastern European Countries has increased considerably. The reason for its growth in popularity is that the specific type of mushroom Boletus Edulus which grows wild in such countries as Yugoslavia and Rumania possesses a much stronger flavour than the cultivated mushroom. The product is subject to a grinding process which renders it very acceptable for inclusion as a flavouring ingredient for prepared foods. 22 Initial consignments were watched carefully for purity standard, and one particular parcel was found to be so grossly contaminated with foreign material of every kind that the importer put into effect the recommendation of the Department that the whole consignment be re-exported to Yugoslavia The quality standard has now improved considerably and the amount of foreign bodies found in the commodity is negligible. MARKETS Licensed street traders engaged in the sale of food for human consumption in the Borough are listed as follows:- Hoxton Street Broadway Market Nile Street Calvert Avenue Fruit & Vegetables 43 10 2 - Fish - wet 5 1 - - Fish - shell 2 - - - Poultry 2 - 1 - Meat 1 - - - Groceries 11 - 1 - Sweets & Confectionery 5 - - - Cakes and biscuits 3 - - Refreshments 1 - - 1 Conditions in general in relation to street trading cannot be said to have deteriorated in any way but the proposed introduction of the new Food Hygiene (Markets Stalls etc,) Regulations has had a somewhat delaying effect on certain phases of market control on the assumption that in the not-too-fardistant future new legislation will become operative which will require improvements to be enforced that cannot be asked for at the moment. The implementation of some of the requirements will undoubtedly call for Byelaw amendments which will take time to introduce but the position is kept constantly under review Public Houses Where as a result of routine inspections of public houses a recommendation has been made to the Brewery Company that the existing sanitary arrangements could with advantage be improved, the Company have received the suggestions favourably and where possible have carried them into effect, or included them in their estimates for the following year Three such incidents have borne fruit this year Pharmacy & Poisons Act. 1933 Thirty two licences under the above Act were issued during the year. Regular observations and routine visits were made to shops and stalls in search of unauthorised sellers Pharmacy & Medicines Act 1941 Observations were kept in connection with the requirements under the above Act but no contraventions were noted during the year Merchandise Marks Act, 1926 There were no contraventions of the above Act during the year and strict observation was kept of all food premises and stalls in the Borough in relation to this subject 23 Complaints in connection with food, received from members of the public Suspected unfit condition of - The sample was submitted for chemical examination bottled lemonade and the laboratory reported that no abnormal smell or taste was detected, neither were any injurious constituents found - no further action.

Moth in loaf of bread - Bakehouse and flour store inspected, no evidence of moths at time of visit - premises maintained in satisfactory condition - letter sent to Bakery Company. 24 EXCEPTIONAL INCIDENTS The Typhoid Epidemic in Aberdeen during the months of May and June had gained such proportions that the introduction of certain precautionary measures became justified over a wide area of the country. All possible sources of spread had to be investigated and steps taken to eliminate the chances of suspected commodities being used for human consumption. To this end all such places as transport cafes were visited by Health Department staff and enquiries made regarding the places from whence the long distant lorry drivers had come all schools hospitals institutions, wholesale warehouses and other food premises were also visited to ascertain the type and brand of specific commodities that were being used This extensive survey entailing long hours of duty was put into operation before any Ministry directive had been dispatched so that when certain information was received some 3 days later in confidential documents from the Ministry of Health, it only remained to revisit those places that were known to have in stock the specifically mentioned brands 40 cans of corned beef were temporarily confiscated and not released until assurance had been received that the comnodity was safe to be used A large quantity of bacon approximately 2¾ tons being transported by lorry to its various destinations became involved in a road accident in which the lorry was overturned depositing the bacon into the roadway where it became contaminated with fragments of broken glass The total consignment was returned to the wholesale warehouse for examination, where 163 lbs of bacon was found to be totally unfit for human consumption and condemned by the Health Department The remainder was allowed to be delivered to premises where it would be subjected to special treatment (under supervision of the Health Department staff of that area) which would render it suitable for prescribed uses CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN Public opinion was re awakened during the year to the fact that unless cleanliness be practised in the preparation and handling of food at all times, anxiety, worry and illness creating chaos in our every day life could result. Hoping for a worthwhile response whilst this topic was uppermost in mind, it was considered opportune to engage in an intensive food hygiene campaign aimed at improving standards of food handling in general and to educate the personnel in the correct conception of hygiene The theme adopted for this campaign pointed to the destruction of harmful bacteria and the popularizing of the use of detergents, plus sterilizers, in all cleaning processes Circular letters were delivered to all food premises explaining how cross infection was started and pointing out the advantages to be gained by the introduction of one of the sterilizing agents in all washing operations The campaign terminated with a one day exhibition and film show held in the Town Hall Old Street presided over by the Deputy Mayor Mr Councillor C H Turner, B E M Twelve leading manufacturers of materials and products associated with the subject of clean food handling had accepted the invitation and displayed quite a range of measures available to fight the danger of cross infection The attendances could have been larger but the representative cross sections of the community that did attend were very appreciative and went away possessed of knowledge on the subject of clean food handling which they otherwise would not have had. 25 ATMOSHERIC POLLUTION Smoke Control Areas Further progress has been made during 1964 to accelerate the Council's original Smoke Control Programme phased for completion in 1967. The whole Borough will be under complete smoke control by September 1965 providing the Minister approves the last Smoke Control Area in the Moorfields Ward, and thus two years will be clipped off the seven years programme, completing in five years what was origninally estimated to take seven years. The Shoreditch (Haggerston) Smoke Control Order was confirmed on the 11th December 1963 and become operative on the 1st September 1964 and comprises Area Nos 6 and 7 on the Map The final Smoke Control Area (Area No, 8 on the Map) was resolved by the Council on the 1st December 1964 and is awaiting Ministerial confirmation. Details of the numbers of applications received this year for the adaptation and replacement of fireplaces together with the number of conversions completed during the year are hereunder enumerated:- Applications Approved Conversions completed 483 545 in respect of 543 fireplaces Future Additional Grants for approval appliances The Ministry, having recognised the need for appliances capable of burning efficiently the less popular types of smokeless fuels, have authorised the Council to pay a higher grant to owners or occupiers of dwellings covered in future smoke control programmes in respect of certain types of appliances capable of burning the inferior and cheaper types of fuels efficiently, and as a result grants may be made on openable stoves to encourage occupiers to burn these inferior types of fuels as opposed to the premium fuels which are in short supply and cost more. So far as electric space heating is concerned grants may now only be paid in future smoke control areas in respect of electric storage heaters and no grants will be paid on any other form of electric fire. Deliveries of small quantities of solid smokeless fuels The problem of obtaining regular small supplies of solid smokeless fuel particularly in blocks of flats where there are no lifts is a very real problem and a deterrent to those living therein to use solid fuel for space heating. The fact that accommodation for the storage of solid fuel in blocks of flats throughout the Borough is very limited is one salient cause of this vexed problem together with the fact that those delivering the fuel are very reticent to carry it to dwellings above the first floor, and this is perhaps very understandable. Shoreditch is not alone in this problem and it is common throughout the whole Country where circumstances are similar the only solution would seem to be the siting of automatic vending machines in convenient places so as to enable all occupiers of houses and flats to obtain small quantities of fuel at reasonable price as and when required Such facilities are available and such machines are already on the market and it is suggested that very serious consideration should be given to solving this problem for those desirous of burning solid smokeless fuel. 26 No. 1 Shoreditch (Hyde Road) S.C.O.

During 1964 prices remained much the same and I am pleased to say regarding Gloco and Cleanglow prices were slightly cheaper and whilst Sunbrite had increased 1/- per cwt this fuel is little used because of its lack of popularity in Shoreditch.

Industrial Nuisances More than the usual number of complaints have been received regarding Industrial smoke nuisances and other nuisances - that is to say sawdust from Saw Mills and Fumes from paint spraying factories. This I believe is an indication that householders in Smoke Control Areas are becoming much more Clean Air Minded" Shoreditch is the hub of the furniture industry and, as reported in previous Annual Reports accommodation for the storage of wood waste is very limited in the numerous small factories throughout the Borough, In the past every effort has been made by the occupiers of these to dispose of these waste products by burning in fireplaces which were never designed for this purpose. The result is therefore that volumes of smoke from smouldering wood waste are emitted to the atmosphere A great deal of work will have to be done and other means devised for the disposal of wood waste when the Moorfield Area is confirmed and becomes operative in this Borough. Measurement of Smoke Pollution Daily measurements of the quantity of smoke and sulphur dioxide are recorded by the volumetric apparatus installed in the Town Hall and the monthly averages of the quantity of smoke is appended in a graph for the two years 1963/1964 The 1964 graph showns a noticeable reduction of approximately 12% in the level of smoke pollution as compared with the previous years. The measuring apparatus at the Town Hall is not at present included in a Smoke Control Area and the very low summer figures are very satisfactory as the apparatus is sited in an Industrial/Commerial Area. The high October Figure is due to some fog experience rather earlier in the winter than is usual but fortunately this did not develop into a serious smog. The monthly averages of the quantity of sulphur dioxide in the air is given on the graph for the years 1963/1964. and the 1964 graph shows an increase of approximately 12% in the level of sulphur dioxide as compared with the previous year The emission of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere is increasing, and unfortunately this cannot be adequately controlled by local authorities alone. 28 SMOKE POLLUTION MICROGRAMMES OF SMOKE PER CUBIC METRE 29 SULPHUR DIOXIDE POLLUTION MICROGRAMMES OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE PER CUBIC METRE 30 HOUSING Details of Redevelopment Work carried out during 196b 3 Clearance Areas were resolved involving 18 premises. 4 Compulsory Purchase Orders were confirmed involving 136 premises. No Demolition Order was made. No Closing Order was made. 30 Undertakings not to re-let until premises were made fit, were accepted 1 Undertaking was cancelled - premises being made fit 345 Premises were demolished 241 New flats were completed 1,165 New flats were in course of erection 101 Routine inspections under Section 3, Housing Act, 1957. Loans and Grants 1 Application for Standard Improvement Grants was received and approved, 2 Applications for Discretionary Improvement Grants were received and approved. Underground Rooms During 1964 representations were made to the Public Health Committee resulting in - 2 Closing Orders being made 9 Undertakings being accepted not to re-let until premises rendered fit, Derelict sites Derelict sites throughout the Borough still present many problems but gradually are disappearing as new buildings take their place. Their value as parking places for cars now that parking meters are in operation in Shoreditch has greatly increased and this automatically results in keeping many sites presentable which would otherwise develop into refuse dumps. Drainage plans All drainage plans submitted to the local authority are perused by the Public Health Inspectors before they are submitted to the appropriate committee for approval. During the year 78 plans were perused and numerous interviews have taken place with architects, builders, owners and others concerned in the works involved Overcrowding and Preferential Treatment At the end of 1963 the number of overcrowded cases on the Public Health Departmental Register was 47 and the number of cases on the Register for Preferential Treatment on medical grounds was 9. No new case of overcrowded conditions was added to the register during the year but 29 families were removed having been rehoused or found alternative accommodation themselves The number of cases remaining on the Overcrowding Register at the end of the year therefore was 18 the number remaining on the Preferential Treatment Register being 9 16 visits of inspection were made Rent Act 1957 No application was received during the year under the Rent Act 1957. Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 No application was made to the local authority under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 during the year 31 HOUSING ACT 1961 Houses in Multiple Occupation Whilst the subject of houses in multiple occupation is not a serious problem in the Borough of Shoreditch the thin end of the wedge appears to have been established in the North East corner of the Borough, and a great deal of the District Public Health Inspectors' time has been devoted to maintaining some measure of control. Unfortunately this has resulted in other duties having to be deferred for the time being but the results obtained have been most encouraging and well worth while. The amount of time investigating and ascertaining information in connection with any one of these premises has to be experienced to be believed, for numerous problems arise and very often the wisdom of Solomon is required and the patience of Job to obtain the necessary information as to who is the occupier, who is the owner and as to whether those residing in the premises are members of one family or not. Family relationships as in the case of Hindus, Cypriots, Jamaicans, etc., have a far different meaning in those particular countries than the definition we give to family relationship in this country For instance, a god-father will claim that his godson is a member of his family. One need not stretch his imagination very far to realise that co¬operation is lacking from those who are likely to be evicted as the result of our investigations It is not surprising in the case of many immigrants who occupy such premises that their knowledge of English quickly dries up when enquiries are being made - which adds enormously to our problem. This has meant a lot of work well outside the normal working hours, often late on Saturday evenings and even on Sundays, in addition to late visits throughout the week by the Public Health Inspectors, who are to be congratulated for the enthusiasm shown in conducting duties which quite often may be described as of the most unpleasant tasks It is interesting to note that, whilst the Act defines a house let in multiple occupation as one which is occupied by members of more than one family. that the Act fails to describe or give any definition as to who may be considered to be members of one family, in other words where family relationship begins and ends In Shoreditch we are very alive to this problem and every effort is made to prevent the occurrence of overcrowding in premises which lack amenities and are totally unfit for use as houses in multiple occupation Indeed, wherever premises are noted to be for sale or are unoccupied and are of a type likely to be let in multiple occupation energetic measures are immediately taken by the Shoreditch Borough Council to fix a limit of occupation on the premises. In many instances where the houses are lacking in amenities a NIL limit is imposed on the premises and we have found by our experience that this is a policy very well worth while pursuing Worthy of mention is the policy of the Council that whenever an application is made for loan purchase whenever the premises lend themselves for multiple occupation, a clause is inserted in the Agreement for the loan, to the effect that multiple occupation shall not be permitted without the written consent of the Borough Council Whilst the services of Technical Assistants are of some value in this important work they are of little value in dealing with the type of people encountered, because of the lack of experience and tact (and sometimes bluff and pursuasion) which is required in dealing with occupants of this class of property. The measures taken by the Shoreditch Borough Council as above defined appear to be proving their worth in not only preventing the occurrence of multiple overcrowding and bad living conditions, but in an uplift in the standards of those houses which are already let in multiple occupation. 32 RODENT CONTROL It is now twelve months since an experiment was commenced in Shoreditch in co¬operation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to see what could be done to eradicate rats completely from sewers in a Central London Borough as opposed to the traditional method of merely controlling the rat population in sewers. A campaign has been conducted as a military operation maintaining constant poisoning at the points on the Borough boundary where the trunk sewers enter and leave the Borough. The object of this operation was to prevent rats entering the Borough from other local authority areas thus containing them within defined limits. A mopping up campaign was then conducted by direct poisoning with 1081 (Sodium Fluoracetamide) at four-monthly intervals At the end of the year test baits were laid to assess the results of the 12 months' work, with the following results - Complete takes Partial Takes No Takes 64 NIL (These slight takes may however have been over-estimated, for where doubt was experienced such are included in this figure of 64) 342 Never before in the history of Shoreditch has any success similar to this been achieved; indeed, what was considered to be good results two years ago would now be considered to be far from satisfactory. As a matter of interest, the treatment has covered some 65,000 yards of sewers, a little over half being 3 ft high or over and the remainder being less than 3 ft Let there be no mistake that the vast amount of work employed in the effective sealing and abolition of disused drains, has had a great bearing on the results obtained In the opinion of the Chief Public Health Inspector, the vast amount of effort put into this side of the project, even though staff can be ill spared is of paramount importance, This subject is further amplified under the drainage section of the report. The almost complete absence of surface infestations throughout the Borough during the year is a positive indication of the very drastic reduction of the rat population in the sewers and of the effectiveness of the proper sealing and abolition of all disused drains. The almost complete absence of rats in factories and warehouses and similar places is another very definite indication of success The policy of encouraging occupiers of business premises to entrust the destruction of rodents in such premises to the local authority through Contracts has continued with success, and the number of contracts maintained throughout the year was 69 yielding an income of £1,582. 33 single treatments were carried out yielding £234. 33 REPORT FOR PERIOD 1ST JANUARY 31ST DECEMBER 1964 Council Property Dwelling Houses Business Premises Total No of properties in Borough 16 12,008 3,768 15,729 No of properties inspected as a result of (a) Notification 2 125 44 171 (b) Survey under the Act - 11 548 559 (c) Otherwise - 107 58 165 Total inspections carried out 88 1 613 4,508 6, 209 No of properties inspected which were found to be infested by (a) Rats - Major - - - - Minor - 13 19 32 (b) Mice Major - - - - Minor 2 100 83 185 No of infested properties treated by Local Authority 3 113 102 218 No. of notices served under Section 4 of the Act (a) Treatment - 1 - 1 (b) Structural works (i e Proofing) No of cases where action was taken following - - - - service of Notice - - - - Legal Proceedings - - - - Number of block schemes carried out - 34 Details of treatment carried out are as follows - Business premises Dwellings Rats Mice Rats Mice Warfarin trays laid 170 351 75 702 Traps set 318 - 47 - DRAINAGE WORKS As in the past the rapid state of development (both private and Council) within the Borough has continued with increasing momentum and the Public Health Inspectorate of Shoreditch being responsible for all drainage works both old and new have been very busily engaged in this part of their duties. In connection with drainage works both sealing off and abolition of disused drains as clearance work proceeds is considered to be of paramount importance notwithstanding the vast amount of work this entails for it is the best insurance against trouble from rodent infestation that may occur in the future if this important work is neglected. Plans for the sealing and abolition of disused drains are formulated long before the premises are vacated and before the demolition contractor commences work The procedure in Shoreditch is that as soon as knowledge is gained that properties are likely to be demolished Technical Assistants make a full survey of the drainage system record this on ordnance sheets and indicate by painting on the kerb the actual positions where sealing off of the drains is to take place when eventually the premises are demolished. Here again is a vivid example where Technical Assistants can be very usefully engaged working under the strict control of the Public Health Inspector thus saving the Public Health Inspector valuable time which can be spent on more useful work. When demolition eventually does take place the disused drains are properly sealed at the sewer end where it is possible to enter the sewer, but where this is not possible such as in the case of piped sewers properly prepared bags filled with cement concrete are pushed down the drain to within a foot or so of the sewer and the drain is properly filled or abolished behind this cement concrete bag. Reference to the Rodent Section of this Report will more fully amplify the importance of the work involved in this Section of drainage works. 34 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION 11 rooms were disinfected following infectious diseases and for other reasons 330 rooms were sprayed against vermin. 19 articles were disinfected at the Council s disinfecting station following infectious diseases 7,081 verminous articles were treated at the Council's Disinfecting Station. No Notices was served in respect of verminous premises 156 visits were made to premises. 8 in respect of infectious disease enquiries and 148 in respect of vermin Articles belonging to private firms were disinfected at their request and charges amounting to £14 were made. During the year 383 families were removed to new Council dwellings as compared with 318 in 1963. All furniture is subjected to Hydrogen Cyanide disinfestation and all mattresses are put through the Council's disinfector prior to removal to their new accommodation by private removal contractors under the supervision of the Officers of the Department Prior to removal the Officers of the Department visit the premises, assess the amount of furniture to be removed and arrange for the number of removal vans required On the day of removal an Officer of the Department supervises the placing of all furniture in the vans and arranges for the reception of soft furniture in a room which can be securely locked until tests carried out to ensure that the furniture is clear of Hydrogen Cyanide have proved satisfactory 6 sites were sprayed to prevent further nuisance from vermin and flies and at the request of the Public Health Inspectors 17 mattresses and other articles were removed for destruction by the Cleansing Department. The measures taken to prevent the breeding of beetles in heating ducts on new Local Authority Estates whilst in construction are a vital duty of the Public Health Inspectors. Personal Cleanliness The arrangement with Finsbury Borough Council whereby residents of Shoreditch requiring treatment for Scabies or vermin, are sent to that Authority's Cleansing Station at Pine Street was continued throughout the year. The number of treatments carried out are shown in the following tables:Verminous Persons New Cases Total new cases Re-attendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years - - - - - Scabies New Cases Total new cases Re-attendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years - 5 5 2 7 (Until school leaving age the L C C. treat all affected children at their own Centre). 35 FACTORIES (Factories Act 1961) Number of Factories in Shoreditch 970 Number of (a) Basic Routine Inspections made 1,786 (b) Re-inspections made 280 Total number of inspections made 2,066 Whilst the erection of many new factories, offices, garages and petrol filling stations continues in the Borough the numerous small factories because of lack of accommodation, provide a very serious problem where nothing more than the bare requirements of facilities and amenities for the staff according to the Factories Acts can be provided The problem of the retention of trade refuse and its disposal in such limited accommodation continues to present a real problem, particularly in Smoke Control Areas where for economic reasons of disposal and the provision of cheap space heating an attempt is made to dispose of these trade wastes in inefficient fireplaces and appliances Particulars of the administration of the Factories Act 1961 in the form required by Ministry of Health Circular 1/65 are as follows:- Part 1 of the Act Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted (1) Factories in which Sections 1 2 3 4 & 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 210 142 2 (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by L A 750 1,910 27 (iii) Other premises in which Section ^ is enforced by the L A (excluding Outworkers Premises) 5 14 - - Total 965 2 066 29 - 2 Cases in which defects were found:- Particulars Number of cases in which defects were found Number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted Found Remed ied Referred To H M Inspector By H M Inspector Want of cleanliness (S. 1) .. - - - - - Overcrowding (S 2) - - - - - Unreasonable temperature (S 3) - - - - - Inadequate ventilation (S 4) - - - - - Ineffective drainage of floors (S 6) - - - - - Sanitary Conveniences (S 7) • (a) Insufficient _ . _ (b) Unsuitable or defective 30 40 - 16 - (c) Not suitable for sexes - - - - - Other offences against the Act (not including offences relating to outwork) - - - - - Total 30 40 - 16 - 36 (a) Outworkers Number of outworkers in Shoreditch 233 Number of basic routine inspections made 138 56 Lists of outworkers were received from employers in the Borough. 718 persons of whom 577 were not resident in Shoreditch were included in these lists 279 outworkers living in Shoreditch but working for firms outside the Borough were notified by 18 Local Authorities. Again one must refer to the Vast amount of what one considers to be unnecessary administrative work thrust upon the local authority Public Health Departments in respect of outworkers, One must again repeat, that if an obligation were placed on the firms responsible for supplying local authorities with lists of outworkers to notify the several authorities in which their outworkers reside, it would be to everyone' s advantage, and very much reduce the work of the clerical staff of local authorities.

Number of basic routine visits made 800 Number of re-inspections made 115 Total number of inspections made 915 Number of notices served PET ANIMALS ACT 1951 Five premises were licensed under this Act during the year. In 4 cases a considerable business is carried on, mostly in budgerigars and goldfish, but the other one deals on a very small scale only, in pigeons, rabbits, etc. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT 1952 General observation was kept on the sale of heating appliances to ensure that they complied with the Regulations made under the above-named Act. In several cases the sellers and users of heating appliances requested that their guards be tested. OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES ACT 1963 Long before the inception of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, the forces of this Department were mustered and a policy defined as to how the Public Health Inspectorate were to carry out the administration of the Act, so that when it eventually came into force on 1st August 1964 all was prepared to continue with this important piece of legislation. The first step was to ensure that all premises of a type which came under the Act should be registered, and to this end full assistance of three assistants were employed making a complete survey of the Borough street by street and visiting any premises likely to come within the scope of the Act, at the same time-delivering registration forms and giving advice as may be necessary to the occupiers of the premises. In all about 800 premises were visited and in due course a little below 80% of the registration forms duly completed were returned to the Public Health Department. To those who had failed to register, an appropriate letter was sent reminding those responsible of their obligations for registration under the Act and also of the penalties involved should they fail to register the premises. This resulted in over 90% of registrations being received by the Department and a final letter couched in more severe terms was sent to the remaining offenders which brought in all but about one dozen outstanding registration forms. Information concerning these outstanding registrations was presented to the Public Health Committee and the Town Clerk sent final warning letters which in due course brought in 100% registrations and this work was completed within three months of the Act coming into operation. From the moment registration forms were received by the Department, a complete inspection was made of the premises, priority being given to the larger offices some of which, in Shoreditch, employ upwards of 600 personnel. The inspection was divided into two stages (a) the obtaining of factual information and the preparation of sketch plans by the Technical Assistants and (b) a detailed inspection of the premises by the Public Health Inspector being armed with the factual Information before entering the premises. 38 In order to facilitate the work and to ensure its administration in a uniform manner throughout all premises within the Borough, a standard form of defects as compiled by the Chief Public Health Inspector and with the use of pocket tape recorders, the Public Health Inspector was enabled to dictate contraventions directly onto tape the audio-typist typing the appropriate notice direct from the tape. In this manner the Public Health Inspector spent little or no time at the office dictating Notices or drafting Notices for the benefit of the typist, and was thus enabled to carry on with his routine inspections without any impediment of any kind output of work thus being carried out to the highest degree. It is a pleasure to report that at the end of the year a great deal of work was being carried out in response to the Notices served and it is most encouraging to the Department proving beyond doubt that the work of preparation carried out well before the date of the application of the Act has paid a good dividend. The value of Technical Assistants to obtain factual information working under the strict control of the Public Health Inspector cannot be overestimated and there is a vast field of employment for this type of personnel working strictly under controlled conditions.

A chlorine content of 1,0 to 1.5 parts per million is maintained during trade with a pH value of 7.6 Back washing of filters is done by air agitation ofsand and washing through to waste by M W B water from a main storage tank The pool is emptied and re filled as conditions and analysis indicate. Cleaning of the pool sides and bottom is carried out every morning before opening and during the day as circumstances permit During the year samples of water were taken from the bath and sent for Bacteriological examination and Chemical analysis Results received from both laboratories showed the water to be satisfactory in every case. RAG DEALERS There are 2 premises in the Borough in which the business of Rag Dealer is carried out, 4 visits of inspection were made WATER SUPPLY The water supply of the Borough is controlled by the M W B and is relayed from public mains direct to premises 40 PUBLIC HEALTH PROPAGANDA Health propaganda posters were posted and regularly changed from time to time on the Public Health notice boards which are fixed in positions on the Council's housing estates, in the Town Hall and Public Libraries, There is also a large notice board situated in St John s Churchyard A rack containing leaflets of various type is kept filled at the entrance to the Department and in addition to this Public Health leaflets have been distributed through the courtesy of the Borough Librarian and the Public Libraries In-so-far as propaganda under the Clean Air Act is concerned all occupier and owners of properties have received information letters and booklets Very wide publicity is being given to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, particularly those affecting Smoke Control Areas All occupiers in proposed Smoke Control Areas and the owners of the properties have received relevant literature in this direction Articles have been written and published in the "Newsletter" published monthly by the Council but the main propaganda has been by direct verbal transmission in the kitchens of cafes and restaurants factories and offices, and all types of premises for it is firmly believed that this type of propaganda really carries a great deal of weight A great deal of publicity of the work of the Public Hfealth Department has been afforded through the medium of the Television Authorities in the B B C s overseas programmes in the National and local Press and in professional journals ANTI FLY CAMPAIGN The campaign to combat the fly nuisance has been continued By arrangement and with the co operation of the Cleansing and Transport Superintendent all dust bins and dust chutes are dusted during the fly breeding season with gammexane after the receptacles are emptied by the Council's refuse collectors. A full survey has been made of all refuse container compartments at the foot of dust chutes in local authority flats because of the rapidly changing nature of refuse as the Smoke Control Programme continues Working in close harmony with the Borough Engineer work of repair and improvement commenced to bring refuse container compartments up to the standard of the British Code of Practice No 306 (1960).
