To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the vital statistics and sanitary work for the Registration Year 1907, 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1907. POPULATION. The population of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was estimated at 116,510 at the middle of the year 1907. BIRTHS. During the 52 weeks ending the 28th December, 1907, 3,323 births (1,615 males and 1,708 females) were registered, compared with 3,260 in 1906, 3,290 in 1905, and 3,265 in 1904. The birth-rate in the Borough was equivalent to an annual rate of 28.5 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 28.2 for 1906 and 28.7 for the two preceding years and with an average of 28.5 per 1,000 for past ten years. The birth-rate in London was 25.8 per 1,000, compared with 26.7, 27.l and 27.9 for the years 1906, 1905 and 1904 respectively, with an average of 28.6 per 1,000 for the past ten years. The birth-rate in England and Wales was 26.3 per 1,000, in the 76 great towns 27.0, and that in the 142 smaller towns 25.7 per 1,000. The subjoined table gives the number of births which occurred in each Ward, also the birth-rate in each Ward. (See also Table 10). Ward. Births. Birth Rate per 1,000. Males. Females. Total.

The number of deaths registered during the year was 1833 (males 932 and females 901). Of these 497 occurred in public institutions outside the Borough, 208 occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South Eastern Hospital, of which 188 were non-parishioners, and 4 were of other persons who were also nonparishioners, so that the actual number of deaths, excluding nonparishioners was 1,641, and upon that number the statistics are based. The death-rate for the borough was equal to an annual rate of 14-0 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 16.0 for 1906, 14.3 for 1905 and 16.0 for the year 1904 per 1,000 persons living, with an average of 15.8 for the past 10 years. The number of deaths that occurred in the borough itself, of parishioners only, was 1,148, giving a death-rate of 9.8 per 1,000, of the population. The death-rate in England and Wales was 15.0, in the 75 great towns 15.4, in the 142 smaller towns 14.5, and in the County of London as a whole 14.6. The following table gives the number of deaths which occurred in each ward, and the death-rate in each ward (See also Tables 1, 2, 6, 7, 8):- Ward. Deaths. Death Rate per 1,000. Males. Females.

INFANTILE MORTALITY. Of the 1,641 deaths registered during the year, 356 were infants under one year of age. This number was equal to a rate of mortality of 107 per 1,000 registered births, which is 37 per 1,000 below the rate of 1906, and is lower than the rate of any year on record. Compared with the average in the ten years 1897 to 1906, the rate of infantile mortalitv showed a decrease of 50 Per 1.000. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Year. Deptford. London.

BIRTHS 3323 DEATHS (including 497 in Outlying Public Institutions) 1641 Excess of Births over Deaths 1682 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The following diseases are classified by the Registrar-General under this heading:—Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, "Fever" (Typhus, Enteric and Continued), Diarrhæa, Plague. The zymotic diseases caused 154 deaths as compared with 318, 233 and 211 for the three preceding years. The death-rate from zymotic diseases was 1.33, and for the three preceding years, 1.24, 2.75, 2.32, and the average for the last nine years being 1.92. The zymotic death-rate in England and Wales was 1.26, in the 76 great towns 1.54, and in the County of London 1.42. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The number of notifications received during the year, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 1,248, as compared with 1,171, 991 and 1,129 for the three preceding years. Table No. 3 shows the total number received during the year, the number of cases in each district, also the number removed to hospital from each district. SMALL POX. 1 am glad to say there was no case of this disease notified during the year. SCARLET FEVER. The 800 notifications received during the year related to 774 cases, of these 9 were errors of diagnosis, 24 were of cases which occurred in hospital, thus reducing the net number of cases to 741. The number of cases during the three past years was 674, 603 and 405. The deaths were 13, compared with 16, 9 and 11 in the three preceding years. The death-rate was 0.11, and for the three preceding years 0.13, 0.07, 0.09. 6 The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.09, in the 76 great towns 0.12, in the 142 smaller towns 0.08, and in the County of London 0.14. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3:—North Deptford 181, South Deptford 242, Central Deptford 351. The Metropolitan Asylums Board recently passed a resolution with regard to the continued prevalence of Scarlet Fever, and asked the Local Government Board to institute an enquiry into the cause of the disease, and whether any, and if so, what further means can be adopted for its prevention. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANEOUS CROUP. There were 324 notifications received relating to 300 cases. Of these 38 related to cases amongst the staff of the South-Eastern Hospital and errors of diagnosis, reducing the number of cases to 262, against 290, 143 and 190 for the three preceding years. The deaths registered were 26, and for the three preceding years 18, 9 and 16. The rate of mortality was 0.22 per 1,000 of the population, and for the three preceding years 0.15, 0.07 and 0.14, the rate in England and Wales was 0.16, in the 76 great provincial towns 0.17, in the 142 smaller provincial towns 0.15 and in the County of London 0.16.

There were 34 cases notified, of these 8 were returned as errors of diagnosis, leaving 26 cases against 37 last year; 27 of the cases were removed to hospital. It was not possible to trace the source of the infection in any of the cases. The deaths were 5, in the preceeding three years 6, 6 and 3 respectively. The death-rate was equal to an annual rate of 0.04, and for the preceding three years, 0.05, 0.05 and 0.02. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.07, in the 76 great provincial towns 0.07, in the 142 smaller provincial towns 0.07, and in London as a whole 0.04. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No 3—North Deptford 13, South Deptford 7, Central Deptford 14.

There were 130 notifications of Erysipelas received during the year as compared with 161, 154 and 146 for the three preceding years. PUERPERAL FEVER. There were 5 notifications of this disease received during the year, as compared with 9, 7 and 8 for the three preceding years. 4 cases were removed to hospital. The number of deaths was 1, as compared with 2, 1 and 2 for the three preceding years. The death-rate was equal to 0.008 per 1,000, compared with 0.01, 0.008 and 0.01 for the three preceding years. CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER. (Epidemic Cerebro spinal Meningitis.) Notification of Cerebro-spinal Fever was made compulsory in the Administrative County of London on March 12th, 1907, for a period of six months. This order was further extended (August 27th) for a term of eighteen months from September 13th, 1907. Notices of this order were posted in the Town Hall and other public places in the borough. The number of cases notified in the County of London during the year was 132, whilst in the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford there were two, both of which proved fatal. DIARRHŒA. The total number of deaths registered from the above disease was 20, against 146, 84 and 112 for the three preceding years. Of these 20 deaths, 17 were children under five years of age, 14 of these being under one year of age. The death-rate per 1,000 persons living was equal to 0.18. The death-rates for the past five years in Deptford and London are shown in the following table:— Year. Deptford. London. 1902 0.67 0.53 1903 0.64 0.64 1904 0.98 1.02 1905 0.73 0.73 1906 1.26 0.94 Average for years 1902-1906 0.85 0.77 1907 0.18 0.29 8 The rate of mortality for England and Wales was 0.29, for the 76 great towns 0.40, for the 142 smaller towns 0.29, and for London as a whole 0.32. In North Deptford there were 6 deaths, in South Deptford there were 2, and in Central Deptford 12. MEASLES. The number of cases of Measles dealt with during the year was 726, as compared with 1,007, 600 and 1,029 for the three preceding years. As the disease is not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the above figure does not represent the total number of cases which have occurred in the Borough, as our only source of information as to the existence of cases is from the Head Teachers of the London County Schools. The same procedure is adopted in the case of measles, with regard to disinfection, as if it was notifiable. The number of deaths which were registered was 55, as compared with 71, 16 and 72 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality was equal to 0.47 per 1,000 persons living, compared with 0.61, 0.13 and 0.64 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.36, in the 76 great towns 0.43, in the 142 smaller towns 0.41, and in the Metropolis as a whole 0.38. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough was the cause of 35 deaths, compared with 61, 18, and 49 for three preceding years. The death-rate per 1,000 persons living was equal to 0.30 as compared with 0.52, 0.15 and 0.43 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.29, in the 76 great towns 0.35, and in the 142 smaller towns 0.29, and in the County of London 0.38. Of the 35 deaths from this cause, 15 were children under one year of age, and 34 children over one year and under five years. North Deptford had 8 deaths, South Deptford 7 and Central Deptford 20. TUBERCULOSIS. Phthisis or consumption and other tubercular diseases occasioned 181 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 1.56 per 1,000 persons living, that for London as a whole was 1.40. The rate of mortality in the borough for the three preceding years was 1.69, 1.58 and 1.93 respectively. There were 64 deaths registered in North Deptford, 46 in South Deptford and 71 in Central Deptford. 9 The Royal Commission on Tuberculosis have reported, after scientific examination in its own Laboratories and under its own control, that bovine Tubercle Bacillus undoubtedly is a danger to man, and a very serious danger. "There can be no doubt," they say, "that in a certain number of cases the tuberculosis occurring in the human subject, especially in children, is the direct result of the introduction into the human body of the bacillus of bovine tuberculosis; and there can also be no doubt that in the majority at least of these cases, the bacillus is introduced through cows' milk. Cows' milk containing bovine tubercle bacillus is clearly a cause of tuberculosis and of fatal tuberculosis in man." A Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Paddington Borough Council, "on the question of taking measures to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (consumption)" was held at the Town Hall, Paddington, on the 6th June, 1907. Twenty-six City and Borough Councils out of 29, were represented. Councillor Brooks and the Medical Officer of Health represented this borough. The following resolutions were passed:— "That it is desirable that the notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (consumption) should be compulsory, "That application be made to the Local Government Board for an Order to be made— (i.) To include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (consumption) among the diseases to be notified under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; and (ii.) To extend the provisions of the following sections of the above Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (consumption)— Section 60—Cleansing and disinfecting of premises, &c. „ 61—Disinfection of bedding, &c. „ 62—Infectious rubbish thrown into ashpits, &c., to be disinfected. „ 63—Penalty on letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging. „ 64—Penalty on persons letting houses making false statements as to infectious disease. „ 65—Penalty on ceasing to occupy a house without disinfection, or notice to owner, or making false answer. "That it is desirable, in order to limit the spread of Tuberculosis, that provision should be made for public inspection and control, at its several sources, of the milk supply of England, and to ask the Local Government Board to take steps to secure the efficient administration of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885, and Orders amending the same." 10 "That application be made to the Local Government Board for an Order to be made to extend the provisions of Section 69 of the Public Health (London) Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis, in so far as it relates to the milking of cows and to the sale and distribution of milk." "That the provision conferred by Section 7 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, namely, that in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation maintained, be rigidly enforced, and a similar provision extended to all places where people are assembled together for any lengthened period, with a view to restricting the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis. (a) That a sanatorium is needed for the open-air treatment of poor persons suffering from pulmonary consumption, in the early stages of the disease, and should be provided by a Central Authority acting for the Metropolis as a whole. (b) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, by reason of their practical experience in the management of hospitals for infectious disease, being eminently qualified for the position of such authority, the Local Government Board be requested to confer on, or if necessary, to obtain for, the said Managers power to act in that capacity. (c) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should also be empowered to use, for sanatorium purposes, the 'Southern Hospital,' recently erected by them at Carshalton, in the County of Surrey." That the Government be urged to provide "a sum of money annually for the erection and maintenance of suitable sanatoria for the treatment of early cases of consumption." It was further resolved "That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation from the Conference in support of the above resolutions, and that he be urged to take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to them." A deputation was appointed. During the year 1905, 19 of the 29 sanitary areas of London adopted the practice of voluntary notification of phthisis (consumption). Dr. Sykes, the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of St. Pancras, reported to the Council of that borough:—"the experience of St. Pancras during the time that voluntary notification of phthisis has been in force appears to coincide with that of nearly all the other local authorities which have adopted the same course. This experience is that voluntary notification is ideal in theory, but of little value in practice, because the number of cases notified is very small, and the notifications often take place when the patients are moribund." RESPIRATORY DISEASES. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and other diseases of the respiratory organs. The number of deaths c2 11 registered during the year was 373, compared with 329, 329 and 344 for the three previous years. 83 were children under one year of age, 154 children over one and under five years and 102 were persons over 65 years of age.

The arrangement for the bacteriological examination and report upon doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, was renewed by the Council with the Clinical Research Association of No. 1 Southwark Street, London Bridge. The number of examinations made by them during the year ending 28th December, 1907, was 163; 150 of them being for Diphtheria and 13 for Enteric Fever, the result being that 51 were found to be positive and 112 negative :—- Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria 45 105 150 Enteric 6 7 13 51 112 163 At a cost of £35 17s. Od. DISINFECTION. Disinfection is carried out at the Council's Yard by means of a steam apparatus (Washington-Lyons), in which all articles of clothing and bedding are disinfected. Such infected articles which would be destroyed by steam, viz., leather goods, boots, furs, books, etc., are disinfected by formic aldehyde, volotised in an alformant lamp in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. There are two vans employed, one used for collecting infected articles, the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions, all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is made. The number of rooms disinfected by the Council's staff during the year was 1,691. The number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., 13 disinfected at the Council's yard being 9,740. No complaint of damage done to any article was received during the year, and only by the desire of the owner were any articles destroyed. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis where required. Disinfection of wearing apparel, &c., under the Midwives Act, was carried out in 6 cases. 215 books belonging to the Council's Public Library, collected from houses where infectious diseases had occurred, were disinfected before being put back into circulation. 5 premises consisting of 11 rooms were fumigated during the year, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, as being verminous. THE SHELTER. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 60, Sub-Section 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. In consequence of the old shelter in Watson Street being pulled down to make way for the New Coroner's Court and Mortuary, it became necessary to make some other arrangements in case of a shelter being wanted. The Committee authorised me to communicate with the Medical Officer of Greenwich, with a view of being allowed the use of their shelter, and I received the following letter from him— Public Health Department, Royal Hill, Greenwich, S.E. January 17 th, 1907. Dear Sir, I beg to inform you that at the meeting of my Public Health Committee last evening, I further brought up the question of the use of our Disinfecting Shelter by persons from your Borough, pending your making further provision yourselves; and my Committee decided that they will be very pleased to grant you this use at a charge of 5s. per person; with a minimum fee of one guinea. I am, Yours faithfully, Dr. Roberts, Ernest G. Annis. Medical Officer of Health, Deptford. This letter was considered and its terms agreed to by the Committee; I am pleased to say however that there was no need for us to use the Greenwich Shelter during the year. 14 MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. The building was not sufficiently advanced to allow of it being opened before the close of the year. During the year 80 bodies were received into the Mortuary.

In 1890 Parliament passed the Customs and Inland Revenue Act (33 Vict., Cap. 8), in which (Section 26, 2) they granted exemption from inhabited house duty for houses used solely for providing 17 separate dwellings at rents not exceeding 7s. 6d. a week for each dwelling, provided that a certificate is produced from the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the house is situated, to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, with due provision for their sanitary requirements. The Medical Officer of Health must examine such premises on request, for the purpose of ascertaining whether such certificate can properly be given. In 1891 Parliament extended the benefits of the Act, and in 1903 the provisions were again extended and embodied in a new Section (Revenue Act, 1903 (Section 11), the previous enactments being repealed except with regard to the mode of obtaining the certificate. The exact words of the Section are:— II. (i.) Where a house, so far as it is used as a dwelling house is used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings:— (a) The value of any dwelling in the house which is of an annual value below twenty pounds shall be excluded from the annual value of the house for the purposes of inhabited house duty ; and (b) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual value of twenty pounds, but not exceeding forty pounds, shall be reduced to three pence ; and (c) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual rate exceeding forty pounds, but not exceeding sixty pounds, shall be reduced to sixpence. The applications made under this Act during the year were in respect to 74 houses in Trundley's Road relating to 148 tenements; as suitable sanitary accommodation was provided, the certificates were granted. COMMON LODGING HOUSE ACTS, 1851 & 1853. The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common Lodging-houses. The following is a list of Common Lodging-houses registered in this district, providing accommodation for 437 persons; in addition to the above there is Carrington House, Brookmill Road, which provides for 802 lodgers.

The total number of premises inspected was 4,357, whilst re-inspections, calls, services of notices, etc., amounted to 12,435. The number of preliminary notices or " intimations " served during the year was 1,601, whilst the number of " statutory notices " served was 100, and in only one case was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders. Overcrowding was abated in 24 cases without having to take legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year 188 observations were made of chimneys emitting black smoke, and in 29 cases where black smoke was emitted in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, notices were served to abate the nuisance. MOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, made by the Council pursuant to Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 :— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of houses so let or occcupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. (e) For the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises. (/) For the taking of precautions in case of infectious disease. The number on the register is 269, the whole of which were regularly inspected with a view to seeing that they comply with the bylaws as regards cleanliness, overcrowding, etc. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. These premises were kept under constant supervision during the year. The number of inspections being 251, involving 113 premises and 160 rooms, and include hotel kitchens, restaurants, ham, beef and pork shops, fried fish shops, coffee shops, eating houses of all kinds, and any place where food is prepared or cooked for sale to the public or intended for human consumption. The number of premises added 20 to the register during the year was 16, and removed 9, leaving a total of 113. 32 notices were served for the remedying of various defects, and for cleansing. Premises of this nature are now kept in a much better condition than formerly, constant inspection having the desired effect. There is a register kept of all the known premises in the borough. Attention to sausage-making premises was continued, and they were kept in good order and repair, strict cleanliness being enforced and the improvement of last year still continues. PUBLIC HEALTH (REGULATION AS TO FOOD ACT) 1907. During the year this Act was passed, extending the powers of the Local Government Board to make regulations so as to authorise measures to be taken for the prevention of danger arising to the public health from the importation, preparation, storage, and distribution of articles of food or drink intended for sale or human consumption. BAKEHOUSES. Special attention was again given to bakehouse premises during the year. No premises were closed, but one was added, bringing the total number on the register to 78; 76 of these being workshops and two factories. The number of inspections for the year was 336. It was only necessary to serve notice in one case. Underground Premises. No underground premises were closed during the year, the number of such remaining at 28. Cleansing and Limewashing. The periodical cleansing and limewashing was carried out during the year, in accordance with the statutory requirements. I am pleased to report that the bakehouses of the borough are kept in a satisfactory condition. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. These premises were periodically inspected during the year, and attention paid to the provision and cleanliness of sanitary accommodation for the persons employed, both male and female, and various alterations carried out, one firm remodelling the entire system of accommodation. '21 The usual attention was given to the reception and despatch of outworkers lists and returns and the keeping of the necessary registers. Factories. The number of factories on the register at the close of 1906 was 39. During the year 18 were added and 4 removed, leaving 53 on register, involving 125 rooms, at the close of the year. The number of inspections was 95. Number of notices served, 5. Workshops. The number of workshops on the register at the close of the year was 195, with 409 rooms, and the number of inspections 165. Number of notices served, 17. Workplaces. The number of workplaces on the register at the close of the year (including food premises) was 224 with 298 rooms, and the number of inspections 274. Number of notices served, 45. Outworkers. The number of Outworkers on the register at the close of the year was 471. Number of inspections 457. No action was found necessary as to work done in unwholesome premises, but in eight cases, infectious sickness was notified in connection with outworkers' premises, and all articles on hand at the time of notification were disinfected before removal from the premises to the employers. Persons doing work at home as outworkers, constantly change their addresses and this causes frequent amendment of the register. In this way 108 names were cancelled during the year. As found necessary, cleansing and repairs were carried out. No legal proceedings were necessary during the year. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1907. This Act which will come into force in 1908, repeals Section 103 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and substitutes therefor new procedure applicable not only to trade laundries, but also to a laundry carried on as auxiliary to another business, or incidentally to the purposes of any public institution. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS AND PURVEYORS OF MILK. Regular inspection of these premises was kept up during the year. The number on the register in 1906 was 198. During the year 54 were added, and 49 cancelled, leaving 203 on the register. The number of inspections for the year was 541, and 4 notices served. Cleansing and limewashing was carried out when required, and defective or corroded measures or vessels prohibited when found in use. No legal proceedings were necessary during the year. Owing to the very mixed nature of the trade carried on in the small general shops registered for the sale of milk, very strict 22 vision is necessary to keep them in a cleanly condition and in accordance with the orders. It is very desirable that shops should be prohibited from selling milk where articles such as fish, paraffin oil, coal, &c., are sold, which, though they may not be considered strictly a contamination are yet very undesirable articles in connection with the sale of milk, and registration should be limited to such premises as dairies only, or confectionery and butter and provision businesses. This difficulty would be obviated by the adoption of the proposals of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, to be submitted to Parliament next year, giving power to the local authorities to refuse to register, or to remove from the register, any person carrying on in their district the trade of cowkeeper, dairyman or purveyor of milk. Under the present system the Council must register an applicant, but he takes the risk as to non-compliance wth the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. The suggested new provisions state :— "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, or any subsequent Order, any sanitary authority may remove from the register kept by them of persons from time to time carrying on in their district the trade of cowkeepers, dairymen or purveyors of milk, or may refuse to enter upon such register the name of any person carrying on or proposing to carry on the trade of a dairyman or purveyor of milk upon premises which are in the opinion of such sanitary authority, for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk therein. Provided that for the purposes of this section premises shall not be deemed to be unsuitable for the sale of milk therein on any ground inconsistent with the provisions or requirements of any Order or Regulation made under any enactment for the time being in force and applicable to such premises. " Subject to the provisions of this Act, any person who thinks himself aggrieved by the exercise by the sanitary authority of the powers of this Section may appeal to the Council, whose decision shall be final." While much assistance must accrue from the adoption of new provisions of this nature, they might be extended by the substitution of a licence in lieu of registration, in the case of dairymen or purveyors of milk, subjected to an annual renewal as in the case of cowkeepers at the present time, and which would still retain to the London County Council or the sanitary authority, the opportunity of refusal to enter on, or to remove from the register. Special attention was given to the practice of using cans on milk trolleys in the street and for household delivery in a corroded and 23 unfit state, and when found they were prohibited and condemned. This will be strictly enforced in the future, and where found necessary prosecution under the orders will follow. In each case the necessary measures were taken in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. ICE CREAM. Periodical inspection of these premises was carried out and the necessary cleansing and repairs enforced. Very few street barrows were in use during the year. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was 121, an increase of 7 on the previous year. The number of inspections during the year was 217. As usual the business was done chiefly during the summer months, and carried on by Italian wholesale dealers, confectioners and itinerant street vendors. The sale appears to be conducted more in small shops and confectionery establishments, and less by Italian dealers than formerly, which is an improvement. Strict control is required over the Italian dealers, whose habits are not always of a very cleanly character. No legal proceedings were necessary during the year. Notices were served in 5 instances for various defects. COWSHEDS. The following are the Cowsheds in the borough at present licensed by the London County Council:— Charman, Thomas, 14, Vulcan Road 1 cow. Crutcher, George, 117, Pomeroy Street 12 cows. Weston, John, 178-182, Grove Street 14,, Weston, J, & Sons, 33, Octavius Street 25„ Do. 211, Railway Arches, Edward St. 17,, 69„ Infectious Cases. During the year 18 cases of infectious disease were notified in connection with dairy and milkshop premises:— Scarlet Fever 12 cases. Diphtheria 4 „ Enteric Fever 1 „ Erysipelas 1 „ 18 „ 24 The periodical cleansing and lime washing has been regularly carried out in accordance with the bye-laws. No cowshed was closed during the year and the licenses were all renewed by the London County Council. Number of Cowsheds in the borough 5 „ Cows allowed 69 „ Inspections for the year 51 SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The following are the slaughter houses licensed by the London County Council:— Mills, Walter & Son, 160, New Cross Road. Wellbeloved, Alfred, 180, Brockley Road. Wellbeloved, William Henry, 13a, High Street. Williams, William, Friendly Street Mews, Friendly Street. The premises were cleansed and limewashed every quarter as required by the bye-laws. No slaughter houses were closed during the year, and the licenses were all renewed by the London County Council. Number of Slaughter Houses in the Borough 4 ,, Inspections for the year 45 OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. There are still three premises in the Borough carrying on offensive businesses under the offensive trade regulations of the London County Council, viz.:— Messrs. Wheen & Sons, Ltd., Copperas Street. ,, Hills & Sons, Ltd., Frankham Street. Mr. Alfred Sharp, 6, Edward Street. Fifty-one inspections were made during the year, and the cleansing and limewashing and necessary alterations and repairs carried out in accordance with the regulations. During the year the London County Council issued new duly sealed bye-laws for the control of offensive trade premises, and the old bye-laws were revoked. 25 CANAL BOATS. Annual Report for the Year 1907. Gentlemen, January 6th, 1908. I have the honour to present the following report under the Canal Boats Acts for the year ending December 31st 1907:— During the year 30 visits for the purposes of Inspection have been made, on the following dates, viz:—February 14th and 22nd; March 7th, 14th, 21st, 22nd and 28th; April 11th, 16th and 24th ; May 8th, 17th, 22nd and 29th; June 14th, 20th and 28th; July 11th, 18th and 26th; August 2nd, 21st and 29th; September 6th, 14th and 26th; October 3rd, 10th and 18th; November 1st, 7th, 15th, 21st and 29th; December 5th and 20th. Boats were inspected on 12 occasions, as follows, viz;—March 14th, 21st and 28th; April 16th and 24th (2 boats); May 29th; June 28th; July 11th (2 boats); August 21st; October 3rd, 10th and 18th (2 boats). Number of visits 36 Number of boats inspected 15 Infringements. The following matters were found calling for attention : April 24th.-—Boat "Nellie" 220, registered at Brierley Hill— Cabin roof defective and leaking. Under notice to repair. April 24th.—Boat " Thistle " 755, registered at Brierley Hill—No pump on board. Under notice to provide. August 21st—Boat "Charles" 254, registered at Brierley Hill— Cabin damp and cabin roof defective. Under notice to repair. Children on Boats. During the year children of school age were found on 6 boats, and on each occasion reference was made to the local education authority for their attention. This effort is rendered useless by the continual movement of the boats, as before the authority can take any action in the matter the boats are out of the district. No cases of sickness have been found on board the boats during the year. The boats have been found in a very clean and habitable condition. The Canal within the borough is still very little used by boats under the jurisdiction of the Canal Boats Acts. 26 This borough is not a registration authority. The arrangements made for the inspection of boats are—Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector, duly appointed an inspector under the Canal Boats Acts, jointly with other duties as Inspector of Workshops, Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, &c., &c. Name and address of Inspector—Thomas Turner, 161, St. Asaph Road, Brockley, S.E. Remuneration of Inspector—£2 per annum (part of salary as a Sanitary Inspector) apportioned to these duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Thomas Turner, Canal Boats Inspector. I am pleased to say that during the year Inspectors Priest and Shelley both obtained a Special Certificate, after examination at the Royal Sanitary Institute, for the inspection of meat and other food. I frequently visited the Disinfecting Station during the year and am pleased to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. I desire to express my appreciation of my staff who have so ably assisted me during the year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. W. Roberts, Medical Officer of Health.
