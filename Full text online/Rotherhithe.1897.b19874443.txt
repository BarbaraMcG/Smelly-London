Common Lodging Houses. On 18th May, 1897, the Sanitary Committee reported having had under consideration a letter from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, drawing attention to the present state of the law with regard to Common Lodging Houses and then licensing, and suggesting the desirability of representations being made to the Home Secretary by each authority, with the view to the introduction of a Bill consolidating and transferring to the local authorities the administration of the law relating thereto, and giving them at the same time power to license annually with the consequent rights to withhold any license in the event of insanitary condition, mismanagement of other sufficient reason. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committtee- That this Vestry agree with the suggestion of the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, 'Westminster, and that they be so informed, 46 Churchwardens. On 20th April, 1897, the Vestry Resolved, upon the motion of Mr. Stuart, seconded by Mr. Beasley, that a special hearty vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. F. T. Talbot, in recognition of his invaluable services as Churchwarden for nine years, and instructed the Clerk to have the foregoing resolution engrossed on vellum, illuminated and presented to Mr. F. T. Talbot. Drainage. Aspinden Road. On 1st March, 1898, the Vestry Resolved to relay the Sewer in the above road at an estimated cost of £230. Combined. Mr. Vice-Chairman Talbot and Mr. R. W. Moss were appointed Delegates from this Vestry to attend, together with the Clerk, any further meeting of the Conference convened by the Holborn District Board of Works upon the above subject. Electric Lighting. County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited. On 21st September, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered the letter from Mr. Sydney Morse, asking on behalf of the above Company for the formal consent of the Vestry to the Company's application for a Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acts, the proposed compulsory streets being as under:— Union Road. Lower Road. Rotherhithe New Road and Albion Street. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That the Vestrv do not consent to the application. 47 London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited. On 20th April, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered a notice of the Company's intention to lay trunk mains in Raymouth Road, Blue Anchor Lane, and Southwark Park Road, in the parishes of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, and st. Mary, Rotherhithe, approximately as shown on plan accompanying such notice, and also a report of the Surveyor in connection therewith, as follows I have considered the plan of the proposed new trunk main along Raymouth Road, forwarded with their notice by the London Electric Supply Corporation, and have to report that it is proposed to put the new mains under the footway on the north-east side, whilst the present mains are under the footway on the south-west side, thus appropriating both footways. I have informed the Receiver and Manager that I cannot recommend you to sanction this, but that, as in the case of Rotherhithe New Road last year, you will require them to be laid on the same side of the road. I have had openings made along Raymouth Road, and am of opinion that this can be done between the existing main and the forecourts, the space varying from 2-ft. to 2-ft. 10 in. Mr. Bain, however, in his reply. states that it would be almost impossible for them to draw in and joint up the cables after the pipes have been laid in the available space, and if they are not allowed to use the footway on the other side of the road, they will be compelled to use the carriageway, which, in my opinion, would be better than having electric cables on both sides. He, however, suggests as an alternative that they should be allowed to lay the new mains on the north-east side, and that they would dig out the present mains at any time when the vestry are overhauling the footway. If you consent to the new mains being laid on the north-east side, I think it should be subject to the Company agreeing to dig out the present cables and pay for the cost of reinstating the footway as soon as the new ones come into operation. And having power to act, had Resolved— That the notice and plan be approved subject to the Company entering into an agreement to dig out the existing cables and to pay for the cost of reinstating the footway as soon as the new cables come into operation. This was approved by the Vestry. 48 On 4th May, 1897, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Receiver and Manage* of the Company, stating that they had arranged to lay their mains on the south-west side of Raymouth Road, on the understanding that they could begin work on the expiry of their present notice ; also enclosing formal notice before commencing work. This was approved by the Vestry. Her Majesty's Jubilee, 1897- Almshouses. On 20th April, 1897, Mr. Stuart handed in the following notice of motion "I hereby give notice that at the next meeting of the Vestry I shall move that this Vestry take into their consideration the question of what steps shall be taken by them to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen. (Signed) R. L. Stuart. Dated this 20th day of April, 1897." On 4th May, 1897, Mr. Stuart moved in accordance with the before-mentioned notice, which was seconded by Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley, and carried.

The Gas Company, however, requiring to be paid £28 8s. for the six or £3 18s. each meter, the Vestry on the 3rd August, 1897, instructed the Surveyor to purchase two only for the purpose.

Under Section 20 of the above Act, power is given to Her Majesty by order in Council to declare as respects any County or part of a County, that after a specified day, registration of title to land is to be compulsory on sale. A letter was received from the London County Council drawing attention to the above, and stating that the Council had received a letter from the Privy Council, giving notice that it was proposed to issue an order applying Part 3 of the Act to the County of London, and inviting an expression of the Vestry's views upon the proposal. The Vestry on 18th January, 1898, Resolved— That the Council be informed, that in the opinion of this Vestry it is very undesirable that Part 3 of the Act should be applied to London, having regard to the large number of properties which would be affected thereby, and that some other less important County should be selected for the trial of the experiment of compulsory registration. 63 Metropolitan 'Water Company's Bill.

On 16th November, 1897, the Vestry Resolved to tar pave the footway at the rear of No. 45, Adams Gardens, and provide a blue brick channel along one side at an estimated cost of £14, and instructed the Surveyor to apportion the cost thereof upon the owners liable to pay the same under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, Amendment Act, 1890. On 14th December, 1897, the Common Seal of the Vestry was affixed to the apportionment:— 65 £ s. d. Mr. Henry Packer 6 7 8 „ Bird 4 0 5 ,, Beacon 093 „ James Mahoney 3 2 8 £14 0 0 Clarence Street. On 6th April, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the proposed crossing in Clarence Street, from Dodd's Place to York Place having had submitted to them the following report of the Surveyor:- I have to report that the cost of repairs to the Macadam roadway of Clarence Street for the two years ending March, 1897, amounts to £81 9s. 7d. The roadway now requires picking up, stoning all over with broken granite, and rolling, the cost of which I estimate at £135. I also estimate the cost of paving the roadway with 4-in. by 7-in. granite setts upon a foundation of 6 in. cement concrete, (including relaying the existing kerb on concrete, relaying the footways, and providing new stones where required,) at £1,375. I cannot at present recommend the street to be paved, as the existing sewer is in a very defective condition and will be required to be relaid before very long, but, as it will be dealt with in my scheme for the re-drainage of that district, I have refrained from bringing this matter before you until I submit the entire scheme for your consideration. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That Clarence Street bo temporarily repaired for the present, and that the question of the crossing stand over until the existing sewer has been relaid, and that the Committee then take into consideration the question of paving the whole of the street upon loan. Hadland Street. On 2nd November, 1897, the Vestry Resolved—That the Surveyor prepare an estimate of the cost of macadamising that portion of the roadway at present unmade, and paving the 66 unpaved portion of the footway, with the provision of a granite kerb and three-course channel, and apportion the same upon the owners liable upon both sides of the road under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 and 18G2, and the Amending Act of 1890. On 14th December, 1897, the Common Seal of the Vestry was affixed to the apportionment:— £ s. d. School Board for London 59 19 3 Surrey Commercial Dock Company 11 14 0 Mrs. Wells 28 5 6 Mr. Muney 19 6 9 „ R. Snow 9 8 6 £128 14 0 > Silver Street. On 5th October, 1897, the Vestry Resolved—That the footway be relaid with Victoria stone and provided with granite kerb and three-course channel, and that that portion of the roadway on the north side of the chapel, to the entrance opposite Messrs. Mills & Knight's premises, be macadamised at a total estimated cost of £260. Union Road. On 18th May, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having met and conferred with the Directors of the London, Deptford and Greenwich Tramways Company, as to their request that the Vestry should reconsider the question of an additional passing place opposite the Conservative Association premises in the Union Road; that it would be remembered that the Vestry had already agreed to consent to the extension of the two existing passing places on either side of Cathay Street and Paradise Street respectively, subject to the Company agreeing to lay wood in front of Christ Church and maintain the same, which, however, the Company contended, would be of no material advantage to them. 67 Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That upon the Company agreeing to lay wood in front of Christ Church and maintain the same, the Vestry consent to an additional passing place on the north side of Union Road. On 1st June, 1897, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Secretary of the London, Deptford and Greenwich Tramways Company, Limited, stating in reply to the Vestry's letter of 20th May, 1897, that the Directors, while being obliged to the Vestry for giving consent to the insertion of a new passing place on the north side of Union Road as indicated, and agreeing as they did to the laying and maintaining of wood paving immediately in front of Christ Church, they desired to emphasise the point that the same must not bo construod into a precedent for any similar alteration of paving by any person or body whatever, so far as that Company are concerned, and that upon hearing from the Vestry confirming the same, the construction of the passing place would be proceeded with forthwith; also that the Directors understood that the wood to be used is to be the hardest possible, and that the Vestry will pave the three feet outside the rails at the same time as they do the space between the Company's margin and the kerb, the Vestry charging the Company the net price thereof. Resolved—That the Clerk write in reply, stating that the Vestry cannot bind themselves not to approach the Company with regard to the laying of wood paving at any other point on the main road traversed by the Company's lines. The wood paving works were carried out during the year. Yeoman Street. On 6th July, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee drew attention to the condition of Yeoman Street, from Chilton Street to the boundary, which required re- forming, and for a portion of the length was without kerb, channel, or footways. T he estimated cost was as under:— Macadamising roadway, providing kerb and channelling £10 Flagging footways 42 £142 68 Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That the Surveyor be instructed to have the roadway macadamised, kerbed and channelled, at an estimated cost of £100, and apportion the cost of flagging the footways upon the persons liable to pay the same under the Metropolitan Management Act, 1862, Amendment Act, 1890. On 16th November, 1897, the Common Seal of the Vestry was affixed to the apportionment as under:— £ s. d. Messrs. Blumann & Stern, Limited 28 15 9 The Surrey Commercial Dock Company 24 4 9 Mr. E. Harrington 4 8 1 Mr. J. H. Bulmer 19 5 £58 18 0 Plant. On 6th April, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered as to the vans and carts required in connection with the new wharf. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That advertisements be issued in the "Contract Journal," "Builder," and local papers, inviting tenders for the supply of twenty-seven suitable vans with designs. The following tenders were ultimately accepted out of nine received:— Mr. Cornelius Hailstone, of Basingstoke, Hants— Total 6 Dust Vans, at £47 each = £282 Messrs. William Glover & Sons, Limited, Warwick— 14 Slop Vans, at £43 each = £602 6 Material Carts, at £23 each = £138 1 Stone Cart = = = = £28 69 Public Baths and Wash-houses. On 6th April, 1897, the Sanitary Committee reported with reference to the removal of ashes from the Public Baths and Wash-houses, that the Dust Contractor contended that such removal did not come within his contract, and that be was entitled to extra payment in regard thereto, and having considered the matter, they were of opinion that there was some justice in the Contractor's contention inasmuch as it had never been the custom for tho Vestry's Contractor to remove the ashes from the Baths. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That the Surveyor bo instructed to have the ashes removed from the Baths in as cheap a way as possible, and charge the net cost thereof to the Commissioners. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Temporary Shelter. On 21st September, the Vestry Resolved—That the Shelter be placed in charge of tho Medical Officer of Health.

Rights of Way. On 2nd November, 1897, the Vestry Resolved— That an iron gate be erected at Acorn Wharf Stairs, and two keys obtained, one to be placed in charge of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at South Wharf, and the other of the Surveyor, and that a notice be painted up to the effect that the key can be obtained at the Board's Wharf, or the Town Hall. St. Mary's Church. On 3rd August, 1897, the Chairman of the Vestry reported that he had received a gift from a lady, to be laid out in the purchase of a painting to be hung in the Parish Church, as a memorial of her deceased parents, that he proposed to instruct an artist to paint a copy of the picture called "The Entombment of Christ" by Titian, the original of which is in the Louvre Gallery in Paris, and had submitted a photo thereof to the Bishop, who had approved of the subject, but stated it would be necessary to obtain a faculty therefor, that he had consulted with the Churchwardens in the matter, the Junior of whom (Mr. Higgs) approved of the proposal, and joined with him in asking for the approval of the Vestry thereto. 71 After considerable discussion the Vestry gave their approval, upon the casting vote of the Chairman, the voting being equal, viz.: 7 for and 7 against. This, however, was rescinded by the Vestry on 21st September, 1897. The faculty applied for, was granted by the Chancellor of the Diocese before the close of the year. Stratford and Plaistow Charity Estates. Upon the application of the Trustees, the Vestry, on 1st February, 1898, Resolved to allow Mr. Norman Scorgie to act as Surveyor to the Trustees during the rebuilding of tho Estates, and fixed Tuesday, March 8th, 1898, to meet the Trustees for the purpose of receiving and determining upon tenders for the grant of leases in respect to the Stratford Estate. The Meeting was duly held, but no tenders had been received. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. On 6th April, 1897, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Clerken well, stating that that Vestry's attention had been drawn to the very small fines sometimes inflicted by the Police Magistrates on prosecutions by the Vestri under the Salt of Food and Drugs Acts," a fine of 6d. and 2s. costs having recently been intlicted upon an offender then convicted for the fourth time, and that he had Ken directed to communicate with the Home Secretary and Local Government Board, urging that some elective means may be adopted to prevent what is practically an encouragement of adulteration, and asking the support of this Vestry in the matter. Resolved—That this Vestry support the action taken by the Vestry of Clerkenwoll in the matter. On 18th May, 1897, the Sanitary Committee reported having considered a letter from 72 the Strand District Board of Works, submitting the following copy resolution adopted by them, The Committee having had under consideration the fact that food is often prepared for sale and sold in places (such as fried fish shops, ice cream shops, and dripping in rag and bone shops), some of which are sanitarily unfit for the purpose, Recommend that the Local Government Board be requested to issue such regulations as will place these places under more efficient control, and that a copy of this resolution be sent to the other Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities. and having also considered the report of the Medical Officer of Health recommending agreement with the said resolution ; Resolved upon the Committee's recommendation that this Vestry concur in the views expressed by the Strand District Board of Works, and that tho Local Government Board be notified accordingly.

Resolved (1st February, 1898).—That the Medical Officer of Health be required to certify all payments made in connection with the Sanitary Department. Surrey Commercial Dock Company. On 4th May, 1897, the Clerk submitted the Agreement prepared by him in accordance with the resolution of the Vestry, passed on the 10th February, 1897, for execution by tho Surrey Commercial Dock Company in connection with the stopping up of a portion of London Road. Resolved—That the Agreement with the Dock Company be approved, and that the Common Seal of the Vestry be affixed thereto. The Clerk reported that the Company were now desirous of obtaining the sanction of the Vestry to the closing of that portion of Plough Road from the commencement of tho Now Road by Yeoman Street, to the end of Commercial Dock Road, at its junction with tho now temporary road, to enable the demolition of Plough Bridge to be proceeded with. Resolved—(Mr, Stuart: Mr. Mullenger)—That the permission of the Vestry bo and ia hereby granted to the closing of that portion of Plough Road from the commencement of the New Road by Yeoman Street, to the end of Commercial Dock Road at its junction with the new temporary road, subject to the consent of tho London County Council being first obtained thereto. 76 On 4th May, 1897, the Surveyor reported receipt of an application from the Engineer to the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, for permission to cross Commercial Dock Road, otherwise Swing Bridge Road, near the "Plough" p.h., with an hydraulic pressure main, so as to supply power for working the new canal lock gates. Resolved—That permission be given for the laying of the said hydraulic main across Commercial Dock Road, subject to tho work boing carried out to the satisfaction of the Surveyor and to the repairs to the roadway being executed by tho Vestry's employees at the Company's expense. Surrey Commercial Docks Extension. On 15th July, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having adjourned consideration of the plan submitted in connection with the extension works and the report of the Surveyor, thereon, to view, with the exception of the undermentioned portion of such report, which they— Recommended for Approval:— "Since your last meeting I have received the plan for your approval of the continuation of Now Road No. 2, to Grove Street. Only about 20 yards are in your District, and it is proposed to construct the same upon exactly the same lines as the plan approved by you. I have, therefore, no observations to offer. The plan has received the approval of the London County Council, subjoct to the approval of the Greenwich District Board of Works and yourselves." Resolved—That the same be approved. The following is a copy of the resolution passed by the Council approving the plan before mentioned:— "That the Council do sanction the plan and section submitted by the Engineer of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, with his letter dated May 6th, 1897, to the Council's Chief 77 Engineer, for the construction of the proposed extension of Road No. 2, authorised by the Company's Act of 1894 and to the closing of the portion of Plough Road in accordance with such plan subject to the consent of the road authorities concerned, viz.:—The Greenwich District Board and the Vestry of Rotherhithe being obtained to such plan and section, and to the closing of the portion of Plough Road referred to, before any part of the works shall be commenced." On 6th July, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having had submitted to them the detailed plans in connection with the Surrey Commercial Docks Extension Works, and the following report of the Surveyor thereupon:— Connection with Lower Road.—This connection is widened in accordance with the arrangement made between tho Vestry and the late Mr. McConnochie; that the new road should at its entrance be 60 feat wide, decreasing to 40 feet, at a point 80 feet back, which is provided for by the curved line shown upon the plan. Upon the other side of the road, at my request, the Company's Engineer has agreed to set back the pier 20 feet, the same as the one at the junction of the New Road No. 2, and Yeoman Street. General Line.—The general line of the road between Lower Road and the GreenlandRussia communication passage deviates somewhat from the line shown upon the deposited plan, if anything, to the advantage of the road, but it is the line of the Swing Bridge across the passage and the junction with Commercial Dock Road (otherwise Swing Bridge Road) to which I desire to call your attention. Upon the deposited plan the bridge is shown to cross the passage in an oblique direction to suit the line of the new road and the junction with the existing roads, but upon the plan now submitted, the bridge is shown to be constructed at right. angles with the passage, and whilst by reason of the altered line suiting the new road equally as well as the line shown upon the deposited plan, the junction with the new bridge and the existing Road will be nearly a right angle, which is proposed to be rounded off to a radius of 80 feet The road will be fenced in on either side with close timber fencing 10 feet high and the driver of a vehicle that had just passed over the bridge would not be able to see another coming in the opposite direction until he was within 40 yards of him; this is only about one half the distance it would be if the bridge and junction were constructed in accordance with the deposited plan. It is therefore for you to consider whether this is satisfactory or whether request be made to the Engineer to construct the bridge in accordance with the deposited Plan 78 Raising Commercial Dock Road.— The existing road between the iron bridge and the junction with the new bridge previously mentioned as over the Greenland-Russia passage will be raised at its greatest depth about 10 feet, so that the roadway between the two bridges will be quite level, but whilst the new road from the Lower Road to the new bridge will be 40 feet wide, it is proposed to maintain the present width, which varies from 25 to 26 feet, between the new bridge and the existing bridge. If the raising of an existing road 10 feet does not under the Act, make it a new road, or if the Company's obligations do not require them to increase it to the width of new roads, I think it will be a great pity if it is allowed to be reconstructed to its present width, and an effort not made to increase it so as to be the same as the remainder of the new road and in conformity with all new streets in the Metropolis. If this were done, Commercial Dock Road and Rotherhithe Street, extending from Lower Road to Trinity Wharf, would possess a good wide road except for a length of about 110 yards extending from Lady Dock Bridge to Elgar Street, which could easily be widened at some future convenient time. Temporary Road.—To enable the Company to raise the existing Commercial Dock Road, it will be necessary to construct a temporary road for the accommodation of the traffic while the work is in progress. This the Company propose to do within the present dock premises upon the north side of the existing road. This is shown to be 26 feet wide, equal to the existing road-way, but no information is given as to its construction, whether it will be pitched or macadamised, which should be settled, as also the width of the footpaths and the question of repairs, liability for accidents, scavenging, lighting, etc., as in the case of the other road, by agreement between the Company and the Vestry. Cross Section of Constructions.—The section of the roadway shown upon the plan is the same as approved by the Vestry for New Road No. 2, but as this road for the greater portion of its length will have no longitudinal fall, the cross fall of the footways where the roadway is level should be increased to 3 inches, and the depth of the channel, except between Lower Road and the Swing Bridge crossing the Canada-Greenland passage, must not be uniform with the kerb, but vary so as to provide a fall for the road water to reach the gullies, say from 3 inches at the crown to 6 inches at the gullies. Specification.—At my request, the Engineer has forwarded through the resident Engineer, a draft of the specification for the construction of the road, in which are embodied several points 79 I have suggested as an improvement for the specification of the works now under contract. I consider the specification satisfactory except as regards the small details I have altered in red. Gullies. Gullies are shown upon the plan 50 yards apart, but for the efficient drainage of the road they should be placed in positions as altered by me and be constructed of an approved pattern. As regards Commercial Dock Road, it is only proposed to raise the existing gullies, but that will not be sufficient as the character of the road will be entirely altered, and new gullies should be provided in the positions I have marked upon the plan. Nothing is shown for the drainage of the Temporary road, which should be provided for, as this road will be in use for a few months at least. Sewer.—The sewer in Commercial Dock Road, which will be abolished, belongs to the London County Council, therefore the new sewer constructed in lieu thereof will require to be constructed to the satisfaction of the London County Council, the Vestry having nothing to do with this. Fence Wall.—It is proposed to construct a fence wall dividing the new road from Osprey Street, at a height varying from 4 ft. 6 in. above the footway at the junction with Lower Road to 6 ft. at a point about 340 ft. down Osprey Street, where the line of the new road diverges from the line of Osprey Street. This is a very low boundary wall, and will, I am afraid, be a source of danger, as it will be possible to mount the wall at the lower end and run along the coping. A slip off at the top end into Osprey Street, would mean a full of 14 ft. 6 in. As soon as the boundary wall leaves Osprey Street it is increased in height to 10 feet, and continues at that height either in brickwork or timber fencing the whole length to Lady Dock Bridge. I have had an interview with the resident Engineer, who on behalf of Mr. Woolf Barry, has agreed as follows: The Temporary road to be constructed in macadam properly consolidated and to have a gravel footway on one side, the company entering into the necessary agreement to efficiently drain, light, maintain and repair the same until the completion of the new road between iron bridge and the new bridge across the Greenland-Russia communication passge. The cross section of construction, specification, and position and number of gullies to be amended by the Surveyor. The height of the fence-wall at the Lower Road end of the new road to be 80 increased to 6 ft. and continue at that height along the whole length of the road until it diverges from the line of Osprey Street. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee— (1) That upon the Company agreeing to give up to the Vestry the necessary land, and make the road to be raised a forty feet road up to Lady Dock Bridge, free of expense to the Vestry, no objection be offered to the amended line of the road from Lower Road to the Greenland-Russia communication passage, and the Swing Bridge across the passage, and the junction with Commercial Dock Road, as shown upon the plans signed by Mr. W. Barry, dated 27th May, 1897. (2) That the remaining portions of the plans be approved, subject to the matters agreed to between the resident Engineer and the Surveyor being carried out, and to the Company entering into the necessary agreement to efficiently drain, light, maintain and repair the Temporary road. The Company demurred to the stipulation that they should give the necessary land to widen the road; a letter was subsequently received from the Clerk, London County Council, stating that the Council had approved the plans as far as the making of the road was concerned. On 16th November, 1897, the Vestry instructed the Surveyor to prepare a plan showing Swing Bridge Road widened to a width of 40 feet with the view of entering into negotiations with the Company for the purpose of effecting this improvement. On 14th December, 1897, the Vestry approved the plan which had been prepared by the Surveyor in accordance with the before-mentioned instructions, and instructed the Clerk to forward a tracing thereof to the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, and enquire whether the Company would be willing to agree to the widening of the road as shown thereon, and if so upon what terms. The Company intimated through their Solicitors that they would be willing to consider the matter, but nothing definite had been settled at the close of the year. 81 Thames Passenger Steamboat Service. On 4th May, 1897, the Vestry Resolved upon the motion of Mr. Stuart, seconded by Mr. Vezey, that a Committee of seven members be appointed to consider what steps should bo taken, in conjunction or otherwise with other local authorities whose districts abut upon the Thames, between London Bridge and Greenwich, in endeavouring to secure a service of Passenger Steamboats between the points indicated, with power to act. Also Resolved—That the following gentlemen constitute such Committee Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley; Mr. R. L. Stuart; „ J. C. Higgs; „ F. T. Talbot; and ,, J. C. Mortimer; ,, Henry Vezey. ,, R. W. Moss; On 18th May, 1897, the Committee reported having considered as to the stoppago of Steamboats upon the river, between London Bridge and Greenwich, and having Resolved—That the Vestries and District Boards of Works having land abutting upon the River Thames between London Bridge and Greenwich, be asked to appoint Delegates to attend a Conference to be held upon the subject of the stoppage of Steamboats between tho points before mentioned, and the consequent inconvenience occasioned to persons wishing to travel between those points. This was approved by the Vestry. On 3rd August, 1897, the Committee reported that they had invited Delegatus from the undermentioned Districts to attend a Conference upon the subject, with the following result:— Bermondsey Vestry No action. City of London Corporation . ,, Greenwich District Board Limehouse „ Poplar ,, St. Olave „ St. George-in-the-East Vestry Two Delegates from each appointed. 82 That since the reference to the Committee, the Thames Steamboat (1897) Company, Limited, had started a half-hourly service of steamboats from Westminster to Greenwich, but there was no guarantee how long it would continue, and submitted the following copy of the minutes of the conference which took place at the Town Hall on Friday, the 23rd July, 1897. Minutes of Conference of Delegates from Riverside Vestries and District Boards, convened by the Vestry of Rotherhithe, held at the Rotherhithe Town Hall, Lower Road, on Friday, July 23rd 1897. Present: Delegates. District. Mr. B. Brennan Limehouse District Board. „ Shand St. Olave „ „ ,, Oake ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, Joseph Heath Greenwich „ ,, „ F. Thurston Poplar „ „ ,, Walter H.

Mr. Stuart thereupon took the chair. After debate, It was moved by Mr. Mortimer, seconded by Mr. Higgs, and unanimously Resolved— That a letter be written to the London County Council, informing them that a Conference of Delegates from Riverside Vestries and District Boards has had under its serious consideration the question of the Thames Passenger Steamboat Service extant, and in view of the irregularity 83 of such service, and the inconvenience occasioned thereby to the public at large, and especially to those living in riverside parishes, is of opinion that some steps should immediately be taken to remedy the existing state of things, and as a preliminary, strongly urges upon the Council to free the whole of the river piers, and also to receive a deputation upon the subject. Moved by Mr. Oake, seconded by Mr. Vezey, and unanimously Resolved— (I.) That a copy of the foregoing resolution be forwarded to each individual member of the Council, with the request that he will give the matter his support. (II). That the members of the Conference form such Deputation with power to add to their number. Letters were read from Messrs. Payne and Morton, Rotherhithe representatives upon the Council, stating the views of the Conference would receive their support. Resolved—That the Minutes be approved and adopted, and the letters from the Councillors received with thanks. On 21st Sept., 1897, the Committee submitted the Minutes of a further Meeting of the Conference, held on the 14th September, 1897. Minutes of Conference of Delegates from Riverside Vestries and District boards, convened by the Vestry of Rotherhithe, held at the Rotherhithe Town Hall, Lower Road, on Tuesday, September 14th, 1897. Present: Delegates. Distiict. Mr. E. Brennan Limehouse District Board. „ E. S. Hartnoll,, ,, ,, „ Oake St. Olave's ,, ,, „ Vice-Chairman F. T. Talbot „ Higgs „ Moss „ Vezey Rotherhithe Vestry. Resolved—That Mr. Vice-chairman F. T. Talbot do take the chair. Mr. Vice-Chairman F. T. Talbot thereupon took the chair. 84 In opening the proceedings the Chairman stated that it had been ascertained that the standing orders of the Council will not admit of more than 10 persons from one body being received as a deputation, and a Memorial must be presented to the Council setting forth the reasons to be adduced in favour of the object in view, and in order that the deputation to the Council may be as representative as possible, it has been suggested that each Vestry and District Board abutting upon the rivpr both above and below Bridge, be requested to adopt a Memorial, appoint two delegates, and separately request the Rivers Committee of the Council to receive such delegates as a deputation at their meeting on Monday, the 27th September, 1897, and submitted draft Memorial, setting forth reasons why the piers should be freed from toll: THE MEMORIAL of to the London County Council praying them to obtain, as soon as possible, the necessary powers from Parliament to enable them to free the Piers of the River Thames, which are used for purposes of public traffic, from all tolls. 1. The River Thames is both at law and in fact a public highway, and at one time was the chief means of communication that London possessed for all kinds of traffic. The improvement of streets and the changes in the methods of locomotion have made the Thames Highway perhaps of less importance than formerly, having regard to the large increase of the number of inhabitants in London, but the traffic on the River has not in any way decreased, and the River is largely used within the area of the County of London both for the carriage of goods and the conveyance of foot passengers. 2. The public policy in the past of the governing body for the London Highways has been consistent for many years, and it has always desired to facilitate traffic in the County. All the Bridges have been freed from tolls; and bars and barriers, where tolls had to be paid within the area of the County, have been done away with. The Bridges are now maintained by the Council, and your Memorialists urge that for the interest of the important traffic of the River, the Piers should be freed from toll and maintained by them in the Bame way, in pursuance of the policy and for the same urgent reasons that induced them to free the Bridges. 3. In the cases where this has been done, large sums of money have been paid in compensation. In the case under consideration it is anticipated that the compensation 85 will not amount to any large sum, as the Thames Conservancy Board, the present owners of most of the Piers, will be willing to make arrangements with the Council that will in any way facilitate the traffic of the Thames. 4. The Thames Conservancy Board are now, by their Act of Parliament, entitled to charge Gd. a call for each vessel that calls at one of their Piers; but this power has never been fully exercised by the Board. In all cases where there has been a great deal of traffic arising from any source of trade, they have always been willing to negotiate a fixed price for a series of calls, and such contracts have been invariably less than the statutory charge. Their policy has been always in every way to assist the traffic in the river, though at a loss to the Board. It has been estimated that if the full toll was charged it would amount to about £17,000 per annum, so large is the amount of traffic which calls at the Piers. 5. Your Memorialists desire to point out to the Council that this excessive tax upon the traffic in the Thames which uses the Piers, has a most detrimental effect upon those who work on the riverside, and to the great inconvenience of the many trades and businesses which are congregated on its banks. 6. For many years the Piers have been chiefly used by the Passenger Steamboats on the river. These Steamboats are most convenient to the business men of London in proceeding to Docks and Wharves which are on the banks at either side of the river. They are also very much used in the summer time for pleasure traffic, and a great number of watermen are employed in this manner. During the last few years the Railways, Omnibuses and Tramways have competed with the River traffic ; before this came to pass the Passenger Steamboats paid well and also paid regularly the tolls; but from this and other causes the toll now is said to be so oppressive that there is a great probability that the carriage of foot passengers will cease to be carried on by private enterprise, and the public will be put to great inconvenience, many riverside workers will be thrown out of employment, and residents and inhabitants of the riverside districts be deprived of a means of communication which is very much valued by them, and the cheapness of which makes it of the utmost importance and indispensable to the least wealthy of the community. 7. Your Memorialists are of opinion that this fatality will be best avoided by freeing the Piers of the tolls. This charge being removed will be the means of stimulating the passenger traffic, and will help to create a healthy competition which will greatly enhance the comfort and convenience of the London public, who so largely use the river. 86 Therefore your Memorialists ask, that they may be allowed to send two of their members to the London County Council, as a deputation in favour of the course of action recommended to the Council by the Rivers Committee, and that they may attend at the next meeting of the Committee, having regard to the urgency of the matter as likely to be before the Council immediately. The Common Seal of the, etc. It was moved by Mr. Higgs, seconded by Mr. Moss, and unanimously Resolved—That the Memorial be approved and adopted, a copy thereof forwarded to each Vestry and District Board abuttiug upon the river, both above and below Bridge, together with a letter, requesting them to adopt a similar Memorial under seal, appoint two delegates and request the Rivers Committee of the Council to receive such delegates as a deputation, at their meeting on Monday, the 27th September, 1897. Moved by Mr. Brennan, seconded by Mr. Vezey, and unanimously Resolved—That a copy of the Memorial be also forwarded to the Association of Master Lightermen and Barge Owners, together with a letter, informing them of the action taken in the matter, and requesting them to give the matter their utmost support, and use what influence they may possess to further the object in view. Resolved—That the thanks of this Meeting be given to the Chairman for his able conduct in the chair. The Conference then adjourned. The Common Seal of the Vestry was ordered to be affixed to the Memorial. Subsequent to the meeting before mentioned the remaining Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis were invited to co-operate in the matter, seal a similar Memorial, and appoint two delegates to wait upon the Rivers Committee of the Council. Mr. F. T. Talbot and Mr. Vezey were appointed as delegates from this Vestry to wait upon the Rivers Committee. On 5th October, 1897, Mr. F. T. Talbot reported that Mr. Vezey and himself waited upon the Rivers Committee of the Council in conjunction with eleven other local authorities, and were very favourably received. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. 87 Town Hall. Opening. The Inauguration of the Town Hall Buildings took place on Wednesday, the 28th April, 1897, Mrs. Carr-Gomm, the Lady of the Manor of Rotherhithe, having kindly consented to perform the ceremony on that date. About 750 tickets of admission to view the ceremony, and also to attend a concert which was subscribed for by the members of the Vestry, and held at the Town Hall in the evening, were issued to the parishioners. The Buildings were subsequently thrown open for the inspection of the public for two days, resulting in 5464 visitors being registered. Management. On 18th July, 1897, the Committee reported having resolved to meet on the 2nd Monday in each month, and having authorised the Clerk to deal with all ordinary applications for the hire of the Hall, where no difficulty or question arises, and in the latter cases to call the Rota Committee together and submit the same for their consideration, which Rota Committee is hereby authorised to deal with such cases, other than any case or cases which in its opinion should go before the full Committee. This was approved by the Vestry. On 6th July, 1897, the Town Hall Management Committee reported having appointed a Rota Committee to take office for four months, and having divided themselves as under June to September, 1897.

On 6th July, 1897, the Committee reported having authorised the Surveyor to incur an expenditure of £2 2s. for the supply of the badges to the Rota Committeo and officials, the guinea already voted by the Vestry not being sufficient. This was approved by tho Vestry.

There being no accommodation for the supply of Refreshments in connection with the Public Hall, the Surveyor was instructed to prepare a plan showing a portion of the yard covered over for the purpose. The Vestry approved the plan on 15th March, 1898, and instructed the Surveyor to obtain Tenders for the work. Assessment. The Town Hall Buildings have been assessed at £810 gross, and £675 ratable.

Engineer and Surveyor's Annual Report, 1897-98. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Keport upon the work of my department for tho year ending 25th March, 1898. Licenses. Forty-seven licenses were granted to erect scaffolds and hoardings on the public footpaths and carriageways for new buildings, alterations, additions or repairs; being tho same number as granted for the previous year. Roads and Footways. In addition to general repairs, special works have been executed as enumerated bolow: Kinburn Street, Forsyth Street, and Brunei Road.—The kerbs for a length of 5G4 ft. and the footways for an area of 5264 square ft. have been relaid. Rebecca Terrace.—The kerbs for a length of 256 ft. and the footways for an area of 1584 square ft. have been relaid. Trident Street.—The macadam roadway for an area of 1184 square yards has been repaired, the amount of broken granite used being 107 tons 7 cwt. Hickling Street—The kerbs for a length of 123 ft. and the footways for an area of 1068 square ft. have been relaid. 100 Union Road—Extensive repairs have been necessary in this road. The kerbs, for a length of 540 ft., footways for an area of 2304 square ft., and GOO square yards of pitching have been relaid; of this latter area 264 square yards was occasioned by the rearrangement of the levels to suit the wood paving-4aid in front of Christ Church, an area of 58| square yards belonging to the Tramway Company, the amount charged to them being £8 Is. 4d. In September last, following the agreement with the Tramway Company, the roadway from the west side of Cathay Street to the west side of No. 29, a length of 175 ft., was paved with wood upon a concrete foundation, the area from the kerb to the tram rail on both sides being executed in " Jarrahdale Jarrah " blocks by the Vestry employees, and the space between the rails in " Stringy Bark " blocks by the Company ; in both cases the blocks were 9 in. by 5 in. by 3 in. The cost of the work executed by the Vestry amounted to £317 10s. 10d., the amount chargeable to the Tram Company for 3 ft. on each side of the rails being £97 8s. 2d., reduced by the value of the old setts, which we retained, to £67 14s. lOd. Cope Street.—The work executed in this street is 430 ft. kerb, and 2621 square ft. flags relaid, 252 square ft. of new flags have also been laid to replace broken and useless ones. Ainstey Street.—This street to the north of Albion Street has been entirely remodelled, new York edge kerb on both sides has been laid, the footways reflagged, and the roadway laid with tar macadam upon a foundation of 4 in. of hard core, at an estimated cost of £180. Bush Road.— Small repairs have been executed to the kerbs and footways, and the macadam roadway has been reformed for an area of 1400 square yards, the broken granite used amounting to 206 tons 8 cwt. Rotherhithe Street.—Owing to the Gas Company laying a new main from Lavender Bridge to Silver Street, it was necessary to relay the whole of the footway on the west side to make a satisfactory job, the area, exclusive of the portion charged to the Gas Company, amounting to 1457 ft. 101 Between Silver Street and Cow Lane the kerb and footway have been relaid and the roadway leformed, the woik executed being shown in the tabulated statoment below. Opposite South Wharf a new kerb has been laid for a length of 211 ft., and the footway formed in cement laid in situ; this piece was laid as an experiment, and after completion, was inspected by the Vestry. This class of paving is much cheaper than York stone or Victoiia flags, and the Vestry has agreed to extend its use as necessity arises. Galleywall Road.—Following the work executed last year the footway has been relaid from Lynton Road to Southwark Park Road, the kerb relaid on concrete, and a new throecourse granite channel provided for the roadway. The whole of the macadam roadway has been reformed, coated with broken granite, and rolled in by the steam roller ; the area of the roadway amounts to 4122 square yards, 558 tons 7 cwt. of broken granite was used, and 42 loads of granite spawls. Lower Road.—Sundry repairs have been executed to the kerbs and footways along the main road, but the condition of portions of the roadway on both sides having become such that it was impossible to satisfactorily patch them, the whole area, from Hothfield Place to the boundary on the east side, and from Cope Street to Deptford Road Station on the west side, between the kerb and tram rails has been relaid, the setts redressed, and new supplied to make up for the waste. The total area repaved is 4092 square yards, the cost £1150 16s., of which sum £288 14s. lOd. was repaid by the Tramway Company for the work within 3 ft. of the tram rails, which they have to maintain. The averago cost of this work, including taking up, cleaning and redressing setts, providing new setts where necessary, concrete, repaving, grouting, ramming and covering of, amounts to 5s. < Id. per square yard Lower Road by Town Hall.—Previous to the opening of the Town Hall the footways and roadway around the same were remodelled, a new kerb was inserted, tho footway along the Lower Road front laid with special rubbed Silex Brand York flags largt size and the footway in Neptune Street and Moodkee Street with orlinary new York flags, the channels and roadway all round were reformed. Details in the work executed will be found in the tabulated statement below. 102 Yeoman Street.—This street from Chilton Street to the boundary has been put into a satisfactory state of repair, the existing kerb has been relaid and a new kerb and granite channel laid down where none previously existed, the whole area of the macadam roadway to the extent of 1G78 square yards has had a foundation put in, covered with 3 in. of broken granite and rolled, the amount of granite used being 149 tons 15 cwt. An apportionment has been made upon the owners for the cost of flagging the footways, amounting to £58 18s., but the whole of the amount is not yet paid. Raymouth Road.—The kerbs and footways in this road have been extensively repaired, 200 ft. of kerb and G958 square ft. of flags being relaid, and 7G0 square ft. of new flags laid, this latter quantity being used to replace broken and worn out stones. Eugenia Road.—The kerb in this road has been relaid to the extent of 89G ft., 2270 square ft. of flags relaid, and 2G73 square yards of macadam roadway repaired, the amount of broken granite used being 210 tons 12 cwt. Silver Street.—This street from the Wesleyan Chapel to the northern entrance in Kotherhithe Street has been reconstructed, new kerb and Victoria stone footway laid, a three-course and five-course channel provided, the pebble-pitched roadway abolished, and a new macadam roadway formed and rolled with the steam roller. Silwood Street.—The macadam roadway in this street has been repaired to the extent of 2738 square yards, 328 tons 5 cwt. of broken granite being used. St. Helena Road.—The footways in this road to the extent of 861 square ft. have been relaid and 1492 square yards of the macadam roadway repaired, 100 tons 4 cwt. of broken granite being used. 103 In addition to the streets enumerated above, numerous others have received attention, the following tabulated statement giving the extent of the work done in the important ones, in addition to which a large quantity of work has been executed in patching.

Up to the 29th September, 1897, the removal of the street sweepings was undertaken by the contractor who was required to load and remove to the Vestry's wharf, the payment being 2s. per cubic yard; but since that date the collection has been by our own vans, to the groat advantage of the district, as I am now enabled to utilise the horse hire to the best advantage, increasing or decreasing the number of vans as necessity arises. Previously the Contractor would send out only the number he thought would be sufficient, always bearing in mind the amount he would receive under his contract, this was all very well should his calculations prove correct, but upon a great number of days the opposite was the case, with the result that the day's sweepings had to remain upon the roads until next morning; further, the collection of the sweepings being paid at per cubic yard and the remainder of the horse hire for carts, watering, etc., being at per day, it was not possible for me to utilise the other horses for this work, especially on days when, owing to rain, the quantity of slop to be removed was considerably in excess of the amount anticipated. The quantity of sweepings removed for the half-year ending 29th September, 1897, amounted to 4102¾ cubic yards ; and for the half-year ending 25th March, 1898, 1572¾ van loads which, if taken at an average of 2½ cubic yards per load, equals 3932 cubic yards.

The past winter being exceedingly mild, any slight fall of snow which took place was so small that it did not require any special means for its disposal, and no extra expenses were incurred during the whole season. Steam Roller. The steam roller has been fully employed during the year. The cost of working has boon as follows:— £ s. d. £ s. d. Driving, 171 days... 50 2 7 Cleaning, Oil, Packing, Coke, Repairs, etc. 40 6 2 90 8 9 10 per cent depreciation 39 0 0 £129 8 9 The total working days were 171, an increase of 6 upon last year, the cost per day equals 15s. l½d., against 14s. l1d. last year ; previous to the purchase of the roller, the amount paid for hire was 34s. per day ; if a roller had been hired for the period worked the cost would have amounted to £290 14s. 0d., showing a saving upon the year's work of £161 5s. 3d. by having our own roller. This amount added to the savings previously reported makes a total of £432 9s. 3d. in less than three years, or £42 9s. 3d. in excess of the initial cost of the machine. It was delivered on the 29th May, 1895, and up to the present time has been at work 489 days. The above figures I think cannot be other than gratifying to the Vestry, and fully justifies the expenditure of £390 in purchasing the roller which has already more than saved its cost. 112 Sewers. No new sewers have been constructed during the year. In June, 1897, the existing 15 in. pipe sewer in Aspinden Road became entirely blocked. It was opened in six pla'c6s along a length of 300 ft. for clearance, and was found to be quite full of deposit, which was so hard that in some cases it was only with difficulty that a drain cleansing rod could be passed through it; from levels taken it was found to be very irregular in level, and for over 160 ft. of its length fell the wrong way, the centre of the length being 45/8 in., and the top end 2£ in. lower than the outlet of the manhole near the Raymoutli Road into which this sewer should discharge. On the 11th June, I presented to the Sanitary Committtee my report on the condition of this sewer and an estimate for relaying the same amounting to £230, but as the sewer had been thoroughly cleansed the matter was adjourned for six months ; at the end of that time the question was again brought to the notice of the Committee and instructions given for the cost of the work to be included in the next estimate, the work to be commenced as soon as possible after the 25th March. The reconstruction will shortly be taken in hand. Receiving several complaints as to the emission of foul gases from the open grating in the street from the County Council sewer opposite 72, Union Road, I endeavoured to obtain the consent of the owners on both sides of the road to the erection of an up-cast shaft ventilator in lieu thereof, but without success. The question of the ventilation of the sewers has received considerable attention during the past year from Metropolitan Engineers and Surveyors; meetings have been held in connection with the Association of Municipal Engineers and Surveyors, and at the invitation of the Chief Engineer of the London County Council a Conference was held on the 25th February, at Spring Gardens, " With a view of some uniform system being adopted for dealing with complaints of offensive emanations from gratings connected wit'i both local and main sewers ; " there were present Engineers and Surveyors from 39 Vestries and District Boards, and the following resolutions were adopted:— 1. "That the closing of sewer ventilators, in response to complaints, increases the general evil, the diminution of which is to be obtained by the multiplication of ventilators at regular frequent intervals. 113 2. That in connection with any interceptor hereafter fixed on a main house drain, it is advisable to carry up a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor, up the front, side or back of the house, to the satisfaction of the local sanitary authority, and that the outlet drain from the interceptor shall not be flap-trapped in sewer, unless required by the local sanitary authority. 3. That pipe ventilators up buildings, or otherwise, when possible, should always be adopted in addition to surface ventilators." It will thus be seen that in the opinion of the Engineers and Surveyors generally, and to which opinion I entirely concur, the remedy for sewer emanations is to be looked for, not by the substitution of up-cast shaft ventilators for surface gratings, but from the maintenance of more ventilating openings, both at the street level and by means of pipes carried up houses and other buildings. At the invitation of the Vestry a further conference was held by representatives of South London Districts at Camberwell, when the above resolutions were practically confirmed. The sewers have been efficiently cleansed and thoroughly flushed during the year, 213½ yards of silt being removed. The new 450-gallon flushing van, mentioned in my last year's report, has been delivered, and has been used 137 days flushing sewers, the quantity of water used, including that carried by the old cart, being 1926 loads or 770,400 gallons, of which amount 106,800 gallons came from the wells in the Parish, and the remaindei lrotu the mains of the Water Companies. Gullies. The gullies now number 842, being an increase of 22 during the year; they have been regularly cleansed during the year and flushed out during periods of drought; 627½ cubic yards of deposit have been removed from them, and a horse and van has been engaged flushing them out on 62 days, using 916 loads or 366,400 gallons of water. 114 The existing old brick gully pits are getting more and more into disfavour owing to their porosity, the water in them gradually leaking away into the surrounding ground, with the result that after slight periods of drought they require filling up, or should there be any slight deposit very unpleasant smells arise from them. Daring the past year, when inserting new ones, I have taken the opportunity of testing three different water-tight gullies brought to my notice, of which I had a favourable opinion, two in stoneware and one in iron, and in three other instances I have substituted iron gullies of the pattern mentioned in my 1896 report. 18 New connections have been made with the sewers for the additional gullies which have been inserted in the undermentioned streets:— 9 New Eoad, Plough Bridge (Nottingham iron gully). 2 Galleywall Eoad (stoneware, Wakefield's patent). 2 Tissington Street (iron double trapped). 1 Prospect Street (stoneware, Wakefield's patent). *1 Nolan Place (iron double trapped). 1 Silver Street do. 2 Ainstey Street do. *2 Glebe Eoad do. 1 Botberhithe Street (stoneware, Sykes' patent). *1 Matson Street (iron double trapped). New connections for all except those marked thus *. Thirty-two of the existing gullies have been found with broken traps and have had new stoneware ones inserted, surrounded with concrete, in the streets, as detailed below:— Trinity Eoad 1 Galleywall Eoad ... 1 Cranham Eoad 2 Princes Passage ... 1 Silwood Street 8 Eugenia Eoad ... 2 Lower Eoad 4 Credon Eoad ... 2 Cathay Street 1 West Lane .... 1 115 Union Road I Bramcote Road 1 Henwood Road 1 Gomm Road 1 Rebecca Terrace 2 Silver Street l Rotherhithe Street 2 Hickling Street 1 Westlake Eoad 2 Twentynine new gulley tops and frames to replace worn out and broken ones have been fixed as follows:— Lower Road 14 Union Road l Prospect Street 1 Osprey Street 1 Trident Street 1 Old Road. 2 Rotherhithe Street 3 Galleywall Road 2 Princes Street 1 Clarence Street 3 Manholes. The only additional manholes constructed upon the sewers during the past year are those in connection with the new sewer for the drainage of New Road No. 2, forming the approach on either side of the new Plough Bridge. One existing manhole in Adam Street which was covered over below the surface of the ground has been brought to the surface and covered with an iron cover. Five existing manholes have had new covers and frames fixed, as follows:— Temeraire Street 1 Ainstey Street 2 Warndon Street 1 Adam Street 1 Twelve new frames and covers have been fixed upon the sewers to lampholes or flushing inlets in the following streets:— Aylton Street 1 Ainstey Street Clarence Street 1 Eugenia Road 1 116 Dodds.Placo 1 Lower Road 1 Lovat Place 1 Luxford Street 1 Mary's Place 1 Platform Wharf 1 Trinity Road .1 Drainage Works. One hundred and fiftyseven notices have been received in reference to the redrainage of houses, erection of new houses, etc., as follows: — Existing houses redrained 138 Buildings and premises other than houses drained or redrained 17 New houses erected or rebuilt and drained 8 Other buildings do. do 17 New W.C.s and conveniences built and drained 16 Alterations and additions to houses 23 House drains cleansed 21 Do. (sanitary requisition) 14 Do. (by agreement) 14 268 In connection with the above twentythree new connections have been made with the sewers ; of this number five were connected to the County Council's sewers. The cost charged to the owners for the connections and for the necessary interceptor and inspection chamber under the footway where no forecourt existed (23), amounted to £226 153. 3d. Street Watering The number of standposts remain the same (7) as mentioned in my last report, but, owing to complaints received from basement flooding, the one fixed in Silwood Street at the corner of Rotherhithe New Road has been removed to Rotherhithe New Road, near South Bermondsey Station. 117 In July last I called the attention of the Vestry to the fact that the number, except for the area supplied by the Kent Water Company, required augmenting, as a great deal of time is wasted on account of the long distance to travel to or from the district and the waiting for turn at the post, but, owing to the shortness of supply and the deficiency of the pressure in the mains, the Vestry hesitated to order the erection of additional ones. If the work of watering the streets is to be carried out in an efficient manner—and each summer the public are more and more expecting to have the roads thoroughly watered—the additional posts must be erected, as I find it is impossible, owing to the lowering of the level of the subsoil water, to hope for any adequate supply from the various wells, and oven should that be again raised, the operation of hand pumping the water is more expensive than obtaining it from the Water Companies. The total cost of the street watering amounted to £393 8s. 7d., and is divided as follows:— Maintenance— £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d. Standposts.

Total 3,160,500 ,, Previous to the commencement of the season, the whole of the vans and carts were thoroughly overhauled and painted by Mr. Scammel, of Hawkstone Road, at a cost of £77 13s. Gd. Further expenses amounting to £16 12s. Gd. were incurred in repairing sundry defects during the season, making the total repairs £94 6s. Od. Several of the vans are very old and each year require considerable repairs, so that 1 think it would be more economical to gradually replace them than to keep patching them up. We have at present nine vans and two carts and the amount that has been expended upon repairs is more than sufficient to buy two new vans made upon the latest and most approved principle for efficiency and economy of working. Urinals• One additional urinal for the accommodation of three persons has been erected during the year in Rotherhithe Street, upon ground belonging to the wharf and adjoining the entrance gates, but for the use of the public, making a total of 11 with accommodation for 42 persons at one time ; in addition to this the Vestry has arranged, from the 25th March, 1898, to discontinue the arrangement of jointly with Bermondsey Vestry maintaining the two 6stall urinals in Southwark Park Road, and in lieu thereof, for each Vestry to entirely maintain one, the urinal opposite the "John Bull" P.H. to be maintained by Bermondsey, and the one opposite the "Queen Charlotte" P.H. to be maintained by us. This will be a saving to us, as was shown in my last report, of about £15 per annum. 119 The cost of the new urinal, which has white glazed stoneware divisions, was as follows £ s. d. £ s. d.

The urinals attached to twelve publichouses in different parts of the Parish are also cleansed by the urinal man, for list see 1895 report. The cost of maintaining the joint urinals as per accounts tendered by the Vestry of Bermondsey, amounted to £89 3s. 8d., of which amount this Vestry paid one half, £44 lis. lOd. Lighting. At the commencement of the year the Public Lamps in the Parish numbered as follows :— Ordinary Street Lamps 500 Sugg's Patent Lamps 4 10 ft. per hour Lamps 2 Large Lanterns. 4 510 Seventeen additional ordinary lamps have been erected and fifteen discontinued, as under NEW LAMPS.

Rotherhithe Street: 1 column to bracket. Lovat Place: 1 do. In connection with the lamps placed upon the New Plough Bridge Approach, by agreement with the Vestry, the Surrey Commercial Dock Company repay the cost of the lighting until the completion of the whole of the alterations to the roads, as authorised by the Surrey Commercial Dock Company's Act, 1891. No further experiments have been carried out in reference to the incandescent burners, and the Company have practically replaced the ordinary burners upon the lamps in Union 122 Road, which were subject to the experiments, as they considered they had determined all that was necessary; in a communication received from the Company, they were prepared to undertake the lighting, repairs, cleaning, and all responsibility in connection with lamps fitted with incandescent burners upon payment of 67/6 per lamp per annum, with an addition of 50/per annum for every additional burner fixed in the same lantern ; but as these charges were in excess of those now paid for ordinary burners the Vestry declined to accept the offer. The diminution in the amount of gas consumed in the Clock Tower of Christ Church has been maintained during the past year, being 7,000 cubic feet less than the previous twelve months, whilst the St. Mary's Church Clock is an increase of 59,000 cubic feet on the same period.

Owing to the great advance in the price of York Flags I communicated with the various Companies, intimating that the price per square foot would be increased from l1d. to 12, and, being reasonable, they have agreed to it. The prices now in operation are as under:- Relay Flags 2½d. per square foot New Flags 1/2 „ Relay Pitching 2/-per square yard ,, on Concrete 4/6 ,, New Pitching on Concrete 15/ „ Repair Macadam 1/6 „ Reset Kerb 2½d. per foot lin.

Further progress has been made during the year in the work of adapting the premises at Bull Head Dock and Victoria Oil Mills for the use of the Vestry as a Depot and wharf. The contract of Messrs. H. Knight & Son, of Tottenham, N., for the house, office, store, blacksmith and wheelwright's shop, steam roller shed and cart shed with shelter over, was completed on the 1st May, 1897, and accepted by the Vestry, the settledup accounts including all variations, additions and deductions, amounting to £2234 12s. 3d., or £8 5s. 3d. more than the amount of tender as accepted; the whole of the buildings are substantially built in stock brickwork with red brick arches and oversailing courses, and give the following accommodation:— House— Ground floor: parlor, 12 ft. by 12 ft. kitchen, 10 ft. 6 in. by 9 ft. 6 in. scullery, 10 ft. 6 in. by 7 ft.

Steam Roller Shed— 21 ft. by 15 ft., with doors at either end so that the roller can enter from street or wharf. An engine pit has been constructed in the centre of the shed so as to facilitate tho examination of the bottom of the firebox. 126 Cart Shed— Provision is made for 18 vans after deducting the spaces occupied by the staircases to the shelter ; it is open upon the front facing the wharf, the first floor being carried upon 4 cast iron columns with steel joists between the columns and across the shed, the inside measurements are 70 ft. by 21 ft. Shelter— This, as before stated, is above the cart shed and occupies the whole of the first floor, the various rooms are formed as cubicles with boarded partitions 7 ft. high, and gives the following accommodation:—kitchen, scullery, bath room with hot and cold water supply, day room, 3 double bedrooms, 2 single bedrooms. The cost of the shelter was £484 14s. 1d. to which must be added the furnishing, amounting to £63 4s. 5d. The paving works so far as the wharf is completed have been executed by the Vestry employees, the setts used being those obtained from Mr. W. Wilson, of Kilsyth, N.B. Following the acceptance of the report of the Committee in reference to the Dust Destructor, my plans for the same were prepared as speedily as possible, and upon the 1st October last, the tender of Messrs. Knight & Son, Tottenham, N., was accepted for the erection of the Chimney Shaft, amounting to £2428 3s. The work was commenced on the 27th October; the foundation of the shaft has been taken down to the ballast formation; it is 30 ft. square, and the contract provided for excavating to a depth of 25 ft. below the coping of the dock, but upon excavating to that depth it was found necessary to go deeper, an average of 2 ft. all over the bottom ; the foundation consists of cement concrete mixed in the proportion of 7 of ballast and sand to 1 of cement, the full size of the excavation and ten feet in thickness; upon this the brickwork commences 24 ft. square with regular 127 offsets until it reaches a 14 ft. 6 in. square; owing to the water met with in the bottom it was deemed advisable to execute the footings to the underside of the flue in cement mortar 3 to 1 instead of lime as provided in the contract, for a height of 7 ft. above the datum or dock coping level, the base of the shaft maintains a square having sides 14 ft. 6 in. long and above the giound line, it is faced with pressed blue Staffordshire bricks finished with two courses of sloped bricks; above this the base is 13 ft. 9 in. square for a further height of 15 ft., and in each side of the square a sunk panel has been inserted. The square baso is finished with three courses of Portland stone of a total thickness of 6 ft. G in., the corner stones of the top course being worked with a splay and forming top to octagonal side of the shaft, which is 12 ft. 4 in. outside diameter at this point, the thickness of the brickwork of the sides being 3½bricks, decreasing ½ brick for every 20 ft. in height, except the last 10 ft. which is built in 1½ bricks. The total height of the shaft when finished will be 150 ft. above datum level, the sides batter 2.963 inches in 10 ft., and the outside diameter at the top will be G ft. 3 in. finished with a 6 in. by 6 in. by ½ in. angle iron forged in one piece, to fix closely over the outside of the brickwork; near the top of the shaft is a cast iron cove cap formed of eight segments securely bolted together at the angles. The interior of the shaft from bottom to top maintains an octagon 4 ft. diameter, and is lined with firebrick for a height of 100 ft., with an air space between it and the outer shell; the firebrick lining is 9 in. in thickness for a height of 50 ft. and 4½ in. in thickness between 50 ft. and 100 ft. The flue from the destructor cells to shaft will be underground, formed of 9 in. of brickwork, and an inner lining of 4½ in. of firebrick with a 1 in. air space between the lining and the outer brickwork, the bottom is flat, and sides vertical with semicircular arch, it is 5 ft, high by 3 ft. wide. The work was commenced 27th October, 1897, Excavation completed 17th December, 1897, Concrete foundation completed 8th January, 1898, and upon the 25th March, 1898, the shaft was completed to a height of 50 ft. above datum level. The drawings, specification and quantities for the erection of the Destructor Buildings, inclined roadways, engine house, disinfector buildings, etc., are now ready, and the advertisement for tenders will shortly be issued. 128 During the past year the following materials have been landed at the wharf, the steam crane being used upon every occasion except in unloading the stoak bricks:— FOB VESTRY:.— Broken Granite 20G0 tons. 3 by 7 Setts 100 „ 4 by 7 Setts .205 „ 6 by 12 Kerb 104G feet.

The weighbridge has been used upon 35 occasions for weighing goods belonging to outside persons, for which a charge of 2d. per load has been made. 129 Barging Contract. Upon the expiration, on the 29th September, of the existing lamp sum contract per annum, for barging away the street sweepings, house refuse, etc., an entirely new basis was made and the tender of Mr. A. H. Keep was accepted, the contractor being paid at per ton for house refuse, etc., at per van load for street sweepings, gully and sewer refuse, etc, and at per cart load for surplus excavation. Upon page 107 will be found a table giving full particulars of the work executed under this contract. Dusting. The biweekly collection of house refuse has been carried out with regularity since the expiration of the contract on the 29th September, the collection has been undertaken directly by the Vestry in our own vans, two collectors being employed in addition to the carters provided by the Contractor for horsehire, and since the appointment of Mr. Ford as Hallkeeper of the Town Hall, Mr. Walsh has superintended the collection under my direction and instructions. No reliable information can be given as to the weight of the dust for previous years, as the contract was for collection and disposal at a lump sum per annum. During the past year it has amounted to 3,242 loads, with a total weight of 5,751 tons 1 cut. The quarterly collection has been as follows:— LOADS.

If delivered at the wharf in the tradesmen's own carts, 3s. per ton, with a minimum charge of 1s. During the past year 258 pails have been repaired at a cost of £9 13s. Gd., and 250 new ones supplied by Mr. Philip Round, of Lye, near Stourbridge, at a cost of €27 1s. 8d. The original pails supplied to the householders are now fast becoming completely worn out, therefore, in future, the renewals will be considerably in excess of what they have been until we have cleared out the whole of the wornout ones. Flooding. Owing to the overflow of the river Thames on the 29th November, 145 houses and premises and adjoining roads in the vicinity of the river were flooded, caused by the defective condition of the Floods Prevention Works of the wharves and premises along the riverside. The whole of the streets were cleared the same evening, and the Vestry employees assisted the occupiers in clearing the basements and houses. Premises in the following streets were flooded:— St. Marychurch Street 4 Elephant Lane 7 Rotherhithe Wall 4 Beatson Street 2 Rotherhithe Street 77 Dock Passage 1 Silver Street 13 Cow Lane 8 Faustin Place 29 145 131 Apportionments. Daring the year apportionments have been served upon the owners of property in the following streets:— Hadland Street, Yeoman Street, Adams Gardens. Vans and Carts. The whole of the vans and carts now in use are the property of the Vestry, bo that it is possible to use the horsehire to the very best advantage. In answer to advertisements, a number of ofters were sent in and, previous to the acceptance of a tender, a Committee of the Vestry inspected the various makes at the rear of the Town Hall. Each maker explaining to the Committee the salient points of his particular van; they wero required to be delivered on or before the 18th September, and were all delivered in time to commence work on the 30th September, and comprised the following: — 14 Slop, Gully and Sewer Vans, 6 Covered Dust Vans, 6 Material Carts, 1 Crank Axle Stone Cart. The covered dust vans were obtained from Mr. Chas. Hailstone, of Basingstoke, at a cost of £283 10s. Od.; the whole of the remainder being supplied by Messrs. W. Glover a Sons, Limited, of Warwick, at a cost of £789. Dock Company's Act, 1894. Further considerable progress has been made during the year in carrying out the work within the Company's premises authorised by the above Act, the first contract has boon completed, comprising the Western end of the new Greenland Dock, excavated on the sito of the Lower Brunswick Yard and Commercial Basin, including a communication passage into the Canada Dock, over which a swing bridge has been erected to carry New Road No. 1, and a new canal lock and basin upon the sito of old I lough Bridge. The new approach road from Plough Road to Swing Bridge Road, with new bridge across the canal and spur road into London Street, was opened for traffic on the 11th June, 132 by agreement with the Vestry, the Surrey Commercial Dock Company hear the whole cost of scavenging, watering, repairing and lighting this road until the completion of the New Roads authorised by the Act, up to the 25th March, 1898 any necessary repairs were executed by the Company's Contractor being within his period of maintenance, but the charge for scavenging, watering and lighting, amounted to £95 6s. 9d. In June, the Engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry sent for the approval of the Vestry, the plans for New Road No. 1 from Swing Bridge Road to Lower Road, near Osprey Street, upon which I reported fully, the Engineer met the Vestry upon various matters suggested by me, but upon the question of widening the existing Swing Bridge Road (which will be raised) from its existing width of 25 ft. to 40 ft., between the iron bridge and the new bridge across the communication passage between Greenland and Russia Docks, he declined to agree, and as it was not necessary to obtain the approval of the Vestry under the Act, he withdrew the plans to place them before the County Council whose approval was necessary; the point was impressed upon the Council, but after taking the advice of their Solicitor, who reported that, in his opinion the raising of an existing road did not constitute the construction of a new road, they suggested that the road may be widened by arrangement between the Company and the Vestry, and, as instructed, I prepared a plan showing the proposed improvement which was approved by the Vestry and a copy forwarded to the Company; the total land required amounts to 761 square yards, and my estimate of the cost of carrying out this improvement, including the purchase of the land, amounts to £1526 5s. 0d. Ventilation of Council Chamber. In accordance with instructions, the Medical Officer and myself presented to the Town Hall Committee on the 23rd February, a joint report in reference to the ventilation of the Council Chamber, as to the existing condition of things and the improvements necessary to effect a proper and efficient ventilation of the same and to prevent the very high temperature in the Public Gallery; shortly the recommendations were to greatly increase the inlets, to connect all the ceiling openings to one main shaft, and to fix therein mechanical expulsion by means of a directdriven exhaust fan of such a size that the whole of the air in the room would be changed every fifteen minutes without creating any appreciable draught. Up to the present the Vestry has not decided to carry out the recommendations. 133 Inventory of Plant, Tools and Machinery, March 25th, 1897. No. Description. No. Description. No. Description. Plant.

In 1893 the number was 142. In 1894 the number was 12G. In 1895 the number was 102. In 1896 the number was 154. All the cases of Measles were complicated with Bronchitis, Pneumonia, or BronchoPneumonia. In my opinion these various forms of lung disease were the true causes of death. The deaths from Infantile Diarrhœa are greatly in excess of former years; the nearest approach being in the year 1886-7, when the deaths from this disease were fortyfour. The complete enumeration of deaths from Zymotic Diseases is as follows:— Smallpox, none; Scarlet Fever, twenty-two; Enteric Fever, two; Typhus Fever, none; Puerperal Fever, one; Continued Fever, none; Relapsing Fever, none; Diphtheria, nineteen; Diarrhoea, forty-nine; Measles, nineteen; Whooping Cough, fourteen; Erysipelas, one; Membranous Croup, none; English Cholera, none; Influenza, four.

The increase in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever and Diarrhoea is lamentably noticeable. On the other hand there is a marked and pleasing decrease in Enteric l\ v. r. Diphtheria, and Measles. The following tabular form shows the number of deaths from the principal infectious and zymotic diseases, of parishioners, whether in the parish or outlying institutions, during the last six years.
