January, 1927. TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting my Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1926. Nine hundred and thirty-six vessels were examined by the boarding staff at Gravesend as coming under suspicion by reason of the ports visited during the voyage or because of declared illness on board. On these and other vessels 787 cases of illness were inquired into and 63 removed to Denton Hospital. No case of plague or cholera has reached London. Reported plague infection during the voyage, always a subject for close enquiry, occurred in connection with only one ship and cholera with five. An arrangement for carrving on a closer sanitary watch on ships entering at Sheerness and lying in the Swale and Medway, was made operative towards the end of the year. The number of rats examined from the dock areas was 2,106; in no case was plague suspected or found; there was no suspicious mortality of rats discovered whether in the docks or on any ship. The fumigations of vessels numbered 136; each was supervised by the Port Sanitary Authority. The work of the Food Inspectors has been largely increased in the control of fats which do not bear the "official certificate" of the country of origin. J he examination of apples (53 samples) showed that most of the shipments contained but little arsenic. It is to be expected that the attention the matter is receiving among exporters will result in continued improvement. The sanitary conveniences in the docks of London are undergoing a change of system in many places and considerable progress is noted during the year ; these improvements sometimes necessitate large and expensive works in connection with laying down that water carriage system which alone can be approved. The renewal of one pavilion for infectious disease at Denton Hospital has become necessary. The annual report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended.

(Medical Inspection at Sheerness.) An agreement entered into in 1895 between the Port of London Sanitary Authority and the Rochester Port Sanitary Authority provided for the examination and inspection of every ship or vessel arriving at or off Garrison Point in the River Medway, including day and night boats arriving at Queenborough, by a Medical Officer appointed by the Port of London Sanitary Authority. This agreement was terminated in July, 1925, following the retirement of Dr. Legge, the Boarding Medical Officer at Sheerness. Temporary arrangements had been in force with Dr. F. H. Watson, of Sheerness, to carry out the minimum duties in connection with declared Infectious Disease on incoming ships, and the Port of London Sanitary Committee explored the position in consultation with the Rochester Port Sanitary Authority and the Ministry of Health, with a view to finding a satisfactory method of securing the inspection of every vessel from foreign ports entering and remaining in the Port of London Sanitary Authority's jurisdiction. With the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Rochester Port Sanitary Authority, an arrangement has now been made by which the Port of London Sanitary Authority continues its legal duties without withdrawing the protection it has successfully afforded to the Port of Rochester and the country at large at this point, on the following lines:- Dr. F. H. Watson, of Sheerness, to act as Temporary Assistant to your Medical Officer of Health for the Sheerness District. His Majesty's Customs, as being the Authority on which the duty of detaining ships " infected " or " suspected " of Cholera, Yellow Fever or Plague primarily devolves, is in close touch with the Medical Officer acting in the Port of London Sanitary Authority's district in the River Medway, and will notify to him all declared cases of sickness on ships entering the Medway, whether bound for Rochester or the Sheerness—Queenboro' district. The duties of the Medical Practitioner acting for the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London have been detailed as follows:- 1. To visit, examine and report to the office of the Port of London Sanitary Authority on every case of illness on an incoming ship brought to his notice by His Majesty's Customs whenever the ship is detained for his inspection. 2. To visit every ship remaining in the Port of London Sanitary Authority's jurisdiction within about twelve hours of arrival and report to the office of the Port of London Sanitary Authority on the health of the crew thereon. In case of non-infectious illness or a clean ship, the report to consist of a note in the remarks column of the arrival sheet. In case of infectious illness, the report to be in the first instance by telephone to the Hulk " Hygeia " and then by a written report on the form provided, to the Port of London Sanitary Authority, fully setting out the circumstances of the case. 3. To obtain from His Majesty's Customs by constant touch with the " Quarantine Officer " a list of arrivals from Foreign Ports and forward them (weekly) to the Office of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. 4. To notify by telegram to the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of Rochester every case of illness brought to the notice of the Port of London Sanitary Authority's Medical Officer on incoming ships which pass through the Port of Rochester, whether examined or unexamined by him, and note the fact on the arrival sheet. In the event of the removal of cases of Infectious Disease from the district of the Port of Rochester to the isolation hospital of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, at the request of the former Authority a charge will be made. 8 TABLE II.—INFECTIOUS DISEASE. disease. 1917. 1918. 1919. 1920. 1921. 1922. 1923. 1921. 1925.

The patient was sent to hospital for treatment and died there the same day. The Goanese peak was fumigated with sulphur and washed down with carbolic, solution at Calcutta. No further case occurred. The ss. "Selandia," from Bangkok, arrived at Gravesend on the 25th May, 1926, having landed a case of Cholera at Singapore on the 14th April, 1926. The vessel was disinfected and the water tanks emptied and cleansed at Penang, this process being repeated at Suez. No further case occurred. The ss. "City of Manchester" arrived at Gravesend on the 16th July, 1926, from Calcutta, having had twelve cases of illness on board during the voyage. Three cases, firemen and greaser, were attacked with severe diarrhoea and vomiting, died and were buried at sea. The Chief Officer reported that the stools of these three cases were of the "rice water" type. The remaining nine cases had abdominal pains, diarrhoea and sickness, and all recovered. One of these cases was landed at Colombo. The effects of the three fatal cases were dumped and the firemen's section thoroughly cleansed and disinfected with strong carbolic. The passengers' drinking vessels were boiled and a disinfectant put into the water tanks. The firemen were isolated. At Suez a sample of the water was taken, but no report was received; the crew were examined and the native quarters disinfected with sprays and flushing; all effects and soiled linen were taken off the ship, disinfected and returned. Fresh water was taken in at Suez and Port Said, and on arrival of the vessel in London the tanks were emptied, cleansed and fresh water taken in. Owing to the fact that no bacteriological examination was made of the stools, it was difficult to form any definite diagnosis, but from the information available, which was dependent on the master and surgeon, and which only came to hand 32 days after the occurrence, the cases were treated as suspicious of cholera. No further case occurred while the vessel was in the port. The ss. "Elpenor" arrived at Gravesend from Otaru on the 29th August, 1926. During the voyage a Chinese fireman was taken ill with vomiting and acute abdominal pains followed by diarrhoea with frequent watery stools. He ultimately died and was taken ashore at Keelung for post-mortem examination and burial. The result of the post-mortem examination was not known, but the vessel was not quarantined and pratique was granted. Nine other cases (all Europeans) suffered from the same symptoms but all recovered, the average duration of the illness being four days. Water for the ship was taken in at Yokohama. The Europeans and Chinese had separate quarters, food and cooks. 10 The vessel appeared to have been admitted to free pratique everywhere and therefore no further action was taken on arrival in this Port. It was understood that the vessel would be leaving for Liverpool and the Medical Officer for that port was furnished with the history. No further case occurred during the vessel's stay in this port. The ss. " Macedonia " arrived at Gravesend on the 8th October, 1926, having had two cases of cholera on board during the voyage. The first case, the boatswain, was taken ill before arrival at Kobe on the outward journey, and the patient was immediately isolated. A report on the patient's stools proved negative to cholera and he returned to light duty. On August 4th the man was again taken ill with diarrhoea (hourly stools) and was again immediately isolated. The case was reported on arrival at Yokohama and specimens of fæces and vomit taken and found positive on the 5th August. The patient was transferred to hospital at Yokohama on the 6th August. The second case, a coal trimmer, was taken ill on the 6th August, 1926, and was landed to hospital. The case was reported positive on cholera examination. Both cases returned to duty on the 14th August. The vessel was disinfected at Yokohama by the Japanese Authorities. 200 of the crew were landed to the Quarantine Station for observation and subsequently all returned to duty. One of the water tanks was immediately chlorinated and samples from the other tanks were taken and examined bacteriologically, but all found negative to cholera. No further case of cholera occurred.

Your Medical Officer received the following unusual document from an Indian port, signed by the Port Health Officer there, a native of India :— Health Officer, Port of _, 23rd February, 1926. "Sir, I have the honour to report for your information that the ss "_,". under the command of Captain_, sails to-day, the 23rd February, 1926, from this port for London, via Gallee and Malabar Coast, with a number of Indian Crews, the bulk of whom were engaged at cutta, which was declared suspected, on account of Smallpox, and where it was prevalent in an endemic form when they were recruited, and that they were not vaccinated at the time of or after engagement. Lascar:—Yeassin, s/o Muslim. Winchman:—Munsooralle, s/o Abdul. Fireman 1st Tindal:—Roisalle, s/o Mhd. Jossun. Fireman:—Mackroomallee, s/o Umbar Meah. Cussab:—Umborallee, s/o Fazal Mahmd. " The marginally noted Indian Crews, who do not bear any marks of vaccination, were not vaccinated by this Department, as the master of the vessel did not want it and the vaccination is not compulsory in this port. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, >) Of course the personnel named in the letter would afford a susceptible field for transmission of smallpox of whatever form to this country, but the chief interest in the document lies in the fact that the ports which export ship-borne diseases are now so closely cared for as to afford the information here contained. It is also interesting that apparently both India and our own country are debarred the benefits that would accrue from vaccination of susceptible persons liable to hand this disease to and fro. The reasonableness of powers to insist on vaccination of the susceptibles on a ship from an epidemic centre should be very obvious. The ss. "Automedon" arrived at Gravesend from Dalny on the 31st March with two cases of smallpox on board. Case 1.—The vessel was at Shanghai from the 11th—20th February, 1926. The patient was taken ill on the 3rd March and reported to the ship's surgeon on the 5th March, and was placed in isolation on the 9th March. A papular rash appeared on face and arms on the 9th March. Smallpox rash aborted, no scabbing. The patient returned to duty on the 15th March. Infected at Shanghai. Case 2.—Immediate contact with case 1, occupying the same cabin with him. Took ill 21st March with backache, etc. Rash appeared on the 25th March. Both cases were removed to Denton Hospital on the arrival of the vessel at Gravesend. The hospital cabin and poop quarters were fumigated and washed down with "Izal" solution. All bedding and effects were removed for steam disinfection. The whole of the crew and passengers were vaccinated on the 9th March but without any success, and were re-vaccinated on 31st March. All were well on inspection. The vessel was kept under observation during her stay in the Port of London and the names and addresses of the passengers and crew were notified to the respective Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned. No further case occurred. 13 The ss. "City of Durham" arrived at Gravesend from Calcutta on the 9th April having landed a case of smallpox at Aden on the 17th March. All the crew were vaccinated and the vessel disinfected at Aden. No further case occurred. The ss.

A rash appeared on the 6th May, and the patient was isolated on board, being placed in charge of one sick bay steward. At Marseilles the case was regarded as Chickenpox. The patient was seen by me on arrival at Gravesend on the 13th May and was removed to Denton Hospital, proving to be a mild abortive case of smallpox. The vessel left Bombay on the 24th April. Infection took place at Bombay. The whole of the passengers' and crew's addresses were notified to the Medical Officers of Health concerned. A cabin mate of the patient left the ship at Marseilles and his address in Cumberland was notified to the Medical Officer of that district as being that of a close contact. The two-berth cabin and the isolation cabin were sulphur fumigated and washed down with a disinfectant. All textile contents, together with the working clothes of the cabin steward and sick bay attendant were removed to Denton Hospital for steam disinfection. No developments of the disease occurred among the personnel of the ship. On the arrival of the ss. "City of Calcutta" at Gravesend on the 29th May, 1926, from Calcutta, it was reported that a Goanese saloon attendant was suffering from a modified form of smallpox. The patient was taken ill on the 13th May, 1926, a rash appeared on the 14th May, and the patient isolated on the 16th May. At Marseilles the case was diagnosed as one of chickenpox. The patient was removed to Denton Hospital on arrival of the ship at Gravesend on the 29th May. The passengers were found to be well vaccinated and the addresses of them and the crew were notified to the Medical Officers concerned. Twenty-four Goanese were landed at Gravesend and bathed, and their clothes and bedding steam disinfected ; the quarters were washed down with "Izal" and fumigated with sulphur dioxide. On watching the case it was found to be not smallpox. On arrival of the ss. "Albionstar" at Gravesend on the 2nd June, 1926, from Taku Bar, it was reported that the 4th Engineer had been removed from the ship to the Shanghai Isolation Hospital on the 10th April, 1926, suffering from smallpox.

Both cases were Lascars. The first case died on board and was buried at sea. The second case was landed at Suez where he died the same day. The crew were examined at Colombo where the forecastles were fumigated with the effects in situ and the Europeans vaccinated. Further disinfection was carried out at Suez and the Europeans and three of the natives again re-vaccinated. The remainder of the natives were examined at Suez and found to have good marks of recent re-vaccination at Calcutta. No further case occurred. b 2 14 The ss. "Clan Mackinlay" arrived at Gravesend from Chittagong on the 6th August, 1926. An apprentice was taken ill on the 6th July with fever, headache and bleeding from the nose. On the second day of illness a red rash appeared on the body which became vesicular. On the 13th July the patient became delirious and died on the 14th. A doctor at Aden saw the body and diagnosed Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, the case to be treated as infectious. All bedding was destroyed and the patient's clothing taken ashore and disinfected. The infected quarters were disinfected and the crew vaccinated. No further case occurred. TABLE VIII.—Scarlet Fever. Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official No. Where from. No. of Cases.

Total 31 DENGUE FEVER An addition to our exact knowledge on this disease has been made by human experiment on volunteers, and may be summarised as follows:- 1 Vector of Infection, the mosquito Aedes egypti (not the also suspected Culex quinquefasciatus) 2 A human being is infective to the mosquito from 18 hours before to three days after onset of the disease 3 The mosquito infected, becomes infective to man in from 11 to 14 days after sucking blood from a human being suffering from the disease 4 The mosquito remains then infective for man 75 days (proven) oritslife-time 5 The disease shows in man in from 4 to 10 days after being bitten by infected mosquitos The above data are from the Phillipine Islands The limit of the Aedes egypti mosquito is the 60 deg F isotherm This isotherm, in the summer and winter northern mean, passes along a line roughly Florida, Southern Spain, Himalayas, Hong Kong Thus cases of Dengue can be, and have been, reported from Southern Europe, and in hot weather even to latitude 42 deg N The Aedes egypti (synonyms Stegomyia calopus, Aedes calopus, Stegomyia fasciata) is also the disseminating agent for Yellow Fever; by geographical situation (in relation to temperature and the requirements of this mosquito) England must of necessity be free from the gnat itself and from both of the pests it conveys I have formerly reported epidemics of Dengue on shipboard, which have occurred along the Indian coast 25 TABLE XXIV.—Venereal Diseases.

A large store in a warehouse had material which, owing to infrequent turnover, afforded not only ample and apparently delectable food-stuff for rats, but also convenient warm and dry nesting. The damage done attracted the notice of your Inspector in the district and a close examination was made of the means of ingress for the rats, as also the conditions under which they lived, in relation to the question of extermination. An examination of the warehouse showed that there were two rat populations to be dealt with—one having acrobatic ingress, of which the marks were very evident, the approach being by way of greasy machinery ; while the other seemed to have taken up permanent and satisfactory quarters. The proofing out of casual or regular marauders was found to be a very simple proposition—that of covering gnawed and gnawable woodwork with zinc sheeting. 40 This, however, enclosed a large population. The rats inside could only be approached satisfactorily through one of the three necessities for a rat—food, water, and undisturbed nesting. The nesting could not be interfered with, while ample food was found in the material amongst which nesting took place. Water, it was found, could only be obtained through occasional drips from the roof or from fire buckets or by means of holes of approach to the roof guttering, or lastly, from the drips from hydraulic cranes. It was, therefore, determined to entirely cut off the rat from his water. The proofing of the hydraulic cranes by means of wire netting of proper mesh was part of the procedure for preventing ingress. This also kept the rats from the drips from these cranes. Drips from the roof were few and far between, but as the experiment proceeded it was interesting to note that the floor in the way of one drip was scoured clean by the tongues of rats, as an indication of success. Poison added to the water of the fire-buckets was partaken of by a few of the rats. Now that holes to the roof were sealed, it was found that, while in time past trapping in the presence of ample and suitable food and water was unsuccessful, cabbage, which of course presented a certain amount of water, formed an acceptable bait, and trapping was successful; in the result a place formerly inordinately ratty, is to all intents and purposes rat-free at the present moment. One is often asked to suggest means for ridding a place of rats. The method successful in this case is seen to depend entirely on a close consideration of the whole circumstances; such consideration has to be made for each ratty premises dealt with. The important point about the experiment here described is not so much the killing of the rats, as the permanent lowering of the state of rattiness in the prevention of breeding, through the simple process of depriving the breeders of water. A DANGER IN SULPHUR FUMIGATION. One of your Sanitary Inspectors reported as follows:— " While supervising the fumigation of a ship in the Port, the following points were noticed. "The fumigator was experienced in this class of work, but his gear, owing to cost and uncertainty of jobs, was rather primitive, any bare iron surface in the ship being used on which to stand the sulphur candles, and the starting spirit applied from a bottle with a perforated cork. "The after end of ship, side and cross bunkers were under fumigation. These compartments are separated from No. 2 hold by a wooden bulkhead and No. 2 'tween decks continue clear through to No. 1 'tween-decks. " Sulphur candles were on the iron decks of Nos. 2 and 1 'tween-decks, the holds of which had been loaded with casks of pa lm oil and bags of palm kernels ; they also contained palm kernel sweepings, dunnage wood and cargo mats saturated with oil. " With the exception of one hatch at the hold ladder, left open for the ascent of the fumigator, all main deck hatches were on and covered with tarpaulins, making the hold extremely dark. " The fumigator now commenced on forecastles, fore-peaks, and chain lockers ; the peaks butted on to No. 1 'tween-decks, the bulkhead of which proved to be leaky. " The Inspector noticed gas coming from No. 2 hatch and advised the fumigator to start the sulphur candles there before the fumes became too strong, and a man was sent down for his purpose. He was seen to apply spirit and start the candles and to apply more spirit to four candles which were not burning. Becoming partially gassed he hurriedly left his job and ran along the 'tween-decks to No. 1 hold in search of fresh air. " It was then noticed that something was burning at a little distance from the sulphur candles ; fumes were becoming stronger not only from candles in No. 2 'tween-decks, but as a result of leakage from cross-bunker peaks, and to cope with the situation the Inspector descended to No. 2 'tween-decks and put out the fire by stamping on it and by the use of water obtained from on deck. The man returned somewhat recovered and rendered assistance, but the fumes compelled a retirement to deck above. " The explanation given by the fumigator was that although his man had swept that part of the 'tween-decks clear in the morning in readiness for the sulphur candles, some one of the many workmen employed on the ship must have kicked the palm kernel sweepings near to the candles and in the darkness this was not noticed when starting the candles, when some spirit must have fallen wide and ignited the sweepings. " Here the want of suitable gear comes in again ; an electric torch would have shown the operator the nearness of sweepings to the candles and petrol from a suitable can would have been deposited on candles only, whereas the cork being shaken out of the bottle the spirit was thrown widecast." Instructions were given to the inspectors that improperly or dangerously constructed operations were to receive no countenance from them, lest they assume responsibilities in no way theirs. 41 FATAL GASES IN SHIP'S HOLD. I have to record three deaths which have occurred on shipboard, illustrating the dangers of poison gases in two phases of their action on the human body. The first case was one of active poisoning, and occurred on February 1st, in a man engaged in disinfesting a ship by means of Zyklon B. The claim for this method of disinfestation is that methyl chlor-formate, or tear gas, by which the presence of hydrocyanic acid gas—the active ingredient—is indicated, is a safeguard against the deadliness of the latter gas. The inquiry into the death showed that the tear gas ingredient of the mixture had given due warning and that disregard of the warning was accountable for the fatal issue. The holds after disinfestation had been opened out for no less a period than twenty-four hours before the fatality. On entering one of them, a stevedore experienced a burning, choking sensation in the throat and smarting in the eyes. He came out. The man in charge of the fumigation then entered the hold, without precaution, to rig a fan, later seeking to retreat, he fell back from the ladder into the hold, and died in hospital after a few hours from the result of the poisoning. The whole case illustrates:— (1) The substantiation of the claim for Zyklon B. as affording some tection in the use of cyanide gas. (2) The impossibility of undertaking Hydrocyanic acid fumigation with mere empirical knowledge of this gas. The first or the fiftieth experience of its action may be the fatal one. The second case includes two fatalities from the development of carbon dioxide gas in a hold. While the ship was in the Red Sea, on February 2nd, an officer went down into No. 4 hold to look for his keys, which had been dropped between the loose hatch covers separating the lower portion of the hold from the baggage room. The baggage room was itself in the upper part of this hold, in the 'tween decks. The hold contained, of dead oxygen-absorbing material, bales of skins and bags of polished rice, of living oxygen-absorbing material, mustard seed and ground nuts. The living element would simultaneously be giving off Carbon Dioxide in respiration, and the dead, especially the rice, would be yielding the same gas under insensible and sensible fermentation. There was seven feet of space between the deck which floored the baggage room, and the cargo. It appears therefore that the officer and his would-be rescuer—a lascar— dropped into a space in which a heavily charged atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide had accumulated, though only a few bags of rice discharged at Marseilles showed gross activation of fermentation by moisture. In the case of the lascar, the wouldbe rescuer of the officer, suffocation beyond recovery ensued within three minutes. Another rescuer, secured by a rope, immediately felt giddy on entering the fatal space. To the shipping companies the dangers of grain containing spaces, and especially those containing polished rice, need no emphasizing. TABLE XXXIV—FORM A.

In connection with Form C, the following procedure, in the Port of London, supplies the data:— All vessels from foreign ports are visited by a Medical Officer. The questions put by the Customs Officer and the answers made by the Master are heard by him and all cases of reported sickness during the voyage examined or enquired into. Ships from ports in the Eastern Hemisphere, south of latitude 45° N. (except European ports west of longitude 20° E.) and ships from ports in the Western Hemisphere south of latitude 30° N., are considered as from "infected ports" and are boarded and examined whatever the report. Ports or rather coastlines containing Ports are added or exempted according to reports of the movement of infection. Medical examination under this system, whether in spite of a negative or because of a positive report of illness, has from time to time led to the detection of serious conditions of infection. On proceeding, these ships come again under scrutiny by a Sanitary Inspector while in dock, special attention being given to those on which there has been suspicious circumstance during the voyage.

On the 30th March, your Medical Officer certified that the Master of the ss. "Golaa," of Norway, was authorised to purchase, and be in possession of 4 ozs. of Tincture of Opium for the use of the ship until it next reaches its home port. The certificate was issued under the Dangerous Drugs (No. 3) Regulation, 1923, amending the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921, Regulation 15 of which is as follows : "If a foreign ship in any port in Great Britain requires to obtain a supply of any of the drugs in order to complete the necessary equipment of the ship, the master of the ship is authorised to purchase and be in possession of such quantity of any of the drugs as may be certified by the Medical Officer of Health of the Port where the ship is (or in his absence by the Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port) to be necessary for the purpose, the quantity not to exceed what is required for the use of the ship until it next reaches its home port. The certificate given by the Medical Officer or Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port shall be marked by the supplier with the date of the supply and shall be retained by him and kept available for inspection." FOOD INSPECTION. Action under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, resulted in 4,011 tons 15 cwts. 3 qrs. 5½ lbs. of unsound food being destroyed or disposed of in such a manner as to prevent its being used for human consumption. Exceptions are shown in the disposal of some of the goods for the manufacture of confectionery, distillation, refining and by exportation. Disposal of the material was carried out as follows, only those goods which could not be used for some useful purpose being actually destroyed. Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Lbs.

The annual number of seizures each year since 1908 is as follows:— Year. No. of seizures. Year. No. of seizures. 1908 437 1918 359 1909 578 1919 449 1910 839 1920 634 1911 747 1921 586 1912 694 1922 932 1913 781 1923 848 1914 791 1924 992 1915 639 1925 1,196 1916 690 1926 1,620 1917 473 The detention and control of Fats during the year was as follows:— Total No. of casks, barrels, etc., reported as imported into the district 71,108 No. of casks found to be officially certificated ; material released 6,690 No. of casks not officially certificated, and released to wharves under Notice of Exportation 17,928 No. of Notices for exportation served in the case of uncertificated material 438 No. of casks released for exportation 28,225 No. of casks released direct from ship for purposes other than human food—soapmaking, lubrication, etc 17,230 'No. of casks released for soapmaking, from stocks detained at the docks under notice 312 44 Edible tallow (whale oil) to the number of 15,107 casks also came under the notice of your officers; this material was released. The mass of correspondence necessary in the control of Fats remains consistent. All tallow released for export is followed up by a Sanitary Inspector to see that the material is actually shipped. This relates to material released from the wharves, as well as docks, for export by vessels leaving the Port. The work of food examination is growing, and may be further increased by the introduction of the Public Health (Preservatives, &c., in Food) Regulations, which come into force on the 1st January, 1927, as regards certain foods. Actinomycosis in Ox Tongues—A percentage examination is made of every consignment of ox tongues arriving in the district. About 313 consignments were put into Dock Store, where a careful examination of some 59,499 tongues was made by your officers. 630 tongues were found to be affected with Actinomycosis, the disease ranging from 0.4 to 5.5 per cent. It is unusual to find a consignment which yields more than 1 per cent. diseased. Ox Tongue Roots—All tongue roots landed in the Port are placed in Dock Store and a percentage examination made. About 9 consignments, totalling 4,483 tongue roots, were examined, and 59 roots found to be diseased. In November a lighter laden with about 2,700 carcases of mutton sank in the river. This cargo was sent direct to the contractors to the Corporation of London, for disposal. The weight of this meat was given as 36 tons 7 cwts. 2 qrs. 7 lbs. A vessel arrived on the 11th December from New Zealand. The meat in No. 1 hold was damaged by fire and water. A question arose as to the disposal of this unsound meat, and a magistrate's decision was obtained on the 19th December (see Legal Proceedings). Pork—A careful examination was made of a percentage of pig carcases landed in the district. Carcases examined 9,222. Carcases found to be diseased, 5, weighing 2 cwts. 0 qrs. 25 lbs. Seven bags of Pork weighing 6 cwts. 0 qrs. 18 lbs. were also destroyed. The general state of pig carcases entering at the port is excellent.

From a microscopic examination of the sterols and the melting point of their antates, after several re-crystallisations, I am of opinion that the sample is not entirely vegetable fat and does contain some animal fat; at any rate, from the results obtained, it would be most unsafe to certify it as entirely vegetable.

OIL TAINTED MEAT. Arrived 31st December, 1925. With regard to a consignment of about 17,000 carcases of mutton and lamb arriving and placed under a stop in the Port, on the 5th February, 1926, your Medical Officer issued the following letter to all persons known to be interested:— Dear Sirs, ss. " " Oil Tainted Meat at Victoria Dock. With regard to the above-mentioned meat, it would appear from the latest experiment in cooking that there is some reasonable prospect of entirely getting rid of the oil taint by further cold storage and airing; this would be largely facilitated by the removal of the shirts. It already appears that the lamb is very nearly taint free apart from the shirts, and the only difficulty in my mind as to eventual freedom for the whole consignment lies in the cut surfaces of mutton fat. Present indications suggest a further period of storage with or without removal of the shirts. Again, however, I would enter the warning that the ultimate result is not certain. Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. In the happy result it was found possible to release the whole of this material without prejudice to the public. It had been an atmosphere of oil fumes which had tainted the meat and not direct oil contact. Domestic experiment was made from time to time to find out how the process of airing was proceeding towards the required and satisfactory end. A vessel arrived from River Plate on the 30th March, 1926, with a cargo consisting of:— Beef, 1,002 quarters. Pigs, 108 carcases. Mutton, 3,910 carcases. Offal, 2,749 packages. „ 40 sides. Butter, 99 cases. 58 On examination, this meat and butter were found to be oil tainted caused by a leakage in the oil pipes on the vessel ; the bottom tier had been in actual contact with oil. The 99 cases of butter and the badly damaged meat were at once destroyed by your contractors. The remainder was put into Cold Store and after various examinations it was found possible to release the meat on the 21st July for general sale. CHILLED BEEF FROM AUSTRALIA. A shipment of chilled beef from Australia arrived on the 21st July, 1926, and was duly examined by your Inspector. The consignment consisted of about 800 hind quarters shipped at Brisbane. By the courtesy of the High Commissioner for Australia your Medical Officer was in possession of the intimate preliminary details of this experimental consignment before arrival. The fact of receiving chilled beef from Australia, whether considered as a scientific achievement or as a solid commercial proposition, is one of profound interest in all its varied detail. Cattle selection, killing, dressing, cooling, weight loss, wrapping, hanging, stowage, insulation, original and intermediate costings and eventual price to the consumer are all in their turn part of Public Health in its wider aspects, but the immediate points for consideration were:— (1) Whether the meat had been superficially treated in any way except by exposure to chilling temperatures. I am assured it had not been so treated. (2) Whether the meat had turned out free from taint or mould growth. (3) Whether the meat was of acceptable appearance to the retail purchaser on "thawing," as chilled meat. Fractional crystallisation of muscle substance under freezing temperatures separates its constituents in a way that is evidenced by drip of sanious water on thawing, since the intimate compound of albumens and water within fibre sheaths is so altered on freezing as to be beyond reconstitution as muscle. The ideal of chilling sufficiently to prevent growth of moulds and microorganisms without some degree of the freezing change taking place is hard of realisation. Yet chilled meat at its best differs markedly from frozen in this respect of constitutional change, forming therefore a more attractive and marketable commodity. The imperfection of any insulation requires that an elaborate arrangement for a scheme of cooling and record be provided throughout the whole time of carriage. The closer to 32 deg. F. the temperature of the meat is brought and kept the better. Cold air in this experiment was to be equably distributed so as to renew the air of the chamber once every 15 days. The aim was a nice balance between heat of conduction and frost, so that carriage at a chamber temperature of 32 deg. F. might be effected. One gain to the consumer is the obvious premium on cleanliness of a high order which must obtain throughout every process in the attempt to ship chilled meat over long distances. Contamination in any stage not only vitiates the meat, but prejudices the commercial success of the venture. Commerce and health so far thus intimately run hand in hand. Between killing and shipment (25th—27th May) the temperature of the meat varied from 32 deg. to 34 deg. F. In loading (27th—28th May) the special chamber, situated in No. 4 'tween deck, varied from 32 deg. to 45 deg. F. and then 37 deg. F. The insulation of the chamber was effected by means of wood shavings which, among insulating media, are said to afford an unattractive hold to mould germs. 59 CANNED LOBSTER. A consignment of 124 cases of lobster, 44 cases, each containing 48 cans, was the subject of considerable correspondence. The consignment showed four types with every intermediate grade, on examination. (1) The obviously blown can "tight swells" mostly with altered and stinking contents. A variant on these is the obviously blown without so obvious an alteration. (2) The "springer" or "slack," where blowing has proceeded to a degree which just overbalances the external air pressure by the gas of internal decomposition. These categories were stopped. (3) The can in which there is an internal vacuum to all appearances, but on puncture there is emission of gas. In these the strength of the tin is masking early decomposition with gas formation. (4) The good cans. It was quite impossible to separate groups 3 and 4 unless by puncture of each tin. I asked the consent of the consignees to destruction of groups 1 and 2; the packers in the Dominion, which exported, asked delay in destruction and re-shipment of the goods, writing: "What needs to be done is to give the goods a short water bath, say twenty minutes and vent them and then stop them." They further wrote: " we found the contents of excellent quality and not showing the least sign of deterioration, the whole trouble is caused by the cans being too full." Venting of decomposing canned goods as a proposal is primitive in the art of canning and of course outside consideration in the practice of public health. Destruction, however, was held over at the request of the overseas Dominion concerned and with the agreement of the consignee, and two cases were released to that government for their information and experiment. Re-shipment of the whole seizure was requested by the Dominion government but was not permitted as contrary to the policy adopted by your Worshipful Committee and unnecessary to the determination of the faulty processing of the goods in manufacture. TINNED CHERRIES. A hundred cases, each containing 24 tins of cherries in syrup, were detained. The cans showed on analysis (four samples) 68—148 parts per million Sulphur Dioxide; this is well within the limits laid down in the "preservatives" regulations about to come into force. There was a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen on opening a sample and evidence that the tin of the container had been attacked. In a few days after opening, the smell had entirely disappeared from the can, leaving cherries apparently coloured with eosin, pretty and neither harmful nor particularly useful as an article of diet. The disgust which would be inevitable to the average buyer of one of these cans, suggests that their release should only be made to a firm of manufacturers of delicacies, of such standing as could ensure the airing of the contents on opening of the cans. I asked for guarantees accordingly.

INTRODUCTION OF NEW LEGISLATION. The Public Health (Puerperal Fever and Puerperal Pyrexia) Regulations, 1926, came into force on the 1st October, 1926. The Public Health (Imported Milk) Regulations, 1926, came into force on the 1st October, 1926. The Sanitary Officers Order, 1926, came into force on the 1st June, 1926, and revoked the Order of 1922. The Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, will come into operation on the 1st July, 1927. SEWAGE DISPOSAL—SOUTHEND-ON-SEA. A Bill was before Parliament to make further provision with respect to the disposal of sewage early in 1926. The existing sewage and sewage disposal works of the Corporation of Southend are insufficient for dealing with the largely increased population of the Borough. This increase is about 2\ times since 1909, the date of the previous Sewage Act. It is therefore necessary to alter or repeal the provisions contained in the Southend-on-Sea Corporation Act, 1909, so as to enable the Corporation to build additional works and discharge from them into the sea. No such discharge into the estuary of the River Thames will be undertaken until screens for the removal from the sewage of gross solid matter have been constructed and sewage tanks provided for the sedimentation of all sewage entering the sewers of the Corporation. Sewage and storm water entering the sewers of the Corporation at a rate exceeding three times the average daily dry weather flow shall not of necessity undergo screening and sedimentation. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal will be followed. The present degree of purification will be lessened. The scheme provides for the outflow of sewage at the eastern boundary of the Borough below low-water mark, at a distance of two miles E.S.E. of the present outfall and just to the west of a peculiar and constant low tide neck of land from which its attendant water inlet takes the natural name of " Knock Swin." The state of purification of sewage thrown from a seaside resort, such as is Southend-on-Sea, need not, I feel be for the consideration of the Port of London Sanitary Authority provided solids are screened and a degree of purification beyond this attained. This Authority's interest, though extending to foreshore pollution, is not of the vital moment in the same matter as is that proper to Southend-on-Sea. As the Authority dealing with shellfish layings, however, the Port of London Sanitary Authority is interested. Mr. Deane, the Consulting Engineer, detailed on behalf of the Corporation of Southend to conduct float experiments with regard to the flow of water at and about the Knock Swin, i.e., the outfall, supplied for the perusal of the Port of London Sanitary Authority a series of maps of bis experiments which trace clearly the direction of flow from the proposed sewage outfall at various states of the varying tides. These distinctly show, amongst other matters of interest :— (1) That the set of the tide in flood trends eastward and northward over the flats which lie in front of Southend, especially Thorpe Bay. (2) That the set of the tides on the ebb is parallel to the shore at first, then trending southward over the flats. (3) That the flow in calm weather from the proposed sewage outfall would reach the Mouse Light, a total distance of nine miles on one ebb tide. (4) An extremely interesting record of the flood tide in and about the Swin. 67 The presence and shape of the Swin and projecting knock are suggestive of a peculiar condition of flow, but one is hardly prepared for the findings that floats laid at low water at the Swin mouth are actually carried northward and eastward past Shoeburyness and over the Maplin Sands as the tide flows, so that as Mr. Deane reports " at neap tides most of the water required to cover the Maplin Sands in front of Shoeburyness finds its way through the Knock Swin passing to the north-east. Had it been possible to follow the floats further, I should have expected them to have continued on, in a north-easterly direction, under the influence of the ebb tides." The significance of this is that a portion of the last emptyings of the proposed sewer would be carried, on the rising tide, away over the Maplin Sands in a welldiluted state by a back eddy current due to Shoeburyness. This current helps to account for the persistent shape and position of the Knock Swin, a curve roughly north and east. The two areas of foreshore affected by the flood flow of the ebb tailings from the sewer would be the areas C and D which have been placed under orders by your Worshipful Committee as shell fish layings. I am of opinion that the question of pollution of shell fish beds is but little affected by the proposed change of outfall position, any slight disadvantage in areas C and D being compensated by slight improvement in areas A and B owing to the moving of the outfall to the E.S.E. This consideration only applies to dry-weather sewage flows, and even so, the lessened degree of purification proposed and increase of population since the foreshore shell fish beds of this district were under review have to be borne in mind. It is advantageous that the area D under the Shell fish Orders of the Port Sanitary Authority was so arranged as to include the lower portion of the Maplin Sands. The interests of the Port of London Sanitary Authority are foreshore pollution and pollution of shell fish layings. The shell fish layings of this district are already under Orders. I therefore suggested that there is no cause for opposition to the present Southend Sewage Scheme by this Authority. SEWAGE WORKS. STROOD RURAL DISTRICT COUNCIL. In June notice was received that the Strood Rural District Council proposed constructing sewage disposal works in close proximity to the Isolation Hospital of this Authority at Denton. It was stated:— "The sewage will only be retained in the tanks some 15 or 16 hours and will be discharged in a fresh condition. No sludge will be allowed to accumulate in the sedimentation tanks. The crude sludge will never be exposed, but will be removed in cast-iron pipes from the bottom of the settling tanks to about mid-depth in the digestion tank, in which it will be retained for some four months before being discharged on to the draining beds." The following data was submitted:— Present population, about 1,200. Prospective population, provided for, 1,500. Dry-weather flow, 20 gallons per head, equals 30,000 gallons per day. Maximum flow to be dealt with, 3 D.W.F., equals 90,000 gallons per day. The position selected for the sludge beds is within 300 feet of the staff residence and wards of the Hospital, and your Medical Officer pointed out that already the staff and patients at the Hospital experience serious nuisance at times from the Gravesend sewage works, which are some distance away, and to construct sewage works within 300 feet of the residential block at Denton Hospital would be very undesirable. The Strood Rural District Council were, therefore, informed that opposition to their proposal would be made by the Port of London Sanitary Authority. I 68 LEAGUE OF NATIONS. VISIT OF FOREIGN MEDICAL OFFICERS. On Saturday, March 20th, Medical Officers of Health from France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Yugo Slavia, Panama, Austria, Brazil, Canada, and Hungary, together with the Medical Officers of Health of Kensington and Halifax amongst the British Boroughs, examined the conditions obtaining in the jurisdiction of your Worshipful Committee. Denton Hospital was visited and due explanation of the system of Port Sanitation found to be sufficient and effective in the circumstances of the London waterway, made. The Officers expressed to your Chairman their great appreciation of the facilities and hospitality offered by the Port Sanitary Authority in this demonstration. Estimation of the benefits of such meetings is difficult, under-estimation very easy ; on the lowest grounds they constitute good business and on the higher plane consolidate that comity of nations to which Port Sanitation is always subject and for many decades has been increasingly submitted to a degree not customarily recognised outside Port Sanitary Authorities. VISIT OF NORTH SEA AND BALTIC PORT MEDICAL OFFICERS. A visit under International arrangement of North Sea and Baltic Port Medical Officers to the jurisdiction of your Worshipful Committee is of definite significance compared with former visits of foreign Medical Officers. At present the North Sea and Baltic are so free from ship-borne diseases that they alone, amongst the ports of the world, save for a few coast lines, are not submitted in the Port of London to a detailed examination of their arrivals, though, of course, the usual quarantine questions are put. This state of affairs is one which it is highly desirable should be maintained, and if there be anything in the methods of the Port of London Sanitary Authority which can be of use to this end when applied to their ports it would be beneficial, as also that our methods be seen and, even possibly, criticised. Without an intimate knowledge of the work of Port Sanitation it cannot be sufficiently recognised how that such a visit may chance to be of large monetary worth to this Port and country. Internationalism with regard to ship-borne diseases is no new phase in the world's history, but such recent developments as these educative tours for those most intimately concerned is a new and welcomed feature. GLASGOW DEPUTATION. A Deputation of four members from Glasgow visited the Port, at short notice, 011 Tuesday, the 14th September, seeking information which would aid in determining the arrangements of Port Sanitation at Glasgow as regards ship-borne diseases. The Chairman of your Worshipful Committee afforded hospitality and your Medical Officer information, for both of which the members of the Deputation expressed themselves greatly indebted, especially as finding a similarity of quality in the problems of the ports of London and Glasgow. JUBILEE CELEBRATION AND CONGRESS. ROYAL SANITARY INSTITUTE. In connection with the Jubilee Celebration and Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute, held in London from July 5th to 10th, there was a gathering of Chairmen of Port Sanitary Authorities and Port Medical Officers, in view of a special Port Sanitary Section. A survey of the Port afforded to these gentlemen by means of the launch "Joseph White," under the Presidency of Mr. Victor Brown, was much appreciated. 69 A paper of outstanding importance was read by Sir George Buchanan at the Conference of Representatives of Port Sanitary Authorities on International agreements affecting Port Sanitary work. International Port Sanitation is steadily increasing in protective influence, lightening the incidence of infection at our Ports by extending the lines of defence to the coasts of countries where exotic diseases are endemic. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, during the year ended 31st December, 1926. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a "canal" for the purposes of the Act, " includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb or flow of the tide." The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the right bank— On the left bank— From Teddington downwards:— From Teddington downwards:— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). The entrance of the River Brent. Hay's Dock. Hammersmith Creek. St. Saviour's Dock. Chelsea Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Dock. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Deadman's Dock. Bow Creek (River Lea). Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Barking Creek (River Roding). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). The entrance to Gravesend Canal. Mucking Creek. Cliffe Creek. Thames Haven. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Hole Haven. Part of the River Medway, and of the Swale. Havengore Creek. River Roach as far as Rochford. RIVER. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as the Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows:— Upper District.— Teddington to Greenwich Inspector Coombe,£150 per annum. Middle District.— Greenwich to Erith Ditto. ditto. Lower District.— Erith to seaward limits of the Port of London (including part of the River Medway) InspectorCliffond,£160per annum. The docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend District. Central District.— West India Dock Inspector Elward, £290 per annum. South-West India Dock Poplar Dock Millwall Dock I2 70 Eastern District.— Royal Victoria Dock Inspector Berry, £270 per annum. Inspector Lambe, £290 per annum. East India Dock Royal Albert Dock King George V. Dock Western District.— London Dock Inspector Gray, £170 per annum. St. Katharine Dock Regent's Dock Surrey Commercial Dock Gravesend District.— Tilbury Dock Inspector Massie, £280 per annum. Left Shore, from Purfleet down Right Shore, from Erith down The total number of inspections for the year was 222, representing a nett number of 122 boats. The remainder—100—represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 37 (inspected on 57 occasions, or 25.67 per cent, of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous five years being 35.64 per cent.). In addition to the above, 8 boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin door locked, there being no persons on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of boats inspected. With reference to the various infringements of the Act:— 1926. Unregistered Boats.
