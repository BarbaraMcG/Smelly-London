The Council considered the subject of the result of the Chairman not voting in Divisions at Meetings of the Council when there is not a majority of the members present either in favour of or against the question. Sec. 28 of 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120, provides that all questions shall be decided by the votes of the majority of the members present. This has been held to mean all the members present whether voting or not. Sec. 75 of the Local Government Act, 1888, applies to the London County Council Schedule II. of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, which provides (Rule 10) that all questions may be decided by the majority of such members of the Council as are present and vote, and sec. 59 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1894, applies to the proceedings of District Councils and Boards of Guardians Schedule I. of the Public Health Act, 1875, which provides that questions at meetings shall be decided by a majority of votes by the members present and voting on that question. 19. The Council being of opinion that the law as to meetings of Metropolitan Borough Councils should be the same as the abovementioned provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, called the attention of the Metropolitan Borough Councils' Association to the matter, and asked them to consider the desirability of taking steps to secure an amendment of Sees. 28 and 57 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. Chairman not Voting in Divisions. 20. A summons having been issued by the Council against the London and South Western Railway Company for failing to give notice of alterations to water-closets at Earlsfield Station, the magistrate fined the defendants 20s. and 2s. costs. The Company appealed against the decision, and the appeal was heard in the High Court on the 8th and 9th March before Mr. Alterations to Waterclosets. 31 Justice Ridley and Mr. Justice Darling, when it was dismissed with costs against the Company. 21. Several complaints of alleged disorderly houses were inquired into but it was only necessary to take proceedings in one case in the Clapham North Ward, in respect of which the defendant was fined £10 and £3 3s. costs or one month's imprisonment. Disorderly Houses. 22. The necessary steps were taken for ascertaining the opinion of the hairdressers and barbers in the Borough with reference to the draft Order referred to in the last Annual Report (page 43). The voting papers received showed that there were 143 hairdressers' and barbers' shops in the Borongh and -only 9 2 occupiers of shops in favour of the proposed Order, and as section 3 of the Act provides that if two-thirds of the occupiers of the shops to be affected approve the Order it may be made, the Council decided to take no further action with regard to it. Shop Hours Act. 23. With regard to the proposed closing Order for the Clapham North and South Wards generally, also referred to in the last Annual Report, the Council considered petitions signed by 127 traders of Clapham and representations made by a deputation from the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks in favour of an Order, and resolutions passed by the Putney Traders' Council and the Balham Shop-keepers Defence Committee respectively, against an Order being made. A register of the shops in the two Clapham Wards was prepared in accordance with the Act, when it was found that there were 818 shops to which the Act applied in those Wards, and as the petition in favour of an Order was signed by only 127 traders the petitioners were informed that the Council was of opinion that no prima facie case had been made out for the suggested closing Order. 24. The Council considered 20 applications for new licenses for the sale in the Borough of intoxicating liquors, and opposed such applications with the exception of the following, viz. :— Licenses. (a) Shop adjoining Streatham Hill Station—beer, off (in casks and not less than six bottles only). 32 (b) No. 121, Mitcham Lane, Streatham—beer, off (not less than one dozen bottles only). (c) No. 10, Gassiott Terrace, Franciscan Road, Tooting—beer, wine and spirits, off (bottles only). 25. The Justices refused all the applications with the exception of those relating to No. 121, Mitcham Lane, and No. 120, Revelstoke Road, Wandsworth—beer, wine, and spirits, off. 26. At the Newington Licensing Sessions it is the practice for applicants and objectors to appear by counsel. The Council, seeing 110 reason why solicitors should not appear at Newington as at other licensing sessions, instructed its Solicitor to personally appear in opposition to licenses. On the Solicitor attending, his appearance was objected to by the Bar and the Clerk to the Justices, but the Justices agreed to hear him in his capacity as Solicitor to the Council. 27. Notice of objection was given to the renewal of certain licenses 011 account of the condition of the sanitary conveniences attached to the premises. The required works having been executed the objections were withdrawn. At the request of the Justices, the Council authorized the Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspectors to give evidence at the Licensing Sessions as to the sanitary state of a number of licensed premises, the requirements of the neighbourhood, and the position of the nearest licensed premises. 28. Forty-eight notices of intention to apply for the transfer of licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors and twenty notices of intention to apply for the renewal of music and dancing licenses in the Borough were considered, and no objection made thereto. 29. The London United Tramways Act, 1902, authorised certain extensions of the Company's lines in (amongst other places) Wimbledon, Merton and Kingston. The Act incorporated Section 27 of the Company's Act of 1901, which is as follows:— "The Company may execute all such works on or in connection with the tramways, and in, over, or under the streets, roads or bridges in or over which the same are laid, as may be necessary or expedient for working the tramways by mechanical power as aforesaid, and may lay down, construct, erect and maintain on, in, under or over the London United Tramways. 33 face orbed of any street, road, footway, bridge, river or place, and may, with the consent in writing of the owner or occupier of any house or building, attach to such house or building, such posts, conductors, wires, tubes, mains, plates, cables, boxes and apparatus, and may make and maintain such openings and ways in, on, or under any such surface or bed as may be necessary or convenient either for the working of the tramways or for connecting any portions of the tramways, or for providing access to or forming connections with any generating station or other stations, engines, machinery, or apparatus." 30. No new generating station was authorised by the Act of 1902, nor were any of the tramways referred to in the Bill situate in this Borough. In March, 1905, the Company gave notice to the Council of their intention to break up the roadway along Park Side, Wimbledon Common, Putney Hill, Putney High Street, and Putney Bridge, for the purpose of laying cables to connect an intended sub-station at or near Kingston, with the central power station at Lot's Road, Chelsea. The Council objected to the proposal and requested the Company to withdraw their notice. This the Company declined to do, and, upon the advice of counsel, application was made for an injunction to restrain the Company from breaking up the roads in question. The Council contended that the Company had no authority to break up or disturb the streets in districts where they had not been empowered to lay a tramway, and that prior to the application for the Act of 1902 no notice was posted up in any of the streets in this Borough where it was proposed to lay the electric cable. The application was heard before Mr. Justice Warrington on the 20th May, and dismissed, the judge being of opinion that the Company had power to execute the works necessary in connection with the working of their system with the generating station in Lot's Road. 31. The Company having served similar notices on the Chelsea and Fulham Borough Councils, Wimbledon District Council and the London County Council, a Conference of Representatives of those authorities and this Council was held to consider the desirability of appealing against the decision, but having regard to the judgment of Mr. Warrington and to the views of the other authorities concerned, the Council decided not to appeal against the decision. 32. The Council having had under consideration the decision of the Metropolitan Water Board to introduce in the next session of Parliament a Bill providing for a uniform Water Supply. 34 scale of charges applicable throughout the Board's limits of supply, informed the Metropolitan Water Board that it was of opinion:— (1) That the basis of all domestic charges should be rateable value (2) That there should be an inclusive charge, embracing baths, high pressure and water-closets. (3) That no water for domestic service should be supplied by meter. (4) That hospitals and charitable institutions should be accorded no differential treatment. (5) That having regard to section 15 (2) and (3) of the Metropolis Water Act, 1902, there should be no limit to the rate which the Water Board should be authorised to charge. (6) Tnat there should be one uniform rate for all rateable values up to £150 and a lower rate in respect of all rateable values exceeding £150—the higher rate to be charged on the first £150 of any rateable value. (7) That the Water Board should have power to make special arrangements with regard to large properties using very little water. This Bill has not yet been introduced. 33. Several complaints from College Park, Wandsworth Common, and its vicinity of the misuse of the commons by loafers and bad characters were considered, and the attention of the Police Authorities and the London County Council was directed to the matter with the view of steps being taken by them to remedy the cause for complaint, and the County Council as a means to that end were requested to empark the strip of the common between the County Arms public house and the Borough boundary, and to lay it out with lawns and flower beds. 34. In reply, the Commissioner of Police stated that numerous persons had been prosecuted for offences committed on the common, and that it was hoped that the action taken would have the necessary deterrent effect; and the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the County Council stated that they did not see their way to recommend that Council to empark the strip of the common referred to. Wandsworth Common. 35. The Council has had under consideration the subject of the difficulty experienced and the expense incurred in preparing separate lists of voters for each of the numerous areas transferred from the several parishes for municipal, but not for Parliamentary purposes, by schemes made under the Parliamentary Boundaries. 35 visions of the London Government Act, and the inconvenience and confusion occasioned by the use of the separate lists for election purposes. The Local Government Board have been asked to consider the subject with the view of steps being taken for the rectification of Parliamentary Boundaries in the County of London. 36. The attention of the Local Government Board has again been called to the unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to combined drainage and the Board were asked to consider the subject with the view of a Bill to amend the law being introduced in the present session. A reply has since been received stating that the subject is one of considerable difficulty and that the President was not in a position to make any promises with regard to legislation upon it this session. Combined Drainage. 37. The Council considered the following resolution passed by the Woolwich Borough Council, viz. :— Parliamentary Returning Officers. "That in the opinion of this Council an amendment of the law providing "for the permanent appointment of Town Clerks of the several Metropolitan " Boroughs as Parliamentary Returning Officers is desirable." 38. This Council concurred in the views of the Woolwich Borough Council and so informed the Prime Minister, the Local Government Board, the London County Council, and the Sheriff of the County of London. 39. A sewer in a new road not having been completed in accordance with the approved plan, Police Court proceedings were taken by the Council in the matter. The defence was (1) that no offence had been committed by the defendant for the reason that there was no time limit for the completion of the sewer, and (2) that if an offence had been committed the Council were out of time as the date on which he ceased work on the sewer was more than six months from the issuing of the summons. It appeared that the defendant before the completion of the sewer sold the land abutting on the road as well as the site of the road to another person, who declined to allow the defendant to complete the sewer or to do the work himself. Eventually, however, the new owner consented to the defendant carrying out the work. The Council, being of opinion that steps should be taken to prevent a similar difficulty arising, asked the County Council to consider the matter with the view of obtaining Non- completion of Sewer. 36 an amendment of the law as to the time allowed for the construction of sewers, and for taking proceedings in the event of their not being constructed in accordance with the approved plans. The County Council stated in reply that difficulties of the nature referred to appeared to be of very occasional occurrence, and that in the absence of further instances and information that Council was of opinion that no case could be shown for an amendment of the law. 40. An owner of property in Fallsbrook Road having appealed against the decision of the Magistrate on a summons issued by the Council under the Fallsbrook Road repairs apportionment, the appeal was heard before the Lord Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ridley and Mr. Justice Darling, and allowed on two points out of the four raised by the appeal. The Court refused to allow the appellant's costs as the decision 011 the main point was in favour of the Council. A fresh apportionment has since been made in accordance with the decision of the Court. Fallsbrook Road Repairs Apportionment. 41. Councillors Ball, Phillips, and Toms attended as this Council's representatives a Conference convened by the Hackney Borough Council of representatives of such Metropolitan Borough Councils as do not possess the power of appointing Assessment Committees. Resolutions were passed in favour of an amendment of the law so as to provide that each Metropolitan Borough Council should appoint the Assessment Committee for the Borough, and requesting the Borough Councils affected to appoint members to form a deputation to the President of the Local Government Board to urge upon him the necessity of the proposal. Alderman Anderson and Councillor Ball were appointed this Council's representatives on the proposed deputation, which, however, did not wait upon the President, the Board having stated that the President was aware of the situation, that it did not at present appear to him that it could be dealt with apart from the general question of valuation—a matter upon which the Government did not propose to introduce legislation that Session, and that under the circumstances it did not seem necessary for the deputation to attend. Assessment Committees. 42. This was an action brought by Mr. Wiggins for compensation in respect of injuries alleged to have been sustained in consequence of his falling off a van belonging to the Council at the Garratt Lane shoot. The action was heard before the Wiggins v. Council. 37 Lord Chief Justice and a special jury on the 18th July, when judgment was given for the plaintiff for £55 damages. Although the Lord Chief Justice declined to rule that there was no evidence of negligence to go to the jury he expressed his disagreement with the verdict, and under the circumstances the Council appealed against the judgment. The appeal was heard before the Lord Chancellor, Lord Justice Vaughan and Lord Justice Stirling, on the 18th January last, and dismissed. 43. The Council had under consideration complaints as to the obstruction and annoyance caused by costermongers standing in Bedford Hill, representations made by a deputation from residents at Bedford Hill, petition signed by 721 residents at Balham, asking the Council to take steps to clear Bedford Hill of the costermongers' barrows, and thus relieve the congested state of the road and remove a nuisance to the neighbourhood and a danger to the public ; and a petition from residents in Hildreth Street, asking that the costermongers might be transferred from Bedford Hill to Hildreth Street. The Council forwarded a copy of the before-mentioned petitions to the Commissioner of Police and asked him to take steps for the removal of the costermongers from Bedford Hill. In reply the Commissioner stated that in the event of the Council deciding to institute proceedings against the costermongers the Police would assist by taking their names and addresses. The Council thereupon decided to accept the services of the Police, and to take action to remove the costermongers from Bedford Hill. Summonses were issued against costermongers for obstruction, and the Magistrate being satisfied that the costermongers caused a nuisance to the inhabitants and an obstruction to the traffic, fined one of the defendants 5s. and 2s. costs, and adjourned the hearing of the other summonses sine die on the understanding that the costermongers would no longer stand in Bedford Hill. The costermongers now stand in Hildreth Street and not in Bedford Hill. Costermongers, Bedford Hill. 44. No steps having been taken by the Local Government Board with the view of obtaining an amendment of the law relating to charges made under apportionments of the cost of paving new streets upon which places of worship abut so as to secure uniformity of treatment in the case of all churches, chapels, or other buildings used exclusively or irrevocably for purposes of religious worship, this Council asked the County Council to take the Paving Charges. 38 necessary steps to obtain an amendment of the law to provide that, so. long as the Established Church is exempt from paving charges, where any "new street" which is within the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts relating to the paving of new streets, or any part of such street, abuts on one side on a church of any denomination used exclusively for religious purposes a fair proportion of the cost of the first paving of such street or part of a street shall be charged against the General Rates of the Borough. In reply the County Council stated that it had already called the attention of the Local Government Board to the inequality which exists in the matter, and had asked that Board to obtain such an amendment of the law as would make places of" worship now exempt subject to them. This Council thereupon asked the Local Government Board to take the necessary steps to obtain an amendment of the law in accordance with the views of this Council expressed above. 45. Sir Henry Kimber, Bart., M.P., presented "The Roberts" Rifle Challenge Cup for perpetual competition within the Borough, and asked the Council to take charge of the cup for the present. The Council thanked Sir Henry for his gift, and has taken charge of the cup until further arrangements have been made with regard to it. "The Roberts" Rifle Challenge Cup. 46. Councillors Harrison and Welton attended as this Council's representatives a Conference convened by the London Chamber of Commerce, of local authorities and others, on the subject of the audit and standardisation of municipal accounts. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference, viz.:— (1) That this Conference, representing Chambers of Commerce, Industrial Associations, Municipal Corporations and Local Authorities, expresses its regret that effect has not been given to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Municipal Trading as regards appointing independent professional auditors of municipal accounts. (2) That this Conference is convinced of the desirability of securing as far as possible the standardisation of the accounts of Municipal and Local Authorities on business lines, and recommends that such accounts be kept on the basis of Income and Expenditure and not on the basis of Receipts and Payments as is at present often the case, and also that Trading and Profit and Loss Accounts be prepared yearly of the various commercial undertakings of such Authorities. (3) That this Conference, while welcoming the Departmental Committee recently appointed to enquire and report with regard to the systems Municipal Accounts. 39 on which the accounts of Local Authorities in England and Wales, &c. should be kept, is of opinion that it should be strengthened by the addition of independent members connected with practised accountancy, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Municipal Trading. (4) That a Deputation from this Conference wait upon the President of the Local Government Board to urge upon him the necessity for giving effect to the recommendations of this Conference. 47. This Couucil has introduced several amendments in the form of accounts published this year, with the view of giving the ratepayers fuller and clearer information as to the receipts and expenditure. 48. Councillor Godfrey Evans was appointed the Council's representative on a deputation of representatives of Local Authorities which waited upon the Home Secretary, on the 29th March, in favour of an amendment of the law relating to street betting. The Home Secretary suggested to the deputation that Lord Davey's Bill on the subject, which had been introduced into the House of Lords for several years past should be introduced into the House of Commons as a Private Member's Bill, and stated that he would consult his colleagues as to how far they would be able to support and give facilities for the Bill. Lord Davey's Bill has been read a third time in the House of Lords this session. The Bill provides that any person frequenting any street or public place for the purpose of betting shall be liable for a first offence to a penalty of not exceeding £10, for a second offence £20, and for a third or subsequent offence, or where the person committing the offence has any betting transaction with a person under sixteen years of age, to a fine of £50 or to imprisonment for not exceeding six months.

Councillor Godfrey Evans attended as this Council's representative a Conference convened by the Garden City Association on the subject of Housing and Rural Depopulation, held on the 16th March. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference, viz. :— "That the housing problem can be solved and the congestion in crowded centres relieved by a concerted movement of manufacturers, cooperators, and others to new areas, arrangements being made for securing to the people the increased value which their presence will give to the c Housing. 40 sites, and the areas being carefully planned so as to make adequate provision for the individual and social needs of the people, especially with a view to securing for all time the combined advantages of town and country life." "That the problem of the depopulation in rural districts can be largely solved by the removal of manufacturing industries from crowded centres to garden cities and garden villages created on new areas; by the development of small holdings carried out on a systematic plan and in touch with facilities for co-operation; and generally by bringing manufacture and agriculture into closer contact." "This meeting records its conviction of the necessity of the formation of garden suburbs as a means of securing the healthy development of London and other large towns." 50.

Clause 32 provided for a contribution of one-third by this Council towards the cost of widening Mitcham Road, Streatham High Road, Sunnyhill Road, and York Road, Wandsworth. 54. This Council having objected to the proposal to construct a tramway from the existing terminus opposite the Tate Public Library along Streatham High Road to the County Boundary 44 by means of a single up line in the part of Streatham High Road between Stanthorpe and Gleneldon Roads and a single down line along Gleneldon, Bournevale and Stanthorpe Roads, the provisions with regard thereto and for the widenings in connection therewith were withdrawn from the Bill. 55. This Council decided to consent to the proposed tramways along Mitcham Road, Tooting, and from Queen's Road to Clapham Common, South Side, subject to an agreement being entered into with regard to the paving of Mitcham Road with wood and artificial stone and the paving with wood of the portion of North Side in which the proposed tramway would be laid, and the construction of a surface water sewer along Long Road, and the compensation to be paid to this Council in the event of the sanitary convenience at Cedars Road being interfered with, and to the County Council undertaking to electrify the existing tramway from Cedars Road to East Hill as soon as possible. 56. With regard to the proposed widening of York Road the County Council in April, 1905, stated that in connection with the reconstruction for an underground conduit system of electrical traction of the tramways along that road it was proposed to diminish the number of lengths of single lines along the route; that the estimated nett cost of acquiring the necessary property in Wandsworth was £12,000, and of executing the necessary paving works, excluding the cost of laying down and paving the tramway track, £2,570, and enquired whether in the event of the suggested improvement being proceeded with this Council would be prepared to consent to the doubling of lengths of the tramway between Edgel Street and Wandsworth railway station, and would agree to the setting back of the kerb and the reconstruction as a double line of the tramway in York Road at its junction with Jew's Row at a less distance than 9 feet 6 inches from the kerb; to contribute one-third (about £4,857 of the nett cost of the necessary street widenings, and to the narrowing of the footpaths. The County Council were informed in reply that this. Council was of opinion that the thoroughfares where the tramways would be reconstructed should be widened to not less than 54 feet where such width could be obtained without interfering with buildings, and that a double line of tramways should be laid where possible. In July, the County Council forwarded route 45 plan and drawings shewing the system of traction to be adopted and statement of the materials to be used for the work. From the plans and descriptions it appeared that the system was practically the same as that adopted for the Westminster to Tooting tramways, but sufficient information was not given as to the positions and dimensions of the feeder pillars and the positions of the levers for working the points. It was proposed to reconstruct the existing tramway as double lines except between Morie Street and Edgel Street and between Ferrier Street and Alma Road, where it was intended to arrange single line portions as interlaced lines. This Council did not object to the proposed system of traction upon condition:— (a) That the feeder pillars and point levers be placed in such positions as the Borough Council may approve so that they may not obstruct the traffic, that the levers be arranged so that the handles work parallel with, and not at right angles to, the kerb, and that before fixing the pillars and levers the County Council furnish the Borough Council with detailed drawings and obtain its approval thereof. (b) That drain rails be provided to the tramway track where required by the Borough Council. (c). That the whole of the carriageways outside the tramway rails be paved with creosoted wood blocks and of the footpaths with artificial stone at the cost of the County Council. (d) That the County Council maintain at its own cost the whole width of the carriageway in all cases where this is now done by that Council as successor to the South London Tramways Company. (e) That the widths of the footpaths be not reduced except in such cases as the Borough Council approve. (f) That in all cases a double line of tramways be constructed throughout. 57. The County Council undertook to consult this Council and as far as possible conform with its wishes with regard to the position of point levers and feeder pillars, to arrange for rail drains to be provided where necessary, and stated that it was arranged in certain cases for a double line of tramways to be substituted for the existing single lines, and that the other suggestions of the Council were under consideration. 58. The Mayor, Alderman Lorden, Councillors Parker and Buchanan subsequently had an interview with the representatives of the County Council, and upon consideration of the report 46 of these Members the Council, being convinced that the whole of the property required for the widening suggested by the Borough Council, viz.:—to 54 feet where it could be done without interfering with buildings, could be acquired for a sum not exceeding the sum proposed to be expended by the County Council, viz.:—£12,000, decided to undertake the acquisition thereof for the sum named upon the County Council agreeing to contribute two-thirds of the cost. This Council also agreed to the space between the rails and the kerb being less than the statutory width where necessary to allow of a double line, and to maintain so much of the roadway as is between the kerb and the tramway margins upon the County Council paving such portion of the roadway with wood and the footpaths with artificial stone and granite kerb. 59. Subsequently an agreement was entered into providing that the Borough Council should acquire the whole of the property required for the widening of the part of York Road in question, the County Council to pay two-thirds of the cost thereof, not exceeding £8,000; the County Council to reconstruct so much of the tramway as consists of single lines as double lines with the exception of the portion between Ferrier Street and Wandsworth railway station, which is to be reconstructed as an interlaced line, the Borough Council consenting to the space between the outer rails of the double line of tramway between the western end of the railway bridge and Bridgend Road and the kerb being less than the statutory width of 9 feet 6 inches, and to the narrowing of the footpaths along certain portions of the thoroughfare; the County Council to carry out certain paving works at an estimated cost of £5,400, the Borough Council contributing onethird, not exceeding £1,800, in respect of such works; the County Council to carry out other paving works at an estimated cost of £3,350, the Borough Council contributing one-fourth the cost thereof, not exceeding the sum of £838; the Borough Council to relieve the County Council of its obligation to maintain the whole of the carriageway affected by the work except the tramway tracks and a margin of 18 inches on each side of the outer rails; the whole of the carriageway except the part between the tramway rails, which is to be paved with Aberdeen granite setts, to be paved with wood and the whole of the footpaths with artificial stone. 47 60. As there were provisions in the Bill to the effect that the system of electrical traction should be such as should be approved by the road authority and the Board of Trade, and that where the consent or approval of the road authority was required for the exercise of any powers by the County Council such consent or approval should not be unreasonably withheld, the difference in case of dispute to be referred to arbitration, this Council presented a petition to the House of Lords against the Bill and the County Council subsequently undertook to withdraw these provisions and to insert a clause to the same effect as section 23 of the Electrical Power Act, 1900, which provides that overhead traction can only be used for the tramways within the provisions of that Act with the consent of the road authority. The petition was thereupon withdrawn and the Bill as amended received the Royal assent on the 4th August, 1906. London County Council (General Powers). 61. This Bill would authorise the County Council to establish and maintain, or to contribute towards the cost of or otherwise aid in establishing and maintaining an ambulance service for dealing with cases of accident, or sickness in streets or public places in London, and for that purpose to hold and use lands or buildings for the time being vested in the Council, to take on lease or acquire lands or buildings within the County, to erect, maintain, repair, and manage on lands so appropriated or acquired any buildings suitable for the purpose, and to adapt, furnish, and equip such buildings, and to provide for the establishment and maintenance of telegraphic, telephonic, or other suitable means of communication between such buildings and other parts of the County. Power was also sought to enable the Council to provide ambulances and other vehicles to be drawn by hand, animal, electrical, or other mechanical power, and to employ and pay such officers and servants as the Council might think expedient for the efficient co.nduct of the service. 62. The Bill would also authorise the Councils of Metropolitan Boroughs who are authorised to supply and are supplying electrical energy to expend money upon wiring, fitting, and supplying with wires, fittings, and apparatus the premises of their customers or prospective customers, to enter into agreements with respect thereto and to make such charges therefor directly ♦ 48 or otherwise as they may think fit, provided that nothing in the Bill shall be deemed to authorise Metropolitan Borough Councils. to manufacture fittings or apparatus. The Bill also provided that every such Council should so adjust the charges to be made by them as to meet the expenditure for this purpose (including interest upon moneys borrowed and payments to sinking fund in respect thereof), and that every sum charged by any Borough Council to a consumer in respect of the wiring and fitting of premises should be clearly stated on every demand note for electrical energy supplied to the consumer distinct from the charge for such energy, and that the total sums received and expended should be separately shown in the published accounts of the Electric Lighting Undertaking of the Borough Council. 63. The Bill also provided that in any case where a registered medical practitioner renders professional services on being summoned pursuant to the requirement of any rule for the time being in force made by the Central Midwives Board established under "The Midwives Act, 1902," and where the County Council has reason to believe that the patient or person liable to maintain her is unable to pay the whole or any part of the fee of a medical practitioner the County Council may pay the whole or part of such fee, provided that if it shall appear to the Council that the circumstances of the patient or of the person liable to maintain her are such that such patient or person can or could have paid the whole or any part of the amount paid by the Council, the Council may recover such amount in a summary manner, and that payment by the County Council of a fee or part of a fee shall not subject the patient on whose behalf such payment was made, or the person liable by law to maintain her, to any electoral or other like disability. 64. With regard to the proposed ambulance service this Council in June, 1904, presented a petition to the London County Council for the insertion of a clause in the County Council's (General Powers) Bill giving Metropolitan Borough Councils power to provide ambulances, and in January last the Council urged upon the County Council the necessity of providing horse-drawn ambulances at all its fire stations in this Borough for use in case of accidents by fire and other accidents and illnesses needing speedy hospital treatment, payment for the use of same to be left to the discretion of the County Council. 49 65. The Council approved of the provisions of the Bill, which passed the House of Commons. The Clauses relating to the payment of fees to medical practitioners were withdrawn from the Bill, and those as to the proposed ambulance service were struck out by the Committee of the House of Lords. The Bill as amended received the Royal assent on the 4th August, 1906. London CountyBuildings. 66. This Bill authorised the County Council, for the purpose of erecting a hall, offices, and buildings for the conduct of the business of that Council, to purchase lands in the Borough of Lambeth, bounded on the north by lands belonging to the Council and used as a Works Department, on the east by Belvedere Road, on the south by Westminster Bridge Road and Westminster Bridge, and the approaches thereto, and on the west by the river Thames (including a portion of the bank, foreshore and bed of that river). The Bill also proposed to authorise the Council to make and maintain an embankment wall and an embankment on the foreshore of the River Thames, limited the period for the compulsory purchase of lands to three years, and the period for the completion of the works to seven years, and authorised the County Council to expend on capital account for the purposes of the Act not exceeding six hundred and fifty-five thousand pounds. 67. This Council made no order with regard to the Bill, which has passed both Houses and received the Royal assent on the 20th July, 1906. London Squares and Enclosures (Preservation). 68. This Bill is to the same effect as the Bill under the same title referred to in the last Annual Report. The number of enclosures included in the schedule to the present Bill is, however, considerably less than in last year's Bill, viz.:—72 instead of 542. The schedule includes the following enclosures in this Borough, viz.:— West Hill Road, Wandsworth — Triangular garden enclosure bounded on the north partly by the roadway of part of West Hill Road and partly by the roadway of part of Wimbledon Park Road, on the south-east by the roadway of other part of Wimbledon Park Road, and on the south-west by other part of the roadway of West Hill Road. West Hill Road, Wandsworth—Triangular enclosed space bounded on the north-west by a portion of Avenue Road, on the north-east by the roadway of West Hill Road, and on the south by the roadway of Viewfield" Road. 5° Melrose Road (Triangle), Wandsworth—Garden enclosure bounded on the east and west by the roadways of Viewfield Road at the junction of that road with Melrose Road and on the south by Melrose Road. 69. This Council approved of the Bill which received the Royal assent on the 4th August, 1906. London County Council Electric Supply and other Electric Supply Bills. 70. I he Council considered the provisions of 12 Bills dealing with the subject of the supply of electricity in the County of London and surrounding districts, the principal one being introduced by the London County Council. The main general object of this Bill was to enable the London County Council to supply electricity in bulk to authorised distributors or local authorities or Companies authorised by Parliament within the Administrative County of London and certain adjoining Boroughs in the Counties of Essex, Kent, Surrey and Middlesex. 71. The Bill also proposed to confer on the Council powers to supply electrical energy direct to railways, docks, tramways and various other undertakings and also to transform, distribute and use electrical energy in various buildings, works or undertakings belonging to or maintained by them, or under their control; but this power was not to apply to schools and various other buildings, parks, open spaces, pleasure grounds or workmen's dwellings without the consent of the authorised distributor. 72. This Council decided to take no action with regard to either of the Bills, but communicated with the County Council with the view of the insertion of provisions safe-guarding the interests of the Borough. 73. The County Council's Bill was referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, who decided that the preamble of the Bill was not proved, and in a special report pointed out that the supply of electrical energy in the County of London and adjoining districts was in the hands of various local authorities and companies, that up to the present time the capital expended by local authorities was about 6½ millions and by Companies about 12 millions and that capital expenditure was proceeding at the rate of one million a year, and stated that they were of opinion that the best means of providing for the supply 51 of electrical energy in bulk and for power and motive purposes, was by one large and inclusive scheme extending not only to the entire County of London but also to adjoining Boroughs and Districts; that for the purpose of carrying out such a scheme some Central Authority was required with statutory powers and corresponding duties, and that the Committee were of opinion that the London County Council should be the Authority. The Committee also pointed out that the County Council as the authority might exercise its powers by undertaking the whole work, providing every authorised distributor and private consumer with electricity in bulk at a maximum scale of charges; or, might retain for itself one part of the undertaking permitting private enterprise to undertake another part; or might lease for a substantial consideration the whole enterprise to a private enterprise, to resume possession of it when its initial stages were over. The Committee also reported that the scheme put forward by the Administrative County of London and District Electric Power Company appeared to be conceived on scientific lines, and calculated to afford a cheap supply of electrical energy at private risk though it was not clear to what extent the paramount authority of the County Council and the ultimate possession of the enterprise by that Council could be secured under that scheme; that evidence was given regarding the generation of electrical energy at the coalfields and the transmission of it to London at a very high voltage by overhead cables along the public roads; but the Committee were not able to regard this as a suitable scheme; and that with regard to all the Bills on the subject introduced into Parliament during the present Session the Committee were of opinion that pending the introduction of a satisfactory Bill next session by the London County Council, or in default of that Council by some competent body of promoters, it was not advisable that any further progress should be made with such Bills. Wandsworth & Putney Gas, and Gas Companies (Removal ot Sulphur Restrictions). 74. The first mentioned Bill was promoted by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company, and the second Bill by the Wandsworth and 20 other Gas Companies with the view so far as affects the Wandsworth Company of repealing section 38 sub-sections (d), (e), and (/) of the Company's Act of 1900, which were inserted at the instance of the District Board. 52 The sub-sections referred to are as follows, viz.:— (d) The gas supplied by the Company shall not contain more than twenty grains of sulphur in any form in one hundred feet of gas. (e) No forfeiture shall be incurred in any case with respect to which it is proved before the justices that the excess of impurity was occasioned by unavoidable cause or accident and unless that excess shall amount to two grains upon the average of six consecutive week days or ten grains upon any one day. (f) In the event of the gas examiner finding any such impurity in the gas he shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company at their office. 75. The Company's Act of 1900 also provided that in substitution of the prescribed testing places (viz., at the works of the Company) the Council shall provide and maintain two sufficient buildings or set apart a portion of some place at Wandsworth and some other place at Putney as may be agreed upon between the District Board and the Company for testing places, and that the Company shall erect and thereafter maintain in such buildings or places testing apparatus for testing the purity and illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Gas Works (Clauses) Act, 1871, as varied by the Act of 1900. The Gas Works (Clauses) Act of 1871 does not provide for testing for sulphur impurities other than sulphuretted hydrogen, whilst the provisions of sub-sections (d), (e), and (/) of section 38 of the Act of 1900, which it is now proposed to repeal, deal with sulphur impurities in any form. 76. The Metropolitan Gas Committee appointed by the Board of Trade in 1904 to inquire and report as to the statutory requirements relating to the illuminating power and purity of gas supplied by the Metropolitan Gas Companies, and as to the methods adopted for testing the same, and as to whether any alteration was desirable in such requirements or methods, and, if so, whether any consequential alteration should be made in the standard price of gas, reported to the effect that only a small percentage of the gas undertakings in the United Kingdom were required to take sulphur products other than sulphuretted hydrogen out of the gas they supplied, that it did not appear that any complaints were made by the inhabitants of other districts on the ground that the gas thus unpurified caused injury to health or 53 was more destructive to articles such as leather, &c., than it is supposed to be in London, and that in the face of this fact the Committee were of opinion that those who contended for the maintenance of the clauses relating to sulphur compounds other than sulphuretted hydrogen had not sufficiently shown that their abolition in the case of the London Companies would be detrimental to the public, and that on the other hand all the witnesses on behalf of the Companies had spoken with much emphasis of the anxiety caused to the management on account of the uncertain action of lime purifiers and the knowledge that the slightest excess of impurity would render them liable to the odium of Police Court proceedings, and had laid much stress upon the nuisance to the neighbourhood which they contended was inevitable when purification was done by means of lime, and that there was no doubt that the nuisance which was occasioned by the use of lime for extracting sulphur products was very serious not only by reason of the annoyance caused to the neighbourhood but also by the deleterious effect on the workmen employed in connection with the process. 77. Following upon this report three Bills were introduced into Parliament last session, one by the Gas Light and Coke, South Metropolitan and Commercial Gas Companies, one by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, and the other by the London County Council. The two first-mentioned Bills went further than the recommendations of the Gas Committee and were rejected by the Committee of the House of Commons. The County Council's Bill was modified and became law as the London Gas Act, 1905. Section 5 of the Act provides for the gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke, the Commercial, and the South Metropolitan Gas Companies being tested for the purpose of ascertaining the calorific power, the purity as regards sulphur other than sulphuretted hydrogen, and the illuminating power as ascertained by means of the flat flame burner, but that the Companies shall not be liable to forfeiture in respect of the testings. Upon the passing of the London Gas Act the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company called the attention of the Council to the matter and expressed the opinion that the legislation with respect to the sulphur impurities which the Company accepted in 1900 was unnec essary, uncalled for, and inexpedient, and they asked how far the Council could follow the course taken by the London County Council and dispense with the penalising for the small extra 54 tion of sulphur that would remain in the gas by the disuse of lime purification pending the Company obtaining the authority of Parliament to secure the same relief as had been given to the other Gas Companies. On the 25th October last the Council decided that until further order proceedings should not be taken in respect of any forfeiture to which the Company may become liable by reason of the presence in the gas supplied by them of sulphur impurities other than sulphuretted hydrogen. 78. Neither of the present Bills provided for testings of the nature prescribed by section 5 of the London Gas Act and the Council petitioned against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of provisions similar to those in that section. The Company agreed to insert the provisions asked for, and gave an undertaking to permit the Council's Gas Examiner to make testings one hour earlier than the hours prescribed in Section 29 of the Gas Works' Clauses Act, 1871, and also to give the Council six hours' notice before any of the Company's officers or servants go to the testing place for the purpose of clearing the pipes connected with the apparatus or renewing the pipes or apparatus, and the Council's petition was thereupon withdrawn. 79. The Wandsworth and Putney Gas (Removal of Sulphur Restrictions) Bill was afterwards dropped, and the provisions asked for by this Council have been inserted in the Gas Companies (Removal of Sulphur Restrictions) Bill, which passed and received the Royal assent on the 20th July, 1906. 80. A report by the Council's gas examiner as to the result of his testings of the gas supplied by the Wandsworth and Putney and Mitcham Gas Companies is printed in Appendix B. Unemployed "Workmen. 81. This Bill, which was introduced by the President of the Local Government Board, proposed to establish— (1) a local body for every municipal borough in London consisting of Members of Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians, and (2) a Central Body for the whole of the County consisting of members of the local bodies and of the County Council, together in each case with a number of co-opted Members to the number of not more than one-fourth of the total number of each body. 82. The Bill provided that the Local Body should make itself acquainted with the conditions of labour within their area and 55 inquire into and discriminate between any applications made tothem from persons unemployed; and that if the local body were satisfied that any such applicant was honestly desirous of obtaining work but was temporarily unable to do so from exceptional causes and considered that his case was capable of more suitable treatment under the Bill than under the Poor Law, they might endeavour to obtain work for the applicant or if they thought the case was one for treatment by the Central Body rather than the local body refer the case to the Central Body, but that the local body should have no power to provide work for any unemployed person; that the Local Government Board might make orders and regulations for the constitution and proceedings of the Central and Local Bodies, including regulations of the condition under which work might be provided by the Central Body, the establishment of farm colonies, the acceptance, regulation, and administration of money or property, the enforcement of payment of contributions by Borough Councils, the borrowing of money and the general regulation of the manner in which any duties are to be performed under the Bill. The duties of the Central Body were to include superintending and as far as possible co-ordinating the action of the local bodies and aiding the efforts of those bodies by establishing, taking over, or assisting labour exchanges and employment registers, and the collecting of information and enquiring into cases referred to them by the local bodies. The Central Body might if it thought fit assist unemployed persons by aiding their emigration, or removal to another area, or by the provision of temporary work or otherwise in such a manner as they think best calculated to put them in a position to obtain regular work or other means of supporting themselves. Any expenses of the Central Body and of the local bodies if incurred with the consent of the Central Body were to be defrayed out of the central fund under the management of the Central Body, which fund was to be supplied by voluntary contributions and by contributions made by each Borough Council in proportion to rateable value. A separate account was to be kept of all sums supplied by contributions from Borough Councils and no expenses of providing temporary work except at a farm colony was to be paid out of that account. Contributions by Borough Councils were not in any year to exceed the sum equal to a rate of ½d. in the £ or such higher rate of not exceeding 1d. in the £ as the. Local Government Board might approve. The Bill was to be compulsory for London, but outside London a similar organisation was to be established by D 56 order of the Local Government Board who might postpone the making of an order upon the application of a county Borough Council until that Council was of opinion that the circumstances rendered it desirable. 83. The Bill was considered by the Joint Committee for this Borough appointed under Mr. Long's scheme, referred to in the last annual report, who passed the following resolutions thereon:— "(a) That the Committee does not approve of creating new authorities dealing with employment relief with monies raised by rates." "(b) That the Bill if applied to London only would result in attracting a large number of workmen to the Metropolis in the false hope of obtaining employment." "(c) That voluntary contributions and rates never co-exist for any length of time together and that the effect of the Bill would inevitably tend to dry up the former." 84. These resolutions were adopted by this Council and a petition for an alteration of the Bill so as to make it uniform throughout the country presented to Parliament. 85. This Council also appointed The Mayor (Alderman Anderson) and Councillor Glegg its representatives to attend a Conference convened by the London County Council of representatives of that Council, the City Corporation, the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and Boards of Guardians at which the following resotutions were passed, viz.:— "(1) That this Conference is of opinion that, whilst legislation on the subject of the unemployed is urgently needed and should place the cost on national and not on local funds, it is desirable that the Unemployed Workmen Bill, 1905. should be substantially amended." "(2) That this Conference is of opinion that the Unemployed Workmen Bill, 1905, should be made compulsory throughout the country as well as in London." "(3) That this Conference objects to the provisions of the Unemployed Workmen Bill, 1905, in so far as they create 30 additional authorities in London, thus adding to the existing complications of local administration in the Metropolis, and in so far also as they confer a power of rating, although limited, upon an indirectly elected authority." (Carried Ay 34 against 25.) "(4) That the words 'Farm Colonies' be omitted from the Bill and that the words 'labour colonies' be substituted therefor and other consequential alterations made in the Bill." (Carried by 20 against 3.) 57 86. The Bill with some amendments was passed and received the Royal assent on the 10th July, 1905, and is to continue in force for three years from that day unless Parliament otherwise determine. 87. An order has since been made by the Local Government Board providing for the constitution of local bodies termed Distress Committees and of the Central Body under the name of the "Central (Unemployed) Body for London." The Distress Committee for this Borough is to consist of 12 Members of the Council, 8 Members of and selected by the Board of Guardians and 5 persons not Members of the Council but experienced in the relief of distress. A list of the Members of the Distress Committee is given on page 15. The Central Body is to consist of: 4 Members of the London County Council, 4 Members selected in each case from their own Body by the Distress Committee of the Common Council and Westminster City Council, respectively, 2 Members selected in each case from their own Body by the Distress Committee of every Borough Council, such number of persons not exceeding 8 as may be nominated by the Local Government Board and 8 persons co-opted by the other Members of the Central Body. 88. Orders have also been made by the Local Government Board as to the conditions under which applications may be entertained by Distress Committees, the conditions under which the Central Body may aid the emigration or removal of unemployed and their dependants, the conditions under which the Central Body may provide or contribute towards the provision of work, records and registers to be kept, the establishment of farm colonies, the acquisition of land, officers and offices, contributions, donations, and labour exchanges. 89. With the view of finding work for the unemployed, this Council decided to carry out during the winter certain channelling and other works, in respect of which the chief item of expense was labour, at an estimated cost of £1,000. The Council also with the same object renewed its offer to contribute the sum of ,£2,000 towards the cost of constructing an open-air swimmng bath on Tooting Common. Eventually an agreement was entered into between this Council, the Central Unemployed Body for London, and the London County Council, under which the bathing lake was to be formed by this Council at an estimated cost of 58 £7,000, the wages, £4,000, to be defrayed by the Central Body,, this Council to pay for the materials, estimated at £3,000, ana the lake when completed to be maintained by the County Council. The work was carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor for the Eastern District at a total cost of £7,717 8s. 7d., towards which the Central Body contributed the sum of £4,300, and the lake was opened on the 28th July, 1906, it being handed over by the Mayor to the Chairman of the London County Council. 90. The following is a statement of the work of the Distress Committee to the closing of the Register on the 31st March, 1956, viz.:— Number of applications received 1,048 Skilled workmen, viz.

Number of men from this Borough now employed;—(13th June). Hollesley Bay 14 Garden City 5 Fambridge 4 Tooting Pond 22 45 Polling Arrangements (Parliamentary Boroughs). 92. This Bill proposed to transfer from the Justices to the County Council the power to divide Parliamentary Boroughs into Polling districts. The County Council has already the power with regard to polling districts for County Council elections, and this Council being of opinion that the division into polling districts of Parliamentary Boroughs and County Council areas should be in the hands of one authority, petitioned in favour of the Bill, which having passed the House of Lords was dropped after first reading in the Commons. Polling Districts (County Councils). 93. This Bill would authorise the County Council to exercise their powers for dividing electoral divisions into polling districts from time to time and as often as they think fit and also to alter polling districts. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which like other Bills 6o to the same effect introduced during the last few years passed the House of Lords and was not further proceeded with. Sale of Whisky. 94. This Bill proposed to amend the law relating to the sale of whisky and the marking of casks and other vessels containing whisky. The Council petitioned in favour of it. The Bill is awaiting second reading in the House of Commons. Public Libraries. 95. The object of this Bill was to repeal any limitation in any Act of Parliament of the expenses or rate to be levied by a Library Authority. The Council petitioned against the measure, which did not reach second reading. Summary Jurisdiction (Children). 96. This Bill proposed to authorise Courts of Summary Jurisdiction to order that no person shall without leave of the Court during the hearing of a charge or application relating to a child remain in or have access to any room or place in which it is being heard except the parties to the case, the counsel, or solicitor engaged, and the witnesses or parents, or guardian of the child. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill which was, however, not proceeded with. A Bill on the same subject was introduced during the present session and was also dropped. Metropolitan Borough Councils Association. 97. The object of this Bill was to enable Metropolitan Borough Councils to pay subscriptions to the funds of any Association of Local Authorities or of local authorities and other bodies and persons formed for the purpose of consultation and discussion on matters of common interest to such authorities, or relating to local Government, and also to pay the reasonable expenses of the attendance of representatives of the Council at meetings of any such association and any conference of Local Authorities convened for similar purposes, provided that no annual or single expenditure should exceed the sum of 30 guineas. This Council petitioned in favour of an amendment of the Bill so as to provide that the total annual expenditure for the purpose referred to in the Bill should not exceed 30 guineas. The Bill was not proceeded with. Justices of the 98. This Bill provided for the nomination of the Justices of the Peace by Town Councils having a separate commission of peace and by County Councils, and proposed to enable Chairmen of District Councils to submit 61 of suitable persons to the County or Town Council. This Council presented a petition for an amendment of the Bill so as to give Mayors of Metropolitan Borough Councils the powers with regard to the nomination of Justices proposed by the Bill to be given to the Chairmen of District and Town Councils. The Bill was not proceeded with. Intoxicating Liquors (Hours of Closing). Sale of Butter. 99. This Bill proposed to authorise Licensing Justices to impose such conditions with regard to the hours during which licensed premises may be open for the sale ot intoxicating liquors as they might deem expedient, provided that a condition shall not be imposed that the premises shall be closed before 8 p.m. on Saturdays and before 9 o'clock on any other day than Saturday or Sunday. The Council presented a petition in favour of the Bill which, however, was not proceeded with. 100. This was a Bill to restrict the amount of water in Butter. The Council presented a petition in favour. The Bill was, however, withdrawn. Representation of tne People, and Parliamentary Voters (Registration). 101. These two Bills which proposed to alter the law relating to the qualification and registration of voters for Members of Parliament were considered by the Council who decided to take no action with regard tnereto at present. Both Bills have been dropped. 102. No action was taken with regard to the other Bills above mentioned. Local A uthorities (Taxation and Purchase of Land). 103. In continuation of the report with reference to this Bill on pages 58 and 59 of the last Annual Report the Council considered a report by Councillor Welton, one of this Council's representatives at the Conference convened by the Hackney Borough Council, and adopted the following report of the General Purposes Committee on the subject, viz.:— (a) Beneficial expenditure such as that on lighting, watering, and cleansing highways, removal of dust, sewers, and other sanitary works. This expenditure ought to be borne by those who benefit thereby, exactly in the same way as if they had voluntarily co-operated in the matter. It is generally accepted that, although rough and imperfect, the 62 present system of assessment for local rates furnishes a reasonably fair method of raising funds for these purposes. (b) Municipal undertakings, such as tramways, lighting, waterworks, &c. These undertakings represent a form of co-operation for the supposed benefit of the ratepayers, and any loss thereon should be borne in the same manner, as the ratepayers must be considered responsible for the mistakes (if any) of their agents. (c) Onerous expenditure, such as that on the poor, the police, lunatic asylums and other unproductive objects. This class of expenses, it is admitted, ought to be borne by the whole community, according to their means, and originally the system of assessment did correspond generally with this principle. The growth in modern times of personal property which is now reasonably calculated to amount in this country to a capital value threefold that of real property, has rendered it necessary that some change should be made in the system of levying funds for this class of expenditure. The object has been but imperfectly attained so far by the allocation of certain parts of the Imperial revenues to local uses. It has been proposed that the house-tax and possibly other taxes should be' surrendered to local authorities. This, however, would only add to the resources of towns and districts already possessing ample means, and the Council has already affirmed the principle that a large allocation out of the general revenue to meet a large portion of the onerous expenditure can alone lead to a satisfactory result. In this connection it is fair to remember that such trades and professions as require extensive and costly premises are unfairly taxed for onerous expenditure, seeing that the true measure of contribution should be the profit made by the contributor, and not the cost of carrying on his trade or profession. (d) Lastly, there is the expenditure for local improvements, which expenditure eventually adds to the value of real property, and consequently should be borne in a fair measure by owners of such property. The usual mode of raising money for such objects is by loans, repayable by instalments. As the occupier, so long as he remains in occupation, receives the benefit of the improvements, it is obvious that the interest on such loans should be borne by him ; and he might justly pay somewhat more, as the benefit is usually much greater than the amount of such interest. The freeholders at the utmost should not be called upon to pay more than the instalments of capital cost of such improvements; indeed, they should pay less in cases where a long term of years must elapse prior to their receiving any benefit. But whatever contribution the site-owners are to make, the necessity arises that site values should be ascertained and rated unless in the opinion of the community the expense and difficulty of raising a tax in this way would outweigh its advantages. Bearing these considerations in mind, we beg to report that the Bill proposes to ascertain site values by a method to which we do not object, 63 and to authorise local authorities to levy a tax of one penny in the pound on capital values, which the promoters estimate to equal 2s. 1d. in the £ on income derived from site values. On this we have to say that as all owners of property are already liable to pay the Imperial income-tax, now amounting to one shilling in the pound, and if resident in England have to pay all local and other taxation falling on citizens of Britain, this proposal to subject them in effect to triple income-tax does not commend itself to us. We think any special burden they are called upon to bear should be commensurate with the special benefit they receive, neither more nor less. The Bill likewise proposes to override existing contracts between landlord and tenant, a course which even Dr. Macnamara, who represented the promoters at the Hackney Conference, did not see his way to defend. The Bill further proposes to authorise very large purchases of land by County authorities, merely for the purpose of management and reletting, though it is contended that incidentally these powers would facilitate the acquisition of open spaces, &c. We regard this part of the measure with grave apprehension, and we observe that it is promoted by the Land Nationalisation Society, the object of which Society is explained to be to eventually acquire for the public the whole surface of the United Kingdom. For the reasons hereinbefore appearing we disapprove of the provisions of the Bill. 104. A Bill on the same subject was introduced this session and dropped after first reading. Education Act. 105. A Conference of the Education Committee and the Council's representatives on the Bodies of Managers of Provided Schools on the subject of the powers and duties of managers, was held at the Council House, Wandsworth, on the 24th October, when there were present:— Members of the Education Committee :— Councillor Gridley (Chairman of the Conference); The Mayor; Aldermen Dunkley and Rucker; Councillors Aldridge, Allen, Ball, Bulstrode, Craig, Cresswell, Eland, Glegg, Hennell, Lance, Luscombe, Mathias, Pannett, Robinson and Somerford.

Brandlehow and Deodar Roads and Proposed New School, Putney, Schools.—Councillors Radford and Walker, Dr. T. A. I. Howell, Mrs. Gridley and Mrs. Harvey. 106. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference, viz.:— (a) That Chairmen of Managers be elected for one year and that they be eligible for re-election. (b) That this Conference is of opinion that a "B" Committee should be appointed for each group of schools. (c) That this Conference requests the Borough Council to invite the Justices acting for Divisions within the Borough of Wandsworth, to exercise their jurisdiction on all proceedings under the Elementary Education Act for default in attendance at School, and for illegal employment of children.. 65 (d) That this Conference requests the Borough Council to ask the Home Secretary to take action to secure the passing into law of the Justices Jurisdiction (London) Bill, introduced into Parliament in the Session of 1901. (e) That this Conference is of opinion that it is desirable that there should be uniformity and greater detail in the Agenda of Managers' Meetings. (/) That in the opinion of this Conference the policy of making the County Council Schools Mixed Departments should be discontinued and separate departments established for boys and girls and that the County Council be so informed. (g) That the present system with regard to the provision of medical certificates of unfitness to attend school presses unduly upon the very poor and is grossly unfair to the medical profession. (h) That the Conference suggest that collection of dust from school premises be made before 9 a.m. or after 4.30 p.m. and that the collection be made at more frequent intervals than at present—daily if possible. (t) That this Conference recommends that the London County Council be asked to issue, as early as possible, a code of instructions precisely defining the duties, powers and responsibilities of the Managers of all Elementary Schools under the control of the Education Committee of that Council. 107. The Council concurred in the foregoing resolutions and sent a copy thereof to the London County Council and to each of the other Borough Councils. 108. The County Council stated that consideration had been given to the subjects of resolutions (a), (b), (e-g) and (»), and that the Council was awaiting the decisions of the Justices, the Home Secretary, and this Council with regard to (c), (d) and (h). With regard to resolution (c) the Justices for the Newington and Wandsworth divisions stated that they were of opinion that the matter should be dealt with uniformly throughout the Metropolis and that a Bill should be introduced into Parliament to deal with the question. A copy of resolutions (c) and (d) has since been forwarded to the Board of Education. 109. The Managers of the St. Mary's, All Saints, Upper Grade Boys', and Upper Grade Girls' Non-Provided Schools, Putney, having applied to the County Council for such schools to be grouped under a Committee of 12 managers, this Council approved of the proposal. The County Council, however, decided 66 to group the schools in question for a period of three years under a Committee consisting of four Foundation Managers, one Representative Manager appointed by the Borough Council and one by the County Council. no. During the year the Council has appointed several new Managers of Provided Schools to fill vacancies caused by resignations. Site for Schools at Southlields. 111. The County Council gave notice of its intention to provide a public elementary school for about 1,100 children on land adjoining Southfield Council School, and to acquire an additional site in the district for future school requirements. This Council pointed out that when the site of the existing school was acquired it was the intention of the late School Board to retain the land not required for the present building as a recreation ground for the children attending the schools in the neighbourhood, and that the West Hill School had not been completed in accordance with the proposals of the School Board. The Council suggested that the West Hill School should be completed and a school provided on a site to be acquired in the locality of Wimbledon Park Road, and that the land adjoining the Southfield School should be retained as a recreation ground. In reply the Education Committee of the County Council stated that the Board of Education had hitherto declined to sanction the completion of the West Hill School; that there would be need for at least 2,000 additional school places, and that under all the circumstances they were not prepared to recommend the County Council to depart from its decision to erect a school on the land adjoining the Southfield School and to secure an additional site in the neighbourhood. The views of this Council were then communicated to the Board of Education and they were asked to receive a deputation from this Council on the subject. The Board of Education, however, gave their formal consent to the proposal of the County Council and stated that having carefully reviewed the correspondence between the Borough Council, the County Council, and the Board on the subject they were not prepared to re-open the question of building a school on the Southfields site, and were unable to see that any useful purpose would be served by receiving the proposed deputation. The subject is still under the consideration of the Council. 112. The Council has had under consideration the subject of the delay in dealing with matters arising out of the 67 tion of the Education Acts, and passed the following resolution, viz.:— That in the opinion of this Council the number of Members of the London County Council should be increased in order to meet the demands of the education work now placed in the hands of that Council. 113. A copy of the resolution was forwarded to the Local Government Board, the Board of Education, the London County Council, the Councils of the Cities of London and Westminster, the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and the local Members of Parliament, and of the County Council, and they were asked to support this Council's views on the subject. Quinquennial Valuation. 114. In accordance with the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the new Valuation List was duly made and deposited on the 31st May, 1906. 115. The following is an extract from the report of the Rating Committee on the final approval of the Valuation List by the Assessment Committee, which shows the very large increase in the Borough during the past five years:— 1 (a) We beg to report that the Assessment Committee have finally approved the new Valuation List, which will, subject to appeals to Quarter Sessions, come into operation on the 6th April, 1906. The total rateable value shewn by the list is £1,935,161. (6) The Quinquennial valuation being now completed, we beg to submit the following particulars, viz.:— No. of rateable hereditaments included in the Valuation List 55,691 No. of hereditaments included in the List at increased values 16,608 No. of objections lodged 4,637 No. of Assessments reduced by Assessment Committee 2,093 No. of Assessments increased by Assessment Committee 60 (c) The number of rateable hereditaments at the quinquennial valuation 1900 was 41,407 and the rateable value £1,538,479; an increase in five years of 14,284 rateable hereditaments and £396,682 rateable value. (d) The rateable value in May last, when the Valuation List was made, was £1,859,220 and the result of the revision is therefore an increase of £75,941 rateable value. Main Roads. 116. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888, the London County Council was responsible for the maintenance of certain of the main roads in London and arrangements were made for the roads to be kept in 68 order by the local authorities in whose districts they were situated. The London Government Act, 1899, threw the duty of maintaining these thoroughfares upon the respective Metropolitan Borough Councils. Some of the Borough Councils who had been in receipt of contributions being of opinion that they should be continued asked the Local Government Board to determine the amount, if any, which should be paid by the County Council. The Board held an Inquiry with regard to the applications and having carefully considered the matter have come to the conclusion that no contributions should be made. None of the roads in Wandsworth were affected and the decision of the Board is in accordance with views put forward on behalf of this Council at the Inquiry. Openings Roads. 117. The Committee appointed at the Conference convened in by the Metropolitan Paving Commitee on the subject of the inconvenience and damage caused by the breaking open of streets by public Companies and others, asked the Prime Minister and the President of the Local Government Board to receive a Deputation in support of the proposal that the Government should introduce a bill into Parliament embodying model clauses for the better protection of local authorities with the view of such clauses being made applicable to all undertakings involving interference with the public streets. The President of the Local Government Board stated in reply that as the Government could not hold out any hope of legislation on the question during the current session he did not think it necessary to trouble the Deputation to attend at present. The Committee will endeavor to arrange for the proposed Deputation to be received in the autumn in order that the views of the Conference may be impressed upon the Government before the details of any Bill dealing with London traffic are settled. 118. The London County Council has also had the matter under consideration and has suggested that such Council should be empowered to make regulations to govern the breaking up of streets. The County Council is now in communication with the Borough Councils on the subject. Metropolitan Paving Committee. 119. The usual day of meeting of the Metropolitan Paving Committee being inconvenient for Alderman Lorden owing to the Council and Committee meetings on the same day, the Council has appointed Alderman Hewett as it representative on the Committee in his place. 69 Tramway Improvements. 120. Practically the whole of the property required for the widening of thoroughfares for the electrical tramways from Wandsworth to Tooting via York Road, Garratt Lane and Defoe Road, has now been acquired by the London County Council, the Borough Council assisting in several cases by putting in force its compulsory powers under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act. The Borough Council has constantly urged the County Council to proceed with the construction of the tramways and the paving of the carriage way. As stated in last year's report the County Council proposed that the road should be paved with macadam. The Borough Council, however, were of opinion that in view of the importance of the thoroughfare and the presence of a tramway in the road, wood blocks should be used and the cost borne by the two Councils in the same proportion as the cost of the. widening. The County Council declined to concur in the Borough Council's views, but after considerable correspondence the Borough Council induced the County Council to agree to include in the improvement scheme the wood paving of the road between North Street and Earlsfield Railway Station. The Borough Council also arranged for the remainder of the road, viz.:—between Earlsfield Railway Station and Tooting High Street, to be paved with wood, the Borough Council defraying the additional cost consequent upon the adoption of that material. The work has since been carried out in connection with the construction of the tramways. 121. At the instance of the Borough Council, the part of the road between the tramway rails has been paved with wood in front of churches and other public buildings in order to lessen the noise of the traffic. 122. In accordance with the agreement with the London County Council (see page 46 of this report) relative to the reconstruction of the tramways in York Road, Wandsworth, for electrical traction, the Borough Council is taking the necessary steps for the acquisition of property required for widening that thoroughfare. The scheme originally proposed by the County Council was for a much smaller improvement, but after correspondence and a deputation to a Committee of the County Council that Council agreed to the widening now arranged for. The agreement with the County Council was exchanged on the 31st May last, but the Borough Council began 70 negotiations with the owners of property immediately it was intimated that the County Council would probably agree to the larger scheme, and the Borough Council has been and is doing all in its power to expedite the acquisition of the property needed. Electrical Traction on Tramways- 123. The work of constructing the new tramways from York Road, Wandsworth, to Tooting High Street, via Garratt Lane, and of reconstructing the tramways in York Road was begun in the early part of this year. The Borough Council continuously urged the London County Council to press forward the tramway and paving works with the view of the inconvenience to residents and others being put an end to as soon as possible. After numerous delays the new lines were completed in July last, and having been inspected by the Board of Trade on the 31st of that month were opened for traffic at the beginning of August. 124. Arrangements similar to those agreed to in the case of the Tooting and Streatham lines were made for indicating the stopping places for the electric cars by fixing notices thereof to the public lamps. The feeder pillars have been placed in positions satisfactory to the Borough Council. 125. With regard to the proposed London County Council tramways from Queen Street, Hammersmith, via Fulham Palace Road, to a point in Lower Richmond Road near the junction of that road with the approach to Putney Bridge, the Board of Trade have approved the plans showing the rails, paving, sub-structure, and electrical arrangements, but the County Council do not intend to proceed with the work of constructing the new lines until next year. 126. In reply to the Borough Council's request that in the part of Lower Richmond Road in which the tramways will be laid the whole of the carriage way should be paved with wood and the footpaths with artificial stone, the County Council stated that if granite setts were substituted for the existing macadam the additional cost would be about £250 and offered to arrange for the use of granite setts upon the Borough Council agreeing to bear the extra cost. The County Council also mentioned that if the portion of the road outside the tramway track were paved with wood and the footpaths with artificial stone the cost would be practically the same as if materials similar to those now in use 71 were laid down. The Borough Council did not approve of the use of granite setts outside the tramway rails and decided to adhere to its original proposal that the road should be paved with wood. Tramway Feeder Pillars. 127. The Council having appealed to the Board of Trade with regard to certain of the tramway feeder pillars fixed by the London County Council on the footpath in the road leading from Clapham to Tooting, the County Council contended that such Council had full power under the provisions of the Electrical Power Act, 1900, to place the pillars in such positions as the County Council thought fit and that the provisions of the Tramway Act giving the Borough Council the right of appeal did not apply to the works in question. After considerable correspondence the Board of Trade, without coming to a conclusion on the legal question as to arbitration, suggested a Conference between their electrical adviser and representatives of the County Council and the Borough Council. The Conference took place on the ground on the 9th February last, and it was arranged that the County Council should shift the pillar in front of No. 172 High Street, Clapham, to opposite No. 186, replace the pillar opposite the London and County Bank, No. 128 Balham High Road, with one of a smaller size, and remove the pillar opposite Nos. 64 and 66 Upper Tooting Road to the wide footpath on the opposite side of the road. The alterations to the pillars arranged at the Conference have now been satisfactorily carried out. Lower Bichmond Road Wldening- 128. The Borough Council has continued its negotiations for the acquisition of the property required for the improvement of Lower Richmond Road, Putney, between Bigg's Row and Rotherwood Road. The Borough Council proposes to repave the whole width of the road where the widening is to be effected, the footpaths with artificial stone and the carriageway with wood. In reply to the Borough Council's application for a contribution towards the cost the County Council stated that its estimate provided for paving only the land actually added to the public way and with materials similar to those already in use, and offered to contribute one-half the cost, subject to the contribution being limited to £2,267 10s. od. Under the circumstances the Borough Council decided to accept the offer. The difference in the cost of the paving works proposed to be carried out and those estimated for by the County Council will be borne by the Borough Council. E 72 129. As stated in last year's report, the Borough Council agreed to a modification of the approved plan for the widening of the part of Lower Richmond Road near its junction with the approach to Putney Bridge in connection with the construction of a line of electric tramways there, subject to the County Council providing a site for a sanitary convenience at or near the approach to the bridge. The Chief Engineer to the County Council having suggested that the construction of the proposed convenience should be included in the County Council's contract for the alteration of the approach for the tramway works, the convenience to be placed in the arches beneath the approach and access thereto obtained by means of steps outside the parapet wall, the Borough Council adopted the suggestion and decided that a convenience for men should be constructed at the spot in question. The Borough Council settled the accommodation to be provided and is now awaiting the plans which are being prepared by the London County Council as part of the contract drawings for the alterations to the approach. When these plans are ready application will be made to the Local Government Board for sanction to the raising of a loan to defray the cost of the convenience. High Street and Gardener's Lane, Putney, W idening. 130. All the claims in respect of the property required for the widening of the narrow part of High Street, Putney, opposite Putney Bridge Road, and the part of Gardener's Lane (renamed Felsham Road) at its junction with High Street having been settled and the purchases completed the improvement has been effected and new buildings erected on the surplus land. The widening was carried out by the London County Council at the request of the late District Board. The greater part of the cost will be borne by the Borough Council. Widening at corner of Upper Bichmond Boad and Putney Hill. 131. The whole of the property needed for the widening of the public way at the corner of Upper Richmond Road and Putney Hill in connection with the erection of a new bank there has been purchased and the paving works will be carried out on the completion of the new building. In reply to the Borough Council's application for a contribution towards the cost the London County Council offered to contribute one-third but as the Borough Council's estimate of £4,690 provided for the paving of a larger area than that added to the public way the County Council proposed to limit the contribution to £1,441 being one-third of the cost as 73 estimated by the County Council's officers. In view of the importance of the thoroughfares affected the Borough Council is of opinion that a larger proportion of the cost should be defrayed out of the county fund, and is urging the County Council to increase its contribution. 132. Terms have been arranged for the acquisition of the whole of the property needed for the widening of Putney Bridge Road, near Wandsworth Park. The forecourt walls on the eastern side of the road have been set back in nearly all cases and the remainder of the work will be carried out when the purchases are completed. Putney Bridge Road Widening- 133. The Council has approved a plan for the widening of Putney Bridge Road in front of the convent grounds so as to complete the improvement between High Street, Wandsworth, and Oakhill Road. The question of the acquisition of the necessary land is, however, in abeyance. 134. In reply to the Borough Council's applications for contributions towards the cost of the various widenings in Putney Bridge Road the County Council called attention to the fact that the widenings formed only a portion of a considerable scheme of improvement which would be necessary to secure the complete widening of the thoroughfare and asked that an estimate of the cost of widening the road throughout might be prepared. The Borough Council was of opinion that as there was no special urgency for the widening of the remainder of the road it could stand over until circumstances were favourable for the acquisition of the property. The Council were, however, desirous to carry out the widenings so far approved and suggested that the proportion of the cost to be borne by the County Council should be settled at once. The County Council, however, declined to consider the question of contributing until particulars of a complete scheme had been supplied. The question of obtaining this information is now under the consideration of the Council. 135. In reply to this Council's application for a contribution towards the cost of widening High Street, Wandsworth, at Nos. 36-42 and at No. 144, the County Council has promised to contribute two-thirds of the net cost of the improvements, subject to the contribution being High Street Wandsworth, Improvement. 74 limited to £1,120, and to the Borough Council undertaking to give its consent to the construction of a tramway in the part of the road proposed to be widened. The cost £75) of the property at No. 144 High Street was defrayed and the improvement carried out by the late District Board. The total cost of the property at Nos. 36-42 High Street was £3,688. The value of the land to be added to the public way has been taken as £1,688 and of the surplus available for the Town Hall extension at £2,000. The cost of the paving works is estimated at £290, and the total cost of the improvement at Nos. 36-42 at£1,978. 136.

The necessary widening of the other parts of Tooting High Street in connection with the extension of the electric tramways are being carried out by the London County Council. Complaints having been received of the loss of trade caused by the delay in carrying out the scheme, the Borough Council urged the County Council to proceed forthwith with the work of pulling down the shops which had been purchased at the lower end of the road and to arrange for the new buildings to be erected in the widened road with as little delay as possible. In reply the County Council stated that terms had been agreed in respect of all interests in the property needed and that every effort would be made to secure as soon as possible the completion of the widening. 141. The Council has continued the negotiations for the acquisition of property needed for this widening and terms have been settled in a number of cases. All the property affected by the scheme has been included in the Bill promoted by the London County Council for the construction of tramways from Tooting Broadway to Tooting Junction Railway Station, and the Borough Council anticipates that the additional powers obtained under the Act will be of great assistance in dealing with the claims still outstanding. Mitcham Boad Improvement. 142. An arrangement has been made for the widening of the part of Mitcham Road between Charlmont Road and Bickersteth Road to not less than 60 feet and the completion of the widening of Charlmont Road in connection with partial re-building of the Mitre Public House. The estimated cost of the improvement is £1,150. The London County Council has been asked to contribute towards the cost. 143. The widening of Church Lane, Tooting, in connection with the development of the Totterdown Fields estate and the Totterdown estate for building purposes has been completed.

Proposals having been made for the development for building purposes of the Stapleton House estate between Upper Tooting Road and Romberg Road, the Council took the opportunity of securing the widening of the part of Tooting Bec Road upon which the estate abuts. As in all probability the thoroughfare will at some future time form part of the route of a line of tramways to connect the tramways in Upper Tooting Road with those at Streatham, the Council came to the conclusion that it was desirable that the road should be made not less than 54 feet wide and arrangements have accordingly been made for the purchase of sufficient land for this purpose. The scheme includes the paving of the new footpath with artificial stone and the making up of the widened carriage way. The estimated cost of the improvement is £1,900. The London County Council has promised to contribute one-half the cost, but as that Council's estimate provides for paving only the land added to the public way and the use of materials similar to those already laid down the contribution is limited to £700. Tooting Bec Road Widening. 147. The widening of the part of Trinity Road, between Balham High Road and Holy Trinity Church, the widening of Upper Tooting Road in front of the site of the old Wheatsheaf public-house, the woodpaving of the carriageway of the part of Trinity Road within the Balham Ward, and the paving of the footpaths with artificial stone where necessary in connection with the widenings, have been carried out.

The total estimated cost of the alterations to the road was £1,050. The actual cost was £1,171 9s. 1od., towards which the owners of the adjoining property have contributed the sum of £500. As the only expense involved was in respect of paving works the London County Council declined to defray any part of the cost. The carrying out of the improvement provided work for a number of the unemployed. Streatham High Ho ad Widening. 151. The widening of Streatham High Road, in front of the Mortimer and Norfolk House estates, has been completed. The estimated cost of the improvement was ,£9,314. The actual cost has been £6,106 2s. 7d.

In connection with the development for building purposes of Lord Westbury's estate at Howard's Lane, Putney, and the Pirbright Road estate at Southfield, the owners desired to stop up or divert the public footpaths across their estates. The Council consented to the proposals and new roads and footpaths having been provided in place of the old footpaths the necessary orders have been made for the latter to be stopped up or diverted. Closing Footpaths, Putney and Southfield. 78 153. The attention of the Council having been called to thelighting of certain of the principal thoroughfares in the Borough the Lighting Sub-Committee of the Highways Committee have carefully considered the whole question. The Sub-Committee viewed the localities and upon their recommendation the Council adopted a scheme for the improvement of the lighting of the roads referred to. 154. In connection with the widening of roads for the new electric tramways from Wandsworth to Tooting the Council has already approved a scheme for the improvement of the lighting of Garratt Lane, Defoe Road, and Tooting High Street. Similar arrangements will be made with regard to the lighting of Mitcham Road, the part of Tooting High Street between Tooting Broadway and the County Boundary, and York Road. 155. The contract with the Mitcham and Wimbledon District Gas Company for lighting the streets in the part of the Borough supplied with gas by that Company having expired, the Lighting Sub-Committee placed themselves in communication with the Company with regard to the terms upon which they would renew the contract. The Sub-Committee have also had before them proposals for lighting the main road through Tooting with electric lamps. Having carefully considered all the circumstances the Council came to an arrangement with the Company by which the lighting of the streets will be greatly improved without any capital xpenditure by the Council and the annual cost will be less than at present. 156. The Council also adopted the Company's suggestion that the existing lamps (311 in number) fitted with No. 2 Kern burn:rs be provided with No. 3 Kern burners, the alterations to be carried out by the Company free of cost, the Council to reimburse the Company in the event of gas lighting in their district being discarded during the period of the proposed contract. 157. The late District Board and the Council have from time to time allowed private lamps to be erected on the public way subject to certain conditions. In some cases permission was granted many years ago and the hours during which the lamps were required to be lighted varied in different parts of the Borough. The matter was considered by the Private lamps on public way. 79 ways, Sewers and Lighting Committee who were of opinion that the conditions should be the same in all cases but they did not think it necessary for the lamps to be kept alight all night as had been the practice in some instances. Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Council decided to allow the existing lamps to remain subject to their being kept properly painted and repaired to the satisfaction of the Surveyor, to their being kept lighted from sunset till 9 p.m. on each week-day, except Saturday, and on Saturday from sunset to 10 p.m., to their being lighted by the Gas Company's employees, and to their being removed at any time if required by the Council. 158. Owing to the works carried out by the County Council and the Borough Council there has been very much less flooding from the sewers than in former years. The Wandsworth and Battersea relief sewer constructed by the County Council at the instance of the Borough Council has now been completed and the Borough Council trusts that when the new pumping station now in course of erection is finished, the flooding which occurs along the valley of the river Wandle in times of heavy rain storms will cease. Flooding from Sewers. 159. The above-mentioned relief sewer was planned to pass beneath High Street, Wandsworth, between East Hill and South Street, and the London County Council proposed to close the whole width of the carriageway while it was being constructed. The Borough Council pointed out that considerable loss and inconvenience would be caused thereby and upon further consideration, arrangements were made for the line of the sewer to be altered so as to render the stoppage of the road unnecessary. 160. The arrangements made by the Highways Committee for the provision of a recreation ground for children on a part of the land at Garratt Park purchased by the Council for use as a slop shoot having been completed the ground was thrown open to the public on the 1st May last. From the number of children and others visiting the place it appears to be very much appreciated. The Council recently purchased an adjoining piece of land for use as a shoot, but until it is wanted for that purpose the Committee propose to add it to the recreation ground. The additional land has been levelled and will be thrown open shortly. Garratt Park. 8o 161. The Council has arranged for Coronation Gardens, Open Spaces.

The Highways Committee having decided not to purchase any horses to replace those which were no longer suitable for the Council's work the number of vacancies at the stables at Clapham and Putney greatly increased. The Committee considered the subject of the desirability of filling up these vacancies and in connection therewith a report by the Surveyors as to the cost of hiring horses under contract as compared with the cost of maintaining a stables establishment. In order to assist the Committee in their deliberations tenders were obtained for the supply of horses on hire at each of the stables on conditions similar to those of the existing contract for the hire of horses for dusting work at Tooting. After full consideration of all the circumstances the Council upon the recommendation of the Committee decided to discontinue its horses establishment and to accept the tender of Messrs. Phillips, Mills and Co. (the lowest received) for the hire of the horses required. The new contract is for a period of five years from the 1st May last. The contractors feed and shoe the horses, supply new harness and maintain the same, and provide a foreman. The Council allows the contractors the use of the stables and cottages rent free and provides a supply of water and light thereto. The contractors are bound to supply a sufficient number of horses at each of the stables and the Council only pays for those actually used. The Committee after obtaining an independent valuation -of the Council's horses arranged for their sale to Messrs. Phillips, Mills and Co., upon terms advantageous to the Council. Horses. 163. The Council considered the subject of issuing a bill relating to physical deterioration and alcoholism. A draft bill was prepared by the Medical Officer of Health, which was amended by the Public Health Committee and Physical Deterioration- 81 recommended for adoption by the Council. The Council, however, disapproved of the bill and referred the matter back to the Committee. A further amended bill was recommended and adopted by the Council, but at a subsequent meeting the resolution was revoked, and no further action was taken in the matter. 164.

It was found that the scheme could not be carried out for less than £1,000 for the building and necessary machinery for washing and drying, and the Council decided not to proceed with it. Proposed Washhouse at Clapham. 180. The provision of baths at Clapham which the Council had under consideration when the last annual report was published has received further consideration. An Inquiry was held by the Local Government Board into the Council's application for sanction to a loan of £5,000 to defray the cost of erecting and fitting up the baths. Tenders were invited in alternative form for carrying out the work; 41 tenders were received for the building and 19 for the engineering work. Upon the tenders being considered by the Council it was decided, as the cost of the designs as shewn by the tenders was so greatly in excess of the approved estimates, not to proceed further with them.

The Burials Committee on a reference from the Council considered as to the adaptability for burial purposes of the land adjoining Putney Vale Cemetery. The Committee, in September, reported that at the present rate of usage, i.e., 160 spaces a year, the cemetery would last about 48 years, and at the rate of say 250 spaces a year, 31 years, and they did not recommend the purchase of additional land. The matter was, however, referred back to the Committee, and further enquiries were made as to the land. The Committee then reported that the land which the owners were prepared to sell was in their opinion not suitable, and too costly, and that having regard to the large area of land available for burials in cemeteries belonging to the Council and to all the circumstances the Committee adhered to their former report on the subject. This report was adopted by the Council. The owners of the land have since approached the Council again and offered to sell some land fronting Kingston Road to add to the cemetery, and the Burials Committee recommended the Council not to entertain the offer. Upon the submission of this recommendation to the Council it was decided to refer the offer to the Highways Committee. 189. Complaints having been made of the destruction by rabbits of flowers on the graves at Putney Vale Cemetery, the Council has placed wire netting at the base of the boundary wall and fence of the cemetery at an estimated cost of £50. 190. The Council has had under consideration the subject of the transfer of grave spaces from parishioners to non-parishioners, by which means the payment of the extra purchase fees payable by non-parishioners is evaded, and decided to amend the rules so as to provide that the owner of the right to use any grave space may dispose of such right, subject to the previous consent in writing of the Council, but shall not be entitled to permit any interment in it for a pecuniary consideration; and to print a note on the grant that it can only be transferred subject to the previous consent in writing of the Transfer of Grave Spaces. 87 Council. This will enable the Council to give its consent to the transfer, if it should think fit, upon condition that the difference between the purchase fees for parishioners and non-parishioners be paid. 191.

In connection with the widening of South Street by the London County Council for the electric tramways it was necessary to remove and re-inter the human remains in the part of the All Saints' graveyard which is to be added to the public way, and the Council agreed to such remains being re-interred in the Streatham Cemetery, Garratt Lane, Tooting. All Saints' Graveyard, South Street. 195.

A portion of the cemetery which was originally assigned by the Home Secretary for consecrated ground (and which had been used for burials as such), had not been consecrated, and steps were taken to have this and also some of the additional land consecrated. The Home Secretary approved the proposal, but as a considerable number of interments had taken place in a piece of the ground at the northwestern corner of the cemetery as in unconsecrated ground, besides the interments which had taken place there as in consecrated ground, it was decided to omit this piece from the consecration.

Report on Daii.y Testings of Gas supplied by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company from October, 1903, to March, 1906, and on Testings of Gas supplied by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company during the same period. As it is now rather more than two-and-a-half years since a daily examination of the quality of the gas supplied by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company was instituted, and as recent gas legislation has somewhat modified the present aspect of gas manufacture and hence also of gas-testing, the time seems appropriate for a report dealing with the results of daily testings obtained to date, and with such points of legislation as have a special bearing on the gas supplied to the Wandsworth Borough Council. Wandsworth and Putney Gas Co.— Brief Retrospect of Gas Legislation. In order to fully appreciate the present aspect of legislation it will be necessary to briefly refer to various Acts of Parliament which have preceded the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Act of 1900, by which Act the daily testing of the gas was first laid down. As far back as 1860,and before the appointment of the Gas Referees, an Act " for better regulating the supply of gas to the Metropolis " was passed by which certain tests were made, and it was enacted that the testing-places should be " as near as may be, but not more than 1,000 yards from the gas works," that is, not in the gas works themselves. In 1868 the Gas Referees were appointed, and since then the following tests were made and have been made daily in the Metropolitan area, viz., illuminating power, sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphur other than sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonia and pressure. The following Gas Companies were, however, specially excluded from jurisdiction under this Act, viz., Wandsworth and Putney, Mitcham and Brentford. In 1880 the words defining the distance of the testing-places from the gas works were omitted and it was left to the discretion of the Gas Referees to place them where they thought fit, that is, as centrally as possible in reference to the population. 160 In 1869 there were five testing-places under the Act of 1868 ; in 1872 there were nine; and at the present time there are 23 testingplaces, under the control of the London County Council. Reverting to the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company, this Company was incorporated by Act of Partiament in 1856, by which Act the illuminating power was fixed at twelve candles, with power to the local authority to test at the works. In 1866 by a further Act the illuminating power was raised to fourteen candles, with the same power to test. In 1880 a third Act was passed, " to raise further capital to meet increased supply." So far as I can ascertain, up to the passing of this Act no attempt was made to test the gas on the part of the local authority, but in 1884 my predecessor, Mr. Williams, F.C.S., was appointed by the then Wandsworth Board of Works to test the illuminating power and the sulphuretted hydrogen from time to time at the gas works. In 1890 I succeeded Mr. Williams and continued the testing at the works till September, 1903. In 1900 when the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company applied once more to Parliament for new powers, the Wandsworth Borough Council obtained the insertion in the Act of provision for the erection of two gas testing-places outside the gas works and for the determination of the amount of sulphur other than sulphuretted hydrogen, as well as the illuminating power and pressure and for daily testings of the same ; a certain limit was placed on the amount of sulphur which should be present in the gas and an excess rendered the Company liable to forfeitures similar to those to which the Metropolitan Gas Company were liable. It was not until 1902 that a suitable building for one of the testing-places was obtained at Disraeli Road, Putney, and the site of the other testing-place has not yet been fixed. In October, 1903, the testing-place at Putney was completed as regards the various apparatus required and I was able to commence the daily testing of the gas, which has been continued ever since. The limitation of the amount of sulphur in the gas supplied by the metropolitan gas companies imposed by the instructions of the Gas Referees for many years past necessitated the use of lime in 161 purifying the gas, and in recent years considerable protests had been made by the companies, who alleged that the process created a nuisance and was injurious, and asked in the first instance for a wider limit as regarded the amount of this impurity. In January, 1904, at the instigation of the metropolitan gas companies, an enquiry was held by a Committee appointed by the Board of Trade, by which the whole subject of gas testing in the metropolis was fully considered. The Report of this Committee known as the Metropolitan Gas Committee was published in May, 1904, and is a document well known to all who are interested in the subject, and the recommendations contained in it gave rise to considerable activity in gas legislation. Without entering into details which are more or less fresh in the memory of most, it will be remembered that among other suggestions it was proposed that the lime purification process should be abolished but that testing for sulphur other than sulphuretted hydrogen should be continued as before and that the companies should not be liable to forfeitures in this connection. It was also recommended that in consideration of the increasing employment of gas for heating purposes, the calorific power of the gas should in future be tested and that inasmuch as flat-flame burners were still much used by a large section of the public, the testing of the illuminating power of the gas by means of flat-flame burners should also be introduced. The Metropolitan Gas Companies were not slow to take advantage of these suggestions and as a result the London Gas Act, 1905, was passed and became law on January 1st of this year. In this Act the above suggestions of the Metropolitan Gas Committee were embodied with some slight modifications. As a natural result the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company recently (October, 1905) asked the Wandsworth Borough Council to consider how far they would follow the course taken by the London County Council and dispense with the penalising for "the small extra fraction of sulphur" that would remain in the gas by the disuse of lime purification, pending the Company's obtaining the authority of Parliament to secure the same relief as had been given to certain other London Companies. The Wandsworth Borough Council after 162 sideration agreed to suspend the penalties and at the present time the Gas Company has a Bill before Parliament—" Removal of Sulphur Restrictions," in which the abolition of forfeitures is proposed. In connection with this Bill an arrangement has been arrived at between the Council and the Gas Company by which the following points will be secured :—Continued testing for sulphur other than sulphuretted hydrogen, estimation of the calorific power of the gas and determination of the illuminating power by means of flat-flame burners ; also a somewhat greater elasticity as regards times of testing; and I trust the erection of a second testing place in the district in addition to the present one at Putney. The Wandsworth Borough Council will therefore be in a position to continue the thorough testing of the gas while the convenience of the manufacturers will be in no way unduly interfered with. Illuminating Power. Results of Daily Testing of the Gas from October, 1903, to March 31st, 1906 (Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company). The standard illuminating power of the gas is fixed at 14 candles and on no occasion have I found it below this figure although at times it has not been very much above it. On the whole, however, the average illuminating power has been about 15 candles, the actual average for the period of two and a half years being 15.4 candles. I think these results are a matter for congratulation and I attribute this distinctly favourable condition to the effect of the daily testings and reports to the Company who are thus better able to regulate and control the illuminating power, since it has been abundantly shown that tests made at the Gas Works only are liable to be illusory as regards the actual illuminating power of the gas in a given centre at some distance from the Works. It is for this reason that I have urged the erection of a second testing place in another part of the district in addition to the one at Putney and I trust the Council will again consider the matter. Table A shows the average monthly variations of the illuminating power from October, 1903, to March, 1906, and the curve in Table B shows the average weekly variations, all the averages" being based on daily testings. Here again I consider the results favourable as at 110 time or at least seldom is there any sudden variation indicated ; as Sulphur. 163 usual a gradual increase is observable in the summer months and a gradual decrease in the winter months. Nor do the maximum and minimum monthly averages vary very greatly, thus in 1904 they were 15.7 and 14.6 respectively and in 1905 16.2 and 14.7 candles. I have already called attention in my brief historical retrospect of legislation to the various changes which have occurred as regards the purification by lime and the consequent removal, for the present at least, of "any restrictions as to the amount of sulphur allowable in gas. It is however generally understood that even in the absence of lime purification the limit should not appreciably exceed 35 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas, and this applies to all the Gas Companies. As regards the Wandsworth and Futney Gas Company at the commencement of the daily testings from October to December, 1903, the amount of sulphur was high in relation to the statutory regulation then in force (viz., that it should not exceed 20 grains in 100 cubic feet, the Company being liable to forfeiture if there should be an excess of two grains 011 six consecutive days or of 10 grains on any one day), but this relatively high amount was due to the fact that the Company had at first some difficulty in regulating this impurity owing to the use of new plant. It is only fair to the Company to state that during the whole of 1904 and 1905 with comparatively few and quite temporary exceptions the sulphur was maintained well within the limit prescribed by the Act of 1900, the average for 1904 being 12.3 and for 1905, 10.5 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas. In Table A will be seen the monthly averages of the sulphur from October, 1903, to March 31st, 1906, and in Table B are shown in the form of a curve the weekly averages during the same period, all these averages having been calculated from daily testings. Although the general average during this period shown did not exceed 12 grains, there was as may be supposed a certain and not inconsiderable fluctuation and what is perhaps the most striking point about this sulphur curve is its remarkable relation to the curve for the illuminating power shown on the same Table. From a general inspection even, it is noticeable that as the sulphur increases the illuminating power d creases and vice versa and the ratio of the two curves is 164 mately an inverse ratio. It certainly would seem that the presence ot sulphur in quantity is not favourable to a high illuminating power of gas and that there is a more or less definite relation between these results. If this is so the relationship may act as a useful factor in preventing too large an excess of sulphur which so many scientific authorities consider injurious from a hygienic point of view. During the last three months the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company have taken advantage of the temporary removal of sulphur restrictions which they are now expecting to confirm in Parliament to abolish lime purification and the sulphur has therefore during this period considerably increased, the average however has not much exceeded 25 grains, and it has been fairly uniform. If this condition is maintained in the future I think the Council will have no cause to regret their decision to meet the Company half-way in procuring the relief of sulphur restrictions afforded to the Metropolitan Companies. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. No sulphuretted hydrogen has up to the present time been found in the gas although daily testings are made, showing a high purification as regards this impurity. Pressure. I have not made a special return of the Pressure in this Report as from daily observations duly reported it is clear that it has not as anytime varied greatly and that it has seldom been less than equal to a column of two inches of water or in other words one inch in excess of the limit insisted on by the law. Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company. This Company like the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company and the Brentford Gas Company was excluded from jurisdiction under the Act of 1868 by whicli the Metropolitan Gas Referees were appointed. As Gas Examiner to the Wandsworth Borough Council I have for many years past tested at the Works of the Company at Mitcham the gas supplied by them. By their Act of 1892 the illuminating power is fixed at 15 candles, sulphuretted hydrogen is tested for and I have noted of late years the pressure, but the sulphur is not estimated. During the last two and a half years I have made fortnightly testings and have presented Reports for 1904 and for 1905. On the whole the tests have shown a satisfactory condition and only on one 165 occasion did I find the illuminating power below the average. For 1904 the average illuminating power was 15.9 candles and for 1905 15.8 candles: No sulphuretted hydrogen was found and the pressure was seldom less than that of a column of water of 3.5 inches in height. I think and have frequently expressed the opinion that, considering the greatly increased supply of gas by this Company and the modern conditions of testing, it would be preferable to examine the gas in a centrally-situated gas testing place outside the Works and should the opportunity arise I trust something may be done in this direction.

Tooting Library: Ernest Callard. * Term of office expired 9th November, 1905. 282 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT, 1905-1906. THE Sub-Committee have pleasure in reporting satisfactory progress in the work of the Streatham, Balham and Tooting Libraries during the year ended 31st March, 1906. Books Issued. The number of books issued to readers was 353,061, being an increase of 18,455 on last year's return. The following is a statement of the number of volumes circulated at each library:— The Tate Library, Streatham 146,819 Balham Public Library 143,695 Tooting Public Library 62,547 353,061 A classification of the issues is given on page 285. Tickets were issued to 10,709 borrowers, namely:— Borrowers' Tickets. 5,042 at the Tate Library. 3,875 at the Balham Library. 1,792 at the Tooting Library. The borrowers registered at the three libraries were 246 more than last year. Tickets are available for a period of twelve months. 1,220 volumes, representing different classes of literature, have been transferred from the Streatham to the Balham Stock. Library for the purpose of augmenting the stock at the latter institution. The technical and reference sections of the Tate Library have been carefully examined during the past year, and many out-of date books have been discarded. 283 The withdrawal of a considerable number of worn-out volumes in the fiction and juvenile departments has caused a further reduction of stock at the Streatham Library. The number of worn-out books which required replacement at the Tate Library at the end of the financial year was 311. After making the necessary deductions for transfers, replacements, and discarded volumes the stock, at the 31st March, 1906, numbered 32,884 volumes, apportioned as follows:— The Tate Library, Streatham 17,042 Balham Public Library 10,316 Tooting Public Library 5,526 Total 32,884 A classification of the stock is given on page 285. At the annual stocktaking in July, only one volume, belonging to the Balham Library, could not be accounted for. The funds did not permit of the publication of a printed catalogue during the past year, but the usual small hand lists of additions and special lists showing the resources of the libraries on topics of the day were issued at frequent intervals. The card catalogues are always kept up to date, and readers find these a convenient means of ascertaining the titles and numbers of the latest books added to the lending departments. Reading Rooms. The reading rooms are supplied with a comprehensive selection of the principal newspapers and periodicals : 227 are provided at the Tate Library, 152 at the Balham Library, and 109 at the Tooting Library. The large number of persons who frequent the rooms daily is an indication of the usefulness and popularity of these departments. The attendance on Sundays is also very good and has increased during the past year. A list of the papers provided at each library is appended. See pages 289—294. 284 Library Receipts. The following is a statement of the receipts from the sale of catalogues, fines, &c., during the past year:— £ s. d.

THE Sub-Committee have pleasure in reporting that the usefulness of the Library is maintained, and that there has been a steady increase in the work of the institution during the period under review. In December, 1905, the Borough Council appointed Councillors Fitch, Jackson, Parker and Radford as the Sub-Committee for 1906. At the first meeting Councillor Jackson was elected Chairman for the year. It having been decided to issue a Quarterly List of additions to the Library, the first part was published in January, 1906; it is classified, and descriptive annotations have been added to the most important additions. Lending Department. The alteration in the times of opening this department, which is now open from 10 a.m. till 8 p.m. daily, Thursdays, Bank-holidays; &c., excepted, has been greatly appreciated by borrowers. There has been a great increase in the number of volumes issued for home reading. During the year 64,380 volumes were issued to borrowers; these figures show an increase of 6,604 volumes on the issue lor 1904-5. The number of borrower's tickets available for use on March 31st was 2,038. During the year 590 volumes have been added to this department, 132 worn-out volumes have been replaced, and 71 have been withdrawn from circulation, not being worth replacing. Total number of volumes now in stock is 8,608. Reference Department. The majority of books in this department are on open shelves ; readers having free access to the books, no statistics are available. The number of volumes in the Reference Library is 2,107. The Sub-Committee have to report that a man was caught stealing a book from the open shelves, and was imprisoned for three months. 297 Magazine Boom. This room is very much appreciated, and is frequently crowded. Twenty-eight monthly magazines and reviews, five quarterlies, and 36 weekly periodicals are placed in this room. The monthly magazines, reviews and quarterlies are transferred to the lending department and are issued for home reading, through the indicator. News Boom. The list of newspapers, &c., contains 28 copies of daily newspapers, including some of the more important provincial dailies, and 94 weekly newspapers and periodicals. During the past autumn estimates were obtained for painting and renovating the exterior of the building, for constructing means of access to the flat roof, for fixing a bath in the Caretaker's quarters, and for additional lighting in the news room. These works were carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor at a cost of £60. The Sub-Committee have much pleasure in expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties. Tables of information relating to the issues of books, classification, &c., will be found 011 pages 298—301. For list of newspapers, periodicals, &c , see pages 302—3.

REED WELCH. 306 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, For the Year ending 31st March, 1906. THE opening of the new Reference Library and Magazine Room in February, 1905, has relieved the pressure in the Reading Room and given great satisfaction to readers in both departments. The replacement of the old worn-out Wenham lamps by incandescent fittings has much improved the lighting throughout at a greatly reduced consumption of gas. 320 worn-out and obsolete volumes have been withdrawn from the Library and not replaced, being out of print or out of date. Allowing for this reduction the number of books now in stock is 14,380, of which 11,371 are in the Lending Library, and 3,009 in the Reference Library. The number issued during the year was 94,229 in the Lending Library and 6,822 in the Reference Library (exclusive of books in open cases), being a total issue of 101,051 volumes, an increase of 5,168 as compared with the previous year, and representing a daily average issue of 414 volumes. This is the highest issue in both departments of any year since the opening of the Library in 1889, as will be seen by referring to one of the Librarian's tables following. 3,570 tickets were issued during the year to readers in the Lending Library. In the Reading Room two additional stands have been provided, accommodating four newspapers, and glazed draught-preventing sides fixed to the sash fanlights. The finding of papers and periodicals by visitors has been facilitated by distinguishing the tables and racks by letters, with corresponding letters on the sides of the periodical covers, and placing on each table a tablet containing a list of the papers to be found thereon. 307 The quarterly lists of additions to the Library have been published and presented regularly by the publishers (Messrs. Willis & Co.), and are much appreciated by the readers. The cordial thanks of the Sub-Committee are due to the donors of books, periodicals, etc., and especially to Councillor Clement Colman for forty-five bound volumes of "The Graphic," and to Mr. Alexander Smart for a number of Roman coins. The Borough Council in November, 1905, appointed Aldermen Bulcraig and Kipling, and Councillors Busfield, Colman, and Kent as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1906. At their first meeting Alderman Henry Bulcraig was elected chairman for the year, and a vote of thanks passed to Councillor Clement Colman for his services as chairman during the previous year. The only alteration in the staff has been the resignation of S. H. Aubrey as junior assistant, and the appointment of H. V. Hind in his place. In conclusion the Sub-Committee have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the able and efficient manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties.

THE Sub-Committee beg to present their report on the work of the Wandsworth Libraries during the year which ended on 31st March, 1906. There are three libraries under the charge of the SubCommittee, viz., West Hill Library, Allfarthing Lane Branch Library and the Branch for the Exchange of Books, at Windermere Terrace, Garratt Lane, Earlsfield. The cost of maintenance of this last is being generously borne by Alderman J. W. Lorden. The number of volumes issued from the West Hill and Allfarthing Lane Libraries was 107,202, an increase of 10,476 over the return for the year ending 31st March, 1905. The number of books in the lending libraries in the different classes, and the number issued are given in Table I., the percentages of issues in each class in Table II., and the issues since 1st April, 1900, in Table III. The statistics for the Branch for the Exchange of Books at Earlsfield will be found in Table IV. The lending libraries are open each day in the week except Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., while the reading rooms are open each week-day from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Allfarthing Lane Branch Library has been redecorated in accordance with the terms of the lease, and the electric lamps there have been re-arranged. 315 With the permission of the Council an exhibition of local views was held at the West Hill Library from 6th to 25th November, 1905. During this time over 200 children from schools in the neighbourhood visited the Library, and to them short addresses explanatory of the historic and literary interest of the views were given by the Librarian. The Sub-Committee arranged the following course of lectures, which were delivered in the Reference Library at West Hill:— LIST OF LECTURES, WEST HILL PUBLIC LIBRARY. 14th November, 1905—Councillor W.

The Librarian with the sanction of the Library Committee attended the 28th Annual Conference of the Library Association held at Cambridge on 22nd, 23rd and 24th August. His report was submitted to the Sub-Committee, and sent to the Library Committee. The Sub-Committee desire to put on record their thanks to the Clapham Library Sub-Committee for a gift of sixty chairs, which have been of great service at the West Hill Library. Messrs. Willis & Co. have supplied gratis four numbers of the quarterly journal which, with the next two issues, will contain a complete list of the books added to the libraries down to the end of 1905. There was included also a classified list of books 011 English history in the West Hill Library. 316 The necessary apparatus for a card catalogue has been obtained during the year, and all additions since the printing of the main catalogue have been entered on this catalogue which has been placed in a position easily accessible to borrowers. The new catalogue is in a forward state of preparation and the Sub Committee hope to be able to send it to press during the ensuing year. The extinction of the out-standing debt on the Libraries has freed an additional sum of money for expenditure on books; in anticipation of this the Books Sub-Committee were asked in October of last year to overhaul certain classes of books in the West Hill Library, especially those on Science, in order that those out of date might be replaced by the latest editions and the newest books on the various branches of Science. This has been done and the work of rejection is being continued in Classes A, B, C and D. The Board of Education drew attention to the advisability of subscribing to the National Home Reading Union; we have instructed the Librarian to become an Honorary Member. The whole of the Libraries Committee was invited for the meeting held on the 17th October, 1905. The following changes have occurred:—Mr. A. Nash, Librarianin-charge, left the Allfarthing Branch Library on the last day of the year (March 31st); Mr. R. Cooper, second Assistant, left and was succeeded by Mr. L. E. Hull, from Tooting Library; W. H. Kirchner, junior Assistant, was followed by R. Cruttenden; H. Tarrant, Saturday Assistant, was followed by T. Davis. 317 TABLE I.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1905. Population. The population of the Borough for the year, estimated according to the methods adopted by the Registrar General was, including public institutions, 284,710, compared with 269,583 in 1904, an increase of 15,127. Table I. shows the population of each sub-district, corrected and uncorrected, as well as that for the whole Borough. TABLE 1. SUB-DISTRICT. Census 1901. Population estimated to the middle of 1905. Corrected. Uncorrected. Clapham 51,361 55,710 55,440 Putney 24,139 27,830 27,660 Streatham 71,658 89,170 89,720 Tooting 16,473 31,110 33,110 Wandsworth 68,403 75,380 78,780 Whole Borough 232,034 279,200 284,710 a 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. This estimated population, although in all probability fairly correct for the whole Borough is not so when each individual subdistrict is taken. In some parts of the Borough, notably in Clapham South Ward and in Southfield Ward, Wandsworth, the increase has been very great, and this increase will be seen in the next Table. The estimated population in this Table is obtained by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Census 1901 by the number of assessments in that year, thus obtaining a factor representing the number of persons per assessment, by which the number of assessments in the middle of 1905 is multiplied. This factor does not vary much at the different deceunia and consequently the estimated population of each sub-district is nearer the truth than the estimated population obtained by the method adopted by the Registrar General. TABLE II. SUB-DISTRICT. Census Number of Population, 1901. Assessments, 1901. Assessments, 1905. Estimated Population, 1905. Corrected. Uncorrected. Clapham 51,361 9,196 11,477 64,170 63,900 Putney 24,139 4,555 5,326 28,400 28,230 Streatham 71,658 13,963 17,332 88,030 88,580 Tooting 16,473 3,341 5,162 23,080 25,080 Wandsworth 68,403 12,243 15,603 82,230 85,630 Whole Borough 232,034 43,296 54,870 285,910 291,420 The corrected population as above, viz., 285,910, is slightly above the estimate made by the London County Council for the Equalisation of Rates Act, viz., 285,433. The corrected population in the above Table is used to calculate the rates in this Report. The difference between the corrected and uncorrected population is made up by the population in the Public Institutions of the Borough, which are as follows :— 7 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Clapham :—Hostel of God. Putney :—The Priory, Roehatnpton. Streatham :—St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish). Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). Tooting :—Tooting Home. Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals— The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. Wandsworth The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Northlands Home for Inebriates. Middlesex Couuty Lunatic Asylum (part ot). H.M. Prison. The total population of these institutions was about 6,300, but as a considerable proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to the Borough, a deduction of 5,510 made from the uncorrected total population give approximately the corrected population, viz., 285,910, compared with 264,200 in 1904, and 251,000 in 1903. A comparison of Tables I. and II. shows that the population of Clapham has been much under estimated, and also of Wandsworth, while the population of Tooting has been over estimated. There are very few boroughs in the Metropolis where the growth during the last few years has been so rapid, and, consequently, the difficulty in estimating the population so great. It is unfortunate from a statistical point of view that a quinquennial census will not be taken, as the percentage of error will naturally increase until the next decennial census. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 30th December, 1905, 6,892 births, 3,467 of males and 3,425 of females were registered, compared with 6,917 in 1904, and 6,722 in 1903. 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. , In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough. TABLE III. Births. Rates. Sub-District. Males. Females. Total. Birth-Rate. Rate of natural increase. Clapham 698 714 1,412 22.00 11.32 Putney 281 248 529 18.62 7.92 Streatham 873 895 1,768 20.08 10.02 Tooting 452 439 891 38.60 26.69 Wandsworth 1,163 1,129 2,292 27.87 14.87 Whole Borough 3,467 3,425 6,892 24.11 12.50 The birth-rate in all the sub-districts, with the exception of Tooting, was lower than in the year 1904. In my Report for 1904 it was stated that this rate for Tooting was probably calculated on too large a population, and that the low rate for that year was due to this circumstance. In 1905 the rate has been calculated from a smaller and in all probability a more correct population, with the result that the birth-rate is 38.60, compared with 29.26 in 1904, and 35.81 in 1903. That the birth-rate in Tooting is high is shown by the fact that the number of births, 891, is a considerable increase as compared with 1904, when the number of births was 772. In all the other sub-districts the actual number of births registered is smaller than in 1904, although there has been an increase in the population. The lowest birth-rate occurred in Putney, and the highest in Tooting. The following Table shows the birth-rate in the Borough, the five sub-districts, London and England and Wales, for the past ten years and for the year 1905, compared with the average.

The birth-rate for London was 27.02 per 1,000, compared with 27.81 in 1904 and 28.37 in 1903, and for England and Wales 27.2 per 1,000, compared with 27.9 in 1904 and 28.36 in 1903. The rate for the year is the lowest yet recorded, and is 2.06 under the decennial average. 10 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, was 12.50 per 1,000, compared with 13.28 in 1904. This rate was lowest in Putney, viz. :—7.92, and highest in Tooting, viz. :—26.69. This diminution in the birth-rate is a real one, as may be shown by comparing the births per 1,000 married females at ages 15—45 for the year with the previous years. In 1901, the year of the census, there were living 28,298 married females at ages from 15—45, giving a proportion of 21.5 births to every 100. In 1904 this proportion was 21.0, while in 1905 it was only 19.4. In all London this proportion was, in the years 1901—3, 23.4, and in 1904 22.8. In the Registrar General's sixty-sixth Annual Report the proportion of legitimate births per 1,000 married women aged 15—45 years, for certain groups of years, was shown to be as follows :— 1870—72 292.5 1880—82 286.0 1890—92 263.8 1900—02 235.5 1903 2333 With reference to this the Registrar-General says :—" This statement proves that the true decrease in the birth-rate is not adequately shown by a comparison of the rates calculated on the total population. . . . This method of measuring the birth-rate shows the amount of the decrease to be far greater than is shown by the rates based on the total population." 133 births occurred in the Workhouse, 6 of these belonging to Clapham, 9 to Putney, 13 to Streatham, 10 to Tooting, 32 to Wandsworth, 52 to Battersea, and 11 to other places. There were 110 illegitimate births registered during the year, 15 in Clapham, 7 in Putney, 29 in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 38 in Wandsworth. Of the 70 births in the Workhouse belonging to the Borough, 55 were illegitimate, 4 belonging to Clapham, 6 to Putney, 13 to Streatham, 7 to Tooting, and 25 to Wandsworth. 11 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of illegitimate births, including those in the Workhouse, was 165, of which 19 belonged to Clapham, 13 to Putney, 42 to Streatham, 28 to Tooting, and 63 to Wandsworth. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2 4, compared with 3.8 for the whole of London for the year 1904. Deaths. During the fifty-two weeks ending the 30th December, 1905, 3,241 deaths (1,613 of males and 1,628 of females) were registered in the Borough, compared with 3,296 in 1904, 3,007 in 1903, 3,209 in 1902, and 3,009 in 1901. The total number of deaths for the year is thus 55 less than the number in 1904, and 540 under the corrected decennial average. The uncorrected death-rate was 11.12, compared with 12.22 in 1904, 11.69 in 1903, 12.84 in 1902, and 12.82 in 1901. The average for the decennium 1895—19°4 was 13.36, so that the uncorrected death-rate is considerably lower, and is the lowest rate ever recorded. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in out-lying institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in public institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domicile was in other parts of London. The total number of deaths corrected for both external and internal institutions was 3,320, compared with 3,417 in 1904,3,073 in 1903, 3,328 in 1902, 3,130 in 1901, and 3,882, the corrected decennial average. The total number of corrected deaths was 562 under the decennial average corrected for increase of population, while in 1904 this was only 110, and in 1903 433. During the year 701 deaths occurred in Public Institutions, and 28 at other places not institutions in the Borough. Of these 729, 610 deaths were of persons not belonging to the Borough, and 119 of persons belonging to the Borough. 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of deaths in Institutions, viz., 729, is an increase of 60 compared with the previous year. This increase is chiefly due to the increased number of deaths in the Fever Hospitals, Tooting Home, and the Tooting Bec Asylum. In the Hostel of God the number of deaths was 11, in the St. Anne's Home one, and in the Middlesex County Asylum five less than in the year 1904. In the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Fever Hospitals there were 28 more, in the Tooting Bec Asylum 36 more, and in the Tooting Home 20 more than in 1904. In other places not Institutions the number of deaths was 28, compared with 32 in 1904. In Table V. it will be seen that of these five occurred in Clapham, three in Putney, eight in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth. In Table VI. will be seen that of persons not belonging to the Borough the greatest number occurred from Old Age, and that of the total of 134, 93 occurred in the Tooting Bec Asylum. In the Middlesex County Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular Disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and other causes, which include all diseases of the nervous system. In the Tooting Bec Asylum the greatest number occurred from Old Age, Cancer, Broncho-Pneumonia, and other causes; in the Hostel of God from Tubercular Disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular Disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and other causes. In the Fever Hospitals 50 deaths occurred from Scarlet Fever, compared with 17 in 1904, 20 from Diphtheria compared with 21, five from Enteric Fever compared with 11, and eight non-notifiable diseases compared with 13. Compared with 1904 there were fewer deaths from Tubercular Disease of the Lungs in the Middlesex County Asylum and the Hostel of God, and more in the Tooting Bec Asylum and the Tooting Home. i5 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 22 deaths in other places five were from Suicidal and four from Accidental Causes. Table VII. shows the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons belonging thereto, arranged according to cause of death, sex, age and institution in which the death occurred. The total number of deaths was 119, 66 of males and 53 of females, compared with 116, 61 of males and 55 of females, in 1904. Fifty of the deaths occurred iu the Fever Hospitals, 51 in the Tooting Home, five in the Workhouse, five in the Tooting Bee Asylum, one in the Hostel of God, one in the Middlesex County Asylum, and six in other places. These deaths are allocated to their proper sub-districts in Table XIV. The number of deaths in Table VI., viz.: 610, and that on Table VII., viz.: 119, make up the total of 729, the total number of deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough as shown in the last column of Table XIV., and in column 9 of Table X. 16 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other parishes in the Borough in institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in internal institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and Tooting Bee Asylum. 18 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE VIII.

The corrected number of deaths, after adding the deaths on Table VIII. and subtracting those on Table VI., was 3,320, 1,684 of males and 1,636 of females, a decrease of 97 compared with 1904, and of 512 compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The corrected death-rate for the year was 11.61 per 1,000, compared with 12.93 in 1904, 12.24 1903, 13.43 in 1902, and 15.33 in 1901. Table IX. shows the total number of deaths and the death-rates for each sub-district and the whole Borough, corrected and uncorrected for deaths in Public Institutions. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 15.1 per 1,000, compared with 16.10 in 1904, 15.6 in 1903, 17.2 in 1902, and 17.1 in 1901. The death-rate in England and Wales in 1905 was 16.2 per 1,000, compared with 16.2 in 1904; in the 76 great towns 17.2, compared with 17.2 ; and in the 141 smaller towns 15.6, compared with 15.6. 20 TABLE IX.

In the several Metropolitan Boroughs the rates during the year were as follows, beginning with the lowest:— 1. Hampstead 9.3 2. Wandsworth 11.61 3. Lewisham 11.7 4. Woolwich 12.8 5.

In 1904 the sub-districts occupied the same positions, but in 1905 Wandsworth was lower by 1.79 per 1,000, and Streatham by .60 per 1,000. B 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The rates in all the sub-districts show a considerable decreasecompared with the year 1904. This decrease was as follows:—Clapham, from 14.25 to 10.68 per 1,000, a decrease of 3.57; Putney, 12.00 to 10.70 a decrease of 1.30; Streatham, 10.66 to 10.06, a decrease of .60; Tooting 13.03 to 11.91, a decrease of 1.12; and Wandsworth, 14.79 to 13.03 a decrease of 1.79. The rates in this Table do not agree with the rates in Table X. as the latter are calculated on the total population without deducting the population of non-parishioners in Public Institutions in the Borough. The first Chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 of population during each week of the year for the whole of London, and for each fortnight for the Borough. At no time during the year was the rate in the Borough higher than for all London, and for the most part it was considerably lower. Only in September was there a closer approximation between the two rates, this being due to the Diarrhoea deaths in this Borough occurring chiefly in the last fortnight of August, and the first fortnight of September, whereas in London generally the number of deaths from these causes reached its maximum at an earlier period. The next Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough compared with the rate for the year 1904, which shows that the rate was about the same in January, much lower in the first fortnight and slightly higher in the second fortnight in February, lower in March, April and May, higher in June, higher in the first fortnight and lower in the second fortnight of July, lower in August, higher in the first two fortnights in September and lower in the third, slightly higher in October, higher in November, and about the same in December. In three fortnights during the year the rate was above 15 per 1,000, and in seven fortnights the rate was under 10 per 1,000. As in previous years the high rates in the last fortnight in August and the first fortnight of September were due to the number of deaths of infants from Diarrhoea and other diseases of the organs of digestion, while the higher rates in January and December were due to the 23 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. number of deaths at the extremes of life from diseases of the respiratory organs. The four tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the ten preceding years; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various sub-districts. It also shows these for each year since 1895, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last ten years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to Hospital. Table IV. is the general mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each subdistrict, and the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. 24 TABLE X. Wandsworth District.

Ages. at Death. The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub district and for the whole Borough :— TABLE XV. Sub-Districts. Under 1 year. 1 to 5 Years. 5 to 15 Years. 15 to 25 Years. 25 to 65 Years. 65 Years and Upwards Clapham 23.32 9.04 3.2I 2.92 35.57 25.94 Putney 19.08 12.17 5.26 3.00 36.81 23.68 Streatham 19.75 9.03 3.61 4.29 32.39 30.93 Tooting 35.20 16.53 4.53 4.53 24.53 14.66 Wandsworth 27.41 10.57 3.65 3.55 33.40 21.42 Whole Borough 24.63 10.66 3.79 3.69 32.90 24.34 Compared with 1904, the percentage of deaths under one year to total deaths was .45 lower; from one to five years .21 higher ; from five to fifteen years 1.13 higher ; from 15 to 25 years .17 lower ; from 25 to 65 years .53 higher ; and from 65 years and upwards 1.24 lower. The comparatively large increase in the percentage at five to 15 years was due to the increased number of deaths at these ages from Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever and all other causes. As was the case in previous years there is a considerable difference between the percentages in the sub-districts. Under one year Putney had a percentage of only 19.08, while Tooting had one of 35.20, while at 65 years and upwards Streatham had a percentage of 30.93 and Tooting a percentage of 14.66. These differences in rates are due to the differences in age constitution and social conditions in the sub-districts, Tooting and Wandsworth containing a much larger proportion of persons under five years of age to total population and also a larger proportion of the working classes. 30 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Infantile Mentality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 818, compared with 851 in 1904, 743 in 1903, and 809 in 1902. Of these 160 occurred in Clapham, 58 in Putney, 175 in Streatham, 132 in Tooting, and 293 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality was 118 per 1,000 births, compared with 123 in 1904, no in 1903, an 126 in 1902. The following Table shows the number of deaths in each subdistrict, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year 1905, and the three previous years, as well as the total deaths for the whole Borough:— TABLE XVI. Sub-District. No. of Deaths under one year. Percentage to total Deaths.

The infantile mortality in London for the year was 128, in England and Wales, 128, in the 76 great towns 140, in the 141 smaller towns 132, and in rural England and Wales 113. The rate for the year, viz.:—118 per 1,000 births, is lower than in the previous year and is also lower than the decennial average, 31 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. which was 132 per 1,000 births. Only once during the decennium viz., in 1903, was this rate lower. The Tables which follow are inserted at the request of the Local Government Board, and show in much more detail than has been done in previous years full particulars of the deaths of infants under one year at monthly age periods and from different diseases. Table XVII. includes deaths in the whole Borough, and the six following Tables the deaths for each separate sub-district. It will be seen that only two deaths occurred from the notifiable infectious diseases, both occurring in Streatham, 15 from Measles, 33 from Whooping Cough, 34 from diseases of a Tubercular nature, 128 from Premature Birth, 271 from Congenital defects or diseases, 120 from Diarrhoea, 136 from Respiratory Diseases, 11 from Accidents, and 168 from all other causes. Compared with 1904 there is an increase in the number of deaths from Premature Birth, Respiratory Diseases, Tubercular Diseases, Measles and Whooping Cough, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Developmental Diseases, the Notifiable Diseases, Accidents, all causes, and especially from Diarrhoea. In all the deaths, with the exception of three, the cause of death was certified by a medical man or by the coroner after inquest. 34.2 per cent of the total deaths occurred in the first month, 52.4 per cent. in the first three months, and 71.8 per cent. in the first six months. An analysis of the Table for the whole Borongh shows that 36.4 per cent. of the total deaths occurred from wasting diseases, and that of the deaths from wasting diseases 70 per cent. occurred under one month. Of the total deaths under one month, viz., 280, 210 or 75 per cent. occurred from wasting diseases. From Diarrhoeal diseases, on the other hand, the number of deaths under one month was only 11 out of a total of 185. The greatest mortality occurred from the second to the tenth month. 34 deaths occurred from Tuberculous Diseases, the majority being Tuberculous Meningitis. From diseases of the Respiratory Organs 136 deaths occurred, only 12 of which occurred under one month. 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XVII. (Table 5.) Borough of Wandsworth.

Population (estimated to middle of 1905), 48,730. Births in the year—legitimate, 941 ; illegitimate, 28. Deaths from all causes at all ages, 404. 39 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next Table shows the infantile mortality rate per 1,000 births for the whole Borough and for each sub-district from all causes, and from certain causes. An examination of this Table shows that this mortality differs very much in the different sub-districts of the Borough, more especially in the case of Developmental Diseases, Diarrhoea, and from Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. For example, from Developmental Diseases the rate was in Streatham only 16.96, whereas in Tooting it was 40.40; from Diarrhoea the rate was in Putney only 3.78, and in Tooting 28.05; and from Respiratory Diseases it was 14.14 in Streatham, and 24.43 in Wandsworth. The rate from Premature Birth was much the same in each sub-district. From Measles and Whooping Cough the rate in Putney was exceptionally high, this being due to an outbreak of Measles there during the year. The Table also shows that about 44 per cent. of the total deaths occurred from Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases, and of the total deaths under one year from these causes 70 per cent. occurred under one month, and of the total deaths from all causes under one month 75 per cent. were caused by Premature Birth and Congenital Defects. 40 TABLE XXIV.

Compared with 1904 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, Whooping Cough and other zymotic diseases, and a decrease from Diphtheria, Measles, Influenza and Diarrhœa. The number of deaths from Enteric Fever was the same in 1904 and 1905. 42 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, and other zymotic diseases, and a decrease in the number from Small-pox, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Measles, Whooping Cough, Influenza and Diarrhoea. The largest decrease occurred from Diphtheria, Influenza and Diarrhoea. The death-rate per 1,000 from all these diseases was 1.57 (1.35 in Clapham, 1.69 in Putney, no in Streatham, 273 in Tooting, and 1.87 in Wandsworth), compared with 1.93 in 1904, 1.72 in 1903, 2.18 in 1902, 1.81 in 1901, and 2-26 the decennial average The death-rate from the principal zymotic diseases, viz., Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Diarrhoea was 1.30 per 1,000, compared with 1.6o in 1904, 1.49 in 1903, and 1.68 in 1902. The rate in London for the year was 1.68 per 1,000, compared with 2.14 in 1904, 1.73 in 1903, and 2.21 in 1902. The rate for England and Wales for the year was 1.94, in the 76 great towns 2.49, in the 141 smaller towns 2.02, and in Rural England and Wales 1.28. In out-lying Institutions 67 deaths occurred from zymotic diseases (24 belonging to Clapham, three to Putney, 13 to Streatham, six to Tooting and 21 to Wandsworth), compared with 58 in 1904, and 32 in 1903. Of these deaths 33 occurred in the Union Infirmary, 17 from Measles, three from Influenza, six from Whooping Cough, five from Erysipelas, and two from Puerperal Fever ; 24 in General and Special Hospitals, one each from Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Intermittent Fever, nine from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis, three from Erysipelas, eight from other septic diseases; and 10 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, eight from Scarlet Fever and two from Diphtheria. In Internal Institutions 89 deaths occurred of persons not belonging to the Borough, compared with 67 in 1904. 43 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of these 76 occurred in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, 50 from Scarlet Fever, 20 from Diphtheria, five from Enteric Fever and one from Diarrhoea. The increase compared with the previous year is wholly due to the increased number of deaths from Scarlet Fever. Four deaths occurred in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum—one from Enteric Fever, one from Puerperal Fever and two from other septic diseases. Two deaths occurred in the Tooting Bee Asylum, both from Erysipelas ; one from Erysipelas in Tooting Home ; one from Influenza in H.M. Prison ; three from Influenza in the Hospital for Incurables ; one from Diarrhoea in St. Anne's Home ; and one from Diarrhoea in other places not institutions. Of the total deaths from zymotic diseases 48 occurred in the Fever Hospitals in Tooting—one from Measles, 19 from Scarlet Fever, one from Influenza, 19 from Diphtheria, six from Enteric Fever, and two from other septic diseases. Table XXVI. shows the death-rate from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1905, as well as for the ten previous years. The rate above or below the decennial average is also shown. TABLE XXVI. 1905 Sub-Districts. 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 I90I I902 1903 1904 1905 Rate above decennial average.

The rate in Clapham was .51 under last year, and 1.07 under the decennial average; in Putney .21 above last year, but .19 under the decennial average; in Streatham .23 under last year and .65 under the decennial average; in Tooting .31 above last year and .30 above the decennial average; and in Wandsworth .76 under last year and .82 under the decennial average. The rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, while compared with the decennial average, Clapham shows the greatest reduction, and Wandsworth the next. The reason why the rate for Putney was higher than in 1904 was on account of the increase in the number of deaths from Measles, and in Tooting on account of the increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea. Notification of Infectious Diseases. The total number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts is shown on Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables. The number of notifications of cases received in this Borough since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is as follows :— TABLE XXVI1. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 Small-pox 4 .... 29 1 15 1 2 1 .... 4 34 127 30 8 2 Scarlatina 453 887 1256 673 659 983 1014 703 894 672 684 1063 835 791 1507 Diphtheria 164 242 398 321 266 286 569 581 615 454 466 743 533 403 354 Membranous Croup Fevers. 8 17 33 22 21 3 7 8 6 6 3 7 6 6 3 Typhus 1 .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... ... .... ....

Small-pox, Erysipelas, Diphtheria and Continued Fever show a decrease, while Enteric Fever and Scarlet Fever show an increase, this being in the case of Scarlet Fever very large. The total number of cases notified was 2,211 (400 in Clapham, 90 in Putney, 481 in Streatham, 245 in Tooting, and 975 in Wandsworth), compared with 1,540 in 1904, 1,735 in 1903, and 2,338 in 1902. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 7.5, compared with 5.8 in 1904, 6.7 in 1903, and 9.5 in 1902.

The increase which commenced in the year 1900 was not continued, as 1904 shows a slight decrease in the percentage of children successfully vaccinated compared with 1903. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and for the vaccination subdistricts for the year 1904, as well as for the ten years preceding. The average for the years 1894-1903 is also given. The increase in the Borough of the percentage of successful vaccinations compared with the preceding ten years was 3.6. In 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Clapham the increase was only .9, in Putney 10.9, in Streatham 2.6, and in Wandsworth 5.0. In the Report for this Borough for 1904, attention was called to the increase in the percentage in Clapham, this year, however, there has been a decided decrease. In the previous Table it will be seen that the total number of children remaining on the books in Clapham as unvaccinated was 311, compared with none in Putney, 50 in Streatham, and 19 in Wandsworth. There are two possible reasons for this, either an increasing objection to vaccination in that part of the Borough, or there must be some laxity in -administration. Putney shows a slight falling off from the previous year, but is still very much above the decennial average. Streatham shows a slight improvement, although the rates are still low, while Wandsworth, with a percentage of 82'8 successfully vaccinated, shows an increase of l.l compared with 1903. The percentage of successful vaccinations in this Borough still compares favourably with the rest of London and with the whole of England. In the Local Government Board's returns for the year 1902 the rate for London was 67.9, and for England and Wales 74.8 per cent. 602 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 8.6, compared with 8.3 in 1903. Of the remaining 1,242 infants, 31 or .4 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination, 137 or 19.0 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received, 223 or 3.1 per cent. had the vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 1,471 or 6.7 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for, while 380 or 5.4 per cent. remained on the books as unvaccinated. If the number of deaths registered be deducted from the total births, then of the 6,388 surviving infants, 80.5 per cent were successfully vaccinated, compared with 80.4 in 1903; 48 were unsuccessful of vaccination compared with 5 per cent.; 3.4 per cent. were under medical certificate of postponement compared with 3; and 2.1 per cent in regard to whom certificates of conscientious 49 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. objection had been obtained, compared with 1.6; leaving 13.3 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination compared with 14.3. On the whole the condition as regards vaccination compares favourably with previous years, with the exception of Clapham, where there has been a decided falling off in this respect. TABLE XXX.

Scarlet Fever. 1,494 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 744 in 1904, 822 in 1903, and 1,063 in 1902. 267 of these were notified from Clapham, 51 from Putney, 292 from Streatham, 177 from Tooting, and 707 from Wandsworth. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1,257, or 84.1 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital where 27 died, and 237, or 15.9 per cent. were treated at home, with one death. The total number of deaths was 28, of which seven belonged to Clapham, none to Putney, seven to Streatham, four to Tooting, and 10 to Wandsworth. There was still a perceptible increase in the percentage of cases removed to hospital compared with former years, the percentage in 1904 being 81.6; in 1903, 78.1; in 1902, 75; and in 1901, 70.6. The case mortality during the year was 1.87 per cent. compared with 1.74 in 1904, and 2.19 in 1903. The mortality among the cases treated at home was .42 per cent. and among those treated in the Fever Hospitals 2.14 per cent. The mortality among hospital-treated patients was thus five times greater than among those treated at home. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 5.1, compared with 2.80 in 1904, 3.2 in 1903, and 4.4 in 1902, and in the County of London 4.1 compared with 2.89, 2.7 and 3.8. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was thus one per 1,000 above that for the whole of London. In the separate sub-districts the annual rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living was as follows for the year and for the three previous years :— TABLE XXXI.

The disease was most prevalent in Clapham during the months of February, March, May, July, August, October and November. A considerable number of cases in February and March were due to a slight outbreak in connection with the Parochial School, Clapham, caused by unrecognised cases attending school while in an infective condition. In this outbreak the first case was notified on the 25th February, followed by another on the 27th and two on the 28th. 14 cases were notified during the month of March, four during April and seven in May. It was not until March 20th that the primary case was discovered as it was only notified on that date. This case was infected by a brother, an adult of 22, who had during the first week of February visited a house in Wandsworth where there was a case of Scarlet Fever, and the first symptons occurred on the 10th February. This patient's sister attended school up till the 17th March, and was in close contact with her brother until she sickened on the 17th March. As far as the school was concerned the outbreak was at an end about the 27th March, and although several cases occurred in April and May these were nearly all subsequent cases and not due to infection at school. The whole of the school was disinfected on the 7th April. During March and April the school was frequently visited and the names and addresses of the absentees taken and their homes visited. In this way several cases were discovered at an early period of the illness. The increase in July and August was also due to unrecognised cases and also to the fact that in one household six and in another five cases occurred. 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Putney the number of cases notified was considerably under the average, the majority of the cases being very mild and no deaths occurred. In Streatham the number of cases was somewhat above the average. The greatest number of cases were notified in the months of March, April, May, September, October and November. In Tootingthe maximum number of cases was notified in November and the minimum in July. The total number was considerably above the average for the previous years. A large proportion of the increase was due to subsequent cases occurring in the same house, and this applied not only to Tooting, but to the whole Borough. In the sub-district of Wandsworth Scarlet Fever was exceedingly prevalent during the whole year. Only in the last month were the notifications under 30. The maximum number of cases occurred in October and the minimum in December. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1905 :— TABLE XXXII. January. February. March. April. May. June. July. August. September.

In February the following report was presented to the Council with reference to the number of cases of Scarlet Fever occurring in the Southfield Ward, Wandsworth :— 15th February, 1905. Re OUTBREAK OF SCARLET FEVER IN WANDSWORTH. During the fortnight ending the 4th February, a considerable number of cases of Scarlet Fever have been notified to me from the Southfield Ward. Careful enquiry has been made into the causation of this outbreak, but it has been impossible to fix upon any particular cause, with the exception of school attendance. Enquiry at the schools show that the children affected were scattered over the various departments and that no special class was affected. The three schools were Merton Road, West Hill and Southfield, and there were also one or two cases from St. Michael's. The curious feature of the outbreak is, however, that several of the cases did not attend school, and the cause of the infection in these could not be ascertained. The Head Teachers of the schools have been interviewed, and were advised to see that no children were allowed to attend school who were suffering from sore throat. I am able to report, that during the past ten days the number of cases have very considerably diminished, and during the last week only one case has so far been notified. Although the influence of school infection was most frequently remarked, yet as will be seen from the number of cases occurring in August, it was not always at work as a cause of the prevalence. The average number of cases per month was 59 nearly, and in July the number of cases notified was 54, in August 61, and in September 48. In April and May the number of cases notified was 149, and a special report was then made to the Council, not only dealing with the school attendance as a cause, but also dealing with milk from a particular dealer as a probable cause of a number of cases. 4th May, 1905. SCARLET FEVER IN WANDSWORTH. Since the commencement of the year Scarlet Fever has been more than usually prevalent in the sub-district of Wandsworth, and chiefly in the Southfield Ward. d 54 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of cases notified to me in the 17 weeks ended the 29th April was 284, 154 of which occurred in the Southfield Ward, 59 in the Fairfield Ward, and 71 in the Springfield Ward. Of the 154 cases in the Southfield Ward, in 101 households there was one case, in 20 households there were two cases in each, in three households there were three cases in each, and in one household there were four cases. In the Fairfield Ward in 36 households there was one case in each, in six households there were two cases in each, in one household there were three cases, and in two households there were four cases in each. In the Springfield Ward in 43 households there was one case in each, in eight households there were two cases in each, and in four households there were three cases in each. A review of the whole circumstances attending the prevalence of this disease shows that it was due to several causes, either school infection, unrecognised and undiagnosed cases, or return of a previous case from the isolation hospital. With regard to the last, the total number of definite return cases was 16, but in the Springfield Ward in February several cases were indirectly infected by a case which had been returned from hospital at the parents' request while the child was still in an infective condition. In the Southfield ward, however, which had a population of 21,924 at the Census of 1901, and an estimated population of 32,380 at the present time, school infection played a considerable part, and the following Table shows the total number of cases during each week and the school attended by the patient:— 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

School the number of cases was 17. In the three weeks ending the 15th April the number of cases in the West Hill School was 13, while the number in Merton Road School was only seven. During the whole period 38 cases occurred in children attending West Hill and 37 among children attending Merton Road. St. Michael's School, which is a small school compared with the other, had also an exceptional incidence, the total number of cases during the same period being n. The greatest prevalence of the disease occurred during the weeks ended the 28th January, 4th and nth February when 47 cases were notified, and during the weeks ending the 1st, 8th and 15th April, when 42 cases were notified. A large diminution took place in the number of cases notified in the week ending the 22nd April, and a still greater diminution in the week ending the 29th April, during the latter week only three cases being notified. Every precaution was taken by the teachers of the schools to exclude children who were suffering from any slight illness, and the cases were removed to hospital promptly and the disinfection of the premises carried out quickly and efficiently. One special and interesting feature in this prevalence of Scarlet Fever was the fact that 15 of the cases in Southfield Ward and five in the Putney Ward were due in all probability to infection by means of milk. The first of these cases was notified on the 31st March, followed by one on the 3rd April, two on the 7th, six on the 8th, two on the 9th, four on the 10th, two on the nth, one on the 12th, and one on the 18th. Inquiry into the date of the first symptoms of these cases elicited the fact that all the patients sickened from the 31st March to the 8th April, and in all, with one exception, the first symptons appeared between the 4th and the 8th April. My attention was directed to the milk supply as being the presumable cause of infection on the 9th April when a case was notified, the father of the patient being employed as a distributor of milk by a firm in the locality. This man was employed not only as a distributor Chart showing the number of cases of Enteric Fever notified during — each week of the year 1905. — 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of milk but also as an assistant to the manager, and took some part in filling the various churns for distribution by other men in the firm's employ. The manager of the company was interviewed at once and information was obtained from him as to the source of this milk supply. The Medical Officers of Health of the districts where the farms are situated were communicated with and information was received from them to the effect that no cases of Scarlet Fever had been notified to them in these districts for some considerable time. My attention was then directed to the possible spread of the disease by the distributor, who maybe called No.1. and it was found that out of the 18 households affected this particular distributor directly supplied eight, and that in all probability he came into contact with the milk supply of the other consumers. The houses of all the other distributors were visited and careful enquiries were made as to any illness, but in every case the men themselves and their families were found to be in good health. I advised the manager of the firm not to allow No.1 distributor to resume work for a fortnight and in the meantime he was advised to have his personal clothing disinfected and also to be personally cleansed. No case occurred in which the first symptoms appeared after the 8th April, so that in all probability the infection only existed from about the 29th March to the 5th or 6th of April. It was not without some reluctance that I concluded that this man was the cause of infection as it has hitherto been believed that infection by means of an intermediary is almost impossible. One explanation may be that this man suffered from sore throat or even without suffering from this that he was carrying about the germs of the disease and in this way infected the milk. A large proportion of these cases occurred among persons not connected with the Board Schools and one extraordinary feature was that four of the cases were domestic servants. I am pleased to report that the manager of the dairy company was most willing to carry out all my instructions and did so at once. P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the latter part of the year and especially during the months of October, a number of cases were notified from the Royal Patriotic Asylum. In all 51 cases were notified, one in May, two in August, five in September, 35 in October, five in November, and three in December. All these cases were at once removed to the Fever Hospital and the bedding thoroughly disinfected. In November 21 of the dormitories were fumigated, and this to some extent lessened the outbreak, as only five cases were notified in that month and three in December. The disease was spread in all probability by means of articles of clothing which were not sent to be disinfected by steam ; these articles having been kept back by the pupils and not being the property of the Institution itself. The disease was of a very mild type, no death having so far occurred among the cases notified. The death-rate per 1,000 living was .09, compared with .05 ill 1904, and .07 in 1903, while the rate for the whole of London was .09, compared with .08 in 1904, and .07 in 1903 The chart shows that this disease was exceptionally prevalent, and that there were five apices, one in January, one in April, one in May, one in August, and one in October. The greatest number of notifications received was in the first week of October, and this was due to the number of cases notified from the Royal Patriotic Asylum. The smallest number was received in the last week of July. On five occasions the number of cases per week was above 40 and on eight below 20, the average number per week during the year having been 28.7, compared with 15 in 1904, 16 in 1903, and 20 in 1902. Of the total number of cases notified, viz., 1,494, 12 or .8 per cent. were under one year of age, compared with 12 or 1.5 per cent. in 1904; 357 or 23.9 per cent. from one to five years, compared with 205 59 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. or 26.5 per cent.; 937 or 62.7 per cent. from five to 15 years, compared with 444 or 57.4 per cent.; 129 or 8.6 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, compared with 80 or 10.3 per cent.; and 59 or 4.0 per cent. rom 25 to 65, compared with 33 or 4.3 per cent. There has thus been a considerable increase at school age, from five to 15 years, in the percentage of cases notified and a diminution at all other ages compared with the previous year. Diphtheria. The number of cases of this disease notified shows a satisfactory decrease compared with 1904 and the decennial average. The following Table shows the number of cases notified, and the number of deaths that occurred in the separate sub-districts and in the whole borough for the years 1895-1904 inclusive, the average for these 10 years, and the number of cases notified in 1905:— TABLE XXXIII.

The number of cases notified during 1905 was 348, compared with 406 in 1904, and 532 in 1903. This is the smallest number of cases since the year 1896 and it is 147 under the uncorrected and 290 under the corrected decennial average. In Clapham there has been an increase of 20, in Putney a decrease of two, in Streatham a decrease of 34, in Tooting a decrease of three and in Wandsworth a decrease of 39 compared with 1904. Compared with the uncorrected average there has been a considerable decrease in all the sub-districts with the exception of Tooting, where there has been an increase of four. The largest number of cases occurred in Streatham and the smallest in Putney. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 1.21 compared with 1.38 for the whole of London. 276 or 79.3 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital where 22 died, and 72 or 20.7 per cent. were treated at home with nine deaths. The case mortality was 8.9 per cent., compared with 10.8 in 1904, 9.7 in 1903, and 10.7 per cent. in 1902. The case mortality for the whole of London was 8.5 per cent., compared with 10 per cent, in 1904, 9.7 per cent. in 1903, and 10.7 per cent. in 1902. The case mortality among the hospital-treated cases was 7.9 per cent. and among those treated at home 12.5 per cent. In 1904 the mortality of the home-treated cases was lower than of the cases treated in hospital, but in 1902 and 1903 it was higher, similar to what has occurred in the year under review. The following Table shows the number of cases, the case-rate per 1,000 living for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the Borough as well as for the separate sub-districts:— 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The highest case-rate was in Tooting and the lowest in Putney. The rate in Clapham was higher in 1905 than in 1904, but it was still 1.29 under the decennial average. Compared with the whole of London the case-rate is .17 lower, while in 1904 it was only .06 lower and in 1903 .44 higher. The death-rate for 1905 was only .11 per 1,000 ( .08 in Clapham, .17 in Putney, .08 in Streatham, .26 in Tooting, and .09 in Wandsworth). This rate was lowest in Clapham and highest in Tooting. In 1904 this rate was .16 per 1,000 and in the whole of London .12, and .16 in 1904. The death-rate for the Borough is .14 lower than the decennial average; the only sub-district showing a higher rate than the decennial being Tooting, but even in this sub-district the increase was only .01 per 1,000. There has been considerable reduction in the mortality in Clapham and Wandsworth, the difference between the decennial average and the rate for 1905 being, in Clapham and Wandsworth .19 per 1,000. 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases was notified in the first week of October when 16 cases were notified, and the minimum in the fourth week in April and the third week in May, when no cases were notified. With the exception of the increased prevalence of the disease in March and October the amount of Diphtheria in the Borough was much under the average. The slight increase in March was chiefly due to the occurrence of cases in South Streatham and chiefly in connection with Mitcham Lane Board School. Three cases had been notified in January in connection with this school, three in February, and eight in Marcln As an outbreak similar to what occurred in that neighbourhood was feared I communicated with the Medical Officer, London County Council Education Department, and on the 15th March the Infants' Department was inspected and 44 cultures were taken. Among these one was found to have the Diphtheria bacillus present and he was at once excluded, as were also two other children, cultures from whom gave suspicious results. Only one case was notified in April and one in May, while in June, July, August and September no cases occurred. The increase in September and October was not confined to any particular sub-district or school, but was general all over the borough. In October 12 cases were notified from Clapham, five from Putney, 18 from Streatham, seven from Tooting, and 12 from Wandsworth, a total of 54, and of these 22 were not in attendance at any school. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the schools in the Borough :— 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXV. SCHOOLS. January. February.

Of the total number of cases notified 33 were incorrectly •diagnosed, leaving a total of 312, compared with 347 in 1904. Of these 312 cases, 148 or 47.4 per cent. were not attending school, compared with 43 per cent. in 1904; while 164 or 52.6 per cent, were at school, compared with 53 per cent. in 1904. Only 13 cases occurred in connection with private schools, and nine were in attendance at schools outside the Borough. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria notified, 119 or 34.2 per cent. occurred among children under five years of age, 175 or 50.2 per cent. from five to 15 years, and 54 or 15.6 per cent. over 15 years. Of the 276 cases removed to Hospital 33 were reported to be not suffering from Diphtheria. Drainage defects, etc., were found in 41 of the houses in which cases of Diphtheria occurred. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 51 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 17 in 1904, and 50 in 1903. There were no return cases of Diphtheria as was the case also in 1904, while in 1903 there were n. 15 of the cases were from Clapham, oue from Putney, 10 from Streatham, nine from Tooting, and 16 from Wandsworth. Nine of the cases occurred in three households in Clapham, three in each, and four in one household in Tooting. The following Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of the return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms in the subsequent cases, and the number of days elapsing between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There has been this year a large increase in the actual number of return cases as also in the percentage to total cases notified. In 1904 the number of cases was only 17 and the percentage to total cases 1.4, while in 1905 the numbers were 51 and 3.4. The average duration in hospital of these 51 cases was nearly 60 days, compared with 56 days in 1904 and 54 in 1903. In 11 of the cases it was noted by the parent that the child when it returned had a discharge from nose or ear and in six that there was slight desquamation. In the others the children were reported by the parents to have been in good health when discharged from hospital. In 13 cases information was received from the hospital authorities that the patient was to be discharged while suffering from chronic discharge from ear or nose, but no return cases resulted. 67 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

ENTERIC FEVER. 96 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year—17 from Clapham, seven from Putney, 16 from Streatham, 12 from Tooting, and 44 from Wandsworth—compared with a total of 74 in 1904. 53 of the cases were removed to Hospital, where seven died; and 38 were treated at home, with four deaths. The total number of deaths was 11—one in Clapham, one in Putney, two in Streatham, one in Tooting, and six in Wandsworth— compared with 11 in 1904 and 19 in 1903. It is also 13.8 under the corrected decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .33 compared with .27 in 1904 and .41 in 1903, and with .33 for the whole of London. The case mortality was 11.4 per cent. for this Borough, and 15.8 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from fever was .04 per 1,000, compared with .04 in 1904, and .07 in 1903; while the rate for all London was .05, compared with .06 in 1904, and .08 in 1903. The death-rate in the separate sub-districts was as follows:— Clapham .01, Putney.03, Streatham .02, Tooting .04, and Wandsworth .07 per 1,000. Of the 58 cases removed to hospital, 15 were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever. The chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. Special enquiry was made in every case to ascertain if any definite cause could be discovered, and in 40 of the 81 actual known cases some probable cause of infection was found, the details of which are as follows:— In 12 the infection was probably due to eating shellfish, in five to watercress, in 10 the disease was ccyitracted outside the Borough (two e 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. in Ireland, four abroad, and four in other parts of England), while 13 were infected by previous cases. With reference to the cases probably infected by eating shellfish, two were from oysters, three from mussels, three from winkles, one from cockles, one from whelks, and two from shrimps. One of the cases from eating mussels proved fatal, but all the others recovered. The following are the particulars of the 12 cases:— (1.) E. R., notified on the 9th September. Had oysters at Rhyl^. North Wales. This patient went to Rhyl in July and returned on the 1 st September. The first symptoms occurred about the 28th August, before returning to London. (2.) H. A., notified on the 28th December. Had oysters regularly from the 24th November up to 9th December from a shop in Vauxhall, but the original source of the oysters could not be ascertained. The first symptoms appeared about the 18th December. (3.) W. P., notified on the 1st March. Had mussels about two weeks before first symptoms of illness appeared. This patient was a 'bus conductor and had nearly all his food away from home. No information could be ascertained as to place of purchase of mussels. (4.) E. M., notified on the 4th August. Frequently ate mussels obtained from peripatetic vendors. This case proved fatal. (5.) M. P., notified on the 13th October. Had mussels about two weeks before first symptoms appeared. These were purchased from a coster's stall. (6.) R. P., notified on the 25th August. Was in the habit of having winkles nearly every Sunday, purchased from peripatetic vendors. (7.) M.S., notified on the 30th August. Had winkles at Gorlestou a fortnight before the first symptoms appeared. (8.) M. B., notified on the 23rd October. Had winkles a week before the date of first symptoms. These were also purchased from a 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. vendor in the street. The name of the vendor was unknown to the purchaser. (9.) T. R., notified 011 the 30th August. Had cockles at Southend on the 7th August and the first symptoms appeared on the 20th August. Southend cockles have had such a bad reputation that there was no difficulty in coming to a definite conclusion in this case. (10.) J. M., notified on the nth September. Had whelks about a fortnight before onset of the disease, purchased from a coster. (11.) T. P., notified on the 7th October. Had shrimps on the 26th August at Ramsgate. This patient was at Ramsgate on that date with M. R. who lived in the Borough, and M. R. was also removed to hospital suffering from Enteric Fever on the 12th September. (12.) E. P., notified on the 18th September. Had shrimps on the 23rd August at Ramsgate. The first symptoms appeared about the 10th September, but she continued at work till she was removed to hospital on the 18th September. In all the five cases where watercress was suspected it was purchased from itinerant vendors., and further enquiry showed that it had in two cases been grown at watercress beds just outside the Borough. The water from this bed h?d been examined by the officials of the London County Council and unfavourably reported on. With reference to the cases contracted outside the Borough and abroad it was impossible in the majority of the cases to obtain any definite history of infection, although (with the exception of one case infected in Germany and one in Italy) enquiries were made from the Medical Officer of Health of the localities from which the patient had come. Of the 13 cases infected by previous cases seveu occurred among members of the same family and their relatives, infected by the same original case. This outbreak occurred in Tooting and the cases were not notified until I personally visited the house on the 30th January. On that date I was asked by the medical man in attendance to see 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. this family with him, and I found that the mother and three children were suffering from a typical attack of Enteric Fever, and that a boy of 14 also had the disease, but that he had been ill since the first week in December, 1904. As the patients had no proper attendance and as the father was a man in poor circumstances I advised immediate removal to hospital. The mother was so ill that she died shortly after admission, but the four children recovered. On the 20th February the father was notified and removed to hospital where he also died. On the 18th February a niece of the last patient was also notified and on the 23rd another niece was also notified. These two patients had been residing at the uncle's house when the first case occurred, and were also infected by him. Both these cases recovered. The original case was a boy of 14 and it was impossible to ascertain where this patient contracted the disease. It was suspected, however, that the infection was due to shellfish as he has been in the habit of going with costers who occasionally sold mussels and winkles. This case was originally diagnosed as Influenza, but owing to the poverty of the parents the medical attendant only saw the case a few times, and it was not until the parish doctor was called in when the other members of the family had been infected that the true nature of the complaint was discovered. Six other casts were infected by previous cases and all recovered Two of these cases occurred in one household. In every case the drains of the houses were tested, but only in five was any result obtained from the test. In three other cases slight sanitary defects were noted, but in all the others the sanitary conditions were satisfactory. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. During the year information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals that the patients removed to hospital were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease in 97 cases, compared with 94 in 1904, and 106 in 1903. Of the 1,861 cases of Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever and Enteric Fever removed to hospital the diagnosis in 97, or 5.2 per cent. was incorrect. In 1904 this percentage was 10, and in 1903 9.5. 73 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Enteric Fever still shows a higher percentage of error in diagnosis than the other two diseases, but Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, especially the latter, show a decrease. The following Table shows the number of cases of mistaken diagnosis from these three diseases in the several sub-districts and for the whole Borough, as well as the percentage of error TABLE XXXVII. Disease. No. of cases of mistaken diagnosis. Total. Total cases removed. Percentage of error in Diagnosis. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandswoith. Scarlet Fever 10 1 13 5 20 49 1257 3.9 Diphtheria 1 ... 16 2 14 33 276 11.9 Enteric Fever ... ... 2 1 12 15 58 25.8 Total 11 1 31 8 46 97 1861 5.2 In 1904 the percentage of cases of mistaken diagnosis for the whole of London was, for Scarlet Fever 6.7, compared with seven in 1903; for Diphtheria i6.1, compared with 14.7; and for Enteric Fever 25.9, compared with 24.2. In the Annual Report of the Statistical Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for 1904 it is stated that out of the total of 806 cases of Scarlet Fever wrongly certified, there were 120 of Measles, 130 of Rubella, 106 of Tonsilitis, 157 of Erythema, 84 had no obvious disease, and 86 were not diagnosed. Of the 904 cases wrongly certified as Diphtheria there were 64 of Measles, 614 of Tonsilitis, 14 had no obvious disease, and five were not diagnosed. Out of the 268 cases wrongly certified as Enteric Fever there were 17 of Influenza, 12 of general Tuberculosis, 47 of Pneumonia, 10 had no obvious disease, and three were not diagnosed. It is also stated that these cases were detained in hospital on an average for 25-18 days. / 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Some discussion has taken place with reference to these wrongly certified cases, but it is not in my opinion an unsatisfactory report. In very many of the cases the patients are seen under most disadvantageous circumstances and probably seen only once or twice by the medical practitioner. It is obvious that the prompt removal of even suspicious cases is desirable in the interests of public health, as serious results might ensue if cases were not removed until an absolutelv certain diagnosis was arrived at by the medical practitioner. In the medical supplement, Dr. Turner, at page 314, states that out of 735 cases of Scarlet Fever 538 weie diagnosed as such in the receiving room, but one case was found not to be Scarlet Fever, while in 197 cases the diagnosis was doubtful. This gives a percentage of 27 in which a diagnosis could not be arrived at on first examination, compared with 3.9 per cent. errors in diagnosis in the Borough in the case of this disease. With reference to Diphtheria the case is even worse. Out of 551 cases notified in only 317 was Diphtheria diagnosed in the receiving room, while in 234 or 42 per cent, of the cases the diagnosis was doubtful. This does not compare favourably with the 11.9 per cent. of error in diagnosis of cases removed to hospital in this Borough. Errors in diagnosis in Diphtheria could, however, be largely minimised if practitioners would avail themselves more of the culture test, and it is possible that the decrease in the number of cases of errors in diagnosis in this Borough was due to the increased use of this method. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 174 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 121 in 1904, 125 in 1903, 78 in 1902, and 66 in 1901. the following Table shows the number in the separate subdistricts and for 'the whole Borough, also the disease for which the examination was made and the result of such examination:— 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In 51 out of 142 examinations for the Diphtheria bacillus the result was positive, and in 20 out of 32 examinations of blood in suspected cases of Enteric Fever the Widal re-action was obtained. Puerperal Fever. 18 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 14 in 1904, and 13 in 1903. Three of the cases occurred in Claphain, none in Putney, four in Streatham, four in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. Eight of the cases (one in Clapham, three in Streatham, three in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth), or 44.4 per cent. were fatal, compared with 357 per cent. in 1904. Four of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary and two deaths occurred. The death-rate was .028 per 1,000, compared with .013 in 1904, and .024 in 1903. 7 6 Report oj the Medical Officer of Health. In all the cases notified the nurses in attendance were informed that no further cases were to be attended by them for six weeks, and that their clothing, instruments, etc., would be disinfected. In every case this was carried out. Erysipelas. 253 cases of this disease were notified and 14 deaths occurred. 48 of the cases and five of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 14 cases and no deaths in Putney, 48 cases and five deaths in Streatham, 31 cases and no deaths in Tooting, and 112 cases and four deaths in Wandsworth. In 1904 the number of cases notified was 267, and the number of deaths 13. 48 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, where nine deaths occurred. Measles. The total number of deaths from this disease was 89, 46 of males and 43 of females, compared with 104 in 1904. 16 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 27 in Putney, 14 in Streatham, six in Tooting, and 26 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 15 less than last year, and 1813 under the corrected decennial average. 15 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 68 of children from one to five years, and six from five to fifteen years. The death-rate was .31 per 1,000, compared with .38 in 1904, and .43 in 1903. The death-rate for the whole of London was .36, compared with .49 in 1904. During the year 1,175 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Measles, 302 in Clapham, 2C2 injPutney, 286 in Streatham, 196 in Tooting, and 216 in Wandsworth. 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Cards were left at each house so that the Sanitary Authority might be informed when the case or cases ha4 recovered so that the necessary disinfection could be carried out. The next Table shows the number of premises disinfected after Measles iu each sub-district for each month of the year. The increase in March was due to the number of cases in Putney, but this increase in that sub-district did not continue, as only 22 premises were disinfected in April and 1.3 in May in that sub-district. In August only 22 and in September only 10 premises were disinfected, this being due to the fact that during these months very few cases were notified from the public elementary schools. In this Table it will also be noted that the maximum number of cases occurred in Clapham in October, in Putney in March, in Streatham in November, in Tooting in December, and in Wandsworth in January.

Table XL. shows the number of cases of Measles and other nonnotifiable diseases, notified by the teachers in the public elementary schools in the Borough. In all 3,352 cases were notified, compared with 2,291 in 1904 and 3,083 in 1903. 1,207 of these were cases of Measles, 556 of Chicken-pox, 576 of Whooping Cough, 751 of Mumps, and 262 of Ringworm. There was a decrease in the number of cases of Measles notified, but an increase in the number of cases of all the other diseases. Mumps shows a very large increase, due chiefly to an extensive outbreak in Tooting, where 372 out of a total of 752 cases occurred. With regard to Measles, 413 were notified from schools in Clapham, 130 in Putney, 254 in Streatham, 157 in Tooting, and 253 in Wandsworth. 79 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL.

The greatest increase occurred in Clapham and Wandsworth. 33 of the deaths were of Infants under one year, 40 of children from one to five years, and two from five to 15 years. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate was .26 per 1,000, compared with -i8 in 1904, and with '32 for the whole of London. There was a very large increase in the number of cases notified from the elementary schools, 576 having been notified, compared with .163 in 1904, and 428 in 1903. With regard to both Measles and Whooping Cough the greatest number of deaths occur under five years of age. From these two diseases out of a total of 164 deaths, 156 or 95 per cent., occurred in children under five years of age. The order of the London County Council with regard to Measles should in my opinion, be extended to Whooping Cough also. It is quite a common experience to see children suffering from this disease playing in public places, and the extension of the order to this disease would effectually put a stop to this dangerous condition of things. Epidemic Influenza. 41 deaths were caused by Influenza, 22 of Males and 19 of females, a decrease of 16 compared with 1904, and of 53 2 compared with the corrected decennial average. Seven of the deaths occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, 18 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .14 per 1,000, compared with '22 in 1904, .15 in 1903, and '38 in 1902. 17 of these deaths were of persons from 25 to 65, and 18 of persons over 65 years of age. Diarrhoea. The total number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis was 137, compared with 208 in 1904 and 96 in 1903. There is thus a considerable decrease compared with the previous years, and there is also a decrease of 53-4 compared with the corrected decennial average. 24 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, 22 in .Streatham, 32 in Tooting, and 57 in Wandsworth. There was a 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. decrease in each of ihe sub-districts compared with the year 1904, but this was marked in the Putney sub-district, where only two deaths occurred, compared with 24 in the previous year. The death-rate was 147 per 1,000, compared with 79 in 1904. The death-rate for the whole of London was 72, compared with 103 in 1904. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows :—Clapham -37, Putney '07, Streatham .25, Tooting 1.38, and Wandsworth -69. In each of the five sub-districts there has been a decided fall in this rate with the exception of Tooting, where the fall is only '09 per 1,000. Of the total number of deaths registered, 120 or 87 per cent. were of infants under one year. Including Enteritis the total number of deaths was 203, compared with 301 in 1904 and 162 in 1903. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under one year of age, for the four quarters for 1905 and the four previous years.

The number of deaths from both these diseases shows a decrease of 54 compared with the year 1904 during the third quarter, and a decrease of 74 during the whole year. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis and Enteritis under one year represents 211 per cent. of the total mortality at that age, compared with 28.8 per cent. in 1904, so that there has been a considerable reduction. Cpecial enquiries were made in the case of 131 of the deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, and the following Table shows the methods of feeding the infants who died.

In other six cases the mother's milk was supplemented by cows' milk. In 78, or 82.9 per cent. of the deaths, cows' milk, either alone or with some other food, was used, while in 28, or 22.5 per cent., condensed milk alone, or in combination with farinaceous food, was used. A special effort has been made duriDg the year under consideration to do something to lessen the infantile mortality from this and other causes, and for this purpose another female Sanitary Inspector was appointed, in accordance with the report of the Public Health Committee. In 1905 a considerable number of visits have been paid by the two female inspectors to houses where births have occurred, and enquiries made as to the method of feeding. Advice was given to those requiring it as to the proper methods, and the circular which was included in last year's Report was left in every case. As these Inspectors were brought into direct contact with the mothers I considered it advisable that they should specially report to me on the matter, and their report was as follows:— "We beg to submit our report on the visits paid to mothers with regard to the feeding of Infants. As it was a new phase of work there were naturally difficulties to surmount; but on the whole we have been well received, and in many instances our visits and revisits have been warmly welcomed. During the Diarrhcea epidemic in July, August and September we were frequently asked to visit infants who were not on our list of births, and our advice to these mothers was followed by beneficial results. Table I subjoined shows the number of visits we paid after notification of birth, the method of feeding, and the number of those visited who died during the year. The ineffectual visits mentioned are due to the migratory character of the population in the poorer districts. In many instances the family had removed immediately after the registration of the birth—a contingency which might not arise were earlier registration compulsory. In some cases false addresses were given, and in others we frequently called two or three times before finding the mothers at home. fY//Yt /Ycss/A /r/ //' /j «ey-* A5!C%%" / ISSSic /9CS v/icZ-ttsCve. . »5 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table II. shows the number of infants visited a second time and the method of feeding then found, the average age at the second visit being from six to eight months. Of the three infants re-visited in Clapham, one was still breastfed, another was weaned and being fed according to the directions in the pamphlet, and the third aged eight months, was having biscuits. Of the five re-visited in Putney, two were still breast-fed, one was weaned and was being fed according to the pamphlet, and one was having Nestle's Milk. In Streatham 13 were re-visited; of these two only were weaned, one of whom was having Nestle's milk, and the other farinaceous food. In Tooting 39 were breast-fed, condensed milk and farinaceous food having been discontinued in three instances. In 18 cases there was no change of food, in eight unsuitable foods have been discontinued. 26 infants were being fed partly on the breast supplemented by cows' milk, or wholly on cows' milk according to the pamphlet. Only two Wards in Wandsworth, viz., Fairfield and Springfield were systematically visited. The infants chosen for a second visit in these wards were chiefly those who were being improperly fed at the first call, as time did not permit of the re-visiting of many owing to the number of births notified, hence the fall in the percentage of those breast-fed. Of the 30 re-visited in the Fairfield Ward, 15 were entirely breastfed, condensed milk and farinaceous food having been discontinued in four cases. In 10 instances no change had been made, and in five the child was being fed partly on the breast supplemented by cows' milk in lieu of condensed milk. Of the 43 re-visited in the Springfield Ward, 28 were entirely breast-fed, in five cases farinaceous food having been discontinued. In four instances no change had been made in the method of feeding, in four the child was being fed partly on the breast supplemented by cows' milk or wholly on cows' milk according to the pamphlet, condensed milk and farinaceous food having been discontinued. e 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. To some houses further visits were paid (17 in number), in the hope of persuading the mother to discontinue unsuitable food; in most instances we were successful. We found, that as a rule, the weaning of the infant was necessitated by the malnutrition of the mothers, or by their having to go out to work themselves owing to the lack of employment among the men. In certain parts of the Borough midwives are largely employed. Of the 24 mothers visited in Clapham, three employed registered and three non-registered midwives. In Putney 20 mothers were visited, of these seven employed registered and five non-registered midwives. In Streatham of the 86 mothers visited 23 employed midwives, viz., 16 registered and seven non-registered. In Tooting, of the 368 mothers visited 70 employed midwives, 53 being registered and 17 non-registered. In the Fairfield Ward of Wandsworth 208 mothers were visited; 72 employing midwives, 31 being registered and 41 non-registered. In the Southfield Ward of the 16 mothers visited five employed registered and three non-registered midwives. In the Springfield Ward 326 mothers were visited; of these 148 employed midwives, 109 being registered and 39 non-registered. Visiting these homes enabled us to discover and have remedied many sanitary defects. In Clapham defects were remedied in six houses, in Putney two, in Streatham seven, in Tooting 28, and in Wandsworth 72 (Fairfield 28, Springfield 42, Southfield 2). We feel that in many instances our advice to the mothers has been of real value, and has helped them to a better knowledge of the duties of motherhood." 87 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In these Wards the infantile mortality has always been greatest and it was hoped that greater good would ensue by limiting the work to these Wards. 89 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all 1,048 visits were made and on the first visit of the Inspectors it was found that 790, or 75.4 per cent. were breast-fed only, while 250, or 24.6 per cent. were otherwise fed. The first visit was generally made when the infant was about two months old, when the percentage of breast-fed children would be near the maximum. If, however, we take the cases in which the child was breast-fed but other foods given in addition, we find that the percentage increases from 75.4 to 89.2. 58 or 5.5 per cent. were fed on cows' milk only, but 17 had in addition some kind of food, raising the percentage to 7.3. 22 had condensed milk only and 10 had condensed milk and food, a total of 32, or 3 per cent., while four infants were fed on farinaceous food only. 34 of these children died, and 311 ineffectual visits were made. The number of ineffectual visits inade shows the migratory habits of the people in the selected areas. In a considerable number of these cases the parents had removed shortly after the birth of the child, and their residences could not be ascertained. In several cases wrong addresses were given to the Registrar, and these were forwarded to him to deal with. With reference to Table XLIV, which shows the number of cases re-visited, it may be here stated that 110 comparison can be made between the numbers found to be breast-fed in this and the previous Table, as a large proportion of the second visits were made in cases where it was known that the children were otherwise fed to ascertain if the instructions previously given with regard to feeding had been carried out by the mother. In the three selected areas 170 infants were re-visited. 109 of these were breast-fed when first visited, and at the second visit, made when the child was from six to eight months old, 82 were still breastfed. Of the 27 infants whose diet had been altered, and in the majority of cases, the mothers were following the directions given on the circular published in last year s Report. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It has been found a very difficult matter to eradicate from the mother's mind the idea that farinaceous food is suitable food for infants. In some of the cases the Inspectors were entirely successful, but in others it was found on the second visit that in spite of the advice given such food was being used. On the whole I am able to report that in my opinion much good work has been done, and I feel certain that a continuance of the methods advised in my Report for 1904, and carried out this year, will prove most beneficial to the mothers, and will tend to lessen the mortality of infants from improper feeding. The following Table shows the death-rate from Zymotic Diseases for the Borough for the year as well as for the three previous years. TABLE XLV.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer and other malignant diseases during the year 1905 was 224, 95 of males and 129 of females, a decrease of 18 compared with 1904, and of 11 compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The corrected death-rate was .78, compared with .92 in 1904, .98 in 1903, and .90 in 1902.

With regard to Tubercular Disease of the Lungs, the rates in Clapham, Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth are somewhat under, while in Putney the rate is higher than in 1904. The rate in Clapham, which in 1904 had increased from .93 to 1.24, was in 1905 only .95, a satisfactory reduction. The rate for other Tubercular Diseases is .17 lower than in 1904 and .26 lower than in 1903. This rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, and the rate for Tubercular Disease of the Lungs was lowest in Streatham and highest in Wandsworth. The chart shows the death-rate per 10,000 from 1885 to 1905. It is satisfactory to notice that the reduction in this rate has, on the whole, been considerable. 95 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tubercular Diseases of the Lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year, as well as for the preceding ten years.

Out of the total of 150 males who died the occupation of 129 is definitely stated, and, as has been the case in previous years, labourers and clerks head the list. There has, however, been a decided decrease in the numbers, for in 1904 35 labourers died, whereas in 1905 the number was only 15. Among females, 107 out of 116 had no occupation, while, of the other nine, five were domestic servants, one a music teacher, one a shop assistant, and two were dressmakers. Voluntary Notification of Consumption During the year 104 cases of Consumption were notified by medical practitioners—two from Clapham, none from Putney, eight from Streatham, eight from Tooting, and 86 from Wandsworth, compared with a total of 118 in 1904 and 88 in 1903. One of the cases was under one year, four from one to five years, seven from five to 15 years, 14 from 15 to 25 years, and 78 from 25 to 65 years. In 67 of the cases notified enquiries were made by the Inspectors and the circular issued by this Council was left in each case. 21 of the cases were notified from the Workhouse, two from Common Lodging-houses, one from the Royal Patriotic Asylum, one had no home and was removed to the Union Infirmary, and one removed from the Borough before a visit could be made. In 11 of the cases no enquiry was made, as the patients were being advised by their own medical attendant. Of these 104 cases 28 died during the year, while of the cases notified in 1903 and 1904 which were still on the register, 26 in number, nine died in 1905. Deducting the cases in and removed to the Union Infirmary, the cases which have recovered, and also those removed to other places, there still remain under observation 57 cases.

Nine of the inquests were on persons who died in the Tooting Bec Asylum, seven in H.M. Prison, four in the Middlesex County Asylum, one in the Grove Fever Hospital, one in the Hostel of God, and eight who died in other places, as in the River Thames, and on the streets. The following Table shows the number of Inquests held on residents in the Borough who died outside the Borough. The large number in which a verdict of accidental death was returned is due to the fact that cases of accident are often removed from this Borough to a general hospital where the Inquest is held if the case proves fatal.

Compared with 1904, the analyses show that there has been some improvement in the quality of the water supplied, only in one month, viz., November, in both supplies, was the water characterised as of fair quality by the examiner. The Lambeth District supply showed that in November the free ammonia was .001 parts per 100,000 ; in the Southwark district, .003; while in this month the albuminoid ammonia, and the oxygen required to oxidise at 80° F. and at 122° F. were also high. This deterioration in the supply was due to the floods in the river Thames. In December also the albuminoid ammonia and the oxygen consumed were high in both supplies, due to the same cause. The Metropolitan Water Board during the year appointed an officer to examine and report on the chemical and bacteriological condition of the London water, and these reports, although of a very technical characler, are most complete. The Examiner reported that with regard to the Lambeth supply in November, only on one occasion was the number of microbes per c.c. above 100, while with regard to the Southwark supply on five occasions the number of microbes per c.c. was above 100, on one occasion reaching 580. In the month of December in both supplies the water, from a bacteriological point of view showed improvement, as no sample taken contained 100 microbes per c.c. With regard to the Bacillus Coli test, in November the results showed that in the Southwark supply 56 per cent. of the samples gave a negative result in 100 c.c. of water, in 22.6 per cent. a positive result was obtained in 100 c.c., in 19.1 per cent. in 10 c.c., in 1.1 per cent. in 1 c.c., and in 1.1 per cent. in .1 c.c. The Lambeth supply in the same month gave a negative result in 57.6 per cent., a positive result was obtained in 25.4 per cent, in 100 c.c., in 13.5 per cent. in 10 c.c., and in 3.4 per cent. in 1 c.c. In December in the Southwark supply 36.6 per cent. of the samples gave a negative result, a positive result was obtained in 43.6 per cent. in 100 c.c.,in 16.9 per cent. in 10 c.c., and in 2.8 per cent. in 1 c.c. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Lambeth supply in the same month gave a negative result in 60.9 per cent., a positive result was obtained in 29.5 per cent. in 100 c.c., and in 9.6 per cent. in 10 c.c. As a contrast 100 per cent., or all the samples, of the Kent water in the same months gave a negative result in 100 c.c. Cutting-off Notices. During the year 84 notices were received from the Water Board, stating that the water supply had been cut off. 38 of these notices referred to premises in the Lambeth District supply, and 46 in the Southwark District supply. 15 of these premises were in Clapham, 14 in Putney, 21 in Streatham, eight in Tooting,. and 26 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 35 premises, for defects from 25 premises, in 23 the premises were empty, and in one the cause of the supply being withdrawn was not stated. Mortuaries. No change has taken place in the four Mortuaries during the year. In Clapham 38 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, in Streatham 52, in Tooting 17, and in Wandsworth 81, of which 21 were from Putney, a total of 188, compared with 197 in 1904. The plans for the new Mortuary at Wandsworth are in course of preparation, and it is probable that in 1906 the erection of this Mortuary will be proceeded with. During the year new by-laws and regulations were prepared with respect to the Mortuaries in the Borough and submitted to the Council. The by-laws were confirmed by the Local Government Board in November, 1905, and are as follows :- 111 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. BY-LAWS made by the mayor, aldermen, and councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth with respect to the Management of Mortuaries in the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. 1. Throughout these By-laws the expression "the Council" means the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. 2. Every person who, in pursuance of permission obtained from the Council, has caused the body of one who has died of an infectious disease to be deposited in the Mortuary, shall cause the body to be removed therefrom for the purpose of interment within a period of three days from the date of death. Provided that if an inquest is about to be held or is being held on the body, such person shall not cause the body to be removed except with the authority or on the certificate of the Coroner, but such person shall cause the body to be removed within twenty-four hours after the issue of such authority or certificate. 3. Every person who, in pursuance of permission obtained from the Council, has caused the body of one who has died of a noninfectious disease to be deposited in the Mortuary, shall cause the body to be removed therefrom for the purpose of interment within a period of five days from the date of death. Provided that if an inquest is about to be held or is being held on the body, such person shall not cause the body to be removed except with the authority or on the certificate of the Coroner, but such person shall cause the body to be removed within twenty-four hours after the issue of such authority or certificate. 4. Every person for the time being employed in depositing a body in the Mortuary, or in removing a body therefrom shall while so employed conduct himself in all respects with decency and propriety. 5. Every person who, being a friend or relative of one whose body has been deposited in the Mortuary, has been admitted to view the body shall while on the premises conduct himself in all respects with decency and propriety. 112 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 6. Every person who, for the purpose of depositing a body in the Mortuary uses a shell which has not been provided by the Council, shall, in every case where the body is transferred from the shell before being carried from the premises to the place of burial, cause the shell, as soon as conveniently may be after the transfer of the body therefrom, to be removed from the premises. 7. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing By-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a Penalty of Five Pounds and in the case of a continued offence to a further penalty of Forty Shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Council. Provided nevertheless, that the Justices or Court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this By-law. The Common Seal of the Council was, by order of the Council, affixed this 25th day of October, 1905, in the presence of Hen. Geo. Hills Town Clerk.

Council House, Wandsworth, S.W. 19th July, 1905. GENERAL SANITARY WORK IN 1905. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year:— 1. General inspection of the whole of the Tooting Ward, and the carrying out of the removal of dust by the Council, for the purpose of noting the working of the system of daily removal of house refuse. 2. Inspection of drains of non-provided schools for the purpose of granting certificates that such drains had been tested with water and found satisfactory. The following schools were dealt with in 1905: St. Andrew's Roman Catholic School, Streatham. Walker's Place School, Putney. St. Michael's School, Wandsworth. Christchurch School, Clapham. Inspections were also made of other schools for the purpose of ascertaining if any nuisances existed that could be dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— North Street School or the Parochial School, Old Town, Clapham.—There a slight defect was found on smoke testing. Charlwood Road, and All Saints Schools, Putney, were also tested with the smoke machine, but no result was obtained. 117 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The drains of these schools will be made watertight; and with regard to the Macaulay Road School, Clapham, which also was inspected, the managers have under consideration a scheme for total reconstruction of the school premises, including all the sanitaryarrangements. Inspections were also made of St. Mary's School, Balham; Commercial School; St. Paul's, Heath Road ; and the Roman Catholic Schools (boys and girls), Clapham; chiefly with reference to the sanitary arrangements. In all these the water closets, although not of a modern pattern, were in a fairly satisfactory condition. At St. Mary's, Balham, the drains and sanitary conveniences are to be reconstructed. 3. Special inspections were made of the following premises in Putney for the purpose of giving evidence at the Local Government Board inquiry as to the site of a new London County Council school. The site inspected consisted of several old properties, known as Bigg's Row, Seymour Row, Isabella Place, Smith's Cottages, Cox's Buildings, the Old School House, Alpha Place, Kempsell Cottages, Marsh's Place, and Nos. 95-105, Lower Richmond Road. In all, 68 houses were inspected, occupied by 314 persons, 152 under 10 years, and 162 over 10 years of age. The majority of the houses are old, but are kept in quite a satisfactory sanitary condition. 4. During the year my attention was called by the Inspectors and also by ratepayers to the insanitary condition of various mews and passages in the rear of certain premises, and special inspections were made for the purpose of ascertaining if such nuisances could be dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or the Metropolis Management Act. The following places were inspected:— (а) Mews in Tankerville Road, Streatham. (б) Passageway from Fallsbrook Road, Streatham. (c) Mews at rear of Furzedown Parade, Streatham. (d) Mews in Westcote Road, in the rear of shops in Mitcham Lane. (e) Mews at rear of houses in York Road, entering from houses in Eltringham Street, Wandsworth. H 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (/) Lovett's Mews, Wandsworth. (g) Field's Mews, Wandsworth. (h) Mews at rear of 519, York Road, Wandsworth. («') Mews between Ebner Street and Tonsley Hill, and also Tonsley Hill land Handel Street, at rear of shops in York Road, Wandsworth. (k) Mews at rear of Grand Parade, Putney. (/) Mews in Sistova Road, Balham. (m) Passage at rear of Brookwood Road, Wandsworth. (n) Passage at rear of shops in the Parade, Upper Tooting Road. (o) Passage at rear of the shops Nos. 1-11. Bedford Hill. (p) Mews at rear of Nos. 27 -35 and 37-45, Abbeville Road, Clapham. In all these mews and passages notices were served where necessary, and these were complied with. Such notices referred to cleansing chiefly, as it was found that nothing further could be insisted on. The mews at rear of Furzedown Parade, Streatham, was paved by the owners, and that at the rear of the Grand Parade, Putney, was repaved. The passage at rear of shops Nos. I-II Bedford Hill, was paved by the occupiers after long continued negotiations with the owners. The mews at rear of shops in York Road, Wandsworth, is at present under notice, and I anticipate that the necessary paving will be completed during the current year. The mews at rear of Nos. 25-35 and 37-45, Abbeville Road were paved by the owners after service of nuisance notices. In my Report for 1904 a list of yards and mews was given which had been inspected in that year and several of which were being dealt with by the New Streets Committee. In 1905 I have also inspected the following Courts, viz.:—Newman's Court, Wallis Court, Great Acre Court, Acre Square, Triangle Place, Clapham; Salvador, Tooting ; Factory Square, Streatham; and Field's Alley and Simrose Court, Wandsworth. Some of these were dealt with by the New Streets Committee in 1904, and in 1905 Newton's Yard, the passage at the rear of The 119 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Terrace, Merton Road, Armoury Yard, and Dutch Yard, Wandsworth, have been paved by the Council and the cost paid by the owners. Triangle Place and the passage at 18, Old Town, Clapham, are being dealt with, and will be completed during the current year. With regard to Salvador, Tooting, part of this has been tar-paved and part channelled and the roadway repaired by the Council, thus effecting a decided improvement in its condition. 5. Special inspections were also made of the following streets as to the general sanitary condition of the houses:—Lydden Grove and Wardley Street, Wandsworth, and Pleasant Place, Nelson's Row, White Square, and Lower Orchard Street, Clapham. In addition to the above special inspections, 260 inspections were made of other premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notice. My attendance at the Police Court was necessary on 14, and at the High Court on two, occasions during the year. Sanitary Operations. The Table of Sanitary Operations shows in detail the amount and nature of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,357, compared with 1,491 in 1904. There was a considerable decrease in the number of complaints from Clapham, and a slight decrease in the number from Putney, Streatham and Tooting. The number of houses and premises inspected during the year was 22,383, compared with 17,999 in 1904 and 16,419 in 1903. This increase was general in all the sub-districts, but was greatest in Tooting, where the number of inspections shows an increase from 1,145 to 2490 Some of this increase is due to the inspection of premises after notification of births, and also to the increased number of cases of infectious diseases dealt with. 6,290 house-to-house inspections were made during the year, compared with 6,440 in 1904. The only sub-district in which there was any increase in the number was Tooting, the other sub-districts each showing a slight decrease. 120 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The number of preliminary or intimation notices served was 7,207, compared with 6,491 in 1904, and of statutory notices 1,099, compared with 1,029 in 1904. The number of statutory notices served included by-law notices, 342 of which were served in respect of the following contraventions of the by-laws:—yard paving 124, covers to cisterns 62, repairs to waterclosets 73, cleansing cisterns 31, repairs to flushing apparatus of waterclosets 29, cleansing house under by-laws of houses let in lodgings 13, and the absence of or repairs to manure receptacles nine. The difference between the sub-districts of Putney and Tooting with respect to statutory notices which was mentioned in my Report for 1904, is also noticeable in the year under review. In Putney while 709 preliminary notices were served, it was only necessary to serve 17 statutory notices, whereas in Tooting 971 preliminary and 100 statutory notices were served. It will also be observed that in the Southfield Ward very few statutory notices were necessary, and that the number of preliminary notices was also small in comparison with the other Wards. This was due to the fact that a large proportion of the property inspected during the year was of a better class and that in consequence fewer notices were necessary. The total number of inspections in that Ward compares favourably with the number in the other Wards. The number of cases of overcrowding dealt with during the year was 92, compared with 103 in 1904. Eight of these were in Clapham, six in Putney, 20 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 59 in Wandsworth. The cases in Wandsworth were, as in previous years, chiefly in the Fairfield and Springfield Wards. The majority of the cases of overcrowding were due to the subletting of premises, and were at once remedied after service of preliminary notices. All the cases of overcrowding were remedied without having recourse to legal proceedings. 1,128 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 1,166 in 1904, and 500 complaints with respect to non-removal of house refuse 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (50 from Clapham, 172 from Putney, 123 from Streatham, 60 from Tooting, and 95 from Wandsworth), were received during the year. These complaints were forwarded to the Surveyor's department and at once attended to by the Dusting Inspectors. Removal of House Refuse. In my Report for 1904 it was stated that a special Joint Committee of the Highways and Public Health Committees recommended to the Council that a daily system of removal of house refuse should be adopted in certain specified areas and that the Council had adopted the recommendation. The necessary notices were served on each occupier and the system of daily collection was commenced on the 2nd January. As stated in the Council's Report for 1904-5 the system adopted met with some opposition in Putney, and a summons was taken out against the Council under Section 30 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for failing to remove the refuse without reasonable cause. This was heard at the South Western Police Court when the Magistrate decided against the Council. Against this decision the Council appealed, but the appeal was dismissed. The Lord Chief Justice, in delivering judgment said that:— " The case was of considerable importance, but he was of opinion that the decision of the magistrate was right, although he did not agree with some of the reasons given by the learned magistrate. It must be taken as a fact that the respondent had a reasonably accessible position on his premises from which the sanitary authority could have removed the refuse, and that he was willing to place it there. The appellants, however, relied upon the exercise of their discretion, and said that they had a right to have, and would have, the refuse, as against this particular occupier, placed upon the kerbstone. He desired to point out that the local authority had gone considerably beyond the by-law if it was to be construed as contended for by Mr. Avory. He agreed that a question might arise whether, 133 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. if a notice had been given with regard to the particular occupier of the particular house that the refuse should be placed on a given spot, the magistrate could override the discretion of the local authority. The case before them raised no such point. The local authority had thought fit to give a notice that in a particular area occupiers should put their refuse upon the kerb-stone. They had not prescribed a conveniently accessible position on the premises. Even assuming that the local authority might prescribe with regard to particular premises —he did not decide that they could—and that the magistrate could not go beyond that, that was not what had happened in the case before them. There had been a notice given beyond that contemplated by by-law—namely, a notice that in a given area everyone should place his refuse on the kerb-stone. He sympathised with the desire of the local authority to have frequent removals of the house refuse in their district, but they had to consider the rights of the occupiers in the district. An obligation to remove the house refuse rested upon the local authority. Occupiers could be required to facilitate such removal, and owners might be called upon to spend money in making that removal easy and convenient, as, for instance, by providing movable dust-bins; but the question was: Could a local authority give a notice applying a by-law in such a way as to relieve themselves of their obligation to remove the refuse when the occupier was willing to do everything which, apart from the particular notice, he could be called upon to do ? The respondent was willing to place the dust-bin in a conveniently accessible position on his premises. The local authority said they would not remove the refuse unless it was brought out to the kerb-stone. That was not a proper prescription of a conveniently accessible position as contemplated by the by-law. If there was no prescription with respect to particular premises then the obligation on the occupier was to put the refuse in a conveniently accessible position on the premises. He thought the magistrate was right in holding that the appellants had failed without reasonable cause to discharge the duty cast upon them by the Act, as the respondent was willing to put the refuse in a place from which they could conveniently remove it. The conviction was therefore right, and the appeal would be dismissed." Mr. Justice Ridley and Mr. Justice Darling concurred. 134 Report of the Meaical Officer of Health. Previous to the decision of the High Court the Council had reverted to the system of weekly collection. There has during the year been no alteration made in the system of disposal of house refuse as set out in previous Reports. 143 statutory notices were served under Section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide dust-bins in accordance with the by-laws, and these were complied with. 1,023 yards in connection with dwelling houses, and 62 in connection with stables were drained, paved or cleansed, compared with 983 and 66 in 1904. 5,565 rooms and 923 passages were cleansed and repaired, a very large increase compared with previous years. The increase was chiefly due to the fact that the property inspected during the year was largely occupied by the poorer classes. As an evidence that this was the case it is only necessary to compare the figures in Tooting and in Southfield Ward. In the former 499 house-to-house inspections and 2,490 total inspections were made, and 552 rooms were cleansed, whereas in the latter 798 house-to-house inspections and 2,016 total inspections were made, but only 118 rooms were cleansed. In Tooting the property inspected was chiefly occupied by the poorer class, while in Southfield Ward it was occupied by the artisan class. 1,087 drains were repaired or cleansed, and 156 rain-water pipes disconnected from drains. 156 notices of re-construction of drains were forwarded to the Surveyors from this department; 17 in Clapham, 13 in Putney, 78 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 41 in Wandsworth. The number of water-closets cleansed and repaired was 2,141, compared with 1,979 in 1904, and 1,783 in 1903. A continued increase has occurred in the number of water-closets repaired since 1901. 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 329 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice, 50 in Clapham, 81 in Putney, 92 in Streatham, 39 in Tooting, and 67 in Wandsworth. Numerous complaints were received during the year with respect to this nuisance, and a large number of inspections were made by the Inspectors to ascertain if a nuisance existed in consequence of accumulation of manure. A considerable number of horses have been disposed of by the omnibus companies, and one of the largest stables in the Borough has been converted into a car shed. In another year there will doubtless be a considerable reduction in the number of horses kept at these stables, and a consequent reduction in the amount of manure produced. The greatest nuisance is not, however, created by the large omnibus companies, but by the small traders and costers, who have difficulty in getting rid of small quantities of manure. 20 notices were served for the removal of the manure every forty-eight hours, compared with 15 in 1904. 209 notices were served on occupiers of premises for keeping animals so as to be a nuisance. 20 of these were in Clapham, five in Putney, 25 in Streatham, seven in Tooting and 152 in Wandsworth. As in former years the animals chiefly kept so as to be a nuisance were fowls, and I have again this year inspected a large number of premises after complaint by persons occupying adjoining premises. In one case a summons was issued and an order was made by the magistrate for the abatement of the nuisance with 6s. costs. 133 smoke nuisances were reported during the year, two from Clapham, three from Putney, seven from Streatham, three from Tooting, and 118 from Wandsworth. Proceedings were taken in the case of four premises for the emission of black smoke, and in each case an order was made by the magistrate for the abatement of the nuisance with £2 2s. costs. Proceedings were taken against the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on two occasions for the emission of black smoke from locomotives and a fine of £3 was imposed and 23s. costs in one case, and in the other a fine of £5 with 2s. costs. 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 10 complaints of emission of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department, London County Council, with regard to 12 premises, and 10 complaints with regard to 28 premises from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society. The majority of the premises were under the observation of this Council's inspectors at the time the complaints were received, and the owners of the other premises were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors and warned. 175 soil pipes were repaired, 70 of these being in Streatham and 36 in Putney, compared with 269 in 1904. The number of unclassified nuisances was 772, compared with 943 in 1904. 260 of these were in Clapham, 92 in Putney, 153 in Streatham, 173 in Tooting, and 94 in Wandsworth. DISINFECTION. Until the 21st September the whole of the disinfection was'carried out at the Disinfecting Station at Bell Lane, Wandsworth, but on the 22nd September the new Disinfecting Station at Tooting was opened, and since that date the work has been carried on there. Plans of this station were included in my Report for 1903. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year was as follows:— £ s. d. Wages 991 19 2 Fuel 23 10 3 Horse hire 23 13 0 Horse keep 32 8 1 Stores, tools, and other materials 89 11 0 Repairs to vans, harness, etc. 50 13 11 Lighting 2 2 7 Insurance 3 12 0 £1,217 10 0 137 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious diseases was 2,947, compared with 2,527 in 1904, and 2,364 in 1903. The increase was due to the increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year. 1,778 lots of bedding, etc., were stoved at the Disinfecting Station, compared with 1,129 in 1904, and 1408 in 1903. The 1,778 lots of bedding stoved included the following:—1,173 beds, 1,359 bolsters, 3,190 pillows, 1,262 mattresses, 1,088 palliasses, 2,607 sheets, 1,922 quilts, 948 cushions, 8,146 articles of clothing, 3,620 blankets, 668 carpets, and 4,464 extra articles, a total of 30,477 articles, compared with 20,295 in 1904, and 24,750 in 1903. 798 premises were disinfected after Measles, and 161 after Tubercular Disease of the Lungs. Cleansing of Persons Act. The Council agreed to the erection of two bath houses at the Disinfecting Station, Tooting, for the purpose of carrying out more fully the provisions of the above Act, and also for dealing with children reported by the officials of the London County Council to be in a verminous condition and in attendance at school. These buildings will be ready for use in 1906 and will be sufficient for the purpose. So far very few cases have been brought to my notice, only two pases in 1905 having been dealt with. Information that conveniences for free bathing and cleansing have been opened will be forwarded to the London County Council officials and the Relieving Officers.

No complaints were received with respect to Nos. 2, 4 and 5. With regard to No. 1, the Sanitary Inspector reported that on the 25th May the smell from these works was very strong in Garratt Lane, and that on inspecting the premises he found that the rear furnace which is used for the destruction of the offensive effluvia was under reconstruction, and that the moveable air duct at boiler, which is the only other means of destroying the effluvia, was not in its proper position. Notice was served under the by-laws and this was at once complied with. With regard to No. 3, no nuisance from these works was reported by the Inspector until the 20th July. On this occasion the smell was very strong in Trewint and Summerley Streets, and the Inspector found that one of the boilers in the glue shed was nearly half full of bones in an offensive condition, and that effluvia from these were escaping and that no means were adopted for the destruction of such effluvia. The smell was also bad on the 21st, 22nd and 24th July. Proceedings were taken against the firm, and after hearing evidence the magistrate imposed a fine of 80s. and ordered them to pay 40s. costs. The other prosecution was for offences committed in August, 1904, and this was heard finally in January, 1905, when a fine of 80s. was imposed and an order made for payment of 23s. costs. Complaint was again made by the Inspector on the 31st August, and his report was to the effect that owing to negligence on the part of the workmen the door of the boiling-room was left open and that in consequence the effluvia escaped, causing smell in Summerley Street. Notice was served and complied with forthwith. No complaint was made after this date as the premises were kept under constant observation. In all 125 inspections were made of the five offensive business premises in the Borough, five notices were served, and proceedings taken on two separate occasions. 147 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Proceeding were taken in two cases, in one for exposing for sale rabbits which were unfit for food and the defendant was fined £5 and costs, and in the other, for exposing for sale fruit unfit for food, the defendant was fined and costs. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. No change has been made in the system of registration during the year as it has been found that the card system fulfils all the requirements. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in 1904, and the whole of the work done by both the male and female Inspectors is there summarised in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,701, including 162 retail bakehouses, 125 workshop laundries, 299 domestic workshops, and 1,115 other workshops, but not including 250 factories, 873 workplaces, and 221 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces and outworkers' premises there were on the Register at the end of 1905 3,045 premises, compared with 2,987 in 1904, and 2,676 in 1903. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of inspections made during the year was 4,933, compared with 4,946 in 1904. The total number of notices served was 462, 426 intimation and 36 statutory, compared with 465 in 1904, and 541 in 1903. There was only one prosecution during the year, for the want of suitable sanitary conveniences in a place where food was prepared. The case was heard at the South Western Police Court, and the magistrate made an order for an additional water closet to be provided. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. There was a slight increase in the number of inspections of factories, especially of factory laundries, owing to the increase in the number of females employed, and the consequent necessity of seeing that the necessary sanitary conveniences were provided. In all 493 inspections were made of 250 factories and 48 notices, 47 intimation and one statutory were served. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,701, 125 of which were workshop laundries, 162 workshop bakehouses, and 1,414 other workshops. In all 2,628 inspections of these were made, and 196 intimation and 20 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 873, and 1,571 inspections of these were made, while 161 intimation and 15 statutory notices were served. In one case proceedings were taken as previously stated. The total number of nuisances found during the year was 623, including six cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses, while only three were notified by H.M. Inspector of Factories. 157 Report of the Medica Officer of Health. To abate these nuisances 426 intimation and 36 statutory notices were served, all of which were complied with except 19 notices served in the end of December and which were complied with in January, 1906. The notices served in the case of bakehouses were all for failing to have the bakehouse cleansed at the proper time, and these were forthwith complied with. The only point calling for special notice respecting workshops was the insufficiency of water closet accommodation. In former years the provision of one water closet for every 15 females employed, and one for every 20 males, with urinal accommodation, has been enforced, but since the issue of the order of the Home Office respecting sanitary accommodation it has been found impossible to insist on the above proportions as employers of labour regard such order as final and applicable to factories and workshops in the Metropolitan area. In all 623 defects were found and 600 remedied, but it was only necessary to serve 426 notices, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises. 158 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Tables which follow summarise the work done during the year by the female Sanitary Inspectors. The total number of premises inspected was 1,709 (354 in Clapham, 222 in Putney, 525 in Streatham, 134 in Tooting, and 441 in Wandsworth). 119 inspections were made of factories, 953 of workshops, 58 of domestic workshops, 421 of workplaces, and 158 of outworkers' premises, while 399 premises were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. There were only 12 cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with 17 in 1904, and 22 in 1903, and these were all forthwith abated; four were insufficiently ventilated, and 83 were found to be in a dirty condition. In three factories and in one workshop the sanitary conveniences were found to be insufficient, while in 22 factories and eight workshops these were defective. It was only necessary to serve 111 intimation and nine statutory notices during the year, and again this year I am able to report that all these notices were at once complied with, the five remaining at the close of the year having been complied with early in the present year (1906). 67 workshops and 16 domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector of Workshops, and 32 were reported by H.M. Inspector to this Council. K 166 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXVI. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

It will be noted that to some extent the number of miscellaneous premises under the heading of workplaces shows a marked diminution, this being due to want of employment. The total number of trades carried on in the Borough does not coincide with the number of workshops and workplaces, as in many instances several trades are carried on in the same premises.

Outworkers. A new Order under the Factory and Workshop Act was issued by the Home Secretary in August, 1905, specifying the trades to which it applies, which are as follows :— The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing,, and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto ; The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets; Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work ; The making of electro-plate ; The making of files ; Fur-pulling; The making of iron and steel cables and chains ; The making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels; The making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gear buckles, mullin bits, hooks and attachments of all kinds; The making of locks, latches and keys; The making of covers for, and the covering, finishing, altering or repairing of, umbrellas, sunshades, parasols and articles of a similar character, and any work incidental thereto; The making of paper bags and of paper boxes ; Brushmaking ; and The making of stuffed toys. The total number of lists received during the year was 33, compared with 36 in 1904. These list contained the addresses of 365 workers, a decrease of ten compared with the previous year. Of these 231 were forwarded to other authorities, and 146 addresses of outworkers working in this Borough for persons outside the Borough were received from other authorities. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers :—Battersea, 92 Lambeth, 38 ; Camberwell, 16 ; Croydon, 13 ; Wimbledon,nine; Fulham, eight; Southwark, seven; Stepney, six ; Chelsea and East-Ham, five each ; Bermondsey and St. Pancras, four each ; City of London, Stoke Newington, Westminster and Willesden, three each ; Ilford, Hackney 171 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and Surbiton, two each; and Shoreditch, East Ham, Enfield, Bromley Chiswick and Norwich, one each, a total of 231. This number is a slight decrease compared with 1904, when the number forwarded was 249. 249 inspections were made of these outworkers' premises, and 21 intimation notices were served. It was not necessary to serve any statutory notices as the intimation notices were complied with forthwith. These notices were chiefly for cleansing. During the year five cases of infectious diseases were notified from the homes of outworkers, three of Scarlet Fever, one of Enteric Fever, and one of Erysipelas, compared with a total of 12 in 1904. Table LXXIX. shows the nature of the work carried out in the homes of outworkers as well as the number of lists received, the number forwarded to other authorities, and the number received from other authorities.

I am again able to report that the whole of the work with regard to factories and workshops has been carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors to my entire satisfaction, and personal visitation of a large number has satisfied me that all my instructions with regard to the improvement of the sanitary conditions where such was necessary have been carried out. There has still been some difficulty with reference to the provisions of water-closet accommodation, but in all the cases some satisfactory arrangement was arrived at. In only one case was it necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings. Canal Boats Act. During the year 23 inspections of canal boats were made, and it was not necessary to serve any notice. The general condition of the canal boats inspected during the year was found to be fairly satisfactory. Statement of Work under the Sale of Food and Drug's Act. During the past year 853 samples of food and drugs have been submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these, 65 or 7.62 per cent, were reported to be adulterated, compared with 11.33 per cent, in 1904, and 12.3 per cent, in 1903, As in former years, the adulterations detected were confined to Milk, Butter and Coffee. It is gratifying to note that owing to the more numerous inspections which have been made of late years that many of the smaller milk and butter vendors, who are the greatest offenders, have been compelled to leave the district, and as this exodus still continues it may reasonably be hoped that in the coming year a still further improvement may be reported. During the period under review the percentage of milk samples which were found to be adulterated was 7.2, compared with 15.3 in 1904 and 17.2 in 1903. This is a very gratifying feature of the year's 173 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. work, seeing that not only is milk by its very nature more susceptible of adulteration than any other article of food, but also that it is the only true " food " with which this report deals and as such is the very essential of healthy life to the young, In 49 out of the 65 adulterations detected proceedings were instituted against the vendors and, in the other cases the Council, taking into consideration the smallness of the adulteration, decided not to prosecute. The total amount received in penalties under the above and allied Acts amounted to £82 10s., and the costs recovered amounted to 41 6s. 6d., making a total of ,£123 16s. 6d. »74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the past three years, however, the same methods have been adopted, and it is satisfactory to observe that the percentage in 1905 is lower than it was in the two previous years. TABLE LXXXIII.

Samples of Milk have been taken on delivery at the public institutions, railway stations, and at four private houses in the Borough on receipt of complaint from the occupiers. All these samples were returned as genuine with the exception of two obtained at the railway station. The old system of forwarding Milk in unsealed churns still prevails and in no single instance during the year has the Inspector observed during his frequent visits to the various railway stations a churn which was adequately sealed. The sealing of churns is recommended by the leading Dairy Farmers' Association, who printed in the form of a leaflet the correspondence which passed between the Board of Trade, the Railway Companies Association and themselves.

The adulteration of Butter, judged by the percentage of adulteration reported, seems to have been gradually increasing during the past three years. The return of samples submitted show that 8.9 per cent, were adulterated, the figures for 1904 and 1903 being 7.2 and 4.4 respectively. The adulteration of Butter is still solely confined to the substitution of Margarine, and in no case has a certificate been returned showing that water has been present in more than the legal quantity. 179 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The adulteration of Groceries again shows a regrettable increase, eight of the 52 samples submitted, or 15.3 per cent, being reported adulterated, whereas in 1904 only 7.7 per cent, of adulteration was detected. It will be observed that all the adulterations under this heading were of Coffee. During the year six samples of meats were examined, four of bacon, one of black pudding, and one of potted beef. All of these samples contained Boric Acid in minute quantities. The following Table shows the number of Milk, Butter, Coffee and other samples taken and submitted for analysis, and the number and percentage of adulteration detected in each class. It also shows the number of samples actually purchased by the Inspector and by his various deputies, together with the adulteration detected and the percentage in each case. TABLE LXXXV.

The work of detecting offenders in the sophistication of food and the sale of such foods to the public becomes more difficult each year, and were it not for the frequent use of deputies, both male and female it would become almost an impossible task. 180 Report of the Medical Officer of Health It is a well-known fact that there are a large number of tradesmen in the Borough who, whilst doing a good trade in an adulterated article, would never serve a strange purchaser with the same article as that supplied to regular customers, for fear that the person so served might be a deputy of the Inspector. In these cases it becomes necessary for a male, or preferably female, assistant to purchase a few articles once or twice a week and thus become known as an ordinary customer. It will be seen by the above Table that practically the only article purchased by the Inspector during the year was Milk. For this there are two special reasons—(I) that it would be totally impossible for him to purchase an adulterated article such as Butter (the two cases which are credited to him were cases in which Margarine was exposed for sale openly without a label and he demanded a sample); (2) a milk vendor of the tricky variety will invariably refuse to serve the deputy, and the deputy having once asked for Milk the vendor is put upon his guard and it is a very easy matter for the receptacle to " accidentally" overturn, and no intentional obstruction can be shown against him. It has also been found to be very difficult to procure adulterated samples during the middle of the day, say from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., it being well known that the Inspector is more likely to be on duty at such hours. This has necessitated much early morning and late evening work. The Inspector himself has been on such duty for 389 hours during the past year. However, the result has adequately justified this line of action as the percentage of adulteration detected in these samples was 9.2 per cent, compared with a general percentage of 7.62. It is necessary in order to carry out the duties under the Food and Drugs Acts efficiently for the Inspector employed to carefully note in the trade and other journals the new forms of adulterations which are continually being " discovered " by the manufacturer and tradesman alike, and thus be prepared to safeguard the public interest. During the first portion of the year the old practice was still adopted for employing a member of the disinfecting staff to act as a deputy. However, as reported last year, the number of samples has increased and the work at the new disinfecting station has also Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 181 interfered so that during the last six months by the instructions of the Council respectable men and women known to the Inspector have been employed by him. This arrangement works satisfactorily, and the Inspector reports that he can now not only cope with the increasing number of samples, but can also exercise a general supervision of the various districts which otherwise could not be accomplished. Taking the total amount of fines received during the year, excluding the £20 fine inflicted in case 131 for a third offence, the average amount of penalty for the remaining 48 cases is under 30s. per case. When it is considered that this amount and more can be made by fraudulent methods in one evening it can easily be understood that the dishonest trader prefers to take the risk. Until the fines inflicted are of such amount that the financial loss is appreciable the efforts of any officer to effectually prevent adulteration will be almost futile. The fine inflicted depends entirely upon the light in which individual magistrates view offences under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and I have personally known cases in which defendants have not appeared on certain days, but sent a medical certificate and asked for an adjournment in order that they might not appear before the magistrate then sitting, but before a more lenient interpreter of the law in respect of such offences as they have committed. I am pleased to be able to report that the " warranty defence " in the case of adulterated Milk samples which has caused so much trouble to other Boroughs and which is always a standing menace to the effectual prevention of Milk adulteration has been relied on in only two cases during the past year. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. L APPENDIX.
