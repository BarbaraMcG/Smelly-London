To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Valley Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1925. In accordance with the Ministry of Health's circular of the 10th December. 1925, this includes a short survey of the progress made in this area during the last five years in the improvement of the Public Health. The subjects dealt with in the Report fall under the following main headings:— Natural and Social Conditions of the Area, including Vital Statistics. General Provision of Health Services in the Area. 4 Sanitary Circumstances. Including Water Supply. Drainage, Sewerage, etc. Prevention of, and Control over, Infectious Diseases. Housing. Inspection and Supervision of Food. The subjects of Housing and Food Inspection are dealt with more particularly in the Sanitary Inspector's Report. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, AE. ROSE. Natural and Social Conditions of the Area. The Urban Sanitary District of East Barnet Valley is within the Administrative County of Hertford, being situate in the extreme southern portion of the County. Geographically, however, the District is almost surrounded by the County of Middlesex, the exception being the north-western portion of the boundary, which adjoins the Urban Sanitary District of Barnet (Herts). The remaining Districts adjoining the Council's area are all urban sanitary districts, situate within the County of Middlesex, viz.:—On the north, Enfield; on the south and south-east, Southgate; on the south-west, Friern Barnet. 5 The District Council was formed in April, 1894, to succeed the old Local Board. The District comprises the Parishes of East Barnet, Barnet Vale, and Monken Hadley. As its name implies, it lies on the side of a valley extending from Hadley in the north to Brunswick Park in the south. The principal portion of the District is divided by the main line of the Great Northern section of the London and North Eastern Railway from Kings Cross to the north, while it is bounded on the east and west respectively by the main roads leading from London northwards through Southgate and Barnet. The general character of the District is residential; the area on the west of the railway has been conveniently planned, and consists principally of good-class detached and semi-detached villa residences, the altitude varying from 200 to 400 feet above Ordnance datum. The District forms a portion of a much wider area noted for the healthiness of its climate and popularly known in and around the Metropolis as the "Northern Heights." On the east of the railway are situate the older portions of the District, including the village of East Barnet, and Brunswick Park, at the southern extremity, most of which is developed for a much smaller class of property and is consequently more densely populated. On the north-east boundary of the District are the beautiful Hadley Woods and Common, partly grazing land and partly wooded, being parts of the old Enfield Chase. The Council has leased from the Hadley Commoners a portion of Hadley Common (about 9½ acres in extent), including a large lake, until recently part of Beech Hill Park Estate, to be used as a recreation ground. Boating and fishing facilities are available on the lake. The whole acquisition makes a considerable addition to the attractiveness of the District. Area and Population. The area of the District is 2,644 acres. The population in 1921 was 13,514, and in 1925 (estimated) 15,000. 6 The Rateable Value in 1921 was £99,397 and in 1925 £104,082. The sum represented by a Penny Rate is £433. The number of Inhabited Houses in 1921 was 3,016 and in 1925 3300. The number of families or separate occupiers in 1921 was 3,212. Vital Statistics. These show a decline in the Birth Rate from 18.1 in 1921 to 15-1 in 1925. The Death Rate shows little change, being 8.4 in 1921 and 8.8 in 1925, per 1,000 inhabitants. The Infantile Mortality in 1921 was 46 and in 1925 41.4 per 1,000 net births. The Senile Mortality in 1921 was 53 and in 1925, 62. The Zymotic Mortality in 1921 was 6 and in 1925, 4. General Provision of Health Services. The Public Health Staff consists of a Medical Officer of Health (part time) who is also Assistant School Medical Officer, one Sanitary Inspector (full time) who is also Building Surveyor, and one Clerk. There are no Assistant Inspectors, no Health Visitors, or Special Nurses employed by the Authority. Ambulance Facilities. An ambulance for accidents and non-infectious cases is now provided and an ambulance for infectious cases is provided by the Isolation Hospital Committee for the combined districts of Barnet Urban, Barnet Rural, and East Barnet Valley. 7 Hospitals. Fever hospital accommodation is provided by the Joint Hospital Authorities at the Isolation Hospital, Mays Lane, Barnet, and beds are available for Smallpox cases in the hospital at Cheshunt. There are no School Clinics or special treatment centres within the area. LEGISLATION IN FORCE. Adoptive Acts. There are no local Acts. The following are the Adoptive Acts in force in the District:— Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890. Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890. Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1907. Bye-Laws and Regulations. New Streets and Buildings (July 10th, 1917). Public Health Act, 1875, respect to:— Nuisances arising from snow, filth, dust, ashes and rubbish, and for the prevention of keeping animals on any premises so as to be injurious to health. (August 17th, 1885). Slaughter Houses (August 17th, 1885). With respect to:— New Streets and Buildings and alterations to Buildings (July 10th, 1917). Drainage Existing Buildings (June nth, 1907). Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milk Shops (July 30th, 1907). Recreation Grounds (November 19th, 1923). 8 Public Health Act, 1875, Sect. 112, as amended by Sect. 51 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, with respect to:— Offensive Trades (May 9th, 1893), as follows:— Blood Boiler and Blood Drier; Bone Boiler; Fellmonger, Tanner, and Leather Dresser; Soap Boiler, Tallow Melter, Fat Melter or Extractor; Tripe Boiler; Glue Maker and Size Maker; Gut Scraper; Nuisances in connection with the removal of offensive or noxious matters; Fish Frier. • SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water. The water is obtained from wells sunk through the clay and reading beds and borings deep into the chalk. The wells are at New Barnet, East Barnet, Potters Bar, Tyttenhanger, and one at North Mimms. It is pumped direct into the mains or into reservoirs at New Barnet and Rowley Green. It is of great purity, pleasant to drink, and almost free from organic matter or objectionable bacteria. Like all London water, it is of considerable hardness varying in the different wells from 22 to 26 degrees of hardness (I degree of hardness is equal to 1 in 100,000 parts, 0.7 grains of carbonate of lime in 1 gallon of water). Much of the hardness might be remedied by boiling; this process precipitates the lime, but at the same time by boiling out the oxygen renders the water less pleasant to the taste. So far as is known, the hardness has no deleterious effect, such as causing disease of the blood vessels or the so-called rheumatic affections of joints. On the other hand, those who use it are free from the diseases associated with the consumption of softer water obtained from reservoirs, such as lead poisoning, &c. 9 The only possible source of contamination of water obtained from the chalk would be through "swallow-holes," which are cavernous openings commonly found at the junction of the reading beds and the chalk, into which streams disappear. One of these "swallow-holes" is found near North Mimms, where water from nearly 20 square miles of land disappears. Frequent examinations of the water are made so that contaminations may be at once detected. The North Mimms Bore is not used during wet weather. The whole of the water from this station is filtered and Chlorinated. The following is a summary of the various analyses made in 1925 by Drs. Thresh & Beale:— "This is an exceptionally pure and wholesome water suitable for all the purposes of a public supply." Drainage and Sewerage. The District is sewered and drained on the separate system. The sewage is conveyed to an irrigation farm of 50 acres in area at East Barnet, and turned on to the land. It is passed through percolating filters, and finally into Pymmes Brook. Samples of the effluent are occasionally taken by the Lee Conservancy Board, but no complaints have been received. The surface water drainage is conveyed to Pymmes Brook by several brooklets. These are constantly inspected and kept free from deleterious matter. Scavenging. Everything possible is being done to control the conditions unfavourable to health and so prevent the outbreak or spread of disease; the house refuse is regularly collected by the Council's staff and conveyed to the "tip" at the sewage farm at East Barnet where it is incinerated. The disposal of this refuse matter is becoming somewhat difficult and if householders would consume as much as 10 possible whatever can be burnt it might lighten the labour of collection. The roads are regularly swept and the surface drains cleaned out and the road surfaces treated in a manner to reduce the production of dust to a minimum. Sanitary Inspection. This is dealt with in detail in the Sanitary Inspectors Report. Prevalence of, and control over, Infectious Diseases. With the exception of Mumps, all cases of Infectious Disease are notifiable in the area. During the five years under review there have been three considerable epidemics of Measles and German Measles, 71 cases in 1923, 316 cases in 1924, and 62 cases in 1925. In accordance with the Ministry of Health's Memoranda on Closure of Schools no schools were closed on account of Measles during 1925. Strict quarantine, however, has been enforced in all cases of contact. With regard to Diphtheria every facility for prompt diagnosis and treatment is placed at the disposal of local doctors, swabs for examinations of throat, etc., and a supply of antitoxin are kept in readiness at the Council Offices. Similar facilities for bacteriological diagnosis are available in cases of Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and full advantage is taken of them. In all infectious cases where patients are removed to isolation or special hospitals, the patient's home is visited and disinfection thoroughly carried out. Tuberculosis. A table is given showing new cases and mortality during 1925. The number of deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis during the last five years is shown as follows:— 11 1921 11 deaths. 1922 7 „ 1923 3 „ 1924 8 „ 1925 12 „ Whenever possible all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis likely to benefit are sent to the County Sanatorium at Ware. In every case thorough disinfection of premises, etc., is carried out as soon as the patient has been removed. Vaccination. The Return relating to vaccination within the East Barnet Valley Urban District during the year ended 31st December, 1925, is shown below:— Certificates of successful vaccination of children under 14 years of age received 80 Statutory declarations of conscientious objection to vaccination of children received 111 The above Return does not include re-vaccinations or primary vaccinations of persons fourteen years of age and upwards, no reliable figures relating thereto being available. 12 TABLE I.

Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting the following Report on the work of the Public Health Department. Public Health Staff. Dr. JE. Rose, M.A., M.B., Ch.B., Medical Officer of Health, Assistant School Medical Officer. Mr. J. Lewis, M.Inst.M. & Cy.Engrs., M.R.San.Inst.,. M.Inst.San.Engrs., Sanitary Inspector. One Clerk. There are no Assistant Inspectors. The Sanitary Inspector is also Building Surveyor. The ordinary sanitary operations of the department have continued to receive unremitting attention. In no instance have legal proceedings been instituted, although occasionally much pressure has to be brought to bear on the dilatory owner. 21 Unhealthy Areas and Unfit Mouses. Until much more has been done to overcome the existing shortage of housing accommodation it would obviously be unwise to attempt to put into operation drastic measures for clearing unhealthy areas. Wherever practicable, houses are repaired so as to be at least passable for the time being. Water Supply. Storage Cisterns. Storage cisterns are examined, where house inspections are made. One drinking water supply direct from main, is now required. These supply cisterns are required to be emptied and thoroughly cleansed from time to time, and to be provided with proper closefitting covers, and so placed as to be at all times readily accessible. Infectious Disease Visits. Inspection of the premises where cases of infectious disease have been notified, is made and the information obtained is submitted to the Medical Officer of Health, and the matters contained dealt with according to his instructions. A case paper record of each case is made out and filed for reference. Disinfection. The methods in use in this District are: — Rooms sprayed with Formic Aldehyde: bedding, etc., removed (by arrangement with the Joint Hospital Authorities) for steam disinfection, when requested by the medical attendant. All disinfection of rooms is carried out free of charge by the Council to the residents in the District, and the bedding, clothes, etc., after notifiable cases of fever and tuberculosis, steam disinfected by the Joint Hospital Authorities. 22 The articles are collected, disinfected, and returned free of charge on request by the medical attendant. The Joint Isolation Hospital Authorities now make a charge of 17s. 6d. per journey to residents in this District for the disinfection of bedding, clothes, etc., after all non-notifiable diseases, on request. The Council supply disinfectant soap free after cases of infectious disease, also in cases where supplies are thought to be desirable to facilitate and ensure cleanliness. This should greatly influence people to thoroughly cleanse their premises and so ward off any likelihood of recurring cases. Disinfection figures for the year are:— No. of houses. Rooms disinfected. Houses from which bedding was removed. Houses from which bedding was destroyed. 43 129 4 4 Public Elementary Schools. The sanitary conveniences and drains at the schools are inspected at intervals and after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease. Outworkers. In accordance with the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, several lists of outworkers residing in this District have been received during the year, from persons employing home workers. These lists have mostly come through the office of the Corporation of London, and other Metropolitan Boroughs. The premises specified in these lists have been visited for the purpose of ascertaining the sanitary condition under which the work is done, on complaints have been received. 23 The Workshops in the District are very suitable and well adapted for the several processes that are carried on therein, the light, ventilation, and air space is well maintained, and general sanitary conditions are good. Sale of Food and Drug's Act. This Act is administered in this Council's District through one of the Inspectors appointed by the County Council for that purpose and the following Report on the samples of food and drugs taken in New Barnet during the year ended 31 st December, 1925, has been received from the Chief Constable, Hatfield, Herts.

There is no Public Abattoir in the District. The bulk of the meat supply comes from London, 50 % is chilled meat. The following is unsound food that has been voluntarily surrendered and destroyed during the year:— 3 stone of Crabs. 90 lbs. of Tomatoes. 2 boxes of Grapes, approx. 52 lbs. 4 stone of mixed Fish. 14 lbs. of shell Fish. 30 Pigs' heads. 3 carcases of Pigs. Approx. 18 cwts. of edible offal. The butchers' shops, eating houses, fish shops, etc., are frequently inspected to see that the premises and utensils are clean and in good order. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milk Shops. I have prepared the following data for your information with regard to the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, from the circulars and forms issued to Producers and Purveyors within the urban area. No. of cows kept by producers within the urban area 150 No. of cows kept by producers retailing only within the urban area 100 No. of producers who also retail 9 No. of producers who do not retail 1 No. of producers outside urban area who retail 5 No. of retailers only within the urban area 13 25 The sanitary conditions of the several premises is satisfactory and every precaution is taken to distribute the milk in a cleanly condition. Several visits were paid to these premises throughout the year. The local dairymen and purveyors of milk appear to be plying their trade with due regard to the protection of the milk supply from contamination. Limewashing of premises is carried out in May and October. The hygiene of cowsheds, dairies and slaughterhouses and other places where food is stored or handled is constantly under observation and kept up to a high standard of cleanliness. Manure Notices. With regard to periodical removal of manure from stables notices are circulated throughout the District during the summer months to have all manure removed from stables, etc., at least twice a week, in order to prevent the breeding of flies. Bakehouses. There are nine bakehouses in the District, three of which are underground. Notices under Section 99 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, are sent out to all occupiers of bakehouses throughout the District, requiring them to thoroughly limewash their bakehouse premises twice a year. Offensive Trades. Under the provisions of Section 112 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by Section 51 of the Public Health Act Amendment Act, 1907, the establishment of the trades of fish-frier and fat melter are offensive trades within the urban area. 26 Slaughter-houses. There are two registered and three licensed slaughter-houses in the District, and these are being maintained in satisfactory manner. Limewashing and cleansing is carried out regularly and systematically. Attendance during the time slaughtering is in operation, is made as far as practicable. Summary of Statistics. Relating to the sanitary work effected in the District, the information desired has been supplied as fully as possible. The work has proceeded along the usual lines, and resolved itself into several main features, viz:— (a) Inspecting premises on complaint, or for special purposes, as after infectious diseases. (b) Inspections for supervision of works in hand to comply with notices. (c) Inspections under Factory and Workshop Acts, Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milk Shop Regulations, Slaughter-houses, etc. For the information of the Council and in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health, I append hereto a table showing the defects found to exist on the properties inspected during the year:— » 27 SANITARY ADMINISTRATION.
