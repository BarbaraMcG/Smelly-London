The general arrangements of the Board having now become settled, its business necessarily assumes a somewhat repetitive, though no less onerous character year after year, the variation being mainly in figures.

The Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the best means of affording relief to the inhabitants of the Metropolitan Districts, within 6 miles of Charing Cross, by the abolition of these tolls, referred to in last year's report, having concluded their labors, made their report to the Government, recommending a scheme altogether adverse to the interests of this parish. The committee appointed to watch the subject before the Commissioners, as set forth in last year's Report, therefore prepared a petition to the Home Secretary against the proposed scheme, which was adopted by the Vestry, but the Committee having learnt from the Home Secretary, through T. S. Duncombe, Esq., M.P., that it was not the intention of Government to introduce any measure upon the subject at present, nothing further has been done. The Vestry however will keep the question in view, and will take care to be heard at the proper time. The general business of the Board during the period embraced in this report, having consisted almost exclusively of that of a routine character, the reader is referred at once to the more important part of the report—the annexed balance sheet, and the Medical Officer's Report on the Sanitary State of the Parish.

DYER, Arrear Collector, 60, Goswell-road MEDICAL OFFICERS REPORT 1859. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkemvell. Gentlemen-, In the present, which is my fourth Annual Report, I shall do myself the honor of submitting to you a condensed account of tho Reports which I laid before you at your periodical Meetings during the year 1859, with some remarks upon the General Sanitary condition of the District, the improvements effected during the year, and those still required. The number of deaths which took place during the year was 1374, the average of the last 10 years being 1408; so that the deaths were 34 less than the average. In 1856, the number of deaths was 1313; in 1857, 1406; in 1858, 1477; so that the deaths in 1859, were fewer by 103 than in 1858. During each year, a certain number of the parishioners die in General and Special Hospitals, and Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for Clerkenwell amounts to 98; thus producing a total of 1472. The births in the year were 2175; being 45 less than 1858, when they were 2220. Hence the natural increase of the population was 801. The total number of deaths arising from Zymotic diseases, according to the old arrangement, was 331; that for 1858, being 336; and for 1857, 348. The deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases were 301; against 285 in 1858; and 295 in 1857. The Quarters of the year in which these deaths occurred are shown in the subjoined table. 16 1857. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus. Totals. 1st Quarter 2 9 5 35 2 10 63 2nd ,, 18 6 16 4 13 57 3rd „ 2 7 16 10 49 11 95 4th „ 2 17 15 23 10 13 80 1858. 6 51 42 84 65 47 295 1st Quarter 1 10 6 28 5 5 55 2nd „ 10 1 15 5 8 39 3rd 1 11 20 3 34 7 76 4th „ 3 38 37 15 11 11 115 1859. 5 69 64 61 55 31 285 1st Quarter 3 7 27 39 3 9 88 2nd ,, 2 15 29 1 11 58 3rd ,, i 1 10 11 55 3 81 4th „ 5 14 30 8 9 8 74 9 24 82 87 68 31 301 It is thus seen that the total number of these deaths was 16 more than in 1858, and 6 more than in 1857. The deaths from Small Pox, to which 1 must be added as having occurred in the Small Pox Hospital, were just double those of the preceding year; those from Measles, 35 fewer; those from Scarlet Fever, 18 more; those from Hooping Cough 26 more; those from Diarrhœa 13 more; while those from Typhus were the same. When however, the 6 deaths from the latter disease which took place in the Fever Hospital are added to the 31 which occurred in the District, the total becomes 37, against 39 (31 + 8), the total for 1858. Of the 82 deaths included under Scarlet Fever, 16 were registered as arising from Diphtheria. 628 deaths occurred in infants and children under 5 years of age; in 1858, there were 656; and in 1857, 663. 268 deaths took place at and above 60, including 52 at and above 80. 269 deaths arose from Tubercular or Consumptive diseases. 229 deaths occurred from Pulmonary diseases. 120 deaths took place in the Workhouse. 17 On reviewing these particulars, it is satisfactory to find that the general mortality is less than that of the preceding year; and also less than the average. And here it must be observed that no allowance has been made for increase in the population, which naturally tends to augment the number of deaths. The number of deaths from Zymotic diseases has also suffered a diminution. This truly is small; yet the decrement has been constant during the last three years. The number of deaths, however, from the principal Zymotic diseases has slightly increased. This mortality falls principally upon infants and children. Of the 301 deaths occurring during the year from these diseases, 229 took place in children under 5 years of age, and 26 between the ages of 5 and 20; making a total of 255 under 20. And while we are able to reduce gradually but steadily the mortality from other diseases, we are met by at present insuperable obstacles in the case of these principal Zymotic diseases, in the overcrowding and the occupation of single rooms by entire families. Every year about 800 individuals are added to the population, and have to be packed up in the same number of houses. Unquestionably overcrowding exists to a very great extent in the district, and so long as this is allowed to remain and increase, it will be found impossible to reduce the great mortality from these diseases. If the estimate regulating the space required for each individual at 300 cubic feet, and this is a very fair one, were adopted in this district, we should find thousands of tenements overcrowded. It is an everyday occurrence to find 3, 4, or even 5 children suffering from these diseases, in one room. Often in a house there are 10 or 15. In several of the fatal cases which have occurred in the year, the children have been afflicted at the same time with even two or three of these diseases; and when it is considered that the effect of the morbid poisons producing them is increased by concentration, the sufferers having to breathe the same air over and over again, loaded with the poison, there can bo no wonder that the fatal results are so great. The deaths from diarrhoea were more than in the previous year. Most of them occurred in children, 56 of the 58. I believe that a large number of deaths from this disease might be prevented by confining children to a milk diet. Among the poor there is no nursery; the consequence is, that the children when young see the parents' dinner, and of course cry for it, and to satisfy them, they are fed with the food of an adult; often before they are a year old eating as much solid food as a grown up person. Little or none of this is digested; hence the limbs waste, they become atrophied, and as it is vulgarly called, tun-bellied, and as soon as the weather becomes warm, they die of diarrhœa, or suffer from a host of other diseases. 18 The mortality from scarlet fever as augmented very considerably—to just twice that of 1857, and one-third more than that of 1858. It is to be hoped that this declining ratio will be preserved. But the overcrowding is eminently effective in favouring the spread and fatality of this disease. The same remark applies to Hooping Cough. It is evident, however, from a glance at the table, that a low temperature has also considerable influence over the mortality from Hooping Cough. The total number of deaths occurring in children, was 628; a less number than in either of the two first years, yet amounting to nearly half the mortality. This reduction could hardly have been expected, considering that in addition to the unfavourable influences already alluded to, the " strike" was in existence, and caused considerable distress in the district. An unfortunate occurrence of this kind ensures suffering to the children. The mother has to work, the house and the family have to be neglected, and privation has to be endured, which is sure to increase mortality. It will be seen by reference to the general table of mortality at the end of this report, that the total number of deaths from violence, comprising those from accident or negligence, murder and suicide, was less than the preceding year, being 31 against 37. At the same time, five infants were murdered, whilst one only in 1858. Nine were accidentally suffocated, and two died from burns. The murder of infants is not only on the increase in this district, but throughout the metropolis. There is considerable carelessness among the poor in regard to fire. Every year, many children are burnt, and often disfigured for life. This might be prevented in a large number of tbe cases, by the use of a fireguard, which costs about sixpence. Sixteen deaths occurred in the House of Correction, and three in the House of Detention; two of them in the latter arising from suicide. These are not so numerous as in 1858, when there were 22 in the Houso of Correction, and three in the House of Detention—two of these also arising from suicide. It is evident that the main efforts to keep the mortality within due bounds, must be directed to that of children under five years of age. If we add the number of deaths occurring at that period, 628, to that of the deaths at and above 60, of which we can hardly complain, 268, making a total of 896, the remaining mortality is not considerable. In my former report I have so fully detailed the points to be attended to, with a view to keeping the mortality within due limits, that I need only allude to them briefly here. There is no reason why children should have Small pox, Measles, or Scarlet Fever, or any other infectious diseases. Hence, independently of the sepa 19 ration of healthy children from the infected, parents should avoid contact with children or adults suffering from these maladies, as much as possible; for healthy persons may convey the infection to their own families without suffering themselves. No children should be sent to school whilst any member of the family is suffering from any infectious complaints. No landlord Bhould allow a new tenant to occupy apartments in which the previous occupants have recently suffered from infectious disease, without having them properly cleansed and purified. All infants should be vaccinated, as required by law; and again, at least once in after-life—say when 14 years of age; and no child should be admitted to school, who has not been vaccinated. No family should occupy apartments in which there are not 300 cubic feet of space for each person,—i.e., the length, breadth, and height in feet, multiplied together. Every one shrinks from the idea of being poisoned; yet all who do not observe this rule, are merely undergoing slow poisoning. The Vestry can punish by law any landlord who allows apartments to be occupied where this rule is not observed. Any person finding offensive effluvia from drains, &c., in his house or apartments, should at once give notice to the Vestry, that the cause of the same may be ascertained, and the evil remedied. Parents should not allow their children to be brought up in underground rooms. They are sure to be unhealthy, an easy pray to Zymotic disease, and when grown up will be quite unfitted to go through the struggle of life. Both the Vestry and the District Surveyor have the power to restrict the occupation of underground rooms ; yet neither have moved in this important matter. Sufficient attention is not paid in the district to the proper cleansing of the houses and apartments among the poor; many of the houses and tenements are in a very filthy state, and very much darker than they would be if properly white-washed or lime-whited; and even light is an important element of health. On this point, I think the Vestry might do great service by employing the extensive powers at their command. The dwellings of the poor should be regularly inspected, to see that they are kept in cleanly and wholesome condition; and as far as I have found, few would object to this proceeding. The water supply should be kept pure, the cisterns or butts being furnished with lids. The disgusting practice of keeping the frost from the cisterns by a coating of horse-dung is by no means uncommon, even in the case of the better houses. It need not be stated, that the rain percolating the dung will convey gome of it to the drinking water. The remarks made in my last Annual Report, upon the water-supply, the cow-houses and slaughter-houses, remain applicable at the present. It may be remarked that two cart-loads 20 of filth were removed from the most objectionable underground reservoir in Union-square, Chapel-street. Nuisances Removed, &c.—Although many nuisances and sanitary evils still remain, and, as I have shown, some are increasing, numerous others have been removed, and important improvements effected. Thus: 125 houses have been drained; 101 new drains laid; 90 cesspools have been destroyed; 33 sewers have been cleansed and repaired: 341 gullies cleansed, repaired, and trapped: two new airshafts built: 17 new gullies aonstructed, and 1915 feet of new sewers have been made in Little Sutton-street, Berry-street, Allenstreet, Clark-street, Hooper-street, and Chapel-row; besides the removal of pigs, collections of refuse, cleansing of cow-yards, &c. It is evident then on the whole, that the sanitary state of the district has been improved, and that the foundation of still further progress has been laid. At the same time, while we are preventing nuisances from entering the dwellings from without, these have been generated within them; and unless some measures be taken to keep this source of danger in check, should any epidemic condition appear, we shall have to give an account of some extreme mortality, which might have been prevented, or which previous efforts might have rendered less severe.
