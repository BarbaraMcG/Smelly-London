The number of deaths in the Borough shows a slight increase over last year. Those for malignant neoplasm have fallen and the number caused by coronary disease/angina have increased. There was a marked increase in the number of notified cases of infectious disease caused, mainly, by the usual tri-annual outbreak of measles and double the number of cases of Acute Gastro Enteritis than occurred in 1962 although it is interesting to note that the number of cases of food poisoning dropped from 32 in 1962 to 14 in 1963. The week-end meals service for the homebound elderly continues to increase and has proved to be a most worthwhile service. During the year its future seemed to be in jeopardy as the frozen food used ceased to become available. Through the kindness of the Governor's of Guy's Hospital the meals are now supplied by the kitchens of the hospital and I would like to record my grateful thanks to them for their co-operation. In October the Women's Voluntary Service opened a meals club at their headquarters in Brunel Road on two days a week and in a very short time it was working to capacity, an indication of the excellence of the service provided. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Act 1948 (Amended 1962) the Department assumed responsibility for a number of services previously provided by the Bermondsey & Rotherhithe Council for the Welfare of Old People. Grants were made to 398 elderly persons towards a holiday and outings were arranged for the elderly homebound to the seaside or country. No cases of persons needing compulsory removal to hospital or old persons' home were encountered during the year but 3 old people agreed to admission voluntarily. This is undoubtedly due to the patience and kindly persuasive powers of the staff engaged in this work. Included in my report is data on the investigation of lacquer hair spraying and an article I have had published in Guy's Gazette on Air Pollution. Five outbreaks of paratyphoid B occurred during the year—in Edinburgh, Cambridgeshire, Carshalton, Lewisham and in the East Riding of Yorkshire. These outbreaks emanated in each case from bakehouses where Chinese Frozen Whole Egg had been used for cake and pastry making. Consignments of Chinese Frozen Whole Egg, along with other imported egg, had shown food poisoning organisms from time to time by bacteriological examination and had been detained. However, negative bacteriological results had been shown to be unreliable when resampling had established that some of this ostensibly satisfactory egg had, in fact, contained food poisoning organisms. Chinese Frozen Whole Egg was the only imported egg to have occasionally grown the paratyphoid organism, although extensive sampling had been carried out on all imported egg, from whatever source. Whilst no direct evidence was available that this egg had caused the outbreaks (the paratyphoid organism was not found in samples taken from the bakehouses) nevertheless the circumstantial evidence was very strong, and a cargo already detained by this authority had contained a batch positive for paratyphi B. Accordingly, I decided that the only safe method of dealing with this product was for all of it to be pasteurised and I issued instructions that all unpasteurised Chinese Frozen Whole Egg in stock in Bermondsey and arriving in the borough in the future must be held under detention for pasteurisation, by which it would become a perfectly safe product. At a meeting of the egg importers at my office unanimous agreement was reached that (a) No more unpasteurised Chinese Frozen Whole Egg should be imported. (b) That existing stocks should only be released to the public after pasteurisation. (c) That there be uniformity of action on these lines throughout the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Health were immediately informed and the Minister of Health in written answer to a parliamentary question stated that no further unpasteurised Chinese Frozen Whole egg would be imported and existing stocks pasteurised. In conclusion I would like to say that no praise is too high for the members of the egg trade, who showed the fullest co-operation in this matter. May I extend my thanks to members of the Council and to the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year, also to all members of the staff for their help and loyal support. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. E. EPSOM. VITAL STATISTICS. AREA The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres.

The District Nurses, Home Helps, Hospital Almoners and others who are in frequent touch with the elderly all assist by drawing attention to those they meet who require the assistance of the various welfare services provided by the Council. The fullest use was made of the bathing service provided at the Council's Cleansing Station and of the domiciliary service. An average of 47 persons per week were bathed either in their own homes or in the Cleansing Station. The Council continued to act as agents for the Council for the Welfare of Old People in operating the Meals on Wheels Service and the meals served to the Municipal Club until 31st March, when under the provisions of the 1962 amendment to the National Assistance Act 1948 they became directly responsible for operating this important service. At the same time opportunity was taken to reduce the charge to old people from 1/1d. to 1/- whilst keeping the cost of the meal at 2/3d. Because requests for the Meals on Wheels had increased considerably it was found necessary to introduce a fourth unit to meet the demand. There was also an increase in the demand for the Weekend Meals service. It will be recalled that this service was introduced in May 1961 to supply a hot meal at weekends to handicapped and homebound persons unable to prepare or to obtain a meal, the food used being individual portions frozen in sealed bags which could be quickly heated by immersion in boiling water. The summer brought misgivings as to the future of this service when it was learned that production of this particular range of food would cease at the end of June. Fortunately sufficient stocks were procured to enable the service to continue whilst other arrangements were made. It was through the kindness of the Governor's of Guy's Hospital that a solution to this problem was quickly found. The Board of Governors readily agreed to the suggestion that the meals for this special group of persons should be cooked in the hospital kitchens and delivered by Council staff. The new arrangement started from the beginning of October. I was most impressed by the interest and enthusiasm shown by Guy's for this service. The local section of the Womens' Voluntary Service offered to open a luncheon club for experimental period for old people living in the Rotherhithe Area where their premises are situated. The accommodation, utensils and staff were to be found by the W.V.S. and the Council to supply the food. The Council accepted the offer and from the first week in October the club opened on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is every indication that this venture will be successful and there may possibly be justification for it to be extended to more than two days each week. The following table sets out the number of meals provided during the year: Meals on Wheels Municipal Club Weekend Meals W.V.S.

Arrangements were made for 179 elderly people to spend holidays at the seaside and a standard grant was made in each case, the balance of the cost being met by the individual. The same rate of grant was paid to 219 people proceeding on holiday under private arrangements. The Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Council for the Welfare of Old People have for some years arranged afternoon outings for the elderly homebound as these old people rarely have the opportunity of seeing something of the countryside. The Council decided to continue with this greatly appreciated activity and during the year four afternoon outings were arranged consisting of a ride into the countryside with a stop for tea on the way. Those who by reason of infirmity were unable to get to a central point to board the coach were collected from their homes and returned at the end of the day. Some 300 old people participated in these outings, the success of which was in no small measure due to the kindness, courtesy and great consideration shown by the coach drivers. Arrangements were made for fireguards to be fitted in the homes of 37 elderly people. I appreciate the co-operation shown by owners of property in the Borough in helping to reduce a very real risk of accidents to those who are frail and infirm. During the year 82 articles of home nursing equipment held by the Council on behalf of the Red Cross were issued on loan. MUNICIPAL CLUB The Club in its sixth year has considerably increased its membership which now totals 628. The members were fortunate in having made available to them extensive additional accommodation which allowed for an enlarged dining room, a rest room, a television room and an extra recreation room. New furnishings and furniture were purchased with the result that the Club now provides an excellent meeting place for the elderly people of the Borough where they may find companionship, entertainment and relaxation. The programme of entertainments followed the pattern established in previous years, namely Whist Drives, 'Bingo', Old Time Dancing, Darts, and Arts and Crafts classes. Theatre parties were arranged for the annual visit to the pantomime and to see 'My Fair Lady'. Visits were also made to the 'Corona' factory at Finchley and to the 'Ovaltine' factory at Kings Langley. The Club members and the members in the Workrooms chose a trip to Southsea for their Annual Outing and they were accompanied by the Mayor and Mayoress and other Members of the Council. Further outings were also made to the Isle of Wight and to the Kent hopfields. Arrangements were made in May for a group of the membership who are handicapped to be taken to Eastbourne for the day. This particular section of the Club have limited opportunity to join in the Club's activities. However, special arrangements are made on Thursdays to provide transport so that they can be brought to the Club. Plans are in hand for the purchase of an ambulance which will allow them more frequent visits. A member of the staff kindly gave talks, which he illustrated with film, on India, Ceylon and Spain. The Entertainments Officer also assisted during the year by arranging for concert parties to entertain the members. The members in the Workrooms have been fully engaged throughout the year in fulfilling the contracts arranged for them. Some examples of the work undertaken are the assembling of suspender belts, packing knitting needles, preparing manilla folders and cutting braids for braces. It will be seen that none of this work is too exacting. The value of the Workrooms in helping to rehabilitate elderly people who have suffered some psychological upset cannot be underestimated. (17) During the course of the year three old persons agreed voluntarily to be admitted to a home for the elderly and the necessary arrangements were made. Section 50 It is the Council's responsibility under this Section of the Act to arrange for burial or cremation of a person dying in the Borough when there are no relatives, or other persons, who would be prepared to make the funeral arrangements. Where possible in such cases the Council's expenses, inclusive of an administrative charge, are recoverable from the deceased's estate. During the year under report six burials were arranged and particulars of these cases are given hereunder: 1. Miss L. P. Found dead in her flat and burial arranged at the request of next-of-kin who indicated that he could not meet the cost. Council's expenses recovered from deceased's estate. 2. Still-born Body recovered from Thames and burial arranged at request of Coroner's Officer. Cost written off as irrecoverable. 3. Mr.E.J.T. Found dead in his flat and burial arranged at the request of stepson who subsequently met the Council's costs. 4. Mr. J.D. Found dead in men's hostel and, at the request of Coroner's Officer, funeral arrangements made in the absence of any known relatives. Council's costs partly reimbursed from estate. 5. Mr.A.R.A. Body recovered from Thames and funeral arrangements made at the request of Coroner's Officer as deceased's wife, from whom he had been separated for many years, was unable to meet the expense. Council's costs written off as irrecoverable. 6. Unidentified Body recovered from Thames and burial arranged man at request of Coroner's Officer. Council's costs written off. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT 1936, SECTION 122 The Council are authorised to remove and cleanse personal effects where the Medical Officer considers that the condition of such articles is likely to cause the spread of infectious disease. During the year the Medical Officer visited the homes of 11 old people who were seriously ill or senile. Quantities of soiled bedding and personal clothing were found in each case and it was necessary for these articles to be regularly collected for cleansing in the Disinfecting Station and returned to the owners.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH During the year two areas were represented—the New Place Area comprising 67 dwelling houses and 1 shop with dwelling over and the Cherry Garden Street Area comprising 9 dwelling houses. The Borough Council completed 224 dwellings, 192 were in course of erection at the end of the year and plans for 663 were prepared or in course of preparation. 394 families from the waiting list, clearance areas etc. have been rehoused and 328 transfers and exchanges were arranged. This has resulted in 722 families being provided with improved accommodation by the Borough Council. 358 families were rehoused by the London County Council and 18 families were accommodated in new towns. 20 E.F.M. Bungalows were demolished during the year and 80 remain.

Bergman and others, "Thesaurosis due to Inhalation of Hair Spray", New England Journal of Medicine, April 1962, suggested that hair sprays may have been responsible for a condition known as thesaurosis (storage disease), better called "hair spray lung disease" (A. I. G. McLaughlin and P. L. Bidstrup, "The Effects of Hair Lacquer Spray on the Lungs", Food and Cosmetics Toxicology, Vol. 1, 1963). These simulated, in one instance, classical pulmonary sarcoidosis but, more generally, in the others, hilar gland enlargement and diffuse X-ray shadowing in the lung fields. Press and radio publicity was given on the subject in the UK with added warnings on the dangers, especially to hairdressers. PUBLICITY It was thought the condition might be due to types of hair sprays being used containing the plastic polyvinyl pyrrolidone, or those containing shellac. Either this publicity was alarmist or a serious hazard was in our midst about which we virtually knew nothing. A survey to investigate this problem was carried out. First, a nominal roll of all hairdressers and their assistants was made by the public health inspectors, together with the age, sex, period of working at hairdressing, the type of spray being used, and the name of each person's medical practitioner. We felt there would be a potential occupational hazard if one or more persons at risk in Bermondsey showed the signs of this new disease. Accordingly, all hairdressers and their assistants agreed to come to our public health centre for chest X-ray. Approval for this procedure was obtained from their medical practitioners. The survey covered 24 female hairdressing establishments, and included 14 male and 59 female hairdressers. All had been working with hair sprays for at least six months, the majority for several years. Nine different brands of hair spray were being used which, on analysis, were found to contain, with one exception, percentages of shellac varying between 5 and 7 per cent. The one exception contained no polyvinyl pyrrolidone but a nitrogenous film forming resin. The results of the X-rays are summarized in the accompanying table. (31) Total X-Rayed Age Groups 73 Under 20 20-30 30-40 40-50 50 34 25 8 5 1 X-ray results Normal 64 Re X-rayed for comparison purposes and found to be normal 2 Seen by chest physician and myself and declared to be within normal limits 7 Total 73 Conditions in the hairdressing saloons which are regularly inspected by my staff were favourable. In all there was adequate ventilation which I think is the most important factor in the prevention of any chest disease. It can be seen that no person working in female hairdressing establishments in Bermondsey where hair sprays of the shellac type were in continuous use was suffering from any effect that could be described in any way as relating to hair spray lung disease. Perhaps the most useful aspect of carrying out the survey was the personal contacting of the general practitioners by telephone in seeking approval to X-ray their patients. All were keenly interested in the survey itself and readily gave their approval. Several practitioners mentioned that since hair spraying became fashionable they had seen contact dermatitis in a limited number of patients. It occurred at the adjoining areas of skin to hair, namely the neck, the ears and the forehead. In "Hazards of Beauty Culture", Part II, The Practitioner, September 1962, G. Hodgson confirms this when he states "contact dermatitis, usually from the lacquer, is seen on the ear, neck, and eyelids but the arms may also be involved." Thus, an element of sensitivity of the individual to hair sprays is a fact and there is no reason why very rarely individuals may not develop an atypical sensitivity in pulmonary tissues which may eventually lead to storage. It is a possbility, too, that where sprays are used very frequently, solvents or the propellant may affect the mucosa as well in some way, especially the cilia, e.g. "by anaesthetic effect", and prevent their proper functioning, thus allowing conditions favour- able for this unusual storage to take place. Most of the particle sizes of the hair sprays are small enough to enter the alveoli (McLaughlin and Bidstrup). SARCOIDOSIS Dr. Read, general practitioner of Longfield, Kent, whose consent I obtained to X-ray a hairdresser working in Bermondsey, asked me to see a most interesting case of another female hairdresser, aged 28, who had had some 12 years experience and had been using sprays for seven years and who is now well and back at hairdressing in a part-time capacity. She, in fact, in March 1962, had developed erythema nodosum with pyrexia and, subsequently, a classical picture of sarcoidosis developed with X-ray changes in the chest that could be mistaken for hair spray lung disease in view of her occupation. She was treated in York, having temporarily moved to her mother's residence there, where she could be more carefully looked after. I am grateful to Dr. Laing, Consultant Medical Specialist at the County Hospital York, for forwarding full details of this case which indicates that hairdressers using lacquer hair sprays daily are as liable as any other person to develop ordinary sarcoidosis which, fortunately, is rare. I am certain that hair spray lung disease is extremely rare and the diagnosis is not easy. However, withdrawals from hairspraying usually clears the X-ray picture to a variable, but significant, extent fairly quickly. There was no such clearing in the above mentioned case of sarcoidosis despite a long absence from work. Resumption of working in sprays has not affected the X-ray picture at all. The patient is now reasonably fit. In any consideration of the hazards of lacquer hairspray, full reference must be made to the work of Dr. McLaughlin and Dr. Bidstrup whose very full and excellent account in "The Effects of Hair Lacquer Spray on the Lungs" covered a survey of 505 persons working in a representative cross-section of the female hairdressing business in the London area. This survey did not uncover a single case of their spray lung disease. THESAUROSIS However, as in the course of my investigations came the case mentioned earlier of sarcoidosis in a hairdresser from outside the Bermondsey area, so Dr. McLaughlin also had a lady referred to him from outside the London area, but she was proved, by exhaustive investigation, to be a fully established case of hair spray lung disease. It can be seen that the likelihood of developing this disease is still very remote but that, nevertheless, one proved case exists out of 756 hairdressers examined; this being the total in all the various known surveys undertaken so far in the United Kingdom. CLEAN AIR ACT 1956 Surveys of properties in connection with the establishment of Smoke Control Areas continued throughout the year in accordance with the Council's objective of establishing one Area each year until the whole of the Borough is covered. During the year 5,422 visits were made by the staff of the Department. The Bermondsey No. 5 (Leathermarket) Smoke Control Order, 1962 This Order came into force on 1st October, 1963 and details of the Smoke Control Area made by this Order are as follows: — Area: 105.5 acres Types of properties within the Area: Industrial 8 Commercial 233 Dwellings 1,722 Others 19 Of the 1,722 dwellings exemptions were made in respect of 103 dwellings which are situated within Clearance or Redevelopment Areas. Works of replacement and adaption of fireplaces were considered necessary in 998 dwellings and the provision of gas or electric points in 535 dwellings. The estimated total cost of these works is £18,333. The Bermondsey No. 6 (Riverside) Smoke Control Order, 1963. This Order was made by the Council during 1963 and was awaiting confirmation at the end of the year. Details of the Smoke Control Area made by this Order are as follows: — Area: 166·1 acres Types of properties within the Area: Industrial 44 Commercial 240 Dwellings 3,079 Others 30 Of the 3,079 dwellings exemptions were made in respect of 414 dwellings situated within Clearance and Redevelopment Areas. Works of replacement and adaption of fireplaces are considered necessary in 842 dwellings. The estimated total cost of these works is £24,065. 3. 6d. Notification was subsequently received from the Minister of Housing & Local Government that the South Eastern Gas Board were unable to undertake the servicing of the Area so far as supplies of open fire gas coke were concerned. In view of the Ministry's Circular 69/63 and the need for replanning of smoke control areas on a different basis where supplies of open fire coke are not available, the Council were requested to review the fuel and cost estimates for this Smoke Control Order and to submit revised schedules to the Minister. C The fuel and costs estimates were reviewed by the Council and also the question of smoke control areas generally consequent upon the terms of the Circular, and it was decided that no further action be taken in respect of this Order and that the programme for the making of further Smoke Control Orders be suspended. The Council is represented on various bodies dealing with the problems of Clean Air such as the National Society for Clean Air and the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies and a number of Meetings have been attended by the Council's representatives. Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution The extent of atmospheric pollution has continued to be studied during the year in co-operation with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. AIR POLLUTION Few people nowadays are unaware of the blessings of really clean air; a trip outside the London area is usually necessary to obtain it. What of the permanent residents of inner London who breathe polluted air by day and night, year by year ? Obviously they are going to suffer pulmonary effects on a greater scale than rural or seaside dwellers. Statistics amply confirm this supposition insofar as bronchitis and cancer of the lung are concerned.

Pollution from Chimneys In so important a matter what has been done, what is being done and what will be done to attenuate the serious long-term effects of air pollution ? The answer lies in the hands of the residents themselves to demand cleaner air and to act accordingly. There has indeed been a demand and action in Bermondsey. The Council, through its Public Health Committee and its officers, has effected considerable achievements already in lessening air pollution. The effort continues at an ever-greater pace and, well before the original target date for completion in 1970, the whole of the Borough will be covered by smoke control areas. But, of course, controlling the visible smoke from chimneys is not the entire answer to air pollution; invisible sulphur oxides present a considerable problem in themselves. However, recent research suggests that sulphur is more dangerous when combined with carbonaceous particles as in non-controlled smoke emissions. A lot of nonsense has been talked about the efficacy of smoke control under the Clean Air Act of 1956. It is now established beyond any reasonable doubt that the use of smokeless fuel in properly approved appliances has definite beneficial effects for the following reasons: — (i) Bituminous elements having been removed, the fuel burns clearly, i.e., without the greyish/black, yellow tinged smoke. (ii) Efficiency of the old type of coal fire grate is about 25 %, whereas the new approved closed appliances are about 70% efficient. The gain of this efficiency means that only about half the quantity of fuel need be burnt to obtain the same heat and hence sulphur emission will be cut by one-third to a half. (iii) Existing industrial and commercial establishments are inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and advice for the improvement of the plant is given. If this advice is ignored, prosecution can be undertaken. Plans for new premises are only passed if boilers and fires are of the approved type. As far as Bermondsey is concerned, the oil-fired burners of St. Olave's Hospital have an extermely good record and cause no trouble at all. It is not by chance that the hospital is in the centre of a big smoke control area. This is seen on the map as the No. 4 area of 237 acres. Likewise it is not by chance that at the west end of the Borough the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 areas were already in operation from the dates stated on the map. On October Ist this year, No. 5 area comes into operation and this will include New Guy's House and the College. Thus a continuous area of smoke control will stretch along the Borough boundary from London Bridge, through Great Maze Pond, Crosby Row, Long Lane, Weston Street to the Old Kent Road, and eastwards from this boundary to some 250 acres. This should be of undoubted benefit to patients and staff alike at Guy's, as well as residents and other workers in the area. Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey Smoke Control Areas When an area is surveyed for smoke control all houses and premises are visited and a plan prepared. Each fireplace is inspected and an estimate obtained to convert it, if necessary, to an approved appliance, either solid fuel, gas, electricity or oil. When complete, the Minister approves the plan and a date is fixed for the operation of the Act. This involves an immense amount of work. Always the Inspectors have another area coming along so that work continues on two areas at the same time. From an operative date the essential features are:— (i) It is an offence to emit smoke from any chimney and the offender is liable to prosecution; (ii) Only approved smokeless fuel to be used; (iii) Approved methods of lighting fires to avoid unnecessary smoke (e.g. gas pokers). Having dealt with the domestic dwellings, the problem of the large, solid fuel boilers and oil-fired boilers as used in big establishments and factories remain. The conversion over to oil does not necessarily mean an improvement in the sulphur content. Solid fuel D and the crude oils (cheaper oils) contain about 3 per cent of sulphur. To effect an improvement therefore it is essential for conversion that oil to be used should contain not more than 1 per cent. This is aimed at and has shown considerable improvement in the sulphur emission. Some oils are virtually sulphur free but are in short supply. By suitable refining, others can be brought to a low percentage of sulphur but their availability is limited. Kerosine only contains about 0·1 per cent of sulphur but would not be suitable due to possible explosive risks with the type of boilers in use.

Thus, a methodical attack is being made on smoke and sulphur and the results show clearly that it is worthwhile. The extent of the work and estimated cost can be seen from the map and table. From Ist October, 1963, a total of 484 acres will then be in operation out of an area of 1,135 acres, with a total estimated cost of £61,680. The cost of ail adaptation in, for example a £10 estimate will be shared as follows (following approval by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government: —) Owner/Occupier £3 0 0 Council.£3 0 0 Ministry £4 0 0 £10 0 0 Pollution from Vehicles Many people, like myself, have been seriously worried by the vehicle pollution problem. Following discussions with the Director of the M.R.C. Air Pollution Unit at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, it appears that the chimney is still the serious problem. Atmospheric sampling in Blackwall Tunnel, the Archway, North London, in garages and other confined areas apparently does not yield the irritants and carcinogens that chimneys so universally do. Epidemiologists have studied statistics of garage workers, policemen and many occupations where workers are exposed to persistent and varying degrees of exhaust pollution and, so far, we are told, it has not been proved that with these workers there is a special additional hazard in respect of bronchitis and carcinoma of lung. However, at last year's Clean Air Congress, the President of the National Society for Clean Air, Lord Cohen of Birkenhead, in a masterly address, pointed out that Scheper1 has said, "about 3,000 chemical particles have been identified which can be dispersed in air; less than 10 per cent of these we know something about and less than 1 per cent of that which we know is relevant". Therefore it is easily seen what the enormity of the task will be to follow up effectively all known pollutants of air. Lord Cohen also revealed some further American work by Mills 2 : "in an interesting survey of lung cancer deaths in greater Cincinnatti, it was found that there were highly significant correlations between deaths from lung cancer and three other variables, namely cigarette smoking, urban residence, and the number of miles driven annually in urban traffic. In a recent analysis of his findings he asserts that, in general, urban residents exposed in urban traffic for over 12,000 miles per annum exhibit over twice the lung cancer incident rates of those with lesser urban dwelling mileage". I think it is still wise to suspect vehicle traffic pollution as being dangerous, especially at street level. It is clear, however, that all the specific researches are going to take time. Some means must be made available to lessen the intensity of vehicular pollution on our urban highways as soon as possible. To this end the Los Angeles state authority have kept me informed of the progress being made. Temperature inversion occurs there most days of the year; mist comes in from the Pacific and is held by the Rocky Mountains surrounding; dreadful conditions have arisen because of the two million or so vehicles pouring out fume which is trapped. Three interesting effects of this smog have been noted there:— (i) Watering of eyes; (ii) Plants' normal green changed to a silvery colour; (iii) New tyres in stock becoming cracked. Following a thorough investigation during the last three years it was discovered that a chemical reaction was taking place in the smog; the fume, nitrites and sunlight all combining in a reaction to form the complex substance effecting the above three conditions. As a result, various laws were passed, one of which was to provide that by a certain date ahead, all vehicles must be fitted with a state approved exhaust device (either catalytic or flame after-burner, or some other effective invention) to render fume as innocuous as possible. This has led to research and competition to win the approval of the authorities and hence market an effective instrument. There are hopes that a practical solution will be available for world use. Reports so far, however, suggest that, generally, the devices are inefficient when starting from cold, and in slow running. Their effectiveness is in the region of 12,000 miles. However, exhaust pipe fume is not the only contaminent from vehicles; even in a new engine it is thought that "blow by" fume amounts to about 25 per cent of the total exhaust from the engine. "Blow by" fume comes out of the engine breather from the sump and contains, therefore, a high ratio of the mineral oils. This can be overcome to some extent by connecting the breather pipe to the air induction near the manifold and burning the fume in the cylinders. Also spilt oil on a hot engine leads to vaporisation. Worse still, older engines with the invariable oil leaks and overheating, vaporise much oil. The two-stroke engine as well, in which oil is placed in the petrol in definite amounts, presents further unpleasant fume with high mineral oil content, especially when starting up from cold. It is through the conventional radiator grill that polluted air, mostly from vehicles in front in urban areas, passes at great speed and carries also some of the oil fumes from the engine onwards into the car since very few cars really have an effectively sealed body from the engine compartment. This gets worse in time as the various pedal shaft openings loosen up and the rubber seals disintegrate or slip off. The additional contamination from "blow by" oil may be a serious one in view of the report 3 that certain mineral oils used in engines and gearboxes may possess carcinogens in varying amounts. There is also the carbon monoxide problem. Clearly, much research is needed here to confirm or dispel the danger. Body compartments on vehicles should be completely air-tight sealed from the engine. Air intake for heaters should not come from the engine compartment. Car manufacturers should find no difficulty in making the air intake from more suitable sites, and ducting even this air through inexpensive air conditioners (filtered by activated charcoal). A simple procedure on these lines would reduce the pollution burden for drivers who have to work persistently in dense traffic in urban areas. However, all this does not help local residents and workers who have the additional heavy burden of vehicle air pollution to cope with. It is certain, with a vigorous programme of smoke control, that the chimney pollution can be effectively reduced. Progress in overcoming the pollution due to vehicles is at present virtually nil. A walk during business hours along Borough High Street, Tooley Street, Long Lane, Tower Bridge Road, Old Kent Road, or Jamaica Road, reveals the extent of the daily pollution. Something must be done either to reduce the exhaust fume and/or limit vehicles, and it would seem that there is not much chance of either in the immediate future. If ever a benefactor, whether State or private, is needed to fully endow research to clear our roads of this scourge, it is needed now. With hopes focused on the Los Angeles competition, should a practical means be invented to eliminate vehicle fume it would take some time to prove and increase its effectiveness. Then, if really effective, it would take further time to tool up for new vehicles and to fit the device to old vehicles. I am certain that it will be possible to overcome all the difficulties and find the answer but, in my opinion, the tempo of research has been, and still is, far too slow. Smoking Finally, it will be clear from what has gone before that the hazards of air pollution are many. But why add to them unnecessarily ? In a debate as long ago as 1954 at the Royal Society of Health, on smoking. I found it necessary to make the point that although there are the intrinsic hazards of smoking cigarettes per se, nevertheless there is still this further hazard which must be directly linked to all I have said previously, namely the inhalation of polluted air through the red hot ball of the cigarette tip. Here temperatures reach 600° to 800 °C. and the pollutants mix, heat, activate, or combine and react. The opportunities of some of the 3,000 known chemicals (mentioned before) are endless. It is known in industrial medicine that lead poisoning can develop quickly by smoking in certain parts of a lead factory. Similarly, smoking in various occupations where certain dusts or gases may be in the atmosphere increases the risk and speed of toxic reactions. Smoking in the presence of many of the halogenated hydrocarbons causes phosgene to be produced. Smoking in the presence of the dust of "Fluon", a plastic (polytetrafluorethone), is liable to cause symptoms similar to metal fume fever. Of course, the Factories Act, 1961, and the regulations made under it, forbid smoking in specified occupations. These examples relate to very short-term effects in risk occupations. However, persistent smoking in the ordinary way in our air polluted cities over the years must present a very real additional risk as far as bronchitis and cancer of lung are concerned.
