Pursuant to the 119th Section of the "Metropolis Management Act," the Vestry present the Twenty-first Report of their proceedings, under the Acts before mentioned, and of Works completed and improvements effected, during the year ending the 25th day of March, 1877. During the past year, new Paving Works of great extent have been executed, Improvements effocted, and Public Lighting increased, in relating to which the Vestry have been actuated by the desire of extending the benefits thereof as widely as possible, endeavouring to avoid any serious increase of local taxation. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage and Street and House Drainage, &c., at page 4; Highways, New Works, and Improvements, at page 5; Lighting matters as pages 7 and 8; and Sanitary matters by Medical Officer's report, at page 9. The Report also contains an account in abstract, showing the Receipts and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year ending at Lady-Day last; also a summary statement of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These accounts have been duly audited by Auditors elected by the Parishioners. For the purpose of efficient publication, an Abstract Account of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board, from the 1st day of April, 1876, to the 31st day of March, 1877, is set forth at pages 56 and 57. The accounts of the said Board have been duly audited. B 2 4 THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH.

The total number of Public Lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 3241. The cost of Lighting, including the removal of Lamps, new Columns, and sundries for the year ending the 25th March 1877, amounted to £14,202 2s. 2d. There has also been paid for meters £670 8s., and to Messrs. Simson and Wakeford, Parliamentary Agents for opposing the "South Metropolitan," and the "Metropolis Gas Bills," £611 12s. 4d. In the past year 19 memorials and 46 applications were received for improved lighting, in various parts of the parish; 63 of these were acceded to by the erection of new Lamps or removals, and 2 were refused. There have been 115 new Lamps erected, 6 Lamps have been discontinued, and 19 othera have been removed to more desirable positions. From the 29th September 1876, arrangements were entered into with tho London Gas Company, for burning Gas on the average Meter System in the Public Lamps of the Vestry; and up to the 25th March a saving of cost has been effected; but a definite report of the result will be given after the year's experience. The Medical Officer of the Vestry has made periodical Reports of the purity and illuminating power of Gas supplied by the London, Phoenix, and Crystal Palace Gas Companies; and such reports have shown the illuminating power to be above the standard required by the Act, and to be free from Ammonia and Sulphuretted Hydrogen, as will be seen by the following tabular statement, furnished by the Medical Officer. 8 RESULT OF 640 OBSERVATIONS OF THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THE GAS, Made on 72 occasions during the year 1876-77.

(By Order) THOMAS ROFFEY, Vestry Clerk 9 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT For the Year ending Lady Day, 1877. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you the Twentyfirst Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the Parish of Lambeth. In estimating the Mortality of the District, I have pursued the same plan as adopted by my prcdecesors, viz., to deduct stranger's deaths in Public Institutions. To render it more correct, however, the deaths of Lambeth persons who died in Public Institutions without the Parish, during the year should be also included, and notably those belonging to Lambeth who died at Leavesden, Wandsworth, and other Metropolitan Asylums. Next year I hope to be able to furnish these additional data. Being my first report, I have sought to make it as replete with information as possible, so that it may serve as a useful work 10 of reference in comparing the Mortality of the Parish for years to come. With this object also, I have introduced two important Tables, shewing the death-rate in Lambeth, from the two Zymotic Diseases, Scarlet Fever and Small Pox, for the past 18 years. In the year ending 31st March 1877, there were 8970 Births and 5329 Deaths registered in Lambeth. Assuming the population at the middle of the year, viz., on the 30th September 1876, to have been 233,927, the Birth-rate was 38.33 per 1000, and the death-rate 20.56 per 1000. This would follow after deducting the deaths of 519 strangers brought to the Hospitals in Lambeth from various parts of the Metropolis and Provinces. As will be seen on reference to Table I, the above compares very favorably with last year's return, shewing an increased Birth-rate and a lower Death-rate; the Birth-rate being 3833, as compared with 37.21, and the Death-rate 20.56, as compared with 22.11. The excess of Births over Deaths shows the natural increase of population or gain of life for the year. Thus, the Births having numbered 8966, and the Deaths 5329, the natural increase has been 3637 persons (1817 Males and 1820 Females.) No. of Births, Males 4574 Females, 4392 No. of Deaths „ 2757 do. 2572 Natural increase of population, Males 1817 Females 1820—3637 persons. By designating Waterloo Road, 1st and 2nd parts, and Lambeth Church, 1st and 2nd parts, as the Urban Districts; and Kennington, 1st and 2nd parts, and Brixton and Norwood as the Sub-Urban, districts, we have the following facts— 11  Urban Portion. Sub-Urban Portion. Estimated Population 93.728 140,199 Births in 1876-7 4,052 4,914 Deaths 2,542 2,787 Natural increase of Population 15.10 21.27 Birth-rate per 1000 of Population 43.23 35.05 Death-rate ditto ditto 24.37 19.87 As illustrating the effect of the various seasons upon the Deathrates, it may bo stated that if the mortality had continued throughout the year at the same rate which obtained in the June quarter, the year's Death-rate would have been 17.59; if at the September rate, 11.59; if at the December rate, 21.25; and if at the March rate, 23.83. It must be borne in mind, however, that in consequence of an exceptionally mild winter, the mortality in the December and March quarters was much less than usual, the difference in the number of deaths from acute pulmonary affections being such as to reduce considerably the year's mortality; and this in a great measure accounts for the Death-rate of the past year comparing so favourably with previous returns, notwithstanding a severe epidemic of Small-pox. INFANT MORTALITY. The proportion of Infant mortality (under 1 year) was 25.07 per cent, or one fourth of the total deaths in Lambeth, this being slightly better than the rate for the whole of England and Wales which was 25.38 for the year 1876. DEATHS FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Of the 5329 deaths from all causes, 1118 died from the seven 12 principal Zymotic diseases, 251 being strangers in Hospitals. Thus the Lambeth deaths from these causes, were 3.7 per 1000 of the population. Deducting strangers, the deaths were from— Small-pox 221 Measles 107 Scarlet Fever 123 Diphtheria 31 Whooping Cough 119 Typhus Fever 7 Enteric or Typhoid Fever 50 Simple Continued Fever 16 and Diarrhœa 193 Vide—Table II. During the year, 1303 cases of attacks of zymotic diseases were reported to the Vestry, comprising 976 Small Pox, 22 Measles, 250 Scarlet Fever, 8 Diphtheria, 5 Typhus, and 42 Typhoid Fever. In every instance the premises were inspected, and all necessary steps taken in removing the patient where practicable, and in carrying out thorough disinfection. SMALL POX. The total mortality from Small Pox was 371; viz., 20 in the June quarter, 6l September quarter, 129 December quarter, and 1G1 March quarter. The number of strangers who died in the Hospitals was 150, viz., June quarter 7, September 31, December 57, and March 55; making the total number of Lambeth cases 221. One hundred of the Lambeth cases removed to the Hospitals proved fatal, viz., June quarter 9, September 20, December 36, March 35. 13 Of the remaining 121 cases, the patients died at their homes, viz.; June quarter 4, September 10, December 36, and March 71. Early in the March quarter, difficulty was experienced in removing patients to the Hospital, in consequence of the accommodation appointed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board being inadequate for the isolation and treatment of all classes, consequently numbers were compelled to be treated at home, at a time when the disease was most rife in the poorer and more thickly populated districts. Table III. Exhibits the annual mortality from Small Pox in the various districts of Lambeth, since 1860, and the per centage the total bears to the total deaths from all causes, shewing that during the past 18 years, there have died from all causes in Lambeth 78,616 persons, of whom 2,061, or 2.62 per cent, died from Small Pox. Table IV. Relating to 374 fatal cases of Small Pox is important, as shewing the serious consequences of neglect of Infant Vaccination and the need of more stringent measures as to reVaccination at certain periods. MEASLES. There were 107 deaths from Measles during the year, as compared with 102 in the year 1875-6. All the districts shew a decrease from this disease except Lambeth Church 1st part, Brixton, and Norwood. 17 deaths occurred in Lambeth Church first; 16 in Brixton, and 13 in Norwood. 14 The ages at which these 107 deaths took place were as follows:— Under 6 mouths 5 Males. 3 Females. Six and under 12 months 12 do. 9 do. One and under 2 years 24 do. 20 do. Two and under 5 years 21 do. 8 do. Five years and upwards 5 do. 0 do. Total, 107 persons, viz. 67 Males. 40 Females. SCARLET FEVER. The mortality from Scarlet Fever shows 50 per cent, fewer deaths than last year; the numbers being 164, as compared with 335. The decrease took place in all the districts excepting "Waterloo Road 2nd part, and Norwood. Fifty-four deaths occurred in the Hospitals, 41 of them being strangers; the other 13 were Lambeth cases in the Stockwell Hospital. The deaths in the June Quarter were 29 (8 strangers), September 41 (10 strangers), December 75 (20 strangers), and in March Quarter 19 (3 strangers). It therefore appears that out of the total of 78,616 deaths from all causes in Lambeth during the past 18 years, 3493, or 4.44 per cent, died from Scarlet Fever. The deaths for the past year amounted to 3.08 per cent, of the total mortality, being under the average by 1.36 per cent. Of the 123 Lambeth deaths, 60 children died between two and five years old, and 32 between five and fifteen, This is important as pointing to school influence as the means of spreading the infection of Scarlet Fever. Table V. Exhibits the mortality from Scarlet Fever in the several districts of Lambeth in each year since 1860, and the percentage the total bears yearly to the total deaths from all causes. 15 DIPHTHERIA. During the year, 32 persons died of Diphtheria, viz., C in the June quarter, 6 September, 8 December, and 11 March, the number of deaths in the preceding year being 43. The districts which allowed an increase were Lambeth Church 1st part (all 4 cases occurring in St. Thomas's Hospital, one of them being a stranger); Kennington 2nd part and Norwood. The mast marked decrease was in Kennington, 1st part, where 6 oases occurred compared with 20 last year. The following cases may be enumerated as important examples. Two deaths occurred from Diphtheria in a house where a stoppage of a drain took place close to the back door. The drain had been opened and left exposed by the workmen for several days. The servant and nearly all the members of the family suffered from sore throat, and the two youngest children died from Diphtheria at short intervals. Tho house in which the above cases occurred was semi-detached, the two houses being drained together. Two deaths from diphtheria occurred at intervals of three months in a highly respectable family at Brixton. The house was dry, well built, and tho drainage good. There was separate water supply down stairs for domestic use. On the top landing, level with the nursery, was a water closet in which bad smells had been frequently perceived. In a cupboard on the same landing, closely adjacent to the w.c., and within reach, was the cistern supplying the closet, and this being provided with a tap, the children helped themselves to water. Tho water contained in the w.c. cistern was examined, and found to be contaminated with sewer gas. After the first attack of Diphtheria all the cisterns were thoroughly cleansed, and this may account for the long interval taking place between the first 16 and second deaths. The water closet was taken to pieces, when it was found that the waste pipe of the cistern discharged itself into the soil pipe, below the trap of the closet. In this case the W.C. was re-fitted, a ventilating shaft carried from the head of the soil pipe to the roof of the house, and the cistern being on the top landing, thus saving much trouble in the carriage of water for washing purposes, was fitted with a key-tap, so that children could not gain access to it. In another case, where a child died from Diphtheria, running close by the side of the window of a small sleeping compartment occupied by the patient, was a leaky stack-pipe, which had been repaired by another portion of old piping of a different calibre. The end of this pipe terminated in a sealed gully; the water, constituting the trap had become partly evaporated during the hot weather, and what little remained was black from putrescence and in a state of fermentation. WHOOPING COUGH. The year's mortality from W hooping Cough was only 119, as compared with 303 last year. There were 61 deaths in the June Quarter; the mortality declining to 24 in September; 12 in December; and 22 in the March Quarters. In Lambeth Church 1st part, and in Norwood, no death has occurred from Whooping Cough in the latter half of the year. TYPHUS FEVER. Seven cases of Typhus Fever proved fatal to Lambeth residents in the year; the total number of deaths was 23, including 16 strangers in the Stockwell Hospital. The Brixton and Norwood Districts escaped, and only one death occurred in Lambeth, in the March Quarter. The 4 cases in the preceding Quarter (December) were in Waterloo Road 2nd part, and Lambeth Church 1st and 2nd parts. 17 The ages of those who died belonging to Lambeth were as follows:— Five years and under fifteen years 1 Male 2 Females Fifteen years and tinder twenty-five years 2 „ 1 „ Thirty-five years and under sixty-five years 1 „ 0 „ 4 Males. 3 Females. ENTERIC OR TYPHOID FEVER. There were 90 deaths from Enteric Fever, including 40 strangers, and 9 Lambeth cases in Hospitals. Four of the strangers died in St Thomas's, and the remainder in the Stockwell Hospital. Seven of the deaths occurred in the June Quarter (3 of them strangers); 15 in September Quarter (6 strangers); 30 in December Quarter (12 strangers); and 38 in March Quarter (19 strangers). SIMPLE FEVERS. 17 persons classed under the head of Simple Continued Fever died, of whom one was a stranger in St. Thomas's Hospital. DIARRHœA. The deaths from Diarrhoea were 195, as compared with 44 last year; 10 of the deaths occurred in the June Quarter, 150 September, 23 December, and 12 March. Three of the cases were in Hospitals, 2 of them being strangers in the Stockwell Hospital. The four Districts described as the Urban portion of Lambeth, exhibit a decrease of 35 deaths. The 195 deaths comprise only those which were distinctly returned as Diarrhoea, and do not include a large number in which Diarrhoea was only a secondary cause of death; 146 died under one year old. c 18 HEART DISEASE. The number of deaths from the above cause, was 238. Included in the above return for Lambeth Church 1st part are the deaths of 17 strangers in St. Thomas's Hospital. The returns of Lambeth Church 2nd part include 30 deaths from Heart Disease in the Workhouse Infirmary. CONVULSIONS. 163 Infants died of Convulsions. These occurred in the following Districts:— Waterloo Road, 1st part 8 Ditto 2nd „ 25 Lambeth Church, 1st part 15 Ditto 2nd part 39 Kennington, 1st part 34 Ditto 2nd part 22 Brixton 15 Norwood 5 Total Deaths 163 If to this number be added the 201 children under 12 months old, in whose cases Convulsions were stated as one of the causes, but not the primary cause of death, the mortality under this head reaches 364, or an average of one per diem. Thus 41 children under one year died of Bronchitis aud Convulsions, 13 of Marasmus and Convulsions, and the following were the principal of the other primary causes, in which Convulsions participated as a cause of death. Diarrhœa, 35; Dentition, 15; Premature Birth, 10; Whooping Cough, 9; Pneumonia, 9; Inanition, 9; Measles, 8; Congenital Syphilis, 5. CANCER. During the year, 92 persons died of Cancer in Lambeth, including 15 strangers in Hospitals. 19 The above return included 14 deaths (strangers) in St. Thomas's Hospital, one in the Royal Infirmary, Waterloo Road, and one in the Workhouse Infirmary. PULMONARY DISEASES. Table VI. is important as shewing the year's mortality from Affections of the Lungs, specifying some of the principal causes of death. 151 died in the Workhouse Infirmary from the above diseases; there are also included 54 deaths of strangers in the various Hospitals. The number of cases of illness from Epidemic diseases attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers during the year was G84, as will be seen on reference to Table VIII. The total number last year was 552. With the exception of Small Pox, nearly every other Epidemic disease shews a decrease. The number of cases of Measles, was 51 as against 56; Scarlet Fever, 55 as against 173; Whooping Cough, 20 as against 32; Fevers of all classes, 99 as against 128, THE SMALL POX EPIDEMIC OF 1871 COMPARED WITH THAT OF 1876. In the former case, Lambeth was one of the last Parishes in which Small Pox made its appearance, the North and South Marsh Wards being the Districts in which it first broke out. In the month of January, 1871, Stockwell Small Pox Hospital was not ready for the reception of patients, but all the other Small Pox Hospitals were full; consequently the Lambeth Guardians provided a temporary Hospital in the Palace New Road, in the building now used as the out-door department of the Poor Law Dispensary. On January 25th the Stockwell Hospital was opened, affording accommodation to fifteen patients only, C 2 20 but in the middle of February it was in full working order. In the following April, the Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Puckle) reported: "The disease is now most prevalent in the Stockwell and Clapham Districts." Then, as during the recent Epidemic, the Metropolitan Asylums Board did not provide accommodation for the isolation and treatment of all classes suffering from this disease. In the four weeks, ending May 11th, ninety nine persons died in the Stockwell Hospital, twenty of whom only belonged to Lambeth, while forty-six Lambeth patients died at their homes. The efforts made by the Asylums Board were very great, for not only were some of the wards of the Fever Hospital apportioned to Small Pox patients, but a large number of tents was erected in the grounds for the use of the convalescents; but still the provision was inadequate. The Epidemic of 1871 commenced in Lambeth in the early part of January, and disappeared altogether in September, 1873; and, as in the case of the present outbreak, Scarlet Fever was its Epidemic forerunner. SMALL POX EPIDEMIC OF 1876. Lambeth was one of the first Metropolitan Districts in which a death from Small Pox was recorded. Between the months of October, 1875, and March, 1876, the Stockwell Small Pox Hospital had been empty and its wards closed. Early in the month of March a person suffering from Small Pox was admitted from Deptford; the patient died, and also the Nurse who attended him. From this date the disease gradually spread, and in the month of June it was very prevalent in the. Stockwell, Brixton, and Clapham Districts. The total number of cases of Small Pox reported, in which 21 disinfection, &c., was carried out by the Inspectors of Nuisances, was as follows:— Stockwell and Vauxhall Wards 480 Brixton and Norwood „ 222 Bishop's and Prince's „ 136 North and South March „ 138 Total 976 The following are the Streets in which most cases occurred:— Aytoun Road 7 Burgoyne Road 14 Brandon Road 6 Chapel Street 8 Cottage Grove 9 Cornwall Road, Brixton 7 Dalyell Road 17 Edithna Street 7 Cul deSac Elm Grove, Norwood 20 „ Hargwynne Street 12 Landor Road 16 Lingham Street 9 Mordaunt Street 12 Moat's Place 7 Nursery Road 5 Peckford Place 10 Cul de Sac Rossetta Street 8 Stockwell Park Road 8 Stockwell Road 14 South Lambeth Road 10 Wellington Road 7 Vining Street, Brixton 9 Cul de Sac 22 It is important to note, as showing its highly infectious nature now rapidly the disease spreads in Streets forming a cul de sac. It has been shown that the total mortality from Small Pox in Lambeth, including deaths in Stockwell Hospital, was 371, that of these, 150 were strangers to Lambeth, and in 121 cases the patients died at their homes, the greater number of these deaths occurring in the latter half of the year. The difficulty as regards Hospital accommodation was identically the same as in the Epidemic of 1871. The present plan of providing large permanent Hospitals for the isolation and treatment of infectious Fevers admitted from all parts of the Metropolis, appears to be wrong in principle, and one which calls for an immediate remedy. As it is probable that the Asylums Board will soon be invested with powers to provide Hospital accommodation for both classes, it is to be hoped that it will direct its attention to providing a separate Hospital for each parish, or so arrange such accommodation as to prevent the necessity for the great risk and danger, not only to the patients themselves, but to the community at large, in drafting these cases from one Parish to the other through the crowded thoroughfares. If a Parish be treated separately, as regards Hospital accommodation for this class of disease, there would be no difficulty in estimating its requirements, as each Epidemic of Small Pox under the present administration of the Vaccination Laws, must of necessity become less severe. A Hospital of 100 beds, allowing an additional 20 for quarantine and convalescent wards, would probably suffice for the future requirements of Lambeth, with its increase of population. The greatest number of Lambeth cases under treatment in the different Metropolitan Hospitals in any one week was 121, the largest number in Stockwell Hospital being 81. 23 I am in favour of the use of temporary Hospitals with a combined system of Dry earth and strong disinfectants as a means of disposing of the excreta, as opposed to the plan of allowing the drainage of any infectious hospital to be directly connected with the sewarage of a district; for, the possibility of the infection of Scarlet fever and Small Pox being conveyed through our drains and sewers, is a matter to which all Sanatarians should direct sttention. On the Preventive Measures employed in Lambeth during the Small Pox Epidemic, 1876-7. In all cases of Infectious Fevers, it is of the first importance that the Local Sanitary Authority should obtain early information of the sick, and more especially is it necessary that it should bo promptly apprised of the removal of all such cases to Hospital. During my early term of office it frequently happened that many days elapsed before this information reached me. The Guardians, however, promptly responded to my suggestion, that the Master of the Workhouse should supply me with a daily return of all cases in which the Parish Ambulance had been used for conveying persons suffering from Infectious Disease to the Hospitals. This return has been regularly supplied, and the name and address of the patient being given in each case the Inspectors were enabled to cleanse and disinfect the premises soon after the sufferer had been removed. The signal success attending this plan must be as satisfactory to the Guardians as it proved beneficial to the Parish. SMALL POX AT NORWOOD. In the early part of January an outbreak of Small Pox occurred at Elm Grove, Lower Norwood, which consists of two Streets, standing at right angles to each other and forming a cul de sac. 24 The two first cases were those of labouring youths (one of whom was un-vaccinated) employed on an estate in an infected district at Brixton. There were 20 cases, and nine deaths in the two streets. On receiving information of the prevalence of Small Pox in the neighbourhood, which, however, was not until the announcement of the first death, I visited the locality and used all possible means at my command to prevent the spread of the disease. All children residing in the infected District were excluded from school, hand-bills giving instructions as to Vaccination, and showing the penalties for exposing infected articles, &c., were distributed from house to house, the thorough cleansing of all drains and closets was observed, the isolation of the sick, and the speedy disinfection and removal of the dead was in all cases carried out without hindrance. The Clergy and District Visitors rendered very important aid. VACCINATION AND RE-VACCINATION. Observing the number of children attacked by Small Pox under the age of twelve years—the age under which payment for revaccination is not allowed by the Local Government Board to the Public Vaccinators, even during an epidemic of Small Pox.* in the latter part of the year 1876, I directed the attention of the Vestry to the urgent necessity that existed for the examination of all children at our public schools by the appointed Vaccinator, with a view to ascertain whether they were sufficiently protected by primary Vaccination. Under the new system of Compulsory Education it is important to bear in mind, that the children attending our Public Schools * One hundred and one deaths, or more than two-fifths of the total deaths from Small Pox, in Lambeth, were in children under twwlve years of age. 25 represent a very large proportion of the population, and as these are daily congregating in large numbers they become the medium through which infectious diseases rapidly spread. In times of Epidemics of Small Pox, and Scarlet Fever especially, a better organized system of Medical Supervision of our Board Schools is urgently called for. DISINFECTION. Every precaution was exercised in the removal of infected bedding. All infected bedding was first fumigated with sulphur, and as a double precaution, was, upon removal, enveloped in oiled canvas, strongly impregnated with carbolic acid; if old and filthy it was burnt, and new was supplied by the Vestry; this was done in 227 cases. All good flock and feather bedding was disinfected by a process, which consists in first steaming the goods in an atmosphere of strong carbolic acid at a temperature of 280° F.; they are then baked, and the feathers or flock re-dressed. By this plan the bedding is returned to its owner, in a state almost equal to new. The advantages of this method of disinfection ns compared with the ordinary plan of disinfecting by dry heat, are too palpable to need comment, and although much more expensive, it may be the most economical in the end. Great importance was attached to the cleansing and disinfecting of all closets and drains, and where Small Pox was known to occur in Courts and Alleys, disinfectants were supplied to every house. The Parochial Undertaker was specially instructed by the Medical Officer of Health, as to the disinfection and speedy removal of the dead to the Mortuary, where there is a place set apart for the remains of those who died from infectious diseases, and in all cases this was carried out without difficulty. 26 THE NEW MORTUARY. Mr. Dixon ha3 furnished me with the following return. Total number of bodies removed to Mortuary 114 during the year Number of Inquests held 12 Number of post-mortem examinations 7 During the present Epidemic, the Old Dead-house was used for those dying from Small Pox. In all cases where Malignancy prevails or a succession of Fevers happen, I make it a rule, personally to investigate the cause, and when this is not apparent as evidenced by untrappe drains or contaminated water-supply, it is my practice to have the drainage explored from the commencement to its outlet. The following cases are important as showing the frequent necessity for this. (Case No 1.) Double outbreak of Scarlet Fever at Brixton. On the 2lst of January 1876, the first child aged two years and nine months, died of malignant Scarlet Fever after 14 days' illness, and the second, aged three years and nine months, died at the end of 24 days. It was the impression of the parents, that the children contracted the diseaso through visiting a family in which it was supposed there had been Scarlet Fever, but this had no foundation Soon after the deaths of the children, the parents left town for the sea side, and the furniture, bedding &c., were disinfected, and the rooms fumigated. There was no record of any case of infectious Fever having occurred for 12 years previously. 27 During the early part of April, the house was thoroughly cleansed, re-papered, and painted, and let unfurnished, (the stair carpet being the only thing allowed to remain) to a second family, in which there were three children, and within a fortnight of their taking up their residence thereat, all the children were swept off by malignant Scarlet Fever. Satisfied that there was some local cause producing so malignant form of the disease, [directed the drainage to bo thoroughly explored, and in addition to finding the drains all untrapped, I discovered that two large cesspools were at the rear of the house which had been left for surface drainage G years previously, when the premises were drained into tho main sewer. One of the surface-drains waa close to the back door, and the other was in a tool-house in a corner of tho garden, a place which would be sure to excite the curiosity of children coming to a new home. Both cesspits were half full of black decomposing filth. The differenco in the severity of the two outbreaks is striking, as being suggestive of the fact that the infection coming from the first cases was probably intensified by being further subjected to tho influence of Sewer Gas. The cesspools were filled in with lime, and the drains leading to them obliterated, while tho drain-pipes in connection with the main sewer were re-laid and properly trapped. No case of Fever has been reported since. (Case No. 2.) In a house in the Vauxhall district, there were 9 cases of Fever, and 7 deaths, (in three families) reported in 1875—6. On visiting the premises, I found that tho w.c. was on the underground floor and in a very foul and neglected condition, although there was ample water-supply; and as the inmates described the house as 28 being intolerable, early in the morning, from bad smells I directed the whole system of drainage to be thoroughly examined and the soil-pipe of the w.c. to be traced to the sewer. This ran through tho coal cellar, and on examination it was found that it had been placed so superficially beneath the ground, that the coal on being thrown into the cellar had broken several lengths of the piping, so that the floor had become soaked with sewage. Tho door-way of the closet was subsequently bricked up ho as to cut off the communication with the house, an entrance made from tho back yard, and the drainage re-laid. No case reported since. THE WATER SUPPLY. The Water supplied by the Lambeth Company was generally, good. On April 8th however, Dr. Frankland reported it to have contained fungoid growths, and in the month of October moving organisms. The Southwark Companies' water on April 8th, contained blue cotton fibres and moving organisms. On May 6th, moving organisms and confervoid growths, and on June 5th moving organisms, minute worms and fungoid growths. The waters supplied by both companies on several occasions were slightly turbid. METEOROLOGY. The following is taken from the Registrar General's Annual Summary. The mean temperature of the year 1876 at Greenwich was 50°1 Farenheit, which is l°3 above the average of 105 years. It was excessively high in July and August, being 4°3 above the average in July, and 2°9 in August. July was almost rainless. There was a downfall of 24.2 inches of rain in 167 out of the 365 days. The wind swept the earth at the mean velocity of CAUTION. Penalties for wilfully Exposing Infected Bedding, Clothing, &c. Extract from the Pullic Wealth Act of 7866, il Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder who T wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution against spreading J the said disorder, in any street, public place or public conveyance, I and any person in charge of one so suffering who so exposes the I sufferer, and any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does I not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after I it has, with the knowledge of such owner or driver, conveyed any such I sufferer, and any person who without disinfection gives, lends, sells, I transmits or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other tilings which have been exposed to infection from such disorders, shall, on I conviction of such olfencc before any Justice, be liable to a penalty I not exceeding five pounds.

For the purposes of this Section the keeper of an Inn shall be deemed to let part of a house to any person admitted as a guest into his Inn.'' The above, as well as being a Caution to the General Public, applies specially to Marine Store Dealers, Laundry-women, Undertakers, Cabmen, &c. The Medical Officer of Health begs to caution persons against removing any portion of bedding, wearing apparel, or furniture from a room in which any infectious Fever has occurred, and recommends that early communication be made with him, when he will immediately supply all the necessary information for disinfecting, &c. N B.—The burning of infected Articles of Bedding, &c., in the open air is strictly forbidden. ARCHER FARR, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Kennington Green, January, 1877. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH, KENNINGTON GREEN. SMALL POX & SCARLET FEVER. NOTICE.

VACCINATION & RE-VACCINATION. The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth begs respectfully to . direct the attention of Parents and others to the importance and efficacy of Vaccination, and to urge their prompt observance of the following Rules with respect to the same during the present Epidemic of Small Pox. 1.—Infants should be Vaccinated at the age of One Month. 2.— All Children of the age of Five Years and upwards, showing but slight marks of vaccination, should at once be re-vaccinated. 3.—All persons at the age of Twelve Years and upwards who were not re-vaccinated during the Epidemic of Small Pox 1871-72, should be re-vaccinated now. 4.—And all those who were unsuccessfully re-vaccinated during the last Epidemic should have the operation repeated without delay. N.B.—All persons above the age of 12 are re-vaccinated free of charge. VACCINATION STATIONS. District. Station. Public Vaccinator. Days and Hours of Attendance.

At page 39 will be seen the cases in which, on conviction before a Magistrate, penalties were inflicted together with costs. In reference to Table VIII, it will be seen that the work of tho Sanitary Inspectors, in comparison with other years, has been very heavy, and I have to speak in terms of commendation of the prompt and efficient manner in which they have severally discharged their duties.
