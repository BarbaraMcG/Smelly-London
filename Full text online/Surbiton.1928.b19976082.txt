Medical Officer's Annual Report. —— Pubuc HEAlTH Department, Council, Offices, Ewell. Road, SURBITON. July, 1929. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Seventh Annual Report dealing with the health and sanitary condition of the District for the year ending December 31st, 1928. This Report is drawn up according to the directions set forth in a Memorandum sent by the Ministry of Health, and is therefore of a statistical character. There has been a steady increase in the population, the estimated population for 1928 as sent by the Registrar General is 22,340. I have great pleasure in stating that the health of the District is still maintaining a good standard and especially the Infantile Mortality rate which is only 16.78 per 1,000 births. The comparison between this and the figures for England and Wales (Smaller Towns) is shown on page 9. 6 The most important feature that occurred during 1928 was the running of a Health Week in the form of a Health Exhibition, Baby Show, and Lectures. This was the third attempt and owed its success to the capable way in whic It was carried out by the Honorary Organiser, assisted by the Staff of all departments of the Council. The estimated number of persons who visited the Exhibition amounted to 6,000, representing a daily average of 1,000. The Lectures dealing with different health subjects were well patronised. Meat inspection still occupies a good deal of the Sanitary Inspector's time, especially outside office hours. I have to thank Mr. Nesfield and his Assistant for their assistance during the year. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. H. LINZEE, Medical Officer of Health. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

The group of other defined diseases contain the majority of deaths, and of those specified, Cancer heads the list, followed by deaths due to Heart Disease, Arterio-Sclerosis and Pneumonia. No special cause of mortality was apparent during the year. Influenza increased during the latter part of the year The causes and ages at death of the 5 children who died under the age of 1 year were as follows:— Syncope, Atelectasis 16 days. Prematurity 3 days. Acute Bronchitis 5 months. Haemorrhagic Disease of Newborn 1 week. Atelactasis Pulmonum, Excessive cranial pressure during birth 4 hours. There were five deaths of children under one year. This gives a rate of 16.78, which is the lowest on record for Surbiton, and also the best for the County of Surrey. The rate for Surrey is 47.26, and that for England and Wales (Smaller Towns) 60. The various rates compared with those for England and Wales (Smaller Towns) are given in the table below:— Per 1,000 Diving. Per 1,000 Births. Births. Deaths. Diarrhcea under 2 years. Under 1 year.

There is, however, a great decline in the number of cases of Pneumonia, but the deaths from Pneumonia remain the same, thus showing that Pneumonia during 1928 was probably of a more virulent type. 11 TOTAL CASES NOTIFIED.

No cases of Small-pox occurred in the District, although there were several in the neighbourhood. The rate for Puerperal Pyrexia continues to rise. This is accounted for by the fact that regulations were put into force by the Ministry that all temperatures occurring after birth of 99.4 and over were to be notified. Previously these cases were not notified. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA. Hospitals. 1. Fever.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply througout the District is furnished by the Metropolitan Water Board. It is of excellent quality and the supply to all houses is constant. RIVERS AND STREAMS. It has not been found necessary to take any action with regard to the pollution of Rivers and Streams in this area. The Thames Conservancy are responsible for the inspection of the Thames and its tributaries , to ascertain if there is any pollution, and I have had no communication from their officials in regard to such matter. 19 DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. New surface water sewers have been constructed in:— Red Lion Road Corkran Road Lovelace Road Brighton Road, Balaclava Road and new soil and surface water sewers in the following roads : — Princes Avenue Kingsmead Avenue Mayroyd Avenue Oakleigh Avenue Hamilton Avenue Elgar Avenue extension Beresford Avenue Queen's Drive, Lyndhurst Avenue. Considerable additions are now contemplated in regard to the Council's Sewage Disposal Works, plans for which are now in course of preparation. WATER CLOSETS. All closets in the District, with the exception of a few at Worcester Park, which is outside the drainage area, are on the Water Carriage system. SCAVENGING. During the year the method of transport of house refuse has been altered from that of Electric and Petrol Vehicles to the Tractor-Trailor system, with which certain economies have been effected. Owing to the increased bulk of House Refuse 20 it will be necessary in the near future to carry out additions at the Dust Destructor. CEMETERY. In March, 1926, an additional portion of the land purchased for cemetery purposes was drained and laid out for burials, and the first interment in the added portion took place on 16th May, 1928. There are 1,694 grave spaces in this added portion. SANITARY INSPECTION OF AREA. This is fully dealt with in the report of the Sanitary Inspector, which is attached hereto.
