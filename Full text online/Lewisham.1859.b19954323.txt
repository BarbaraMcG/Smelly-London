Five deaths have occurred from epidemic diseases, namely— One typhus fever, Cross Street, Lewisham. One scarlatina, Lewis Grove, Lewisham. One diptheria, Blackheath Hill, Blackheath. One Fever, Lower Sydenham. Influenza, Church Meadow, Sydenham. Hooping Cough, Upper Sydenham. Three deaths have occurred from inflammation of the air passages. Two have occurred from consumption. Cases of smallpox have occurred in Willow Road, Sydenham. A few cases of measles have occurred, but this epidemic has declined in intensity. The following localities require your attention for their sanitary welfare:— Lewisham Road (Lime Kiln Lane), Lewisham. Hither Green Lane. Ladywell. Open drain. Orchard Place and Laurel Brook, Perry Hill; of the latter several complaints have been made. St. Germains Road, Brockley Lane. Verey's Cottages, Sydenham. The drainage of Mr. Stott's house, Sandwell Place, is in a state requiring attention. The children are ill, and the whole of the soil round the house seems to be infiltrated with sewage. 10 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches.

During the same period last year forty-six deaths were registered. The health of the district in some parts (viz., those suffering from insufficient or offensive drainage) is, however, not quite so good as the above satisfactory returns would lead us to suppose. Four cases of smallpox have been brought under my notice; and as in all the metropolitan districts this disease is more than ordinarily prevalent, it is necessary that the strictest attention should be paid to vaccination, to annihilate this fearful disease. A superior ladies' school in Sydenham has been broken up in consequence of a death from malignant sore throat (diptheria), but the disease does not appear to have originated in that establishment, although the houses drain into an open ditch a few yards from the termination of the Park End sewer. Some cases of malignant scarlet fever have occurred in West Kent Park ; and hooping cough is extensively prevalent in the whole district. I have to lay before you a few remarks as to the drainage of this district, varying in character according to the nature of the soil. Thus (as I pointed out to you in my first Report in January, 1856, would be the case), in Blackheath and Lewisham (gravel and sand) the causes of complaint are principally from leakage and soakage of sewage; whereas, in Sydenham and Penge (clay), the causes of complaint arise from the inability of the soil to receive liquid, and the consequent offensive overflow of sewage upon the surface and into ditches. Blackheath.—The cottages in Phoenix Vale require improved drainage, as well as a supply of water. The pump which supplies all these cottages is out of repair, and requires immediate attention. The offensive open privies in Pound's Mews remain the same as when reported in 1856. At Mr. Matthews's, grocer, and the adjoining house, the contents of the cesspool ooze into the well and contaminate the water, which is unfit for drinking; a sewer is required here. Lewisham (Sandwell Place).—The porous strata are percolated by the contents of cesspools. Mr. Stott, the Union Medical Officer, informs me that his family have been suffering from fever, and that he shall, at great expense, be obliged to remove unless 11 something is done to relieve the necessities of this locality. This has been several times brought under the notice of the Board. In Willow Walk, Rushey Green, two offensive privies remain, viz., at Mrs. King's, and Mr. Neil's; the order of the Board to supply closets never having been carried out. An offensive smell is complained of in two houses in James Place, inhabited by Mr. Purdon and Mr. Perch. Beyond the Black Horse, Mr. Blackshaw's, Mr. Crispy's, Mr. Sweetlove's, the houses require dust-bins and water supply. Although closets are, in most instances, erected, no water is at present supplied. Sydenham.—The Conservative Land Society, Brockley, represent their land to leaseholders as properly drained. The offensive smell from the overflow of drainage into the ditch from the two houses already erected proves the contrary to be the fact. An increased number of houses will materially increase the evil, therefore the Society should be compelled to carry its sewer into the main. The houses in Perry Vale (Rutland Terrace) run their overflow sewage into the ditch, which, since their construction, has been comparatively free from drainage. This is a most serious and offensive evil, as it not only renders the whole course of the ditch offensive, but adds to the contamination of the Ravensbourne. The drain in Dartmouth Park should be connected with the Stanstead Lane sewer through the small extent of road which separates them. Drainage still runs through the ditch into the fields, rendering the benefit of the sewer comparatively nugatory. Verey's Cottages, Perry Hill, throw a mass of offensive sewage into the ditches by the side of the road into the Ravensbourne. Verey's Cottages and Brewery, Lower Sydenham, also drain offensively into the ditch communicating with the Pool River. This is increased by a flow (whether accidental or otherwise I am unable to say) from the Sydenham Gas Works. The inhabitants of Orchard Place (where, the Union Medical Officer informs me, there is always low fever) use the water from the stream for drinking and other domestic purposes, fouled as above, and contributed to by their own supply of drainage. Laurel Brook, close by Orchard Place, is a perfect swamp in wet weather from obstructed drainage, and certainly requires attention. A gully into the sewer is required to drain the road under the railway by Mr. Pegg's, coal-merchant. The cab-stand, near the Sydenham Station, also requires repaving and draining. Penge.—The drainage of a portion of Upper Norwood and Anerley, after running over an extensive surface, still enters the portion of canal in Anerley gardens. The offensive smell, decidedly prejudicial to health, has been often complained of. The drainage of the Crystal Palace and Penge is far from satisfactory. The ditch into which the drainage debouches from the former place requires covering to complete that part of the drainage. The mass of liquid falling here has washed away the earth, so as to render the sides dangerous. The smell, at times, is most noxious and deleterious to health. The conjoined drainage, running into the Pool River, contaminates the Ravensbourne water to an alarming degree. If no better plan can be adopted, there is a most convenient situation for deodorizing and filtering: a plan successfully adopted at the North Surrey School. An accident, which might have led to serious results, occurred in the chapel at the North Surrey District School, owing to the fall of a section of the ceiling with the rafters. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

During the same period thirty-eight deaths have been registered; a number a little above the average for the last four years, but less than the number registered during four weeks last year. The mortality in some parts of the district has been small. Thus, in Lewisham no death has been registered since the 4th of June; and in Blackheath and Penge the health of the inhabitants, as evidenced by the returns of mortality, has been favourable. In Sydenham twenty deaths have been registered, a number greatly above the average. Scarlet fever has been prevalent in parts of the district, with a few cases of smallpox, and hooping cough still continues. Zymotic disease has destroyed eleven lives; nine deaths from this cause have occurred in Sydenham, and two in the Blackheath Ward. The localities in which this mortality has occurred arc as under:— Blackheath.—Lewis Cottage, Scarlet fever. Bridget Place, Intermittent fever. Sydenham.—West Kent Park, Scarlatina, malignant, 24th May. Ditto, Malignant scarlet fever, 24th May. Ditto, ditto, 29th May. Perry Hill, ditto, 5th June. Sydenham Park, Hooping cough, 5th June. Kirk Dale, ditto, 5th June. West Kent Park, Malignant scarlet fever, 12th June. Wells Road ditto, 14th June. Bell Green, Croup, 19th June. I have several times brought the state of West Kent Park under the notice of the Board since 1856. It is still of the utmost importance to pay some attention to its sanitary requirements. Most of the houses arc inefficiently drained and offensive; and the sewer in the North Road requires to be connected with the main in Brockley Road. Five deaths have occurred in this locality at the end of the North Road, and these deaths might, in all probability, have been prevented if due attention had been paid to the state of drainage in the locality. In the house in which the mortality has been caused, the pipe opening into the cistern from the cesspool is untrapped, and contaminates the water used for drinking; and cesspools of an offensive kind have existed; added to which, the gullies are very offensive in the neighbourhood, and the main drain contains (in my opinion) a quantity of offensive and poisonous sewage. A similar epidemic to the above prevailed in Lower Sydenham in 1851, since which the house-drainage in that locality has been but little improved. I consider it highly objectionable that persons suffering from malignant disease should be removed to hospital in the ordinary public carriages, as likely to spread disease indefinitely. A vehicle for such purposes should be provided. (I brought this under the notice of the Board in 1856.) The drainage at the back of High Street, Sydenham, is still very imperfect. Drainage from a slaughter-house runs at the back of the houses in Willow Road. Drainage is again oozing into the ditch opposite Jew's Walk from Westwood House. A drain is required at the back of the Forester Inn to communicate with that in Dartmouth Park; at Mrs. Milton's, Forest Hill Terrace, the neighbour's cesspool, although partly emptied, is overflowing, offensive, and prejudicial to health. 13 A quantity of offensive sewage still runs at the back of Park Road Terrace, Dartmouth park this is extremely offensive. A connection should be made between this and the Stanstead Lane sewer. The drainage from Mr. Smith's houses, Rutland Terrace, should be taken into the Dartmouth Park sewer; these, and a few other houses, render the ditch along Perry Vale very offensive, and contaminate the stream. At Mrs. Appleton's, Lewisham, the drainage is extremely filthy: attention is required there immediately. The air-hole to the sewer in Avenue Road allows the escape of foetid gases. Several houses are in course of erection at Anerley, but no system of drainage is at present commenced. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches.

Industrial School. — — — 1 — 1 Total 24 19 43 20 11 31 Gentlemen, During the month ending upon the 23rd of July, forty-three births and thirty-one deaths have been registered. The mortality is, as nearly as possible, the average of the last four years; but, calculating for increase of population, is decidedly below the mortality which might have been expected from previous experience; and the health of this district bears a favourable contrast when compared with others of the metropolitan area. Three deaths only have taken place from zymotic disease, viz.:— Hooping cough, Raglan Street, Sydenham. Erysipelas, Upper Sydenham. Diarrhœa, Russell Square, Blackheath. Three deaths have been registered from congestion of the brain, produced by exposure to the sun's rays. A case of smallpox has occurred in a young man (not vaccinated) resident in Raglan Street, and who was sent to the Smallpox Hospital; other members of the family have been vaccinated, and the disease has not spread; although, from the nature of the locality, likely to do so. Diarrhœa has been extensively prevalent in the whole district during the past fortnight, but only one death has been registered from this cause. 14 Hooping cough still continues common. The temperature of the air reached its highest point on Monday, 23rd July, the thermometer indicating 93° in the shade. During the previous week the average was 69°, i.e., nearly 8° above the average for the last forty-three years. Sandwell Place, Lewisham.—Depraved health has been the result of the undrained state of this locality so often earnestly brought under your notice. Two families have been obliged temporarily to remove their children in consequence. A sewer is required. West Kent Park, Sydenham, is still insufficiently drained. The houses in North Road, in which five deaths from scarlet fever were reported last month (produced or aggravated by want of attention to drainage), are still in a most offensive state, although the insufficient drainage is supposed to be remedied; Mr. Cowburn's cottages, Lower Sydenham, are still undrained. Penge.—The small stream conveying the sewage of the Crystal Palace through the Green Lane into the Ravensbourne, so often brought under your notice, is still uncovered and offensive; it has also so washed away the bank at its exit from the mouth of the sewer, that a house situated at its edge is in danger of falling. This has been brought under your notice before—more than once—but the danger increases. Two new houses (in course of construction) adjoining the grounds of the North Surrey District School have been allowed to drain into a cesspool with outfall into the ditch; as, of course, this cesspool will be rapidly filled (clay soil), the overflow will be a disgusting nuisance, dangerous to health, before long. The managers of the North Surrey School were ordered by you, not long since, to remove the drainage of their lodge from the same ditch. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air.

The mortality (calculating for increased population) is not above the average, though larger in number than during the corresponding month of last year. Five deaths have occurred from consumption (tubercular class). Thirteen deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, i.e., disease produced by 15 causes which are preventible or removable; the localities in which they have occurred are enumerated below, viz.:— In Lewisham— One scarlatina and diptheria, Lewisham Park. One fever and diptheria, Ditto. One scarlatina maligna, Exchequer Place. One gastric remittent fever, Hanover Street. One scarlatina maligna, Mid Kent Cottages, Blackheath— One diarrhoea, Dartmouth Passage. One fever, (Dartmouth Grove. One diarrhoea, Mount Nod Place, One fever, Bush Place. Penge— One diarrhoea, Penge Village. One ditto, Alma Terrace. One scarlatina maligna, Anerley Vale. In Sydenham no deaths have taken place from zymotic disease. Diarrhoea has been extremely prevalent, but generally of a mild form. A case, attended by cramps and collapse, occurred at the North Surrey Industrial School, Anerley, and recovered. Scarlet fever and hooping cough arc more or less prevalent in most parts of the district. I wish to call your attention to the undermentioned nuisances :— In Blackheath— The water closet attached to the Literary Institution is without water supply, although situated in the building. The dungheap in the yard adjoining Mr. Wray's, stationer, is full and offensive; it should be emptied daily. A filthy dungheap (which evidently has been accumulating some timo) and insufficient slaughterhouse exist at Mr. Williams's, pork butcher. No water is supplied to the following houses:—Mrs. Gerrard, Townsend, and Quail, and adjoining house, Collin's Square. At Mr. Thomson'8, flyman, offensive water occasionally flows from the yard, owing to the absence of drainage. At Pound's Mews the privy is full, and no drainage; a large accumulation of dung is in the yard, one heap of which is placed against the pump, into which it drains. This pump supplies several families. At Mr. Matthews's, milkman, &c., there is still offensive drainage, and contaminated water. I have examined the premises of Mr. Buckingham, linen-draper, at whose house serious illness (and one death) has occurred, attributed by the medical man in attendance to the deleterious state of the drainage, and accumulations. I am informed by the inhabitants that, upon the sewer being put down in this place, the liquid contents of the cesspool only were removed; the solid contents being allowed improperly to remain. At all events, the ground is saturated with the contents of an offensive and dangeroug nature, and the yard has been lowered considerably, so as to get more deeply into the filth. A water closet belonging to the neighbours (the fishmonger and poulterer adjoining) is in danger of falling, and has no supply of water whatever. The pipe drains under Mr. Buckingham's house, I am also informed, are only cemented with clay, which, in a porous soil, I hold to be insufficient. (This I mentioned in my first Report.) The drainage of Montpelier Row, &c., into cesspools, liable to contaminate the drinking water around, ought to be remedied. Lewisham— At Perrin's Buildings, Lewisham, the houses are in a dilapidated state, and the only privy which supplies these houses is completely full, and without water supply. This requires immediate attention. At Hurst's Cottages, Loampit Vale, the closets are without water, and very offensive and dangerous to health. In Sydenham— The houses belonging to Mr. Brown, in West Kent Park, require immediate attention. 16 In the North Road the houses occupied by Squire, and adjoining, are still in an offensive state. The houses in the same road, occupied by Mrs. Early, and adjoining, are also filthy and undrained; a cesspool, which ought not to exist here, is overflowing. The houses in the adjoining road, occupicd by Mr. Bax, and others, are in a similar state. A drain runs from Shaw's Cottages, Perry Vale, and is offensive, and requires covering. The cesspool, and overflowing privies at Hamburg Terrace, urgently require attention; they are in a most alarming condition. The cesspool overflows for some distance into the school-ground of Mr. Marshall in the Park Road. At the Bird-in-Hand Cottages (Lower Sydenham), Mr. Verey's property, a most offensive smell arises from the adjoining dirty yard. In the houses near Mr. Loveland's (Lower Sydenham), the privies are overflowing, and require immediate attention. Pigs are kept in an offensive manner upon each side of Mr. Couldery's (Lower Sydenham), Bell Inn. Penge— At No. 3, Anerley Vale, pigs are kept in an offensive manner, and are complained of by Mr. Thomas Smith. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual.

Of these, nine deaths have taken place from zymotic disease, seven from phthisis; but none from other diseases of the chest. The localities and causes of death from zymotic disease are enumerated below, thus:— Blackheath— One fever, Elliot Place. One scarlatina, Montpelier Vale. One diarrhoea, Ordnance Row. 17 Lewisham— One scarlatina maligna, Mid Kent Cottage. One ditto, ditto. One diarrhoea, Silver Street. Sydenham— One diarrhoea, Wells Road. One ditto, West Kent Park. Ono carbuncle, pyaemia, Rutland Terrace. Seventeen deaths have occurred in thoso whose age had not reached ten years, five in those above fifty, five in those above sixty years, and four in those above seventy years. With regard to the health of the district, I have to report upon the existence of many cases of fever in Lewisham; the existence of a generally mild form of scarlet fever, and inflammatory sore throat in several parts of the district (the latter occasioned by the humid state of the atmosphere), and mumps endemic at the North Surrey School at Anerley. The fever at present prevalent at Lewisham, has, in former years, always spread; and Mr. Stott, the Medical Officer of the Lewisham Poor Law District, informs me that he attributes the fact of the disease not spreading on this occasion to the great improvements which have, comparatively at a recent date, been made in the drainage of the place, an opinion in which I fully concur; but the very existence of this disease indicates that, though much has been done to purify the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of our homes, and render the supply of drinking water easy of access and of a pure quality, yet, still much remains to be done, and I believe that we must never be satisfied until every court, alley, and street is rendered dry, and every house made to communicate directly with the sewer; I say directly, as many houses, supposed to be drained, still retain receivers, or cesspools; and others only communicate with the sewers through the medium of old drains, occasionally constructed in the ditches which existed, and still do exist, although covered over. Several neighbourhoods require improvement:—Sandwcll Place, Lewisham. In some families residing hero constant ill-health is kept up by the want of proper drainage. Montpelier Row, Blackheath; Paragon Mews, Wells Road; and West Kent Park, Sydenham. The drainage of Ravensbourne Villas, Stanstead Lane, is very defective. The road at back of Forester Inn, leading to Hindsley's Place, Sydenham, is in a dangerous and offensive state. Water supply is still urgently required by many of the inhabitants of this district.

In the Blackheath Ward only one death has been registered. The health of the district has been generally good, an unusually small amount of sickness having prevailed; but still epidemic poison has attacked those living in unfavourable localities, and therefore, in a favourable state for the reception of disease. Amongst the causes of death I have to mention the following eight, with the situations in which they have occurred:— Lewisham— 27th Sept., Typhus, Rushey Green. 3rd Oct., Diarrhoea, Hanover Street. Sydenham— 23rd Sept., Diarrhoea, Back of Bird-in-Hand, Forest Hill. 30th Sept., Croup, Raglan Street. 28th Sept., Hooping cough, West Kent Park. 8th Oct., Diptheria, Bath Place. 10th Oct., Scarlet fever, Sydenham Place. 19th Oct., Scarlet fever, Rock Hill. The offensive drain at the end of Raglan Street, Sydenham, still remains the same as formerly. The roads in West Kent Park are, some of them, almost impassable ; and the whole of the ground is insufficiently drained. At Bath Place, Wells Road, the drainage is insufficient; and no water is supplied to flush the closets. The death from scarlet fever on Rock Hill occurred in a brickmaker's undrained hut. The road at the back of the Forester Inn, leading to Hindsley's Place, is one impassable swamp. A severe case of dysentry has occurred here. Lewisham— Some months ago I reported upon the state of Hope's Cottages, Lewisham; they are as then, and require your attention on account of their insufficient drainage, and total want of water supply. The state of Pear Tree, or Schloss Alley, in which cholera commenced in 1849, and in which fever is now occurring, requires prompt attention. Penge— The drainage of the upper part of Norwood still runs into the pond, or piece of old canal bounding one side of the Anerley Gardens. This is at times, in the summer, extremely offensive, and it is important that some means of diverting the sewage into a covered tract should be adopted. Frorn the constant building, and, therefore, constant accession to the quantity of sewage, this^ has become daily more necessary, and the better course would be, in my opinion, to insert a sewer and drain away the water altogether. It would be well to take the subject into consideration at once, as, in case the latter plan should be adopted, the winter season would be the safest time to expose the filthy mud accumulated under the water. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. 19 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

Thirty.one deaths have occurred, which is under the average number for the last four years. Although the cold has been for some days below freezing, the temperature has not remained in a depressed state sufficiently long to have produced its usual fatal effects upon the aged. In the the Blackheath Ward only one death is registered during the month. Scarlatina has been very prevalent during the month; two cases of smallpox have also occurred, but no death has taken place from this latter disease. A family of the name of Lester, Hanover Street, Sydenham, have all been suffering from fever; the offensive smell arising in this house has been complained of several times. The deaths occurring from epidemic disease are as under :— Lewisham— 2nd Nov., Typhus fever, Union Workhouse. 10th Nov., Hooping cough, Lady Well. 17th Nov., Diarrhoea, Stratford Place. Sydenham— 21st Oct., Scarlet fever, Greyhound Inn. 20th Oct., Bilious fever, Upper Sydenham 23rd Oct., Scarlet fever, Bath Place. 23rd Oct., Scarlet fever, Willow Road. 26th Oct., Scarlet fever, Willow Road. 29th Oct., Scarlet fever, Willow Road. The state of the drainage in Willow Road, in my opinion, is very unsatisfactory; although a main sewer is in the road few houses use it. It has been my duty repeatedly to call your attention to diseases in this locality evidently taking their origin from some local miasm; and, in this month's report, again three deaths from scarlet fever are recorded. 20 A house at Lewisham, Rushcy Green, inhabited by Mr. Parker, shoemaker, is in an ffensive state; the wife is suffering from fever. The houses at the back are much complained of as being in an offensive state, and the drainage obstructed. Several cases of fever have occurred here.

Seven persons have died from diseases of the chest, and six from zymotic disease, as enumerated below:— One from smallpox, Union Workhouse, Lewisham. One „ scarlatina, Scuddcr's Row, Sydenham. One „ scarlatina, Lower Sydenham. One „ scarlatina, Lower Sydenham. One „ scarlatina, Upper Sydenham. One ,, fever, Dartmouth Terrace, Blackheath. Oi these no deaths have taken place in Lewisham during the month (the case of smallpox recorded was removed front Eltham), and I am again corroborated by the opinion of the Poor Law Medical Officer in speaking of the improved health of the village since the carrying out of the plan of drainage. Some cases of fever exist in Sandwell Place, which renders it of additional importance that the house drainage should be carried as quickly as possible into the main, so judiciously constructed, and the cesspools be completely emptied and cleansed. If in any way to be avoided, drains should not bo carried under the floors of houses, especially in such a porous soil as that of Lewisham and Blackheath. If this is necessary, each joint of drain pipe should be perfectly cemented. We have instances of tho evil results attending the want of care in this matter. Lower Sydenham and some parts of Upper Sydenham require careful attention to drainage which is in some parts quite neglected, and consequently deaths arc frequently reported to you occurring from zymotic disease. 21 In West Kent Park, Grove Road, four houses belonging to Mr. Brown, and in the occupation of Mr. Powell, Mrs. Fennel, Mrs. Young, and Mr. Burrows, are in a disgraceful state of damp and absence of drainage. In Penge the houses at the back of the Crooked Billet are in an offensive state from want of proper drainage. The roads, principally in the neighbourhood of Sydenham and Penge, are now in a most unwholesome state of dirt, principally from the deposit being seldom cleared away; the road contractors are negligent in this particular. In Russell Street, Sydenham, the road has been left in a most incomplete condition since the construction of the sewer. Remittent fever (principally amongst children) is very prevalent over the whole district. Measles and hooping cough are also somewhat prevalent. The former disease lias made its appearance at the North Surrey District Schools. No case of smallpox has occurred during the month. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air.

The number of births during the month ending upon the 21st instant has been sixtyfive. The number of deaths during the same period has been forty-four. This number is greatly in advance of that of former years, and also above the average for the last five years. This is, in part, attributable to the great increase in the mortality from inflammation of the air passages ; twelve having died from pneumonia and bronchitis during the month, eight of which deaths have occurred in Lewisham Village, one in the Workhouse, two in Blackheath, and one in Sydenham. 22 The deaths from zymotic disease have been six, and the localities are undermentioned, viz., in Lewisham— One typhus fever, Stratford Place. One measles, Rushey Green. One smallpox, Union Workhouse. Sydenham— One remittent and puerperal fever, Park. One fever, West Kent Park. North Surrey School— One measles and pneumonia. Twelve deaths have occurred in those above the age of sixty years (one of whom numbered ninety years). Eighteen deaths occurred amongst children under five years of age. Remittent fever (attended with peculiarly offensive excretions) is very prevalent in the district. Some cases of scarlet fever are also at Penge. Measles is endemic in the North Surrey Industrial School. One case of smallpox has occurred at King Street, Lewisham ; and one at Perry Yale, Sydenham. Fever is very prevalent at Southend, Lewisham, and is attributed by the medical attendants to a large quantity of offensive mud which has been removed from the bed of the river and exposed upon its banks, where it still lies. This should be removed, or means be taken to remedy any evil which may arise from it. I beg to call your attention again to the extremely filthy state of some of the roads in the clay portion of the district; they are most unwholesome, and require your power to urge their being put into proper repair. I allude to Hamlet Road, Penge. Hindsley's Place, Sydenham. Russell Street, Sydenham. Willow Road, Sydenham. West Kent Park, Sydenham. Paxton Park, Sydenham. The drainage of West Kent Park is also very inefficient; many of the houses are very damp, and the inhabitants seem peculiarly liable to the attacks of disease. The gully holes are also still dangerous and offensive. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer. Prevailing winds.

Sixty-two births and fifty-one deaths have been registered during the four weeks ending upon the 18th of this month (February). In some parts of the district the mortality has been principally amongst the aged, thus:—In Blackheath and Lewisham twelve of the registered deaths have occurred in those whose ages varied from sixty-five to ninety-five years. (Six died above the age of eighty.) On the contrary, in Sydenham and Penge the deaths have occurred principally amongst the young; eight deaths have been registered in children under six months old. The deaths from pneumonia and one from bronchitis amount to six. Six have also died from pulmonary consumption, and five deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, viz.:— One diptheria, Sydenham Park. One diptheria, Thorn's Place, Lewisham. One confluent smallpox, Essex Place, Blackheath. One measles, Lewisham. One smallpox Union Workhouse. A few cases of smallpox (about seven in number) have occurred in various parts of this district, but are generally doing well, as reported by their medical attendants. Measles and hooping cough are prevalent at llushey Green, and in some other parts of the district. Scarlet fever has been reported as prevalent at Blackheath, but no death from this cause has taken place in this district, and the report has been exaggerated. The attack of measles reported to you as existing at the North Surrey School has nearly disappeared, and most of the patients are doing well. The typhoid fever, reported upon last month, still exists at Southend. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air.

In Blackheath, Lewisham, and Penge the number of births and deaths have been equal. In Sydenham the births exceeded the deaths by ten. Thirteen deaths have taken place from zymotic disease, viz., in Blackheath— March 2, Scarlatina, Montpelier Row. „ 3, Scarlatina, Montpelier Row. „ 2, Measles, Mill Cottages. „ 21, Hooping cough, Spencer Place.

Measles had been very prevalent in Lewisham, and still continues endemic in a small degree at the North Surrey School. Scarlet fever is also prevalent at Blackheath. Hooping cough is more or less prevalent throughout the district. Smallpox has been a little upon the increase. One case has occurred in Loat's Pits, and several cases have occurred in Bell Green, Willow Road, and Russell Street, upon which localities I have frequently reported to you, and which—more than ever—demand your attention. Fever still continues at Southend. One whole family, living over a stable opposite the Tiger's Head, have been afflicted by it, and have been removed, as the loft is unfit for human habitation. The improvements which took place some time back in Loat's Pits have told very materially in favour of the health of the locality. The Medical Officer of the District informs me, as the result of his experience, that prior to the improvement in drainage and water supply, smallpox would certainly have spread amongst the inhabitants. The health oi the inhabitants of Sandwell Place, I am also informed, has visibly improved since the filthy cesspools have been emptied, and drainage secured. A drain opening into the ditch at Anerley, from two houses on the crest of the hill, still gives forth a poisonous smell. 1 have before brought this under your notice. Montpelier Row, and Paragon Mews, still require proper drainage. As abovementioned, two deaths have taken place from scarlet fever, to be attributed to the above cause. 25 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches.
