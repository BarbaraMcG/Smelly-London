LIBRARY BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM INTERIM ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1948 CECIL HERINGTON, M.D. (Lond.), D.P.H. BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM INTERIM ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1948 CECIL HERINGTON, M.D. (Lond.), D.P.H. 3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Dagenham. Madam Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present herewith my report on the health of Dagenham for the year 1948. This must be regarded as a historical year in the annals of Public Health, July 5 th being the date on which certain of the services hitherto provided by the Corporation passed to the control of the County Council. It is difficult to differentiate accurately between the County and Corporation activities, therefore no attempt has been made to draw a hard and fast line to divide the functions of the Authorities concerned. Indeed, I would go further and suggest that our endeavour should be to knit all the agencies into one homogeneous whole, the target being to raise the level of health. I would here invite attention to some of the vital statistics. The Infant mortality rate has touched a new low level, 29.04 per thousand live births compared with 34 for England and Wales and 31 for London. The general death rate was 6.15 (England and Wales 10.8). The fall in births is shown by the fact that the birth rate was 19.15 in 1948 as against 23.71 in 1947. Now that the full complement of medical staff has been attained, it has become possible to re-distribute the duties entailed by the maternity and child welfare and the school health services. Each member of the medical staff is now engaged in both these services. Where possible the same medical officer who is in charge of infant welfare centres is attached to the schools which serve the same areas, thus preserving continuity of supervision. health Consideration has been given to the centres provision of health centres and certain sites in the Borough have been earmarked for this purpose. The guiding principle in selecting sites has been that each centre should give facilities for approximately 10,000 of the population and that it should not be necessary to travel more than half a mile to the centre. The sites earmarked are at the moment ten in number, but with the development of building estates some modification will be necessary. Building restrictions at the present time have prevented any actual construction from taking place. It will be appreciated that there should be no confusion between existing combined treatment centres and proposed health centres. CARE of mothers Fourteen weekly and two fortnightly AND YOUNG ante-natal sessions are held at six clinic CHILDREN. buildings, these latter are at Ashton Gardens, Chadwell Heath, Becontree Avenue, Ballards Road, Rush Green, Frizlands Lane and Ford 4 Road. The days and times of these sessions are set out in tabular form later in the report, together with average attendances. All these sessions are staffed by Medical Officers, Midwives and Health Visitors. Infant Welfare Centres are held at the same premises as the Ante-Natal Clinics with the exception of Frizlands Lane and the addition of King George Hospital Out-Patient Department. Thirteen weekly sessions are held and two fortnightly sessions. Here again the average attendances are given in another part of this report; all the sessions are staffed by Medical Officers and Health Visitors. Patients seen at the Ante-Natal Clinics are referred, when the clinical condition so indicates, to the Consultant Obstetrician at Oldchurch Hospital who conducts a session for Dagenham cases only once a fortnight. A Gyn√¶cological Clinic is held once a month at Becontree Avenue Combined Treatment Centre, one of the medical staff being in charge of this session. Three day nurseries are provided and are situate at Chadwell Heath, Kingsley Hall and Goresbrook Park. Priority is given to children of mothers who have of necessity to go out to work. The capacity of these nurseries is far from sufficient to meet the demand and the waiting list for non-priority cases is very long. The problem is tackled to some extent by the Daily Guardian Scheme whereby the local health authority contributes the sum of 4/per week and the balance is payable by the mother concerned. When Daily Minders desire to take under their care more than two children, it is necessary for them to register with the Local Authority before this is permitted; in these circumstances the houses of the Daily Minders are visited and on the report obtained the advice of the Area Medical Officer is tendered to the SubCommittee. "Deprived" children are now dealt with by officers of the Children's Department of the County Council. The services of the Health Visitors are, however, utilised and local investigations are carried out by officers of this Borough. Facilities for the convalescence of pre-school children are arranged and the services of the local branch of the Invalid Children's Aid Association are made use of when placing these children. MIDWIFERY. The total number of whole-time midwives serving the area is 21, there being one senior Council Midwife, 11 District Midwives, two employed by the Salvation Army and seven employed by arrangement with the Dagenham District Nursing Association, now controlled by the 5 County Council. Only one independent midwife was in practice at the end of the year. Until the appointed day Dagenham Corporation was the Local Supervising Authority under the Midwives' Acts and the Medical Officer of Health carried out the duties of inspection. Since that day supervision of midwives has passed to the County Council and by arrangement the detailed supervision is still carried out by the Medical Officer of Health. Institutional midwifery is afforded at Oldchurch Hospital and the East End Maternity Hospital. Occasionally beds in other hospitals are put at our disposal. The housing shortage has caused an increased demand for maternity beds, and it is now only possible to arrange for institution midwifery when the clinical condition or the domestic circumstances so indicate. HEALTH The duties of Health Visitors have been VISITING. extended by the National Health Service Act, 1946. Health Visitors are now required to visit persons suffering from illness and to advise as to measures necessary to prevent the spread of infection. Before the provisions of this Act came into force the activities of Health Visitors were chiefly confined to visiting expectant mothers and children under school age in addition to attendances at Ante-Natal and Infant Welfare Centres. There are at present nine Health Visitors on the staff, of whom one is the Superintendent. The total number of visits paid during the year was 16,716. A table is included later in the report giving more details as to these visits. HOME Home Nursing is carried out by nurses NURSING. attached to the training home, York House, Frizlands Lane. This was formerly controlled by the Essex County Nursing Association, there being a local sub-committee styled the Dagenham District Nursing Association Sub-Committee. Since the appointed day this home is managed by the Training Home Management Sub-Committee which also controls the home at Leytonstone. There is a shortage of district nurses which it is hoped will be remedied to some extent when facilities for housing these nurses are available at York House which is in process of being extended. VACCINATION Vaccination is now carried out by general AND practitioners who have agreed to perform IMMUNISATION. this service. At the present time the fee for this service is under consideration. the only information with regard to the number of persons who have been vaccinated is that provided by the general practitioners 6 who have completed record cards and sent them to this office. Since the appointed day records of 85 persons have come to hand and those of 11 persons who have been re-vaccinated. Provision is made for medical officers of the Local Health Authority to carry out vaccination under certain conditions, such as the occurrence of an outbreak of smallpox. This has not been necessary during the period under review. General practitioners also participate in immunisation against Diphtheria. The total number of children protected by general practitioners was 56; this figure includes four boosting doses. A table is given in the report showing the number of children immunised by medical officers of the Local Health Authority which indicates that 2,224 children were protected and 118 children were given boosting doses. Only one case of Diphtheria was notified who had been given protective doses; this was a child aged nine years who had an attack of moderate severity six years approximately after the final dose. There were no deaths from Diphtheria during 1948. Immunisation against Whooping Cough must still be regarded as in the experimental stage. It has been carried out to a limited extent in this district for some time, but the effectivity has not been evaluated and parents of children receiving this treatment have been informed in every case that no guarantee of protection could be given. 439 children were given the full course of vaccine during the year. There are indications that a vaccine of higher efficacy will shortly be available for general use. AMBULANCE Until 5th July the ambulance service was SERVICES. provided by the Dagenham Corporation, there being three ambulances and one sitting case car. The service was sited at the Fire Station, the maintenance of the vehicles and control of personnel being the responsibility of the Borough Engineer; the Medical Officer of Health was the officer in charge of the operational control of the service. On 5th July the County Council was vested with all duties connected with the provision of ambulances. PREVENTION OF This heading covers a large number of ILLNESS, CARE activities which will no doubt, in due AND AFTER-CARE. course, be extended. At the present time sick room appliances are stored at York House and loaned to persons who require them. Convalescence is provided for adults who are not in need of medical and/or nursing attention. It is understood that arrangements are being made to extend facilities under this head. 7 The existing Tuberculosis Care Committee has been in operation for very many years, but it is contemplated that this Committee shall be re-grouped and that there will be some changes in its personnel and secretariat. Garden shelters for persons suffering from certain forms of Tuberculosis are at present stored by the County Council but arrangements are being made for a quota of shelters to be stored in the area and for these to be erected, dismantled and maintained locally. DOMESTIC A Home Help Organiser was appointed HELP. and took up duty in April, 1947. vision has been made for six whole-time domestic helps, at the time of writing four are employed. In addition there are 65 part-time helps who each undertake an average of 25 hours of duty per week. The average number of householders helped per week is 49. Up to date it has been possible to meet every demand for this service, but in a minority of cases there has, of necessity, been a slight delay in supplying the help required. Arrangements are in hand for the National Institute of Houseworkers to examine certain selected Home Helps with a view to conferring upon them a diploma of proficiency. The successful candidates will be rewarded by a slight increase in the normal hourly rate of wage. GASTRO-ENTERITIS. There were two explosive outbreaks of Enteritis during November within a period of nine days; the food was supplied from the same canteen in both instances. The first outbreak occurred at schools situate in a neighbouring area. Meals were supplied from a canteen in this Borough. 532 dinners were served and 324 diners complained of diarrh≈ìa; all had completely recovered within 48 hours. The second outbreak occurred at the canteen itself. 320 dinners were served and 55 diners complained of diarrhoea. Minced meat was the suspected food in both outbreaks. In the second outbreak scraps from five dinners, together with some minced meat, were submitted for examination but no pathogenic organisms were isolated. I visited the canteen with the Chief Sanitary Inspector and carried out an investigation, including the processes adopted in the cooking of the various items of food. Advice was given in respect of minced meat to ensure that during cooking a temperature sufficient to kill pathogenic organisms would be maintained. These nstructions have been followed and there has been no further trouble. I am pleased once more to record my appreciation of the services of all members of the Public Health Department who have 8 continued to give of their best. There have been a few changes, one of which was the resignation of the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, Dr. H. B. Carter'Locke. I would also mention how much the interest and help of the members of the Committee concerned, with particular reference to the Chairman, are valued, and state that the burden of administration of my department has thus been lightened. I am, Madam Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CECIL HERINGTON, Medical Officer of Health.

Since November, 1938, eight local authorities in the South Essex Waterworks Company's area of supply have carried out a co-ordinated system of sampling. Each authority takes one sample a month for bacteriological examination and one sample every six months for chemical examination in accordance with a rota. The 12 bacteriological and two chemical samples taken from the Company's mains in this Borough were all satisfactory. The water is not liable to have plumbo-solvent properties, and no action was called for in respect of any form of contamination. Approximately .10 per cent, of the inhabited houses and .084 per cent, of the population of the Borough take their water from standpipes. During the year the mains laid in the Borough were as follows :‚Äî Size Yards Laid 6" diameter 677 4" ‚Äû 1,169 y ‚Äû 93 Total 1,939 784 Supplies were afforded to houses during the year. The Chief Engineer of the South Essex Waterworks Company has furnished me with the following report:‚Äî "Bacteriological and chemical examinations are made of the raw river water, of the water in its various stages of treatment and of the water going into supply and of both raw and chlorinated water from the Company's wells. "Analyses are also made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in the various parts of the Company's district and all proved to be satisfactory. "Over 3,300 chemical, bacteriological and biological examinations have been made during the year. "All water going into supply was wholesome." 20 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 & 1948 Inspections.
