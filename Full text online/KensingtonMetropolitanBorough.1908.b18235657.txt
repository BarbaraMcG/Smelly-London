KEN17 The Royal Borough of Kensington ANNUAL REPORT OF THE * MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. 1908. Ordered by the Council to be printed. Vail & Co., Printers and Stationers, 170, Farringdon Road, E.C, THE ROYAL BOROUGH OF KENSINGTON. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Kensington, W. 30th January, 1909. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN, AND COUNCILLORS. Sir, and Gentlemen, I beg to present the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for the year 1908. Last July, owing to the death of your late distinguished Medical Officer of Health, Dr. T. Orme Dudfield, I was appointed Acting Medical Officer of Health. This position I held until the 31st January of this year. I am, consequently, accountable for that portion of the report which deals with the second half of the year, and have incorporated the reports dealing with the work of the department for the earlier months of the year. As, however, any consideration of the vital statistics of the borough must be those of a complete year, I hold myself responsible for all the statistics contained in the report. It is very pleasing to have to record a dimiilution in the death-rate, which this year is 13.0 per 1,000, being the lowest yet recorded. The infantile mortality also shows an improvement, being the lowest for the last three years, the rate being 122 per 1,000. The zymotic death-rate also shows an improvement as compared with former years. The birth-rate for the year was 19.0 per 1,000 (the same as in 1907) thus showing a continuous decline since 1868, in which year it was 33T per 1,000 persons living. Compared with 26.5, the corresponding figure for England and Wales (1908), the rate is remarkably low. As regards general sanitary administration, every endeavour has been made to maintain the standard of the work of the department at the same high level of efficiency as it has attained in the past. Finally, I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful appreciation of the support and assistance I have received from the Chairmen of Committees and Members of the Council, during my tenure of office, and of acknowledging the work and loyal co-operation of the staff of the Department, I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, WILLIAM J. CORBETT, Acting Medical Officcr of Health. The Royal Borough of Kensington. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1908 To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors. Sir, and Gentlemen, The vital and mortal statistics in this report relate to the registration year, a period of fifty-three weeks, December 29th, 1907, to January 2nd, 1909. For the purposes of the report the population of the Royal Borough is estimated to have numbered 181,000 at the middle of the year; the estimated population of the sub-districts, parliamentary divisions, etc., is set out in the table at page 5. The estimate of population of the borough is based on the subjoined summary table which shows the Age, and Sex Distribution of the people as ascertained at the census of 1901. Population at all Ages, March 31st, 1901. Under Five Years. 5 to 15. 15 to 25. 25 to 35. 35 to 45. 45 to 55. 55 to 65. 65 to 75. 75 to 85. 85 to 95. 95 and upwards. All Ages.

The tenements of less than five rooms, 20,052 in 1891, and 55.8 per cent, of total tenements, were 21,115 in 1901, and 55T per cent, of the entire number. In these tenements there were housed 73,425 persons (compared with 70,718 in 1891), or 41.6 per cent, of the population : the relative percentage in 1891 was 42.5.

Increase in 37 years. Population 121,000 181,000 60,000 Number of Inhabited Houses 15,735 28,000 7,265 Rateable Value £935,720 £2,488,515 £1,502,795 It thus appears that the population in 1908 was twenty-one times as large as in the first year of the nineteenth century, and the rateable value of property more than thirty-one times as great as in 1823, the first year in respect to which I possess information. Since 1856, the rateable value has increased nearly eight-fold, and the population and the number of inhabited houses have increased more than three-fold. 5 AREA OF THE BOROUGH. The Borough comprises an area of 2,291.1 statute acres, an addition of 101.1 acres having accrued from the changes in boundaries brought about by the London Government Act, 1899. Of this addition all but 1.8 acres belongs to the Town sub-district, the area of which (including 3.8 acres of inland water) is 1,596.3 acres; the area of Brompton being 694.8 acres. The acreage of the wards is not given in the census report. REGISTRATION DISTRICT AND SUB-DISTRICTS. The " Kensington " Registration District (No. 1B in the Registrar-General's list) comprises two sub-districts, respectively named Kensington Town (hereinafter for brevity referred to as Town) and Brompton. The Town sub-district comprises all that portion of the Borough north of Kensington High-street and Kensington-road, together with a large area south of that main thoroughfare, the dividing line running, from west to east, along Pembroke-road, Stratfordroad, and south of the workhouse, through Cornwall-gardens to Queen's-gate-place, and thence northwards so as to include Queen's — gate (west side). The remainder of the Borough, south of the line indicated, forms the sub-district of Brompton. The Parliamentary Divisions are two in number; North Kensington and South Kensington—High-street, Notting-hill, and Holland-park-avenue forming the line of demarcation. The Wards are nine in number, of which four—St. Charles, Golborne, Norland, and Pembridge are in (and constitute) the Parliamentary Division of North Kensington ; and five— Holland, Earl's Court, Queen's Gate, Redcliffe, and Brompton, are in (and constitute) the Parliamentary Division of South Kensington. POPULATION AND INHABITED HOUSES IN 1908. The population of the borough, estimated to the middle of the year, was 181,000.* It comprised 70,800 males and 110,200 females: excess of females, 39,400. In the Town sub-district estimated population 131,180), the males numbered about 54,760, the females, 76,420; excess of females, 21,660. In the Brompton sub-district (estimated population 49,820), there were about 16,040 males and 33,780 females: excess of females 17,740. This population was in occupation of about 23,000 houses; equal to 7.9 persons to a house. For the purposes of this report, the population of the borough, the sub-districts, the parliamentary divisions, and the wards, will be taken to be as follows:— The Borough. 181,000 Sub-districts:— KensiDgton Town. 181,180 Brompton 49,820 Parliamentary Divisions:— North Kensington 93,330 South Kensington 87,670 Wards :— North Kensington St. Charles Golborne Norland Pembridge 22,480 26,970 24,070 19,810 South Kensington Holland Earl's Court - Queen's Gate Redcliffe , Brompton 20,920 18,490 14,620 19,140 14,500 * The Registrar-General's estimate of the population of the Royal Borough in the middle of 1908 was 182,752. I have thought it desirable to adopt the more conservative estimate given in the text. 6 MARRIAGES AND MARRIAGE RATE. The marriages in the year were 1,561, compared with 1,574, 1,690, and 1,676 in the three preceding years respectively. Of these marriages there were celebrated— By the Church (58-8 per cent, of total marriages) 910 At Roman Catholic places of worship At other Nonconformist places of worship At the Jewish Synagogue (12.0 per cent.) 135 48 5 At the Superintendent-Registrar's Office (29-7 per cent.) 463 1,561 The subjoined table shows the Marriage-Rate in Ten Years 1898-1907, and in 1908, in Kensington, in London, and in England and Wales.

The births registered, including 142 that occurred at Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital were 3,504 or 3,438 after correction for the 53rd week: Males 1,827, Females 1,677: in the Town sub-district (which includes the Borough Infirmary) 2,966, and in the Brompton sub-district 538. The male births were to the female births in the proportion of 1,089 to 1,000. 7 The births were, after correction, 250 below the corrected decennial average number (3,688) and were fewer by 603 than in the year 1872 (4,041), when the population (127,600) was 53,400, less than in 1908; 191 of them were illegitimate. The birth rate, which of late years has always been considerably below that of London (25.2 in 1908), has been declining since 1868, in which year it was 33.1 per 1,000 persons living. In 1908 it was 190 per 1,000, and T4 below the decennial average (20.4). The rates in the sub-districts were:—Town 22.2; Brompton 10'6 per 1,000. The births in North Kensington, i.e., the part of the Borough north of Holland park-avenue and High-street, Notting-hill, were 2,487 ; the birth-rate 26*1 per 1,000 living, and 0'9 above the metropolitan rate. The births in South Kensington, i.e., the part of the borough south of the streets above named were 1,017 ; the birth-rate 11.4, and 13'8 per 1,000 below the metropolitan rate. The birth-rate in the several wards—after distribution of the births at the borough infirmary and at Queen Charlotte's Hospital—was as follows:— North Kensington— St. Charles 655 births = 28.6 Golborne 886 births = 82.2 Norland 594 births = 24.2 Pembridge 352 births = 17.4 South Kensington— per 1,000 persons living. Holland 295 births = 13.8 Earl's Court 202 births = 10.7 Queen's Gate 126 births = 8.5 Redcliffe 252 births = 12.9 Brompton 142 births = 9.6 The births exceeded the deaths by 1,106: in the Town sub-district they were 1,033 more in number than the deaths, whilst in the Brompton sub-district they exceeded the deaths to the number of 73 only. In North Kensington the births exceeded the deaths by 958; in South Kensington to the number of 148 only. The excess of births over deaths in the several wards was as follows:— North Kensington. St. Chailes 288 South Kensington. Holland 71 Golbonie 448 Queen's Gate 31 Norland l39 Redcliffe 55 Pembridge . 83 Brompton 35 The deaths exceeded the births by 44 in Earl's Court Ward. The registered births of illegitimate children in the borough, as a whole, were 191*—9 less than in 1907. Of these births 173 were registered in the Town sub-district, which includes the workhouse, at which institution out of 119 live births (males 58, females 61) 73 were illegitimate. In the borough generally the illegitimate births formed 5"5 per cent, of total births, as compared with rates of 4*5, 4'8, and 5'8 in the preceding three years. * Inclusive of 30 at Queen Charlotte's Hospital. 8 The subjoined table shows the quarterly numbers of births of males and females in the borough, including those in Queen Charlotte's Hospital, and in each of the sub-districts:— Kensington Town.

(page 60) gives the number of births and the birth-rate for each of three years, 1856-1908. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. During the year, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five notifications of births were received, or 55.5 per cent, of births registered: 1,462 of them belong to North Kensington and 403 to South Kensington: 612 were notified by fathers, 351 by medical practitioners, 726 by midwives, and 176 by other persons. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The registered deaths, inclusive of 354 of parishioners at outlying public institutions, etc., but exclusive of 713 of non-parishioners at public institutions, etc., within the borough, were 2,398 (males 1,139, females 1,259), or 2,353 after correction for the 53rd week, and 345 (after correction) below the corrected decennial average (2,698). Of these deaths, 1,933 belong to the Town subdistrict and 465 to Brompton. The death-rate, which in the preceding three years had been 14.0, 13'9 and 13.7, per 1,000 respectively, was 13.0* in 1908, and the lowest on record. It was 1.9 below the decennial average (14.9) and 0'8 below the rate in the Metropolis, as a whole, 13'8. The rates in the sub-districts were : Town 14.5, Brompton 9.2 per 1,000, as compared with 15.2 and 9.8, respectively, in 1907. The deaths in North Kensington were 1,529, and the death-rate 16T per 1,000. The deaths in South Kensington were 869, and the death-rate 9.7 per 1,000. The sex-rates (entire borough) were, males 16T, females 11.4 per 1,000. The ward-rates in 1908 (entire year) are set out below; the rate in each of the thirteen four weekly periods in the table at page 12. North Kensington: per 1,000 persons living. St. Charles 367 deaths = 16.0 Golborne 438 deaths = 15.9 Norland 455 deaths = 18.5 Pembridge 269 deaths = 13.3 South Kensington : Holland 224 deaths = 10.5 Earl's Court 246 deaths = 13.0 Queen's Gate 95 deaths = 6.4 Redcliffe 197 deaths = 10.1 Brompton 107 deaths = 7.2 The Corrected or True Death-rate.—The death-rate, 13.0 per 1,000, as calculated above is a crude or uncorrected one, not taking cognizance of the relative numbers of the sexes, nor of the age-composition of the population. Correction for these data involves addition to or subtraction, from, the "recorded death-rate," as compared with the "standard death-rate.'t The necessity for such correction is obvious, having regard to the great excess of females in the population, and to the lower death rate in the female sex as compared with the rate in the male sex. That excess in 1908 was approximately 39,400. The deaths among the 70,800 males were 1,139 and those among the 110,200 females 1,259. The crude death-rate in the male sex was 16T as compared with the rate of 11.4 in the female sex. It is obvious, therefore, that if the numbers of the sexes had been equal, the death-rate would have been higher than the recorded rate. The Registrar-General, in his Annual Summary, gives the " factor for correction for sex and age distribution " in each of the Metropolitan Boroughs. Corrected after the manner indicated, the death-rate of Kensington in 1908 becomes, instead of 13.0, one of 14.0 per 1,000 ; and the rate for London, as a whole, 14.5 instead of 13-8. The " true" death-rate is that which shows the mortality per 1,000 living of each sex at different age-periods, as set out in the subjoined table. * This is the crude death-rate. The rate corrected for age and sex distribution was 14 0 per 1,000. The " true death rate " is set out in the table at page 10. † The expression "standard death-rate " signifies the death-rate at all ages, calculated on the hypothesis that the rate for each sex, at each of twelve age-periods in each town, were the same as in England and Wales, during the 10 years 1891-1900 ; the rate at all ages in England and Wales during that period having been 18 2 per 1,000. 10 The True Death-rate of Kensington, 1908.

Table A, Appendix II. (page 60) gives the number of deaths, and the death-rate, for each of the fifty-three years 1856-1908. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The infantile mortality, or the proportion of deaths under one year of age to registered births, is an important factor in vital statistics. The deaths under one year, which in the three preceding years had been 498, 452, and 433 respectively, were 428 (or 420 after correction for the 53rd week) in 1908; being equivalent to 122* per 1,000 births, and 28 below the decennial average. The deaths under one year in the Town sub-district (379) were equivalent to 128 per 1,000 births, those in Brompton (49) to 91 per 1,000. * This figure was exceeded in 7 Metropolitan Boroughs : in 20 others it was less. 11 The infantile deaths in North Kensington, after distribution of the deaths at the Borough Infirmary, were 333, or 134 per 1,000 births; those in South Kensington 95, or 93 per 1,000 births. In the several wards the rate was as follows:— North Kensington— per 1,000 registered births. St. Charles 86 deaths = 131 Golborne 95 deaths = 107 Norland 105 deaths = 177 Pembridge 47 deaths = 138 South Kensington— Holland 26 deaths — 90 Earl's Court 22 deaths = 111 Queen's Gate 13 deaths = 105 Redcliffe 25 deaths = 101 Brompton 9 deaths = 65 In England and Wales the rate was 121 per 1,000. In the 76 great towns of England and Wales (including London) the rate averaged 129 per 1,000. The rate in Rural England was 110 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality Rate. YEAR The Borough.

(page 60) gives the number of deaths under one year in Kensington, and the proportion to 1,000 registered births for each of the thirty-seven years, 1871-1908. The figures for the 13 years, 1896-1908, have been corrected by the addition of the births to Kensington mothers at Queen Charlotte's Hospital to those occurring, and registered, in the borough. 12 The deaths of children over one year and under five years of age were 177 ; the deaths under five years, therefore, were 605, compared with 757, 693, and 688, in the preceding three years, being equal to 173 per 1,000 births; the relative proportion in London, as a whole, being 174. The deaths of illegitimate children under five, 94, 79, and 57 in the preceding three years respectively, were 68 in 1908 ; of which 61 were registered in the Town sub-district, and 7 in Brompton. These deaths were equal to 35 6 per cent, on the 191 births registered as illegitimate. Of the 68 children 15 only survived the first year of life. Senile Mortality.—At sixty years of age and upwards, there were 944 deaths, as compared with 873, 934, and 903 in the preceding three years respectively. These deaths were equivalent to 394 per 1,000 deaths at all ages. The relative proportion in all London was 327 per 1,000. District Rates of Mortality.—The table below shows (inter alia) the death-rate in the sub-districts, the parliamentary divisions, and the wards, for the year, and also for each of the thirteen four-weekly periods covered by the monthly reports. As usual the rate was far higher in the Town sub-district (14.5 per 1,000) than in the Brompton sub-district (9.2), and the same observation applies to the parliamentary division of North Kensington (16.1), compared with the southern division of the borough (9.7). In all of the wards in North Kensington, the death-rate exceeded that of the borough as a whole (13.0 per 1,000), whereas in each of the wards in South Kensington it was more or less largely below the rate for the borough as a whole, with the exception of the Earl's Court Ward. Death-rate in the Metropolis, and in Kensington, and in Localized Districts of the Borough, in each of the thirteen four-weekly periods ended January 2nd 1909, and in the Registration Year, 1908.

In the table at page 14 the principal statistics have been arranged in thirteen four-weekly periods corresponding to the dates of the monthly reports. The annual birth-rate in 1908 was 19.0 per 1,000 of the population, the death rate 13.0. There were considerable fluctuations in the death-rate at the different periods, ranging between the minimum (8.7) in the eighth, ended August 8th, and the maximum (18.7) in the first, ended January 25th. The rate in six periods was above, and in seven below the average for the year. The deaths in the two halves were 1,316 and 1,082 respectively. The deaths from the principal diseases of the zymotic class were 167 : 13 fewer than in 1907, and 108 below the decennial average: 56occurred in the first half of the year and 111 in the second. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs were 458, and 62 fewer than in 1907. Diseases of the heart were accountable for 269 deaths, compared with 233 in 1907 ; and phthisis for 181, as compared with 174. Other tubercular diseases claimed 80 victims, against 90 in the preceding year. COMPARATIVE VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS. London.—The birth-rate, 25'2 per 1,000 (2-9 below the decennial average), was the lowest on record. The rate has been declining for many years, never having been below 30 per 1,000 prior to 1898. The adjusted death-rate was 13.8 per 1,000 (also the lowest on record), and 3T below the average of the preceding ten years. Small-pox, the cause of 1,300, 13, 25, and 10 deaths, respectively, in 1902, 1903, 1904, and 1905, was unattended by fatality in 1906, 1907 and 1908. Scarlet-fever was the cause of 548 deaths, compared with 644 in 1907, and a decennial average of 514. Diphtheria was the cause of 724 deaths ; 57 fewer than in 1907, and 472 below the decennial average. Enteric-fever was the cause of 225 deaths, 31 more than in 1907, but less than half the decennial average. The four diseases above-named, commonly spoken of as the " dangerous infectious diseases," were the causes of 1,499 deaths : the deaths from the other three principal diseases of the zymotic class totalled 5,100, being (after correction for the 53rd week) 2,782 below the decennial average; viz., measles 1,524 (average 2,213), whooping-cough 984 (average 1,772), and diarrhoea 2,592 (average 3,800). Kensington.—The birth-rate, 19.0 per 1,000, and the lowest on record, was T4 below the decennial average. Having regard to the disproportion in the number of the sexes, a high birth-rate is not possible. The death-rate, 13.0 per 1,000 and the lowest on record was 0.7 below that in 1907, and 1.9 below the decennial average. The infantile mortality-rate, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to 1,000 registered births, was 122 ; a decrease of 4 per 1,000, compared with the rate in 1907. Scarlet-fever was the cause of 9 deaths, diphtheria of 26, and enteric-fever of 5; total 40 in a population of 181,000; a surprisingly small number. The deaths from these diseases were respectively, 5 below, 1 above and 7 below the decennial averages. The deaths from the remaining three of the principal diseases of the zymotic class were 127: viz., measles 32 (average 69), whooping-cough 7 (average 51), and diarrhoea 88 (average 102). The table at page 19 shows the number of deaths in the several Wards from the principal diseases of the zymotic class. The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich during the year was 50'0° Fahrenheit and 0'3 above the means of the preceding 50 years,—the means of the four quarters being 39'5, 53.8 60.3 and 4.6 respectively. 14 Summary of Vital and Mortal Statistics of the Royal Borough of Kensington, 1908.

The rate in London, was 13"8 per 1,000 of the estimated population, and 0-8 below that of 1907 ; l-4 below the average rate in the 5 years 1903-1907, and the lowest on record. The subjoined table shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 persons living in each of the last eleven years, in Kensington, in London, and in England and Wales. 1908 1907. 1906. 1905. 1904. 1903. 1902. 1901. 1900. 1899. 1898.

In the County of London the mortality was at the rate of 13'8 per 1,000, whilst in the Outer Ring it did not exceed 12'0. Infantile mortality in Greater London was equal to 108 per 1000 births, as compared with 123, 129, and 112, severally, in the preceding three years. Last year infantile mortality was equal to 113 per 1,000 in the County of London, and to 98 in the Outer Ring. Other Large Towns.—The crude death-rate in the seventy-six large towns, including London (population 16,234,952), was 14"9 per 1,000; the rates in the preceding three years having been 15'7, 15*9 and 15*4. The death-rates of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin and Belfast were severally 15'2, 17"7, 23*0, and 19'5. These rates are calculated without reference to differences between one town and another with regard to the age and sex-distribution of their respective populations. But the sex and age composition of the several populations having been ascertained at the census of 1901, suitable factors have been calculated for correcting the recorded death-rates in the large towns in order to render them fairly comparable with one another ; and in his Annual Summary the Registrar-General furnishes a table showing the recorded and corrected death-rates per 1,000 persons living, in each of the 76 towns in 1908. Colonial and Foreign Cities.—The authorities of a large number of the principal cities supply returns of mortality to the Registrar-General. The highest death-rates recorded in 1908, were 32*2 in Rio Janeiro, 28"6 in St. Petersburg and 28*0 in Moscow; the lowest, 10*3 in Sydney, 130 in Amsterdam and 13'7 in Rotterdam. Indian Cities.—The death-rate was 27*8 per 1,000 in Calcutta, 40*6 in Madras, and 39*1 in Bombay. ASSIGNED CAUSES OF DEATH. The Registrar-General issued, in 1902, a "New List of Causes of Death," as used in the Annual Reports for England and Wales, together with " Suggestions to Medical Practitioners respecting Certificates of Causes of Death," in which it is stated to be " highly desirable that Medical Practitioners should use only those terms which are recognised by the Royal College of Physicians of London." This List comprises "General Diseases," i.e., those in which the whole body may be said to suffer, and " Local Diseases," of various systems and organs, set out in the Table (page 57,) in which the first twenty diseases named are those formerly described as "Specific, Febrile or Zymotic Diseases;" chief among them being the nine "Principal Zymotic Diseases;" three of which were formerly associated under the generic term " Fever," which comprises Typhus-fever, Enteric-fever, and Pyrexia. 16 The Tables numbered I. to V. are required by the Local Government Board to be used in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Deaths from the " Principal Diseases of the Zymotic Class " (247, 278 and 180 in the preceding three years respectively) were 167 in 1908, and 108 below the corrected decennial average (275). These deaths, of which 151 belong to the Town sub-district and 16 to Brompton, were equivalent to 09 per 1,000 persons living (IT in the Town sub-district and 0'3 in Brompton) as compared with TO in 1907 ; the decennial average being T5. The rate in the Metropolis, as a whole, was 1*35 per 1,000 (1*42 in 1907); the decennial average being 2T.

In Appendix II., statistical information is given, in Tables B, C and D, pages 61 and 62, showing the number of deaths from the several diseases during the fifty-three years, 1856-1908; viz., in Table B, the annual number of deaths from each disease and the death-rate therefrom ; in Table C, the number of deaths grouped in quinquennial periods; in Table D, the rate per 1,000 of the population, in quinquennial periods, of the four notifiable diseases (small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria and " fever "), and of the three non-notifiable diseases—measles, whooping-cough and diarrhoea. In England and Wales the deaths from these diseases were at the rate of 1-29 per 1,000 persons living, against 1-55, 1-77, and 1-28 respectively, in the preceding three years. In the seventy-six great towns, including London, the average rate was 1-59. The following table shows the rate of mortality per 1,000 persons living from the principal zymotic diseases in Kensington and London, and in England and Wales:— Small pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever.

There was no case of this disease in the Borough during the year. Only one death (in 1904) has been registered in the six years 1903-8. 20 For the third year in succession there was no death in London from this cause, the corrected decennial average being 166. One case was notified, compared with 74, 31, and 4 in the preceding three years. MEASLES. Measles was the cause of 32 deaths, compared with 54, 81, and 31 in the three preceding years successively: 30 and 2 in the Town and Brompton sub-districts respectively; the corrected decennial average being 69. Thirty-one of the deaths were of children under five years of age, including 8 in the first year of life. The lady sanitary inspectors visited all cases reported by school teachers, 474 in number; the schools in connection with which cases were reported were 26, the aggregate of cases in nine schools (ranging from 22, upwards to 70) was 330; in seven schools (ranging from 11 to 18) 106; in the remaining 10 schools there were 38 cases. The largest numbers occurred in connection with Portobello Road C.C. School, 70; Wornington Road C.C. School, 50; and Buckingham Terrace and Gloucester Grove C.C. Schools, 44 each. In addition to the cases reported by school teachers, other 132 were found in the houses visited. Of the total cases (606), 249 were of children under five years; 384 belonged to three wards—St. Charles 76, Golborne 210, Norland 98—the population of which is approximately 73,520 ; and 122, to the remaining six wards—population 107,480. An advisory leaflet was left with each family visited, calling attention to the serious nature of the disease—a fact which appears to be better recognised than formerly. But even now it is no uncommon thing to find mothers visiting friends with young children in their arms, at houses where measles exists, with the not unexpected result of a spread of the disease; the imprudence being justified by them on the ground that the children must have it at some time—which is by no means necessary. Moreover, as nearly all deaths from measles occur under five years, it follows that if a child is attacked after that age, the risk of a fatal result is almost negligible. No effort, therefore, should be spared to postpone the date of attack. Disinfection was carried out in 77 cases. The deaths from measles in London, as a whole, were 1,524, and approximately 689 below the corrected decennial average (2,213). SCARLET FEVER. The notified cases of scarlet fever were 439, compared with 332, 463, and 522 in the preceding three years, 313 in North Kensington and 126 in South Kensington. The deaths were 9 (a casemortality of 21 per cent.) and 5 below the corrected decennial average (14). All took place at outlying public institutions, to which 398 cases were removed. The deaths in the preceding three years had been 21, 11, and 9 respectively. The deaths in London, as a whole, 548, were approximately 34 in excess of the corrected decennial average. The cases notified during the year were 22,059, compared with 19,467, 20,343 and 25,936, in the preceding three years respectively. The case-mortality was 2-5 per cent, on notifications, compared with 2-8, 2-6, and 2-5 in the preceding three years. The admissions to hospitals were 21,311, compared with 17,230, 18,316, and 23,208, in the preceding three years, and equal to 96-6 per cent, on cases notified. At the close of the year there were 3,557 cases remaining in hospital, compared with 3,446, 3,846, and 4,999 at the corresponding period in the preceding three years. The subjoined table shows the degree of prevalence of the disease in the borough and in London, as a whole, indicated by the number of notifications, and of deaths, etc., in thirteen four-weekly periods, as set out in the monthly reports.

The cases notified as diphtheria (including membranous croup, classified by the RegistrarGeneral with diphtheria) were 230, compared with 125, 164, and 234 in the preceding three years; 128 in North Kensington and 102 in South Kensington. The deaths were 26 (a case-mortality of 11.3 per cent.) and one above the corrected decennial average (25); 22 in the Town sub-district, and 4 in Brompton. Twenty-four of the deaths took place in hospitals, to which 204 cases were removed—a case-mortality of 11.8 per cent. Seventeen of the deaths were of children under five years of age.

C. and D, pp. 61 and 62. The deaths in London, as a whole, were 724—approximately 472 below the corrected decennial average—compared with 533, 691, and 781 in the preceding three years; the notifications 7,998, compared with 6,489, 8,035 and 8,761. The cases admitted to hospital were 6,872, compared with 4,180, 5,264, and 5,782 in the three preceding years. At the close of the year there were 1,245 cases under treatment, compared with 701, 1,000, and 1,170 at the corresponding period in the preceding three years. The subjoined table, based on the thirteen four-weekly reports, set out certain particulars with regard to diphtheria, in Kensington, and in London as a whole:— Report for four weeks ended No. of Notifications.

Whooping cough was the cause of 7 deaths, compared with 60, 20, and 81 in the preceding three years; 5 of them in the Town sub-district; the corrected decennial average being 51. All of the deaths were of children under 5 years of age. All of the cases reported by school teachers (44 in number) were visited by the lady sanitary inspectors. In addition to the cases reported by school teachers, other 13 were found in the houses visited. An advisory leaflet was left with each family, pointing out the serious nature of the disease—a fact which the inspectors think is becoming better recognised by mothers, leading to more care of the sufferers. The deaths from whooping-cough in London, as a whole, were 984, and approximately 788 below the corrected average. FEVER. Thirty-six cases of Enteric Fever were notified, compared with 49, 38, and 40 in the preceding three years. The deaths were 5 (7 below the corrected decennial average), 4 of them belonging to the Town sub-district; 4 of them took place in hospitals, to which 28 cases were removed. The deaths from this cause in the preceding three years were 13, 5, and 5 respectively. Enteric Fever in Kensington, 1898-1908. Year Cases Notified. Case-rate per 1,000 of population. Deaths.

No case of typhus was notified in the Borough, and only four cases in all London; there was no death from this cause. No death was registered in the Borough from simple continued fever (Pyrexia); one case was notified. The deaths and notifications in London from this cause were 2 and 13 respectively. DIARRHCEA. Diarrhoea was the cause of 88 deaths, compared with 90, 142, and 30 in the preceding three years; 84 in the Town sub-district and 4 in Brompton; the corrected decennial average being 102. The deaths in London, as a whole, from this cause, were 2,592 and approximately 1,208 below the corrected decennial average (3,800). 25 INFLUENZA. Seventy-five deaths were registered from Influenza, as compared with 49, 52 and 63 in the preceding three years; 48 in the Town sub-district, and 27 in Brompton.

Syphilis was the cause of 21 deaths, 17 of them in the Town sub-district. Puerperal Diseases were the causes of four deaths, 3 in the Town sub-district; three deaths were registered as having occurred from accidents connected with childbirth. These seven deaths were equal to 2.0 per 1,000 live births, compared with rates of 2.0, 4.7, and 2.6 per 1,000 in the preceding three years respectively. Erysipelas was the cause of four deaths, 3 of them in the Town sub-district. The notifications were 129 in number.

Alcoholism, Delirium Tremens, was the cause of 5 deaths; two in the Town sub-district, and 3 in Brompton. The deaths in London, as a whole, were 403. Rheumatic Fever, Acute Rheumatism, was the cause of 6 deaths, four of them in the Town sub-district. Malignant Disease Cancer, was accountable for 186 deaths; 132 in the Town sub-district and 54 in Brompton. Carcinoma was the registered cause in 87 cases, Sarcoma in 10, and Malignant Disease, Cancer, in 89. Cancer would appear to be on the increase in the country generally; possibly, however, some portion of the apparent increase in the number of deaths may be due to greater accuracy in diagnosis. The deaths in Kensington in the preceding ten years were 193, 169, 152, 185, 155, 187, 174, 172, 171, and 201 respectively. The deaths in 1908 were equal to 10-3 per ten thousand of the population, and to 7-8 per cent, of all deaths registered. Deaths from Malignant Disease are usually more numerous, proportionately to population, in the Brompton sub-district than in the Town sub-district, cancer being quite as prevalent, probably more so, amongst well-to-do people than in the poorer classes. The parts of the body most commonly affected are the viscera or internal organs ; in women, the uterus and the breast; the disease, moreover, being for the most part one of later life. Thus 164 of the deaths took place at ages above forty-five, and 16 between thirty-five and forty-five years In London, as a whole, the deaths from Malignant Disease, Cancer, were 3,101. Premature Birth was the cause of 74 deaths; 60 in the Town sub-district and 14 in Brompton ; Old Age (Senile decay) of 95; 72 and 23 in the two sub-districts respectively; including 12 between 65 and 75 years, 39 between 75 and 85, and 43 at 85 years and upwards. LOCAL DISEASES.

Eleven of the deaths were due to Convulsions, and 32 to diseases which, not being named specifically in the " New List," are classified to " Other Diseases " of the System. The number of deaths from the several other diseases are set out in the Table at page Circulatory System.—The deaths from Diseases of the Heart were 269—219 in the Town sub-district and 50 in Brompton—as compared with 209, 220, and 233, in the three preceding years.

The principal causes were Bronchitis 210 deaths, and Pneumonia, in one or other of its forms, 198 deaths. The deaths under five years of age were 131, or 28-6 per cent, of the total number, as compared with percentages of 34.3, 30.8, and 37-7 in the preceding three years; and at 55 and upwards 253, or 55.1 per cent., against 46.9, 50-7, and 45 0 in the preceding three years. Bronchitis and Pneumonia were accountable for 408 deaths (including 125 under five years of age), of which 69 were registered in the Brompton sub-district. Digestive System.—The diseases of the Digestive System were accountable for 148 deaths; 112 and 36 in the Town and Brompton sub-districts respectively; 32 of them under five years of age. The chief causes were Cirrhosis of the Liver 27 deaths, Other Diseases of the Liver and Gall Bladder 16 deaths, Intestinal Obstruction 12, Enteritis 17, Gastric TJlcer 9, and Appendicitis 15. * A considerable number of deaths are certified ai due to " Failure of the Heart," in persons dying in old age. These deaths are classified to " Old Age" in the Table at page 57. 27 Urinary System.—Eighty-seven deaths were due to diseases of the urinary system; 64 and 23 in the Town and Brompton sub-districts respectively; Chronic Bright's Disease {Albuminuria), being- the cause of 50 deaths, Bladder and Prostate Disease of 18, and Other Diseases of the Urinary System of 7.

Ill-defined and Not specified causes of death were returned in 50 cases; 45 in the Town sub-district and 5 in Brompton; 47 were certified due to Debility, Atrophy, Inanition, all but one of them of infants under one year. DEATHS AT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The only large public institution in which we are directly interested is the Poor-law infirmary located in the Town sub-district. There are several public institutions, at which the deaths are mainly of non-parishioners; viz., St. Marylebone Infirmary, North Kensington, St. Luke's House for the dying, Pembridge Square, the Kensington General Hospital at Brompton, the Brompton Consumption Hospital, and St. Joseph's House, Portobello Road, Notting Hill, a Roman Catholic Home for aged poor persons of both sexes.

Percy Potter, the medical superintendent, for the statistics of mortality at this important institution. The deaths, the causes of which are set out in the table below, were 538*, compared with 552, 541, and 526 in the preceding three years respectively, and were equal to 22.4 per cent, of all the deaths recorded in the borough. The quarterly numbers were 178, 137, 107, and 116; 294 deaths, therefore, occurred in the first and fourth or colder quarters, and 244 in the second and third or warmer quarters of the year. The deaths included 277 of males and 261 of females. The ages at death were:—Under one year, 73 •This is the number actually occurring during the year. The number registered was 546. 28 (compared with 72, 71, and 57 in the preceding three years respectively); between one and sixty, 225 (compared with 270, 231, and 242 in the preceding three years), and at sixty and upwards, 240 (compared with 210, 239, and 227 in the preceding three years.

UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. There were four deaths in the borough that were not "certified" either by a registered medical practitioner or by a coroner. The causes of death were premature birth (in two cases), Debility and Cancer respectively. In England and Wales the deaths not certified were 1.4 per cent, of total deaths; the proportion in London was 0.1 and in Kensington 0.2. INQUESTS. One hundred and eighty-three inquests were held on parishioners, including 44 at places without the borough, mostly at public institutions to which the deceased persons had been removed for treatment. The cause of death is stated to have been ascertained by post mortem examination in 117 cases. Thirty-four inquests were held on the bodies of non-parishioners who had died in Kensington. All of the inquests in the borough were held at the coroner's court at the Town Hall. The causes of death may be classified as follows:— Deaths caused by disease 97 Deaths caused by violence (86), viz.:— Accidental 69 Suicidal 14 Murder 2 Manslaughter 1 — 86 Total 183 The inquests on Kensington parishioners were in the proportion of 7.6 per cent, on total deaths, the rate in the Metropolis being 101 per cent; in England and Wales the rate was 7.0per cent. The relative percentages in 1907 were 8.2, 9.8 and 6.9, respectively. The deaths from violence (86) were equal to 0.48 per 1,000 of the population in Kensington; the corresponding rates were 0.58 per 1,000 in London, as a whole, and 0.57 per 1,000 in England and Wales.

I beg to submit the annual report of the two lady inspectors (Miss de Chaumont and Miss Looker) with reference to the cases of consumption notified during 1908:— "During the year 1908 we enquired into all cases of phthisis (pulmonary consumption) voluntarily notified by medical practitioners, 229 in number (compared with 231 in 1907), of which 68 proved fatal. We made enquiries also with regard to 22 deaths of persons whose illness had been notified in previous years, and of 91 deaths of persons whose illness had not been notified. The cases investigated during the year were thus 342 (males 195, females 147); the number of visits paid being 868. Home or other Accommodation of the Sick Person or Family. Number of Rooms Occupied. 1 2 3 4 or more. Homeless Persons in the Infirmary. Common Lodginghouse Cases. No Information obtainable. Total Cases investigated. Number of cases of illness 82 79 42 46 32 28 33 342 "One hundred and eighty-eight of the 229 notifications and 139 of the 181 deaths, were of persons belonging to North Kensington; whilst 165 of the notifications were from three wards viz.:—St. Charles (29), Golborne (54), Norland (82): 118 of the deaths 25, 43, and 50, respectively) belonged to the same wards, the population of which is but little over 73,000. "The proportion of deaths from phthisis at the Workhouse Infirmary to deaths from this cause in the Borough, as a whole, was, as usual, large: 80 out of 181. Seventy-three of these deaths were of North Kensington persons and 7 of South Kensington persons. "The notified infirmary cases were 139; males 90, females 49: 112 of North Kensington persons and 27 of South Kensington persons. Forty-one cases were notified by the district medical officers; the majority of which were subsequently removed to the Infirmary. There was a slight increase in private notifications during the vear; 18 cases, as against 12 cases in 1907 having been reported by other than Poor Law Medical Officers. In addition, 11 private cases were reported by Poor Law Medical Officers. Seventeen cases were brought to our knowledge from other sources—Hospital Almoners, the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Military Authorities. Three additional cases were found by ourselves when visiting houses for other purposes. "In the month of November a fresh step was taken by the Authorities at Brompton Consumption Hospital; the Medical Officers now notifying (with the patient's consent) to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, all out-patients residing in London. These notifications are forwarded to the respective Local Medical Officers of Health. In Kensington they numbered 13 of the cases received through Hospital Almoners mentioned above. "Patients residing at home (averaging 86 in number) were kept under observation, and visited as frequently as practicable. Disinfection after death or after removal of a patient from one abode to another, was offered, and usually accepted ; it was done in 126 cases, out of 249 infected rooms: in 105 by the Council's officer, in 21 under the medical attendant's direction. There were only 19 absolute refusals (as against 38 in 1907), on the ground that disinfection was considered "unnecessary." In 104 cases the room was in occupation. "The Council at the end of 1906 sanctioned the free distribution of sputum bottles to sufferers residing at home, and 51 were given out during 1907. An additional 27 bottles were distributed in 1908, much to the comfort of the recipients and to the benefit of the community. "In a large majority of the cases the disease was in an advanced stage when notified, the sufferers having continued to work for the support of their families, and rarely having seen a doctor till absolutely compelled. We are deeply impressed with the need for a sanatorium to which sufferers could be removed in the early stages of the disease, a course which would generally involve provision being made for the support of families during the period devoted to treatment of the breadwinners. We noted continued improvement in the ventilation of sick rooms by open windows, and an increased appreciation of the value of fresh air to phthisical persons, and of the danger arising from indiscriminate spitting. "Attention may well be drawn to the final table appended to this report which bears eloquent testimony to the fact that consumption is mainly a disease of the poor. Of the 342 cases investigated fifteen only were of persons in a more or less well-to-do position—their illness had not been notified, and all of them died—the remainder belonging to classes of the population able to contribute little, if anything, to the cost of sanatorium treatment. It appears to us hopeless to expect any material benefit when the sufferer is compelled to live with others in one or two rooms; and the 'advice' to sleep alone is a counsel of perfection very rarely capable of being followed." 37 Notifications, Deaths, and Disinfections, 1908.

The subject of infantile mortality continues to receive much attention from sanitary authorities. No subject is more deserving of consideration, or is of more national importance, having regard to the constantly decreasing birth-rate. The Council exhibited their interest in this matter by appointing a "health visitor" in 1905, and were so satisfied with the result that they appointed another one temporarily, for a period of twelve months, in April, 1908. The Registrar-General, dealing with the question of infantile mortality in the Annual Summary for 1906, observed that of the total deaths under one year of age recorded in London in that year, nearly 29 per cent, took place in the first month of life, and it will be seen from the table at page 41 that this proportion was slightly exceeded in the borough last year. To this interesting table—which deals with deaths from stated causes in weeks and months under one year of age, having been designed by the Local Government Board to "procure periodically from Medical Officers of Health . . . special returns of mortality in the infantile portion of the community," I have added another, grouping the deaths occurring- in the borough in monthly periods. From this * Males, independent (4), medical practitioner, stockbroker, actor, barrister, electrical engineer, teachers of singing (1 each.) f Females, independent (2), journalist, daughter of a secretary, of a company director (one each). 39 table it appears that of the 428 deaths under one year in 1908, the numbers in the successive quarters were 111, 84, 131 and 102. Diarrhoea, which in 1907 was the cause of 21 deaths, proved fatal to 65 infants last year. Prematurity of birth was the cause of 74 deaths, including 54 in the first week, and all save four within four weeks after birth. Diseases of the lungs account for 79 deaths (pneumonia JjO, bronchitis 29), atrophy, debility, marasmus for 43, tuberculous diseases for 27. Syphilis was accountable for 17 deaths, and 22 were attributable to congenital defects. The births registered as illegitimate were 191, or 5'5 per cent on total births; the deaths of illegitimate infants were 53, equal to 12*4 per cent, on all deaths under one year, and 27'7 per cent, on births registered as illegitimate. The Health Visitors, Miss Gauntlett and Miss Wilkinson have submitted a report on their work during the year as follows:— "The Care of Infants.— In the course of the year 2,446 visits and 1,927 re-visits were paid to the homes ; total visits 4,373; in North Kensington 3,530; in South Kensington 676. In 167 cases no information was obtainable. "A Weekly visit was paid to the Maternity Ward of the Borough Infirmary, and 58 Convalescent mothers were interviewed. Many of these mothers were re-visited subsequently in their own homes. "Of the 2,279 infants seen 1,865 were found—when the first visit was paid—to be breast-fed only, 221 were partly breast and partly hand-fed; and 193 were entirely Land fed. Eighty-eight of the two latter classes were improperly fed, and 81 hand-fed infants were weaned at birth. Forty-eight long-tubed bottles were in use. We are glad to be able to record a steady decline in the use of the long-tubed bottles. "Eighteen hundred and forty-five infants appeared to be in a healthy condition, and 434 were suffering from various diseases or were weakly and ill-nourished A large proportion of these sickly infants were breast-fed only, and doubtless owing their debility in many cases to the obviously illnourished condition of the mothers; 178 were partly or wholly hand fed, and 40 little sufferers were improperly fed; 44 infants were found to be dirty and not receiving proper care. "Assiduous re-visiting resulted in "improvement" being recorded in 301 cases; this means that the mothers had been successfully urged to clothe their infants in woollen vests, that in cases of illness, in compliance with the visitor's wish, a doctor had been consulted—that long-tubed bottles and improper feeding had been abandoned—that homes were cleaner, and that the health of mother and child (one or both) had improved. "It was ascertained that 573 mothers went out to work as laundresses, charwomen, etc., (154 of the women had worked up to the day of confinement), the infants thus bereft of maternal care were put out to nurse in creches, and with fostermothers; no objection was raised by the latter to visits being paid to the children while under their care. Thirty-five mothers were employed in their own homes as machinists and laundresses. "Mothers to the number of 189 were found to be in a weakly state of health, and by reason of consumption, anaemia, starvation, mammary abscesses, overwork, etc., 48 were unable to suckle their infants at all; 47 strong, robust-looking women stated that they were unable to feed naturally owing, in some cases to depressed nipples, in others to indifference or expediency, and 9 women only acknowledged to unwillingness. We came across 187 families in need of food—the lying-in mother, invariably the bread winner, was the principal sufferer in each case. "In this connection we wish to record our gratitude for the sympathy and practical help received from the many charities we have pressed into the service of the necessitous mother, enabling her to retain the milk for the child's sustenance which would otherwise have been lost: also work has been found for some fathers. "ReNotication of Births Act—The following analysis of 100 consecutive cases visited during the 1ying-in period and re-visited within 2 months of life, may serve to demonstrate— I. The necessity for early visiting now made possible by the Notification of Births Act, and II. The value of re-visiting. 40 Breastfed. Partly breast-fed. Handfed. Improperly fed. Total. Found at visit paid during lying-in periods ... ... 96 4 0 0 100 cases, Second visit paid within 2 months of life ... ... 82 17 1 0 100 cases. "Found at Second Visit that 21 impoverished and weakly mothers had benefited by advice and help given re improving the quality of the breast milk, and had continued to suckle their infants under most unpromising circumstances. The 4 mothers found partially hand-feeding their infants had discarded the bottle altogether in favour of natural feeding only. In the 17 cases where supplementary feeding had been adopted owing to various necessities, properly prepared cow's milk had been the substitute used. The one hand-fed child was excellently so fed, cream and milk sugar were being given in addition to cow's milk. "Appended is a statement of the visits paid during the year. (###)Ward.

Of th2 hand-fed infants 21 were found to be improperly so fed and 36 had been weaned within the first month of life. "By reason of premature birth, debility and other pre-natal causes 60 infants were weakly born. "Eleven of the cases investigated were illegitimate children and 12 infants suffered through obvious neglect. "In 32 instances one or other of the parents was in bad health, and 18 mothers were discovered to be in a semi-starving condition. "Fifty-three women went out to work as laundresses, charwomen, &c., and 24 worked up to the week preceding confinement." 41 TABLE V. INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1908. (See page 38.)

The table at page 43 is a return respecting vaccination in Kensington in 1907, for which I am indebted to Mr. King, the vaccination officer. It shows that out of 3,318 infants, whose births were returned in the "Birth List Sheets" (col. 2), during the year, 2,779 were successfully vaccinated, and that 12 were returned as " insusceptible of vaccination." In 11 cases vaccination was postponed by medical certificate; 260 infants died unvaccinated; in 27 instances infants were removed to other districts, the vaccination officers of which were duly notified of the fact; whilst 163 cases, from "removal to places out of the parish, unknown, or which cannot be reached, and cases not ha.ving been found," were unaccounted for. These cases are, with those of conscientious objectors (63, against 37, 32, and 47, in the preceding three years respectively), equivalent to a "loss" (i.e. cases not finally accounted for) of 6.8 per cent., as compared with the number of births returned in the Birth List Sheets; the loss in the preceding ten years having been 10.1, 12.7 (1898), 8.1, 6.8, 7.6, 6.1, 5.8, 5.8, 5.4 and 6.3 per cent. The Vaccination officer attributes " many of the lost cases to false registration and non-registration of births." Be this as it may, the Kensington returns compare favourably with those for the Metropolis as a whole. 43 Vaccination Officer's Return respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were Registered in 1907.

Subjoined will be found the report of the Lady Inspectors of workshops, workplaces and laundries where women are employed, and the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector with respect to men's workshops, comprising information required by Section 132 to be set out in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In connection with the first-named report, it may be mentioned that it was in Kensington that the services of women were first enlisted, in 1893, in the work of sanitary administration. Now almost all of the Metropolitan Borough Councils and many provincial sanitary authorities have appointed women inspectors. The work of the Kensington Inspectors (Miss de Chaumont and Miss Looker) under the Factory and Workshop Act, in 1908, is as follows:— " The number of workshops, etc., at which female labour was employed, at the end of 1908, was 846; viz., 370 (mostly laundries) in North Kensington, and 476 (mostly dressmakers) in South Kensington. During the year, 99 new workshops were added to the register and 173 were removed therefrom. The great decrease in the number of registered premises in this report is owing to the fact that all the restaurants and dining-rooms (80 in number) have been removed from the register of women's workshops and are now under the supervision of the male inspecting staff. "The subjoined table summarises particulars of the factories and workshops on the Register at the end of the year, in North Kensington and South Kensington respectively—Holland Park Avenue and High Street, Notting Hill, constituting the dividing line.

Inspector or otherwise, received immediate attention. At several workshops improvements to ventilation, a matter within the jurisdiction of the Council, were carried out. "Overcrowding.—We have to report a slight increase in the number of instances in which this 'Nuisance' was observed : twelve cases compared with 9 in 1907 and 23 in 1906. "Sanitary Conveniences.—Where persons of both sexes are, or are intended to be employed at any factory, workshop or workplace, the provision of sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, (separate accommodation for persons of each sex), is required, by Section 38 Public Health (London) Act, 1891. These are usually provided, but difficulty occurred during the year in regard to the accommodation provided at some of the florists' shops, these premises now being classed as "workshops" under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901; whereever wreaths, bouquets, etc., are prepared for sale. The nuisance was abated in each case before the close of the year. "Outworkers.—Lists of outworkers are required to be sent in twice a year—in February and August, and reminder notices having been sent to all known employers of outworkers, there was no failure to comply with the requirements of the order during the year. The names and addresses of 832 outworkers working for firms within the Borough were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of the several boroughs in which they resided; while the names and addresses of 302 outworkers residing in Kensington, but working for firms in other boroughs, were received from Medical Officers of Health. "Infectious Disease.—Cases of notifiable diseases occurred at thirty-four workshops or outworkers' homes; scarlet fever in 12 instances; diphtheria in 11; erysipelas in 9; enteric fever in 2. The sufferers from scarlet fever and diphtheria were removed to hospital. Disinfection was carried out in every case, and happily there was no spread of disease. "Home Office Cases.— Eighty-five cases of failure to affix the "Abstract" in workshops were reported to the Home Office, and also six complaints on other matters coming under the jurisdiction of His Majesty's Inspectors, and not under that of the Local Authority. Fifteen cases of alleged insanitary conditions in workshops, received from the Home Office, were investigated forthwith, and dealt with as found necessary. Twelve reports with reference to these cases were forwarded to His Majesty's Inspectors. "For some years past we have experienced almost invariable willingness on the part of employers to conform to the requirements of the law when attention has been called to any default, and we gladly testify to the courtesy with which our visits and suggestions are received. "The table appended to this report summarises the work of the year, so far as it is capable of being expressed in this form. "We may mention that, as usual, we kept under observation the lavatory accommodation for women at the railway stations; thirteen in number, all of which were as a rule, found in good order. In two cases written intimations were necessary; they were at once complied with." 46 SUMMARY RETURN OF WORK OF LADY INSPECTORS OF WORKSHOPS, ETC. 1908. North Kensington. South Kensington.

Men's workshops (i.e. workshops conducted on the system of not employing any woman, young person or child therein) are in a somewhat different position to those where women are employed, inasmuch as (inter alia) the sections in Part I. of the Act relating to temperature, thermometers, means of ventilation, drainage of floors, sanitary conveniences, etc., are not applicable to them." I have received from the Chief Sanitary Inspector the subjoined account of the administration of the Act in relation to men's workshops, in 1908. "The businesses carried on at the workshops where men are employed, 796 in number, are set out in the subjoined list, compiled from the register, in which the trades are classified, columns being provided for the address, and the name, of the occupier, and a column for the "number of protected persons" employed at the date of inspection of the premises.

At the close of the year there were 2,056 houses on the register of "houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family" (Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 94), of which 28 were newly registered during the year. Inspections of these houses to the number of 9,246 were made by the Sanitary Inspectors, including 2,134 inspections of those which are let in "furnished" rooms. Twelve hundred and sixty-six notices were issued in the course of the year, and the provisions of the by-law for annual cleansing were duly carried out by the several landlords under the supervision, so far as practicable, of the inspectors.

Salvation Army shelters are now annually licensed, but there are none in the borough. THE WORK OF THE SANITARY INSPECTORS. The Sanitary Inspecting Staff comprises a chief inspector, ten male inspectors, and two lady inspectors of workshops, workplaces and laundries where women are employed. The table at page 53 contains a summary of the work of the male inspectors (so far as it admits of tabulation) in their several districts; of which six are in North Kensington; i.e., north of High Street, Notting Hill, and Holland Park Avenue; and four in South Kensington, three of them to the south of Kensington High Street and Kensington Road; the remaining district lying between the main thoroughfares named The work of the inspectors is carried out under the supervision of the Public Health Committee, the Council having conferred on that body authority to enforce the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 18901903, and the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, etc. Supervision of underground work—reconstruction and trapping of drains, etc., was, as from the beginning of 1905, transferred from the Borough Engineer's department and placed under the Sanitary Inspectors, who during the year supervised the reconstruction of the drainage systems of 98 premises. The Sanitary Inspectors are charged with the further duty of collecting samples of food and drugs for analysis by the public analyst; the number of samples collected last year was 700. Written Intimations of nuisances were served by the inspectors to the number of 2,402 As a result of these intimations, many works of sanitary amendment were carried out forthwith, thus realising the object of the legislature, and obviating, in many instances, the necessity for service of statutory notices. On the intimation form a red ink note authorises the person liable to abate a nuisance to make what, for convenience, may be called an "appeal" to the Committee against the requirements of the sanitary inspector. Appeal, which is of rare occurrence, usually takes the form of an application for an extension of the time specified for carrying out works. Statutory Notices for the abatement of nuisances to the number of 462 were issued by direction of the Committee. Notices under the by-laws for houses let in lodgings, to the number of 1,266, were served. Legal Proceedings.—In ten cases proceedings were instituted: in seven instances, for offences under the by-laws for registered houses, the fines in six cases amounting, in all, to £20; the other case being withdrawn, the required work having been executed. In other two cases, the summonses were for non-compliance with the Council's notices, a fine of £1 being inflicted in one 52 case, the other being withdrawn, the work having been carried out before the hearing of the summons. A penalty of £5 was also inflicted in the remaining case for conveying offensive matter through the streets during prohibited hours. The subjoined table recommended for use by the Metropolitan Branch of the Society of Medical Officers of Health is inserted at the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council.

Eleven slaughter-houses were licensed by the County Council in October—six in North Kensington and five in South Kensington. The several premises were regularly visited by the sanitary inspectors, and were inspected, in July, by the Public Health Committee. The business of a slaughterer of cattle has not been established anew in the Borough since the passing of the (now repealed) Slaughter-houses (Metropolis) Act, 1874, in which year there were 48 licensed premises. The names of the licensees, and the localities of the premises, are as follows:— North Kensington. South Kensington. Lonsdale Mews Mr. Grove. 13, Archer Mews Mr. Bawoombe. 10, Edenham. Mews Mr. Gibson. 195, Clarendon Boad Mr. Simmons. 235, Walmer Road Mrs. Van. 273, Kensal Road Mr. Miles. 35, Earl's Court Road Mr. Matson. 11, Peel Place, Silver Street Mr. Csborne. 133, High Street, Notting Hill Miss Candy. 113, Holland Park Avenue Mr. Holloway. 128, Draycott Avenue Mr. Little. LICENSED COW HOUSE. One cow house was licensed by the County Council in October for the keeping of three cows. The licensee is Mr. Arnsby, and the premises are located at 187, Walmer Road. In bygone days there were 28 licensed premises, containing 500 cows, in Kensington. Dairies Order.—The Council, as Local Authority in regard to milkshops, etc., received last year 14 applications for registration. At the close of the year 284 premises were on the register. The several premises are regularly inspected. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. I am indebted to Mr. Buck, Superintendent, for the subjoined particulars:—The washers in the year ended 31st March, 1909, were 71,321 compared with 73,302 in the preceding twelve months; the bathers 130,088 (males 97,608, females 32,480) compared with 136,695 in 1907-8. The total includes pupil teachers and evening continuation classes 3,581 (males 1,641, females 1,940); school children 35,019 (boys 22,681, girls 12,338) and members of boys clubs 609. The superintendent attributes the decrease in the numbers as compared with the previous year to the fact that new baths and washhouses have been opened in the neighbouring borough of Hammersmith within a very easy distance of those of Kensington. UNDERGROUND ROOMS ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED. In 22 instances rooms "underground" were found to be illegally occupied. The illegal occupation was in each case discontinued on the service of a written intimation, or a statutory notice. 55 DISINFECTION. The work of disinfection at the new disinfecting station, an illustrated description of which was given in the report for 1906, went on in an entirely satisfactory way throughout the year 1908.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Provisions as to Water.—In accordance with the instructions of the Public Health Committee, houses newly erected are now inspected before being occupied, in order to effect being given to Section 48 (2) of the Act, which reads as follows:— "A house which after the commencement of this Act is newly erected, or is pulled down to or below the ground floor and rebuilt, shall not be occupied as a dwelling house until the sanitary authority have certified that it has a proper and sufficient supply of water, either from a water company or by some other means."
