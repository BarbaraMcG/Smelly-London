Handbills were issued inviting the residents along the route traversed by Her Royal Highness to and from the site to decorate their premises, and the buildings belonging to the Council were decorated at the cost of the Mayor (Councillor Lorden). The 4th Volunteer Battalion East Surrey Regiment provided a Guard of Honour 011 the occasion. The Council also attended the consecration of the new Church on the 4th March, 1905- 30 10. The Scheme for amending Article 30 of the Streatham Streatham Charities' Scheme which deals with the income of the Charities. Dorothy Appleby Charity, mention of which was made in the last Report, has been made by the Charity Commissioners. 11. The Streatham Charities' Scheme provides for the appointment by the Council of four Representative Trustees of the Streatham Charities, such Trustees to hold office for a period of four years, and at the end of two years from the date of the appointment of the first Trusters, two of them, to be determined by lot if necessary, to go out of office. Mr. R. Simpson, one of the Council's representatives, having resigned his position, and it having been determined by lot that Alderman Dickinson, another of the Council's representatives, should go out of office, the Council in January last reappointed Alderman Dickinson and appointed Councillor Hunt to -fill the vacancies. 12. The Council also reappointed Alderman Dickinson and Weir Councillor Penfold representatives on the Committee Hospital Trust. to administer the " Weir Trust. Councillor Welton having intimated his desire not to be re-elected, Councillor Rose was elected a representative in his place. 13. Pursuant to Section 2 of the Borough of Wandsworth Wandsworth (Wandsworth) Scheme, the Council appointed Councillor Charities. Campbell a Representative Trustee of the Wandsworth Consolidated Charities, to fill the vacancy caused by the expiry of the period for which Mr. W. Godfrey was elected. 14. Mr. John Bell, J.P., has been reappointed by the Council a Wandsworth Representative 011 the Governing Body of the WandsTechnical Institute. worth Technical Institute for a period of three years from the 31st July, 1904. 15. The Board of Governors of the Bolingbroke Hospital have Bolingbroko elected the Mayor an Honorary Member of the Governing Hospital. Body of such Hospital. 16. The Guardians of the Union having proposed to erect an Wandsworth Infirmary at St. James's Road, Upper Tooting, the Union. attention of the Local Government Board was called to their letter of the 30th November, 1903, with reference to the probable 31 division of the Union within eight or ten years and as to the provision of additional accommodation in the meantime, and they were informed that this Council was in agreement with the proposal of the Guardians subject to the Borough of Battersea taking over the Infirmary at the cost price in the event of the division of the Union. 17. In January last, the Council appointed a Special Committee, Division of consisting of two members from each Ward to consider the Borough. ancj report as to the advisability of a division of the Borough. The Committee have not yet reported on the subject. 18. Section 2 (1) of the Education (London) Act, 1903, provides Education that every Public Elementary School provided by the Act- Local Education Authority (i.e., the London County Council), shall have a body of managers ; that the number of these managers and the manner in which the Schools, in cases where it is desirable, should be grouped under one body of managers, shall be determined by the Council of each Borough, after consultation with the Local Education Authority, and subject to the approval of the Board of Education ; that two-thirds of such body shall be appointed by the Borough Council and one-third by the Local Education Authority ; that due regard shall be had in selecting managers to the inclusion of women in the proportion of not less than one-third of the whole body of managers, and in the case of the first body of managers, also of members chosen from the then existing body of managers. 19. The Council considered the subject of the grouping of provided schools in this Borough and the appointment of managers therefor, and informed the London County Council that in its opinion the whole of the provided schools in the Borough should be placed under one body of 45 managers appointed in accordance with the Act, and that for the management of each group of Schools (of which it was suggested there should be 13) a Committee of not more than 12 managers should be appointed by the body of managers, partly from themselves and partly from existing managers. The Council also appointed Aldermen Anderson and Howell and Councillors Aldridge, Gridley, and Luscombe, to attend a Conference on the subject of the powers and duties of Metropolitan Borough Councils under the Education (London) Act, 1903, convened by the Islington Borough Council. All the Metropolitan Boroughs, with the exception of Battersea, Camberwell, Greenwich, Kensington, Southwark, Stepney 32 and Westminster, were represented, and on the motion of Councillor Gridley, one of this Council's representatives, the following resolution was passed, viz.:— "That it is desirable that the provided schools in each of the Metro" politan Boroughs should be placed under one body of managers appointed " in accordance with the Education (London) Act, 1903.'' The County Council having considered the matter, was of opinion that, as a general rule, provided schools should be arranged for the purpose of the appointment of managers in groups, each comprising not more than four schools. A circular to this effect was sent by the County Council to each Borough Council, and in October last, the County Council stated that an examination of the replies received showed that most of the Borough Councils were in general agreement with the opinion of the County Council, and that, after paying due regard to all the expressions of opinion, the County Council had come to the conclusion that it was desirable that, subject to the necessary adjustments in certain cases, the groups of provided schools should not comprise m.ore than four schools in a group ; that the groups should be so formed that all schools in. one group should be within the limits of one County Electoral area ; that (or a group of four or three schools there should not be more than 18 managers, and for a group of two schools or one school not more than 12 managers. Upon further consideration of the subject, this Council in November last agreed with the suggestions of the London County Council, and decided that the Schools in this Borough be grouped as follows :— New Road, Wandsworth Road, Clapham North Larkhall Lane, Clapham North St. Andrew's Street, Wandsworth Road, Clapham North Wirtemberg Street, Clapham North 2 Aristotle Road, Clapham South Haselrigge Road, Clapham South Bonneville Road, Clapham South 3 Cavendish Road, Clapham South New Park Road, Clapham South Telferscot Road, Clapham South 4 Oldridge Road, Balham Hearnville Road, Balham 5 Fircroft Road, Balham Broadwater Road, Balham Smallwood Road, Balham 33 6 Ensham Street, Tooting The Tooting Graveney, Tooting Sellingcourt Road, Tooting Franciscan Road, Tooting Garratt Lane, Springfield Swafheld Road, Springfield Swaffield Road Intermediate Springfield 11 7 Hitherfield Road, Streatham Sunnyhill Road, Streatham Eltringharri Street, Fairfield Warple Way Fairfield 1 2 8 Merton Road, Southfield Eardley Road, Streatham Mitchain Lane, Streatham West Hill, Southfield Southfield, Southfield Frogmore, Southfield 9 Waldron Road, Springfield The Earlsfield, Springfield Dunt's Hill, Springfield Brandlehow Road, Southfield Deodar Road, Putney Proposed new school at Putney 19. The Board of Education having approved of the proposals, the Managers for the respective Groups have been appointed by this Council and the London County Council. This Council's lepresentatives 011 Bodies of Managers of Provided and Non-Provided Schools are appointed for three years and the present representatives retire on the 7th December, 1907. 20. In November, 1903, the School Board for London asked for School the observations of this Council upon a proposal to Sites. secure compulsory powers of purchase over Nos. 2-18, Montserrat Road, Putney, and land in rear thereof, for a new school. This Council objected to the proposal and suggested an alternative site for the proposed school. The Montserrat Road site was however included in the Education Board Provisional Order Confirmation {London) Bill and passed. The subject of the school accommodation in Putney was then further considered by this Council, who came to the conclusion that the proposed new school should be 011 the west instead of the east side of Putney High Street, and in October last the County Council decided to take the necessary steps with a view to obtaining compulsory powers of purchase over a site at the corner of Hotham Road and Charlwood Road, containing 45,500 sq. ft. in lieu of the Montserrat Road site. The proposal was considered by this Council in connection with the following other suggested sites, viz :— 34 (a) On the west side of Coopers Arms Lane near Modder Place, containing 3,430 sqr. yds. (b) On the west side of Bemish Road. (c) Between Bigg's Row, March's Place, Worple Road and Lower Richmond Road containing 12,363 sqr. yds. This Council came to the conclusion that the property included in the Hotham Road site and also that immediately adjoining was of high rental value, and that the adjoining property would be seriously depreciated by the erection of the proposed school there; that the area of site (a) was not large enough, that site (b) being occupied by and the property of a Brewery Company would be expensive to procure, and that site (c) being situate in the neighbourhood in which the children who would attend the proposed school reside should be purchased for the proposed school which should face the Lower Richmond Road, provision being made for re-housing the persons displaced on the portion of the land fronting Worple Road. As this Council had not agreed with the proposal to acquire Hotham Road site, Mr. Claude Schuster was appointed by the Board of Education to hold a Public Inquiry in order that such Board might be satisfied whether the concurrence of this Council should or should not be dispensed with. The Inquiry was held on the 28th and 31st March, at which evidence was submitted on behalf of the Council and residents at Putney in favour of the Lower Richmond Road site. The Board of Education having considered the report of Mr. Schuster decided that the concurrence of this Council might be dispensed with and that a Provisional Order authorising the purchase of the Hotham Road site might be properly issued. The Provisional Order was accordingly made and included in the Education Board Provisional Order Confirmation (London No. 2) Bill. The Bill has passed the House of Lords and owing to the opposition of Sir H. Kimber, Bart., M.P. for Wandsworth, to the measure in the House of Commons, the London County Council stated that if the Bill were allowed to become law that Council would not exercise any powers over the lands mentioned in it for one year from the passing of the Act and would consider any suggestions for an alternative site which might during that period be made to it. 21. The proposals of the County Council to acquire the following sites for schools have also been considered by the Council, viz.:— (1) On the north-western side of Greyhound Lane, south west of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, and containing about 87,120 square feet. 35 (2) On the north-western side of Greyhound Lane, north east of the railway, and containing about 88,200 square feet. (3) Fountain Road, additional land for enlargement of school site. This Council suggested that site No. 1 should be acquired in preference to site No. 2, and that additional land adjoining should also be procured in order to provide playground facilities, similar to those to be provided at the Southfield School, Wandsworth. Provision was not made in the Bill for the acquisition of the additional land, and this Council again suggested to the London County Council that such land, which is at present unbuilt upon, should be acquired. No objection was made to the Fountain Road site. 22. The Local Government Board has been urged to again bring forward the Bill to make the areas of Metropolitan Boundaries. Boroughs conterminous lor all purposes which was introduced and withdrawn in the Session of 1902. 23. The scheme for the supply of electric current generated by Electric power obtained from the Tooting Dust Destructor, Lighting. referred to in the last report, has been considered by the Council, and the County of London Electric Supply Co., Ltd., were informed that this Council contemplated applying for a Provisional Order for the supply of electricity in the Borough, but before taking steps with that object the Council would be glad to learn— a. Whether the Company would be prepared to hand over to the Council the Streatham area of their undertaking upon terms. b. Whether they would be prepared tj purchase in bulk electricity generated at the Tooting Dust Destructor. In reply the Company stated that the Streatham area formed the centre of the Company's distributing system of supply, so that the sale of that area would sever the Company's undertaking into two separate portions, and involve great interference with the supply of electricity in the remaining area; and that the situation of the Company's generating station is so far from the Tooting Dust Destructor that the proposal that the Company should purchase •electricity generated at the Tooting Dust Destructor appeared to be practically impossible. It was pointed out to the Company that, 36 having regard to the fact that current is generated at Wandsworth and transmitted to Streatham and there transformed, it appeared to the Council that electricity generated at the looting Dust Destructor could profitably be used by the Company, the Dust Destructor being nearer to the Streatham distributing station than is the Company's generating station at Wandsworth. The subject of lighting the streets of Tooting with electricity being under the consideration of the Company and the Highways Committee, it was suggested that it would be an advantage to the Company to purchase the electricity generated at the Tooting Destructor for the purpose of lighting the streets in question. The Company then stated that they were advised that it would not be practicable for them to take at their sub-station at Streatham the current generated at the Tooting Dust Destructor for distribution over the whole of the Wandsworth area, but that they looked more favourably on the proposal that the Company should purchase electricity generated by the Tooting Dust Destructor for the purpose of lighting the public streets of Tooting, and that the Company's Engineer would confer with the Council's Surveyor on the subject. The matter is still under consideration. 24. The subject of the variations of pressure on the circuit of the Company's mains is also still under the consideration of the Council. 25. The Council has again been in correspondence with the Company on the subject of the charges made by them for the supply of electricity in the Borough. In June, 1904, a letter was received from the Company stating that in order to meet the wishes of a number of their consumers the Directors had decided to introduce the option of an alternative flat rate of 6d. per unit for current supplied for lighting purposes, and that the charges for meter rentals would also be reduced by about 25 per cent. 26. The attention of the Board of Trade has again been called to the accounts published by the County of London Electric Supply Company not clearly showing each undertaking separately. The Board of Trade, however, came to the conclusion that they could not call upon the Company for more detailed statements of accounts. 27. This subject has again been under consideration. The Combined St. Pancras and other Borough Councils having sugDrainage. gested that the County Council should promote a Bill in Parliament for preventing private drains being transformed into 37 sewers by the sub-division of premises that Council stated that during five sessions of Parliament it had endeavoured, without success, to obtain legislation with regard to the question ; that it was advised that the prospect of obtaining powers had not improved and the Council suggested that a joint representation should be made to the Government with a view to the question being dealt with as a public measure. This Council thereupon suggested that the matter should be considered by the Association of Metropolitan Borough Councils. It was also proposed by the Battersea and other Borough Councils that another deputation should wait upon the President of the Local Government Board to urge upon him the necessity of legislation. The President did not think it necessary to trouble a second deputation to attend, and stated that he would consider any additional information sent to him. Information relating to this Borough on the subject was forwarded to the Battersea Borough Council with the view of its being sent to the President of the Local Government Board with similar information relating to other Boroughs. 28. In reply to a letter from the London County Council this Hours of Council stated that it was in favour of the hours of Polling. polling at County Council and Metropolitan Borough Council elections being extended to 9 p.m. but did not approve of the proposed extension to candidates for election as Metropolitan Borough Councillors of the provisions of the Municipal Corporations (Corrupt Practices) Act, requiring a return and declaration of election expenses. 29. The Loudon County Council has been asked to consider the steamboat desirability of erecting a pier at the north eastern Pier. corner of Wandsworth Park in connection with the proposed river Thames Steamboat service. 30. The Council considered a letter from the London County Loans for Council stating that the attention of such Council had short-lived works. been directed to the large amounts borrowed by Borough Councils for paving works during the last few years, pointing out that the equalisation of the burden of these works would be accomplished without any charge for interest if Borough Councils were to arrange to expend approximately the same amount each year upon paving works and to defray the same out of the rates for the year. This Council expressed the opinion that the policy suggested would require a 38 -gradual provision out of the rates averaging a halfpenny in the pound during the next ten years and would also tend to greater irregularity in the amount of the rate required for local purposes as the need of heavy outlays of this nature would occasionally arise at an inconvenient moment. The Council pointed out that the total charge on the rates for interest on these loans as estimated for the Metropolitan Boroughs collectively was probably 6,000 per annum upon a rateable value of 36 millions which would equal a rate of about onetenth of a penny in the pound and did not seem a particularly heavy price to pay for the advantage of equalizing the burdens of the ratepayers ; that this Borough, being traversed by several important trunk roads, is more than others exposed to the risk of having to repave with wood long lengths of roadway, so that any obstacle to the equalization of annual expense would especially press upon Wandsworth. Under all the circumstances this Council proposed to charge the current rates with temporary improvements of the value of ^4,000, and under, and to borrow as hitherto in respect of more costly ones. To carry this proposal into effect it is intended to fix a sum to be levied annually as a Fund for wood paving and other works, such sum to be carried to a separate fund and not merged in the general balance ; the annual sum so allocated to be revised from time to time but neither increased or diminished save for special reasons or as a measure of permanent policy. 31. The London County Council having been asked by this Seats on Council to provide additional seats on Tooting Graveney Commons. Common, especially along the Tooting Bee Road, stated that, in view of the fact that the estimates of expenditure for the year contained no provision out of which the cost of the additional seats could be defrayed, the Parks Committee had decided to postpone the consideration of the question, and that the subject would be again considered in sufficient time to enable such additional seats as the Committee might deem it desirable to provide to be constructed and placed on the Common before the summer of 1905. 32. The London County Council have also been asked to provide Bowling Bowling Greens on Wandsworth, Streatham, and Greens. Tooting Commons similar to those provided on other •open spaces under the control of the County Council. 39 33- Alderman Kipling, and Councillors I.ing and Sommerfeld were appointed the Council's representatives to attend a Telephones Qonferencej convened by the Corporation of London, of representatives of Local Authorities in the London Telephone area, to consider the proposed purchase by the Government of the National Telephone Company's undertaking. The Corporation, the London County Council, the Westminster City Council, 25 Metropolitan Borough Councils, eight Provincial Borough Councils, and 40 Urban District Councils were represented at the Conference, at which the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— (a) That this Conference is of opinion that it would be inexpedient for the Government to acquire the undertaking of the National Telephone Company on any other terms than those set out in the agreement between the Postmaster-General and the Company, dated. November 18th, 1901. (A) That this Conference is of opinion that before any agreement is entered into with the National Telephone Company for the purchase of their system within the London Telephone area the terms of the proposed arrangement should be submitted for the consideration of the Local Authorities within the London telephone area ; and that in the event of Parliament appointing a Committee to consider purchase negotiations between the Postmaster. General and the National Telephone Company, the local authorities within the London telephone area should be enabled to submit their views before such Committee, and steps be taken to secure accordingly. (c) That this Conference again protests against the Post Office telephone tariff, being of opinion that the charge for the use of a telephone in the London area should be materially reduced. (d) That in the opinion of this Conference, the trunk line service is inadequate and unsatisfactory, and requires considerable improvement. 34. Copies of the resolutions were sent to the Prime Minister, the Postmaster-General and others, and a letter was received from the Postmaster-General to the effect that he thought the National Telephone Company could hardly be expected to accept at the present time the terms which they accepted as applicable 011 the termination of their licence in 1911 ; that he was convinced that the acquisition by the Government of the whole telephone system of the country in the near future, provided the price to be paid was reasonable, would be more to the public advantage; that further opportunity would be given for consideration by Parliament of any agreement between the Government and the Company which might be proposed, when the views of the Local Authorities in the London area would 110 doubt be expressed by their representatives in the House of Commons, but he c 4° did not see his way to promise that an agreement applicable to the whole United Kingdom should be submitted to the Local Authorities representing a limited part of the country ; that with regard to the charge for unlimited service (^17 per annum) the Select Committee of 1898 did not consider a charge of that kind unduly high for large users ; that in his opinion the proper method of charge for an exchange service was that recommended bysuch Committee underwhich the payments of subscribers were fixed in proportion to the user, and that the work of constructing additional trunk lines w-ould be pushed 011 as rapidly as possible. The matter is now under the consideration of Parliament. 35 The Council considered 24 applications for new licenses for the sale iix the Borough of intoxicating liquors and with Licenses • • the exception of one case, being the transfer of an existing license from No. 56 to 40, Streatham High Road, opposed all the applications. The Licensing Magistrates refused the applications except in the following cases, viz. :— No. 40, Streatham High Road— Bter, wine and spirits off ... Mr. J. Hooke. No. 16, Richmond Terrace, Southfield— Beer off ... ... ... ... Mr. F. E. Laceby. No. 84, Brookwood Road, Southfield—■ Beer off (bottles only) ... ... Mr. G. Goodman. The two last-mentioned applicants having each offered to surrender a beer on-license within the Wandsworth Division, their applications were granted. 36. Several notices of intention to apply for transfers of existing licenses were considered, and the Council decided to take no action with regard thereto. 37. Notices of intention to apply for the renewal of music and dancing licenses in the Borough were considered and no objection made thereto. 38. Proceedings have been taken against six persons for keeping Disorderly disorderly houses in the Clapham North Ward. In Houses. every case a conviction was obtained. The penalties inflicted were in one case 3 months' hard labour and in another 4 4i months' hard labour, In the remaining cases the defendants were fined sums ranging from £5 and as. costs to £20 and ^5 5s. costs. Five other complaints were received and inquired into, but the evidence was not sufficient to warrant proceedings being taken. 39. The Council had under consideration the question of the law relating to disorderly houses and with the view of more effectively dealing with the matter, sealed a joint petition to the Home Secretary in favour of an amendment of section 13 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, which deals with legal proceedings in such cases. The petition was also sealed by the Council of the City of Westminster and by 17 other Metropolitan Borough Councils. 40. In October last the President of the Local Government Board The U11- prepared a scheme for dealing with the Unemployed, employed. The scheme proposed that a Joint Committee should be established for each Metropolitan Borough, who should receive applications for work and enquire into them, and that a Central Committee should be formed upon which each of the Joint-Committees and the London County Council should be represented and additional members appointed by the Local Government Board. The Central Committee were to gather and distribute information as to employment and administer the funds entrusted to them and deal as far as possible with cases of the unemployed in any Borough for whom employment could not be found by the Joint-Committee. A Joint-Committee was appointed for this Borough consisting of the following members of the Borough Council and the Board of Guardians, viz.:— The Borough Council—The Mayor (Alderman The Rev. J. H. Anderson, M.A., J.P.), Alderman J. M. Rucker, Councillors A. Glegg, D. Jackson, T. P. Ling, J. W. Lorden, H. W. Nightingale, M. Robinson, and H. Somerford. The Board of Guardians—Rev. Canon Curtis, M.A., Messrs. Percival Rees, S. P. Clark, Councillor J. L. Curtis, Messrs. A. Forward, J. Holland, W. P. Mellhuish, H. Osburn, and A. Sullivan. The Mayor and the Rev. Canon Curtis, M.A., were appointed the representatives on the Central Committee, and the Town Clerk Hon. Secretary to the Joint-Committee 42 41. With the view of finding work for the unemployed the Borough Council decided to put in hand the following works :— Estimated Cost. Channelling and Paving Works £3,000 Widening and levelling footpaths at Church Lane, Tooting 1,690 Tarpaving footpaths across Wandsworth Common 336 Levelling land and setting back fence at Coronation Gardens 251 .£5,277 The Guardians also provided 549 days'work for the unemployed on their land at Tooting Home. 42. The Joint-Committee received and inquired into 909 applications, and offered work to 357, of whom 291 accepted the offer—the total number of days work provided being 12,831. Some of the men were employed on works of the Central Committee at Tooting Common, Totterdown, Long Grove Asylum, Hollesley Bay, Garden City and Green Park. A fuller report as to the work of the Joint-Committee has been issued separately. 43. The subject of the proposed erection of a new Mortuary for Mortua Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth Wards has again Coroner's been considered and, in connection therewith, the want Court. 0f a coroner's Court, and the County Council has been informed that this Council proposes to erect the proposed Mortuary on the site of Nos. 2, 4 & 6, Ram Square, and asked to erect the proposed Coroner's Court on land in Red Lion Street, Wandsworth, acquired by the County Council in connection with the widening for the proposed tramways there. The proposal is still under the consideration of the County Council. 44. The provisions of this Act enable local authorities to make Shop Hours' closing orders, fixing the hours on the several days of Act. the week at which either throughout the area of the local authority, or in any specified part thereof, all shops or shops of any specified class are to be closed for serving customers. The hours fixed may be as early as 1 p.m. on one day in the week, but on the remaining days shall not be earlier than 7 p.m. Closing orders do not come into force until confirmed by the Secretary of State, and are not 43 to apply to fairs, charitable bazaars, or shops carrying on exclusively certain businesses specified in the schedule to the Act. Councillors Aldridge, Ball, and Lindsey were appointed the Council's representatives to attend a conference of representatives of South London Boroughs, convened by the Lewisham Borough Council, to consider the provisions of the Act. The conference drafted a circular letter to traders and form of reply thereto, which they suggested should be issued in the several Boroughs with the view of ascertaining the opinion of traders with regard to the hours of closing to be adopted in the several trades. This Council has not adopted the circular. 45. Numerous letters have been received, and several deputations from tradesmen and associations attended before the Council both in favour of and against closing orders being made, and in March last the Council decided to take no steps under the Act unless it first received a petition for a closing order signed by a substantial portion of the traders who would be affected if the order were made. 46. The Council has since received a petition signed by a large number of hairdressers and barbers asking the Council to make a closing order with respect to hairdressers' and barbers' establishments in the Borough. A register of hairdressers' and barbers' establishments has been prepared, and a draft order dealing with such establishments issued by the Council. 47. The subject of making a closing order for the Clapham North and South Wards generally is also under consideration. 48. The following Parliamentary Bills have been considered by Parliamentary t]ie Council during the year, viz. :— Bills. London County Council (General Powers). London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). London Building Acts (Amendment). London Squares and Enclosures (Preservation). Sale of Bread (London). Polling Arrangements (Parliamentary Boroughs). Polling Districts (County Councils). Administrative County of London and District Electric Power Company. County of London Electric Supply Company. Supply of Electricity. 44 London Port and Docks. Port of London. Thames Harbour. London Gas. Gas Light and Coke, South Metropolitan and Commercial Gas Company. South Metropolitan Gas Company Weights and Measures (Metric System). Open Spaces. Metropolitan Police Provisional Order. Metropolitan Pneumatic Despatch. Re-vaccination. Vaccination. Sale of Butter. Rating of Machinery. Valuation. Licensing. Land Values (Assessment and Rating). Local Authorities (Qualification of Women). Metropolitan District Railway. Public Meeting Facilites. South Eastern and Chatham and Dover Railways. Sale of Intoxicants to Children. Sunday Closing of Shops. Thames Conservancy. Justices of the Peace. 49. This Bill proposed to authorise the London County Couucil London County tQ compulsorily purchase for the purposes of the (General Powers) Metropolitan Fire Brigade Acts, lands at the corner of Kersfield Road and Putney Death Lane and at Christchurch Road, Streatham, to make representations to the Local Government Board as to the manner in which the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts are administered and to institute inquiries and make investigations for that purpose, to authorise officers of the County Council to take samples of milk for the purpose of ascertaining whether such milk came from cows suffering from tuberculosis, or whether the milk is likely to cause infectious disease, and to authorise officers of Sanitary Authorities to take for examination at any place within their district, samples of milk purchased, sold or intended for sale with the view of ascertaining whether such milk is fit food, and to enable the County 45 Council to make representations to the Local Government Board as to the manner in which the last-mentioned provisions are administered. The Bill also proposed to authorise the County Council to enter into agreements for the exchange of lands adjoining or near open spaces, to extend the time for the widening of York Road, Battersea and Wandsworth, until August, 1908. to prevent the carrying on for the purposes of private gain registries for the employment of female servants or of a theatrical or music hall employment agency without a license from the London County Council, and to authorise Metropolitan Borough Councils which are authorised to supply and are supplying electrical energy to supply and fix wires, fittings and apparatus at the premises of their customers or prospective customers. 50. This Council petitioned against the Bill and suggested that power to acquire the land at Putney Heath Lane should only be given upon condition that that thoroughfare should be widened to 45 feet in front of the land in question, that the provision relating to the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts would serve no useful purpose and would tend to embarrass Sanitary Authorities in the performance of their duties ; that the suggested powers for the inspection of cows and the prohibition of the supply of milk from dairies where cows are suspected of suffering from tuberculosis should be exercised jointly by the County Council and Metropolitan Borough Councils, and that the power proposed to be given to the County Council to make representations to the Local Government Board as to the manner in which Sanitary Authorities carry out their duties under the Bill should only be conferred in the event of default being made by a Sanitary Authority and should be limited to the district of such Authority. 51. With regard to the proposed acquisition of land at Putney Heath Lane the County Council undertook that the proposed widening should be considered by the Improvements Committee but owing to the opposition of residents in the neighbouihood the clause relating to the acquisition of the land in question was withdrawn. The clauses relating to the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and milk supply were also withdrawn. The date for the completion of the widening of York Road has been altered to August, 1906, and a proviso added to the clause relating to the wiring of premises for electric current to the effect that the charges for such wiring, &c., shall be so adjusted as to meet any expenditure by the Borough Council under the powers of the clause, and that the charges for wiring and 46 fittings shall be shewn on the demand notes distinct from the charge for energy. The Bill as amended received the Royal Assent on the 11 th August. 52. This Bill included a proposal to provide a continuous London County tramway service over Westminster and Blackfriars Council (Tramways). Bridges and along the Victoria Embankment and for an extension to the Embankment of the subway tramway authorised in 1902. The CouncM, being of opinion that the carrying out of the proposal would be of great advantage to the inhabitants of this Borough and the County generally, passed a resolution in favour of the proposal and authorised Alderman Kipling to give evidence in favour thereof. The Committee of the House of Commons passed the provisions subject to Blackfriars Bridge being widened or a new bridge constructed there, and the Bill was read a third time, as amended, on the 12th July. The Bill was rejected by the House of Lords on the 18th July. 53. A Bill to amend the London Building Act was again London introduced by the London County Council. The Bill Building Act (Amendment), dealt with the following subjects, viz :— Formation and widening of streets, lines of building frontage, naming and numbering of streets, open spaces about buildings and height of buildings, construction of buildings, special and temporary buildings and wooden structures, means of escape in case of fire, and provisions for reducing risk of fire in buildings, rights of building and adjoining owners, dangerous and neglected structures, dangerous and noxious businesses, dwelling houses on low-lying land, Superintending Architect and District Surveyors, bye-laws, legal proceedings and other matters. This Council presented a petition against the Bill and appointed Alderman Lorden and Councillors Glegg, Hunt and Wise, to attend a Conference convened by the Kensington Borough Council to consider the provisions of the Bill at which a Committee was appointed, Alderman Lorden being elected this Council's representative on such Committee. The County Council, having withdrawn all the provisions of the Bill except those relating to means of escape in case of fire, and provisions for reducing the risk of fire in buildings, the Committee appointed by the Kensington Conference suggested that the opposition of the several local Authorities who had petitioned against the Bill would be materially strengthened and much expense saved if the opposition 47 could be a joint one; and that any expenditure arising from the joint action should be defrayed by the Councils concerned on the basis of their respective rateable values. The Council concurred in the views of the Committee and decided to take part in the joint opposition upon the proposed terms. At a meeting of the Conference on the 8th May last the following resolutions were passed, viz :— (a.) That, with reference to the communication recently addressed tothe Metropolitan Local Authorities on the subject of the amendment of the Building Acts, this Conference desires to reiterate the view expressed at its former meeting, that before any amending Bill is drafted the-whole question of the administration of the Acts should be reported upon by a Royal Commission, in order that the. new legislation may not only provide for the consolidation as well as amendment of the existing law, but may ensure a substantial devolution of the administration of the Acts from the central to the local Authorities. (6.) That it be suggested to the Metropolitan Local Authorities that they should, in replying to the communication of the London County Couficil, make it clear that no Amendment Bill will be deemed satisfactory which does not provide for all administrative duties under the Acts which can be efficiently discharged by the local Authorities being transferred to those bodies, in accordance with the views expressed by the Royal Commission in 1894. The Council agreed with the views expressed in the foregoing resolutions. The Bill as amended received the Royal Assent on the 1 ith August. In May, 1905, the County Council forwarded a copy of a report with regard to the Bill together with a copy of a document showing the effect rf the Bill on the existing Acts, and stated that the Council would be glad to receive the co-operation of the Borough Councils and others concerned in introducing in. the next session of Parliament a Bill containing all the necessary amendments of the Act and asking that any observations which the Council might have to make with regard to the matter might be communicated to the County Council by the 10th June. The County Council were asked to extend the time within which they would receive observations upon the proposed Bill and the time was extended to the 10th July. The matter is still under the consideration of the Council. 53. This Bill was introduced by the London Count}' Council with London the view of preventing the erection on 542 enclosures in Enclosures the County of London, set out in the Schedule to the (Preservation). ^ j3uj|cjjngS or structures other than such buildings 48 or structures as are necessary or convenient for the use and enjoyment of such enclosures as gardens, recreation grounds, or other like purposes. The Schedule included the following enclosures in this Borough, viz. :— West Hill Road, Wandsworth—Triangular garden enclosure bounded on the north by the roadways of West Hill Road and the premises therein numbered 31 to 37 and of part of Wimbledon Park Road, and the premises therein numbered 26 to 32, on the south-cast by the roadway of other part of Wimbledon Park Road and the premises therein numbered 19 to 27, and on the south-west by the roadway of West Hill Road and premises therein numbered 44. West Hill, Wandsworth—Triangular unenclosed piece of land bounded on * the north by the roadway of The Terrace, Upper Richmond Road, and on the south by part of the roadway of West Hill. West Hill Road, Wandsworth—Triangular unenclosed space bounded on the north-west by a portion of Avenue Road, on the north-east by the roadway of West Hill Road and the premises therein known as 44 Oxford Lodge," and on the south by the roadway of Viewfield Road and the premises therein known as 41 Harefield." Nightingale Square, Balham—Garden enclosure bounded on the north and south by the roadway of Nightingale Square and the premises therein numbered I to 38, on the east by the roadway of Endlesham Road and the premises therein numbered 47 to 51, and on the west by the premises known as 44 St. Gertrude's House." Crescent Lane, Clapham—Crescent-shaped garden enclosure bounded on all sides by the roadway of Crescent Grove and the premises therein numbered l to 32. Grafton Square, Clapham—Garden enclosure bounded on all sides by the roadway of Grafton Square and the premises therein numbered I to 38. Holmewood Gardens, Streatham—Two garden enclosures bounded on all sides by the roadways of Holmewood Gardens and the premises therein numbered I to 81 and of a portion of Holmewood Road. Pleasant Place, Clapham—Unenclosed piece of land bounded on the northeast and north-west by the roadway of Triangle Place, and on the south by Pleasant Place. Clapham Common—Two garden strips bounded on the north by the roadway upon which abut the premises known as 43 to 52, 44 The Cedars," and on the south by a porlion of the roadway known as Clapham Common North Side. 49 Melrose Road (Triangle), Wandsworth—Garden enclosure bounded on the east and west by the roadways of Viewfield Road at the junction of that road with Melrose Road, and on the south by Melrose Road. Garret Green, Wands worth—Unenclosed land bounded on the north-west by a portion of the roadway of Burnt wood Lane, on the north-east and south-east by a portion of the roadway known as Aboyne Road, and on the west by the roadway of Garrets Green. The Bill was read a second time in the House of Lords, but was not farther proceeded with. 54. This Bill was also introduced by the London County Council, Sale of Bread and provided that all bread sold within the County (London). should be sold by weight and not otherwise, and only in loaves the weight of which is one imperial pound or any other weight being a complete number of imperial pounds. Clause 3 defined bread to include every kind of bread except that made up into separate rolls, twists, or other shapes, each weighing less than one pound, and not being similar in shape or appearance to ordinary loaves of bread. The Council suggested that the concluding portion of the definition should be deleted and that a provision should be inserted providing for a margin of variation in the weight of loaves, any deficiency to be made up to the purchaser. The Bill was rejected by the Committee of the House of Commons to which it was referred. Polling Arrangements (Parliamentary Boroughs). 55. A Bill on this subject to the same effect as that referred to in the last Annual Report has again been introduced and read a third time in the House of Lords. Polling Districts (County Councils). 56. This Bill is also to the same effect as the Bill under the same t'tie referred to in the last Annual Report, and has been read a third time in the House of Lords. Administrative County of London and District Electric Power Company. 57. This Bill provided for the incorporation of a Company with a capital of £5,000,000 for the purpose of producing, generating and transforming energy in the County of London and portions of the Counties of' Essex, Kent, Middlesex and Surrey. The powers of the Company for the supply of energy were to be subject to the provision that energy should be supplied only to authorised undertakers and for providing power to any persons. The Bill, together with others introduced by other Electric Supply Companies, was considered by a Committee of 50 the House of Lords, and passed after amendments, and, as amended, provided that in the industrial portion of the area prescribed in the Bill energy could not be supplied by the Company (except to authorised undertakers or to the proprietors of any railway, tramway waterworks, dock, canal, or Government departments), in the area of supply of any authorised distributors except with the consent of those distributors, whose consent was not to be unreasonably withheld. In the nonindustrial area, the provisions of the Bill were not to be exercised except for the purpose of supplying energy to undertakers, proprietors of railways, &c., or to any persons for power whose premises are situated partly within and partly without the industrial portion of the area. The Company were not to charge more than 1½d. per unit, but might refuse to supply consumers if they thought they could not be supplied remuneratively at that price. The dividend was not to be greater than 8 per cent., unless the average price received by the Company was less than ¾d. per unit, when the dividend might be increased ¼ per cent. for every 1¼ per cent. reduction of price below ¾d. 58. This Borough not being in the industrial area, the Council presented a petition against the Bill, but after communicating with the Company and conferring with the Council's solicitor as to the probability of the Bill being amended so as to include the Borough in the industrial area, the Council decided not to proceed further with its opposition. The Bill passed the House of Lords, and was read a second time in the House of Commons, but was not Passed. County of London Electric Supply Company. 59. This Bill would authorise the Company to acquire additional land adjoining the Creek, Wandsworth, and to erect thereon additional buildings and works, to supply electrical energy in bulk to authorised undertakers in the City and other parts of London, and to connect their areas of supply and the generating stations at Wandsworth and Finsbury one with another, and would require the Company to supply authorised undertakers with electrical energy at such points as they may reasonably require. The Company having inserted clauses in the Bill limiting the proposed building line on the land to be acquired adjoining the Creek, Wandsworth, to the line of the camp sheeting there, and prohibiting the Company enclosing any portion of the foreshore, and providing that the Creek shall be flushed not less frequently than at present, the Council withdrew its opposition to the Bill. The Committee of the House of Lords struck out of the Bill the provisions relating to the supply in bulk and the coupling up of the generating stations. A 51 clause was inserted to the effect that no person shall be entitled to demand or continue to receive from the Company a supply of electricity for any premises having a separate supply, unless he has agreed with the Company to pay to them such minimum annual sum as will give them a reasonable return on the capital expenditure, and will cover other standing charges incurred by them in order to meet the possible maximum demand for those premises. As it appeared that the clause was inserted with a view to protect the Company from the course which has sometimes been adopted by large consumers, such as theatres, &c., who are in a position to compel the Company to lay their mains to the consumers' premises, while the consumers use their own plant and generate their own current, of calling upon the Company for a supply on rare occasions, when their own plant breaks down, the Council decided not to oppose it. The Bill as amended was passed. Supply of Electricity 60. This Bill was introduced by Lord Wolverton on behalf of the Government, and proposed amongst other things to empower authorised undertakers for the supply of electricity to compulsorily acquire land for generating stations subject to the provisions of the Lands' Clauses Acts, to supply electricity in bulk to other authorised undertakers, and to reduce the ordinary period of seven years for a revision of maximum charges to five years in any Act passed after the passing of the Bill. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which passed the House of Lords, and was not proceeded with further. London Port and Docks. Port of London. Thames Harbour. 61. These three Bills, the first of which was introduced by the London County Council, proposed to establish a Commission for the administration of the Port of London. The Council petitioned against the Bills and in favour of a public inquiry into the matter. The Bills have not yet been read a second time. London Gas. Gas Light and Coke, South Metropolitan, and Commercial Gas. South Metropolitan Gas. 62. The first of these Bills was introduced by the London County Council, and included the recommendation of the Departmental Committee of the Board of Trade recently appointed to inquire into the subject of gas testing in the Metropolis with reference to method of testing gas, and modifications of the present test for sulphur impurities. 52 63. The Gas Light and Coke, the South Metropolitan, and the Commercial Gas Bill, provided for some modifications of the method of determining the illuminating power which were in opposition to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee, and differed from the mode of testing in use. 64. The South Metropolitan Bill, while dealing with the same tests for illuminating power as the last-mentioned Bill, left the tests for purity as at present under the Gas Works' Act, and proposed the abolition of the office of gas referee. The Council petitioned against the two last-mentioned Bills, but in view of the opposition of the London County Council thereto and to the promotion by such Council of the London Gas Bill, did not proceed further with its opposition. The three Bills were referred to a Committee of the House of Commons. After four days' discussion, the Committee passed the preamble of the County Council's Bill, and rejected that of the Companies. The County Council's Bill was afterwards modified by abolishing the sulphur tests for forfeitures, and provision was made for the illuminating power to be tested in the same way as the purity is at present tested, viz.:—on a three days' average. The Bill as amended was passed. 65. This Bill, referred to in the last Annual Report, received the Royal assent on August 15th, 1904. "Weights and Measures. (Metric System.) 66. This Bill was introduced by the Government with the object of consolidating the enactments relating to open spaces without making any alteration in the law except such as seemed necessary for removing inconsistencies. This Council suggested to the Government that Clause 14 of the Bill should be amended so as to authorise Borough Councils, as well as County Councils, to purchase, lease, lay out and maintain lands, for the purpose of being used as public walks and pleasure grounds, and to support or contribute to the support of public walks or pleasure grounds. In reply, the Board of Agriculture stated that the Bill was essentially for the consolidation of the existing enactments, and that the passing cf the Bill would probably be imperilled by the introduction of the amendment suggested by the Council, and that the wishes of the Council would be kept in view. The Council informed the Board of Agriculture that it regretted that these proposals could not be adopted at present, and trusted that the matter would be further considered in due course. The Bill was withdrawn on the 9th August. Open Spaces. 53 Metropolitan Police Provisional Order. 67. This Bill contained provisions authorising the acquisition of a piece of land adjoining the Police Station, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, for the purpose of enlarging and improving such station. The Council suggested that any buildings which may be erected on the land in question should not be erected in advance of the existing station, and the Home Secretary stated that when the time came for rebuilding the station, the wishes of the Council with regard to the frontage line would be borne in mind. Metropolitan Pneumatic Despatch. 68. This Bill proposed to authorise the establishment of a Company with a capital of £4,000,000 for the purpose of constructing, laying down, maintaining, and using pneumatic lines in the County of London, and collecting, transmitting, and despatching parcels, goods and messages within and beyond the County. The Bill was rejected on preamble. Re-Vaccination. 69. This Bill provided that children should be re-vaccinated within six months of attaining the age of twelve years, and that lists of children attending schools should be sent to the vaccination officers during the months of May and November in each year. The Council presented a petition in favour of the Bill, which was, however, not proceeded with. 54 Valuation. 73. This Bill which was introduced into the House of Commons by the Government proposed to apply the present law relating to assessments in London with some modifications to the whole of the country as recommended by the Royal Committee on Local Taxation in 1901. The Bill proposed to repeal practically the whole of the Acts which deal with assessments, and provided, for the first time, for a quinquennial valuation simultaneously throughout the country. The Metropolitan Borough Councils, as Overseers, would have continued to perform all the preliminary work of collating the necessary information and making the list, but the County Council would have had power to appoint a person to value special property and have such valuer's figures inserted in the list, and, if they thought fit, to appoint some one to make the list instead of the Borough Council, and to do so if the Borough Council failed to make the list. Assessment Committees were to be abolished and the County Council was to become the Valuation Authoritv, with power of supervision and regulation with regard to making and revising the lists. A Valuation Committee was to be established for each Metropolitan Borough. This Committee was to be formed of such number of members as the County Council might fix, and to consist of members of the Borough Council (who were to form a majority of the Committee) together with a number of members of the Board of Guardians and other members appointed by the County Council. In those Boroughs which constitute a separate Poor Law area, the Guardians were not to be represented. It was proposed that a Provisional List should in future operate only from the date of the service of a copy of the list as confirmed by the Valuation Committee. Supplemental Lists were to be made yearly as in the past. Appeals were to be limited to Quarter Sessions. The first Schedule to the Bill laid down rules with respect to the quorum, proceedings and place of meetings, and as to the appointment of Sub-Committees. The Clerk to the Committee was to be appointed by the County Council. The maximum deductions from the gross to arrive at the rateable value prescribed by the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, were made fixed deductions. The notices and forms were to be prescribed by the Local Government Board and the Treasury. 74. This Council approved generally of the Bill, and suggested that it should be amended so as to provide that a Provisional List shall have operation as respects any hereditament not previously assessed from the date the hereditament becomes occupied and as respects any 55 altered value from the date of the service of a copy of the valuation immediately after the List is made ; that it should be made clear that any expenses incurred by a Borough Council in carrying out the provisions of the Act should not require the sanction of the County Council; that the rates of reduction from gross to rateable value should exclude fractions of a; that Government property should be subject to the same treatment as all other property; that Borough Councils should appoint at least three-fourths of the Valuation Committee, and that the system of a quinquennial re-valuation should be continued, but that each Metropolitan Borough should be subdivided into five sections, so that the re-valuation might be spread equally over five years. 75. Councillors Ball and Godfrey Evans were appointed this Council's representatives to attend a Conference convened by the Paddington Borough Council, at which the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— (a.) That in the opinion of this Conference of Metropolitan, City and Borough Councils, and Assessment Committees, the provisions of the Valuation Bill, as applied to London, are impracticable and unnecessary, and ought to be abandoned. (b.) That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation of the Conference at an early date, in order that its views on the Bill may be laid before him. 76. The deputation afterwards waited upon the President, who intimated that it was the intention of the Government to proceed with the Bill, and to apply its provisions with such amendments as might be deemed expedient to London. 77. At a Conference convened by the London County Council, the following resolutions were passed with regard to the Bill, viz.:— (a.) That the Corporation of the City of London and the Councils of the City of Westminster and the Metropolitan Boroughs, shall be the Valuation Authorities for the purposes of the Act. (b.) That, except in the case of the assessment of its own property, the London County Council shall, in regard to rateable value, have similar powers to those given by the existing law to Surveyors of Taxes, in regard to gross value; and that the costs of any appeals against assessments increased at the instance of the London County Council shall be borne by that authority out of the County Fund. D 56 (c.) That provision be made for the London County Council being empowered, after conference with the Valuation Authorities, to make bye-laws, to be approved by the Local Government Board, to secure uniformity in practice for valuation purposes in the Administrative County of London. 78. A deputation from this Conference also waited upon the President of the Local Government Board, who intimated that he was favourably disposed to consider the suggestions laid before him by the deputation. The Bill was read a second time on the 20th July last, and was then withdrawn. Land Values (Assessment and Bating). 79. This Bill provided that all valuation lists on which local rates were based, should contain separate assessments of the land values on rateable premises; that the laud value was to be an amount equal to three per cent. on the selling value of the land as distinct from the building; that unoccupied premises were to be subject to rating, but only on the land value; that in cases where the land value of premises exceeded the rateable value, rates were to be paid on the land value; that after the Bill became law, the occupiers should be entitled to deduct from their rent so much of any rate as is based on the amount of the land value, but that there should be no interference with existing contracts; and that deductions from the gross value for the purpose of arriving at the rateable value should be made on the value of the building only and not on the land value. The provisions of the Bill were considered by the Council, and the following resolutions were passed thereon, viz.:— (1). That to levy rates upon ground values in respect of any expenditure save capital outlay on improvements permanently increasing the value of the hereditament would be unjust. • (2). That a fair portion of any capital outlay on such improvements (including instalments of sinking fund of loans in respect of same) might justly be levied on ground values, saving existing contracts. (3). That great injustice would result from rating vacant land at a hypothetical valuation founded on its presumed utility for building purposes. (4). That the Council disapproves of the Land Values Assessment and Rating Bill as it is not in harmony with the foregoing conclusions. (5). That as site and structure differ so much in character, it is desirable that they should be separately rated for the purpose of local taxation. 57 (6). That the differential treatment should take the form of a special site value rate. (7). That the site value for this purpose • should be arrived at by deducting from the gross assessment of the premises such rent in respect of the structural value of the buildings or other improvements thereon as shall equal an annuity which would by the six per cent, interest tables extinguish the structural value fixed by the assessors in a term of j'ears also fixed by them representing the estimated duration of such buildings or other improvements, but which term of years should not exceed seventy years even in the case of a new building.—The gross assessment referred to should equal the rack rental less cost of repairs or maintenance and fire insurance falling on the landlord. (8). That ordinary rates payable by the occupier should continue to be charged on the total rateable value. (9). That the special site value rate should be confined to the purposes mentioned in resolution No. (2) and should be charged in respect of sites of occupied and unoccupied buildings but not on sites of buildings which have never been occupied. The special rate should in the first instance be paid by the occupier, if any, and he should (saving existing contracts) have power to deduct such special rate from the rent due to his landlord,, each leaseholder being ent:tled to deduct the same from the rent payable by him to his lessors, provided that if such rent be less than the site value on which the rate is charged, the deduction shall only be on the amount of the actual rent. In the case of unoccupied property the site value rate should be payable by the freeholder. (10). That having regard to the onerous expenditure which is incurred locally for matters of national concern, a larger contribution should be made from Imperial sources. This is the more necessary as at present the rates are levied upon about one-fourth of the property«of the community. Licensing. The Bill was not read a second time. 80. The principal object of this Bill was to authorise the Quarter Sessions, subject to payment of compensation, to refuse the renewal of licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors. Where the Quarter Sessions refused the renewal of licenses, a sum equal to the difference between the value of the licensed premises and their value if they were not licensed, was to be the compensation to be paid to the persons interested in licensed premises. Quarter Sessions were for the purpose of providing compensation authorised to impose certain charges on all licenses granted or renewed in respect of premises in their area. The Council 58 were of opinion that the Bill should be amended by providing that there should be a time limit to the payment of compensation to licenses not renewed ; that the powers of the local Justices should be continued as heretofore, and that all licensed premises should be valued immediately and contributions to the Valuation Fund made on the values. The suggestions of the Council were not adopted, and the Bill received the Royal assent on the 15th August, 1904. Local Authorities (Taxation and purchase of Land). 81. The objects of this Bill were :— To require owners of land to declare the unimproved value thereof, or otherwise to ascertain such value; To confer upon local authorities power to levy upon owners of land a rate upon its ascertained unimproved value for the benefit of the locality ; To confer upon local authorities power to acquire such land at such ascertained value, but subject to certain limits as to the amount to be expended in the exercise thereof. To confer upon local authorities certain defined powers of user of land so acquired, in order to secure to the community the benefit of any subsequent rise in its capital value and to the tenant the full benefit of all capital expended by him on buildings or improvements. 82. The Council made no order with regard to the Bill, which was not proceeded with. A similar Bill was introduced during the present Session, and Councillors Glegg and Welton were appointed this Council's representatives to attend a Conference convened by the Hackney Borough Council. 17 Borough Councils and 15 Boards of Guardians were represented at the Conference, and the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— 1. “That this Conference of representatives of Metroplitan Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians heartily approves of the principles of the Local Authorities (Taxation and Purchase of Land) Bill now before Parliament on the following grounds :— (a) That it would provide a new and just source of local revenue to the relief of the rates on houses and other buildings. (b) That it would remove the present unnecessary restrictions and reduce the present ruinous expenses whenever tend ?s needed for public purposes. (c) That it would enable Local Authorities to acquire land for building and other purposes, and thus to secure a far better 59 development of our towns, and put into the public purse the unearned increment of land, and the other profits of development. 2. That copies of the foregoing resolution be sent to the Prime Minister, the President of the Local Government board, Sir Henry Campbell Banner man, M.P., and the Metropolitan Members of Parliament and that the London County Council, the City Corporation, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians be asked to petition Parliament in favour of the Bill. The Bill has since been dropped. 83. No action was taken with regard to the other Bills above mentioned. 84. The Metropolitan Paving Committee, which consists of repre- Openings in Roads. sedatives of a number of Metropolitan Borough Councils, have had under consideration the subject of the injurious effect upon paving works of the openings made in streets by public Companies, and the great inconvenience and obstruction to traffic caused by the inspection and repair of their works in public streets, by the Postmaster-General, the Electric Light and other Companies. The Paving Committee were strongly of opinion that some further powers should be given to local authorities for the protection of traders and the public generally; and with a view to formulating proposals for strengthening the position of Borough Councils in this direction, convened a Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Local Authorities on the subject. 85. The Conference was held at the Westminster City Hall on the 19th May, when Councillors Glegg and Wise, together with the Town Clerk and the Surveyors, attended as the representatives of this Council, and a resolution was passed expressing the opinion that greater power and control should be given to the Highway Authorities with regard to the opening of public streets for the purposes of gas, water, hydraulic, electric, telephonic, telegraphic, tramway, and similar undertakings, and that a Bill should be introduced into Parliament by the Government embodying model clauses for the better protection of the local authorities with the view of the same being made applicable to all undertakings involving interference with the public streets. The Conference decided to ask the Prime Minister and the President of the Local Government Board to receive a deputation in support of 6o the proposal, and a Committee of the Conference was appointed to take the necessary steps to give effect to the resolution. This Council concurred in the resolution passed at the Conference. Heavy Traffic on Tramway Routes. 86. In September last the Council called the attention of the London County Council to the obstruction to tramway cars caused by heavily-laden vans and carts, and suggested that steps should be taken with the view of slow traffic being kept to the sides of the roads where tramways are laid. The suggestion was adopted by a Committee of the London County Council, who submitted to the Home Secretary a proposal for a draft bye-law dealing with the matter for application throughout the County of London. The Home Secretary was not, however, disposed to allow a general bye-law. The County Council Committee are now in communication with him as to the streets to which the proposed bye-law should be applicable, and have expressed the opinion that any list of streets which may be drawn up should include the streets in which tramways are laid. Fire-alarm Indication. 87. The London County Council has been in communication with the several Metropolitan Borough Councils with the view of an uniform system being adopted throughout London for indicating the position of fire-alarm posts. The replies of the Borough Councils having been considered, the County Council suggested that the County Council should supply the fire-alarm indicators, and that the Borough Councils should fix them to the lamp columns nearest the fire alarms, maintain and paint the indicators as often as may be necessary, and paint the lamp columns red. For some years past it has been the practice in this Borough to paint red the lamp columns nearest fire-alarm posts. The Council has now decided to also adopt the other suggestions of the County Council, which have so far been agreed to by 15 of the Borough Councils in London. Locomotives on Highways. 88. The Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Local Authorities convened by the London County Council to consider the subject of the prop°sed restriction of heavy locomotive traffic on streets within the County was held in November last, when Councillors Wise and Parker (the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, of the Highways Committee), and Councillor Ling attended as the representatives of this Council. The resolutions passed at the Conference are still under the consideration of the London County Council. 61 89. In December last the Local Government Board made an Order (The Heavy motor-car Order, 1904) dealing with motor-cars exceeding two tons in weight. By this Order, which came into force on the 1st March last, the widths required for the tires of the wheels of heavy motor-cars and the speed at which they may be driven on highways, are made dependent upon the weight of the car and load. The Paddington Borough Council objected to the Order and convened a Conference of Metropolitan Local Authorities on the subject. The Conference was held in March last, when resolutions were passed suggesting modifications in the Order with the view of reducing the weight and speed of heavy motor-cars. This Council did not take part in the Conference, as it appeared to the Council that the Order would be useful in controlling the speed at which heavy locomotives might travel along the streets, and that the damage to buildings, &c., arising from the vibration caused by this class of traffic would thereby be considerably reduced. Electrical Traction on Tramways. 90. With regard to the system of electrical traction to be adopted for the new tramways from Wandsworth to Tooting and the re-constructed tramways in York Road, the Council in December last was informed by the County Council that from a careful investigation which had been made of the route it appeared that certain extensive additional widening would be necessary in order to permit of the whole of this line being constructed for an underground system of electrical traction, that, apart from the question of delay, the County Council Committee did not then feel able to recommend that Council to incur the very heavy expenditure which the improvements in question would entail; that a proposal had been under consideration for the re-construction of the lines from tile eastern end of the route to a point west of Falcon Road (where the necessity of fresh widenings arose) for the underground system, the re-construction of the remainder of the existing tramways west of that point and the construction of the authorised tramways along Garratt Lane being carried out on the overhead system; that should this course prove practicable it might be possible for the work to be put in hand at an early date, and the lines would in that case, it was hoped, be ready for electrical working by the time that the generating station at Greenwich was completed. The County Council asked whether this Council would be prepared to consent to the use of overhead traction on the part of the existing tramways in this Borough 62 proposed to be re-constructed for that system, and on the new tramways in Garratt Lane, &c. ; and stated that in the event of the lines being constructed as proposed and being ready for working before electrical power was available from the Greenwich generating station, the County Council Committee would carefully consider the Borough Council's suggestion that a service of horse-drawn cars should be run on the Garratt Lane lines. In reply, the County Council was referred to its letter of the 8th July, 1903, from which it appeared that the tramways could be constructed for the conduit system approximately by the following dates, viz.:-(a) Tooting Tramway Terminus to Earlsfield railway station, 30th June. 1904; (b) Earlsfield railway station to York Road, Wandsworth, 31st October, 1904 ; and informed that the Borough Council was anxious that the proposed tramways in Red Lion Street, South Street, Garratt Lane, and Defoe Road, should be constructed at once, and on the conduit system, and was of opinion that until sufficient electrical power could be obtained from the Greenwich generating station horse-drawn cars should be run on that route. 91. The County Council having further considered the subject ill connection with other tramways which that Council is authorised to construct, now proposes to adopt an underground conduit system of electrical traction for the following tramways, viz.:— (a) The existing tramways from North Street, Wandsworth, via York Road, Battered Park Road, &c., to Westminster Bridge. (b) The new tramways from York Road, Wandsworth, at its junction with North Street, via York Road, Red Lion Street, South Street, Garratt Lane, and Defoe Road to join the newly-constructed lines at Tooting. (c) The new tramways from Queen Street, Hammersmith, to a point in Lower Richmond Road near the junction of that road with the approach to Putney Bridge ; and has applied to the Board of Trade for its approval of the system. 92. From the plans and description submitted by the County Council, it appears that the system is practically the same as that adopted for the Westminster to Tooting tramways. Sufficient information has not, however, been given to the Borough Council as to the positions and dimensions of the feeder pillars and the positions of the levers for working the points, and fuller particulars have been 63 asked for. The ducts for the distributing cables are to be placed either under the footpaths, or under the tramway margins, or under the clearway between the two tracks. As nearly the whole of the footpaths in Defoe Road and Garratt Lane has only recently been re-paved, the Borough Council hopes that the County Council will arrange for the ducts to be laid in the carriageway. 93. With regard to the paving, the County Council proposes that the part of the road between the tramway rails should be paved with granite setts, as difficulties are likely to arise if wood is used between the rails owing to the closing of the slot by the expansion of the wood. Outside public buildings, churches, &c., some form of silent paving will be employed if the road authority so desires. The County Council only proposes to pave the margins of the tramways for a width of 18 inches with wood or granite to correspond with the remainder of the surface of the roadway. A large part of the thoroughfares is at present macadamised, and in the opinion of the Borough Council the whole of the carriageways outside the rails should be paved with wood and of the footpaths with artificial stone. 94. The new tramways (b) and (c) are to be constructed as double lines throughout, and the County Council proposes to re-construct the existing tramways in York Road as double lines, except (1) between Morie Street and Edgel Street and (2) between Ferrier Street and Alma Road, where it is intended to arrange the existing single line portions as interlaced lines. In the case of the first mentioned exception sufficient width of road could be obtained for a double line by acquiring the forecourts of the property abutting on the road in the same way as the County Council proposes to widen the adjoining sections of the road. In the other instance, if a double line were adopted, the outer rail of the tramway would for a length of about 50 yards be less than the statutory distance of 9 ft. 6 ins. from the kerb, but the necessary consents thereto could, no doubt, be obtained. Inconvenience and danger are likely to arise if the system of interlaced lines is adopted, and the Borough Council does not therefore favour its introduction. 95. The Borough Council decided not to object to the proposed system of electrical traction upon condition— (a) That the feeder pillars and point levers be placed in such positions as the Borough Council may approve so that they may not obstruct the traffic, that the levers be arranged so that the handles work 64 parallel with, and not at right angles to the kerb, and that before fixing the pillars and levers the County Council furnish the Borough Council with detailed drawings and obtain its approval thereof. (b) That drain rails be provided to the tramway track where required by the Borough Council. (c) That the whole of the carriageways outside the tramway rails be paved with creosoted wood blocks and of the footpaths with artificial stone at the cost of the County Council. (d) That the County Council maintain at its own cost the whole width of the carriageway in all cases where this is now done by that Council as successor to the South London Tramways Company. (e) That the widths of the footpaths be not reduced except in such cases as the Borough Council approve. (/) That in all cases a double line of tramways be constructed throughout. 96. The Board of Trade and the County Council have been acquainted with the Borough Council's views on the subject. 97. The question of the obstruction caused by certain of the feeder pillars fixed by the London County Council on the footpath in the road leading from Clapham to Tooting for controlling the various sections of the electrical tramways there has continued to receive the attention of this Council. At the suggestion of the County Council, the officers of that Council and of the Borough Council met on the ground with the view of some arrangement satisfactory to both Councils being come to in the matter, and the County Council subsequently submitted for approval a drawing of a smaller type of pillar which it was proposed to substitute for the pillars to which the Borough Council objected, viz.:— those opposite No. 130, High Street, Clapham, the London and County Bank, No. 128, Balham High Road, and Nos. 64-66, Upper Tooting Road, respectively, the new pillars to be placed slightly nearer the edge of the kerb, so as to reduce the widths of the footpaths as little as possible. The Borough Council, however, did not see its way to agree to this proposal, and again urged the County Council to shift the three pillars to positions where less obstruction would be caused to the traffic. In reply, the County Council stated that as the Borough Council had not accepted the County Council's suggestions, no further steps would be taken for the alteration of the pillars. In view of the position taken up by the County Council, the Borough Council has decided to appeal to the Board of Trade in the matter. 65 Tramway Improvements- 98. The Council has also had under consideration suggestions of the London County Council with regard to the widening of thoroughfares in connection with the proposal to reconstruct for an underground conduit system of electrical traction, the northern route of the tramways acquired from the South London Tramways Company. The Improvements Committee of the County Council stated that the estimated nett cost of acquiring the necessary property in Wandsworth was £12,000, and of executing the paving works (excluding the cost of laying down and paving the tramway track), £2,570 total £14,570 for the Wandsworth portion of the scheme ; and asked whether, in the event of the suggested improvements being proceeded with, the Borough Council would be prepared (1) to consent to the doubling of the two lengths of the tramway in York Road, between Edgel Street and Wandsworth railway station ; and would agree (2) to the setting back of the kerbs and the re-construction as a double line of the tramway in York Road at its junction with Jews' Row at a less distance than 9 ft. 6 ins. from the kerb; (3) to contribute one-third (about £4,857) of the nett cost of certain suggested street widenings in York Road, Wandsworth ; and (4) to the narrowing of the footpaths there. The County Council also proposed that the Borough Council should agree (5) to put into force on behalf of and at the cost of the County Council its compulsory powers under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act in those cases where terms could not be agreed for the acquisition of the necessary property, so as to avoid the delay of applying to Parliament next Session for compulsory powers. 99. The Borough Council decided to agree to the suggestions (1), (2) and (5). The Borough Council did not, however, see its way to consent to the width of the footways being reduced to the extent proposed by the County Council, except at the corner of Jews' Row. The County Council was informed that upon its agreeing to widen the thoroughfares where the tramways will be re-constructed to not less than 54 ft. where such width could be obtained without interfering with buildings, to pave the whole of the carriageways with wood and of the footpaths with artificial stone, to maintain the whole width of the carriageway in all cases where this was done by the County Council as successor to the South London Tramways Company, and to construct a double line of tramways where possible, the question of the Borough Council contributing one-third of the cost of the street widenings in Wandsworth 66 would be further considered, and the County Council was asked to furnish the Borough Council with an amended plan and detailed estimate of the cost of the proposed improvement. 100. Considerable progress has been made by the London County Council during the past year in acquiring property required for the widening of thoroughfares for the proposed electrical tramways along York Road, Red Lion Street, South Street, Garratt Lane, Defoe Road, and Tooting High Street. By arrangement with the County Council, the Borough Council is carrying out the work of paving the new footpaths as the land is purchased by the County Council and the fences set back. The Borough Council has also arranged for the lighting of the widened thoroughfares and for the existing overhead telegraph wires to be placed underground. The cost of these works will be charged to the improvement. The question of the paving of the footpaths having been satisfactorily settled, the Council has been urging the London County Council to proceed with the work of constructing the tramways and wood paving the carriageways. The Improvements Committee of the County Council, however, stated that having regard to the character of the traffic at present passing along the thoroughfares they could not advise the County Council to incur the very heavy additional expenditure which the use of wood instead of macadam would entail. The amount provided for paving works in the estimate of the cost of the widening of the thoroughfares in question was £77,000, and the Borough Council expressed the opinion that this was amply sufficient for the whole of the carriageways to be paved with wood and of the footpaths with stone of the best description. When the widening scheme was first put forward, the Borough Council agreed to contribute one-third (not exceeding £91,316) of the nett cost of the improvement upon the understanding that the paving works would be carried out in this manner, and in 1903 approved a proposal of the County Council that the footpaths should be paved with artificial stone, instead of York stone, thus greatly reducing the cost. Under the circumstances, the Borough Council decided to adhere to the original scheme for the paving of the carriageways with wood. 101. These views were communicated to the County Council, and the matter is under the consideration of that Council. 67 Tramway Extension 102. The Borough Council has again been in communication with the County Council with regard to the suggested schemes for the extension of the tramway system from Streatham to Norbury, and from Clapham to Wandsworth. The Highways Committee of the County Council propose to recommend that Council to apply for powers to construct the suggested tramway from the present Streatham terminus along Streatham High Road, with a loop line along Gleneldon Road, Bournevale Road and Stanthorpe Road, to the County boundary at Norbury, but have decided not to recommend the County Council for the present to revive the suggestion for the construction of a tramway from Clapham Common to East Hill, Wandsworth. The County Council has been informed that the Borough Council regrets the decision not to proceed with the scheme for the construction of a tramway from Clapham Common to Wandsworth, and it has been pointed out that the part of the thoroughfare in the Borough of Battersea has already been widened in anticipation of the proposed tramways, and that it is very desirable that tramways should be constructed from Clapham via East Hill and High Street, Wandsworth, to the junction of West Hill with Upper Richmond Road. Lower Richmond Road Widening 103. The Council having acquired the property on the northern side of Lower Richmond Road required for this improvement, the buildings have been removed and a footpath formed there. In reply to this Council's application for a contribution towards the cost of the widening, the Improvements Committee of the London County Council pointed out that to complete the widening of the whole thoroughfare it would be necessary to deal with other properties, and suggested that the Borough Council should prepare alternative estimates of the cost of widening Lower Richmond Road (a) to 54 ft. and (b) to 60 ft. throughout. 104. After consultation with the London County Council valuer, an estimate of the cost of acquiring the property required for widening the road to 54 ft. was prepared and amounted to £37,328, after allowing for surplus land. The estimated cost of paving the carriageway with wood and the footpaths with artificial stone was £11,372. The total estimated nett cost of widening the road throughout to 54 ft. was, therefore, £48,700. The estimate was forwarded to the County Council, and that Council informed that the Borough Council did not 68 think any good purpose would be served by the preparation of an estimate for a 60 ft. road, as the cost would be prohibitive, owing to the large number of buildings affected, and the County Council was reminded that the Borough Council's application for a contribution related only to the widening of the road between Biggs' Row and Rotherwood Road, the estimated cost of which was £5,830. The County Council has not yet come to a decision upon the Borough Council's application. 105. When the Act authorising the London County Council to construct a tramway from Hammersmith, via Fulham Palace Road, to a point in Lower Richmond Road near the junction of that road with the approach to Putney Bridge, was before Parliament, the Borough Council secured the insertion of a clause providing for the widening of the part of Lower Richmond Road where a tramway would be laid. The whole of the cost of this widening will be payable by the County Council. The County Council having recently had under consideration the details of the scheme, pointed out that it would be very inconvenient to arrange the levels of the road satisfactorily were the widening carried into effect in accordance with the plan approved by the Borough Council when the Act was passed, and submitted a modified plan by which no interference with the abutments ( f Putney Bridge would be involved, and the facilities provided for the general and tramway traffic in Lower Richmond Road would be fully as satisfactory as those which would have been secured by the adoption of the original scheme of widening. In reply, the County Council was informed that the Borough Council would be prepared to approve the amended plan of the widening upon the County Council providing, to the satisfaction of the Borough Council, a site for an underground sanitary convenience at or near the approach to Putney Bridge, should the Borough Council desire to construct a convenience there. This proposal is now under the consideration of the County Council. "Widening at corner of Upper Richmond Road and Putney Hill. 106. The negotiations which were commenced in August of last year for the acquisition of the property required for widening the public way at the corner of Upper Richmond Road and Putney Hill in connection with the erection of a new bank there, have now been brought' to a satisfactory conclusion. The total estimated cost of the improvement is £4,690. This corner is at present highly dangerous 69 Putney Bridge Road widening. for the traffic, many serious and some fatal accidents having occurred there. Some of the property has been acquired, and the Council is pressing forward the arrangements with the Bank for an exchange of land, in order that the improvement may be effected with as little delay as possible. The London County Council has been asked to contribute two-thirds of the cost of the widening. 107. Nearly all the property required for continuing the widening of Putney Bridge Road from Wandsworth Park southward to the London and South Western Railway Bridge has now been purchased. Steps are being taken for the compulsory acquisition of the remainder. The fences on the western side of the road have been set back and the paving works there completed. The total estimated cost of this improvement, including the land acquired from the Railway Company, is £1,700. 108. The Council has approved a plan for the continuation to the Convent grounds of the widening recently effected in Putney Bridge Road at its junction with High Street, Wandsworth. Some of the property required has been purchased, but the prices asked for the remainder being considered prohibitive, the Council has decided not to proceed with their acquisition at present. The total estimated cost of the widening is £6,250. 109. The London County Council has been asked to contribute towards the cost of both the above-mentioned improvements, but has not yet come to a decision in the matter. High Street, Wandsworth, Improvement 110. The Council having purchased on favourable terms the four houses with shops adjoining the Wandsworth Town Hall on the east, a scheme for widening that part of High Street, Wandsworth to about 58 ft. has been approved. The total estimated cost of the improvement is £2,053. The Borough Council has asked the London County Council to contribute two-thirds of the cost, and has offered to consent to the construction of a tramway in the part of the road to be widened. The land not required for the improvement will be available for the extension of the office accommodation at the Town Hall. Approach to River at High Street. Wandsworth. 111. The desirability of stopping up the approach to the River Wandle on the eastern side of the bridge at High Street, Wandsworth, has formed the subject of negotiations between the Borough Council, the owner of some 70 adjoining property, and the London County Council, that Council having recently undertaken the future maintenance of the bridge and its approaches. The owner of property referred to, who was also the owner of mills above and below the bridge, objected to the river wall erected by the Borough Council alongside the public baths, and an arrangement has now been come to whereby this objection is waived on the Council taking the necessary steps to obtain an order of the Justices for stopping up the approach to the river and removing the island between High Street and Buckhold Road. The part of the site of the approach required for the widening of High Street to 60 ft. will be transferred to the County Council, but will not be added to the public-way there until the bridge is widened or reconstructed. The remainder of the site will become the property of the owner of the adjoining land, who is to be at liberty to build thereon. The approach to the river has often been the subject of complaint, and several fatal accidents have occurred there. The necessary steps for obtaining the closing order will be taken as soon as the agreement is completed. Should the order not be made within an agreed time, a sum of money will be payable to the above mentioned owner of property. 112. The agreement referred to in last year's report for the widening of Merton Road, Wandsworth, in front of the Park Tavern, to 54 ft., the rounding off of the angle at the junction of Merton Road and West Hill Road, and the construction of a public underground sanitary convenience on the corner has been entered into. The necessary land having been conveyed to the Council the widening has been o ected, and the work of constructing the convenience will be shortly completed. Merton Road, Wansworth, "Widening, and Sanitary Convenience. Footbridge over Biver Wandle, near South Street. 113. The Highways Committee have for some time had under consideration the subject of the necessity of improving the bridge carrying the footpath from South Street to Southfic'd over the River Wandle west of McMurray's Paper Mills. The existing footbridge is very narrow and inconvenient, and is clten flooded. The Committee prepared a scheme, which was appr \ed by the Council in December last, for the construction of a new bridge and the straightening of the path in connection therewith. In order to carry out the proposal, a small piece of land is required on the western bank of the river, and as the Committee have not been 71 Widening Railway Bridges at Streatham. able to come to terms with the owner for its acquisition, proceedings will be taken to acquire the same compulsorily. 114. The late District Board secured the insertion in the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Act, 1898, of clauses providing that when the widening of the Croydon and Balham line authorised by the Act was carried our, the Company were, if required by the Board, to widen to 40 ft. the two bridges carrying the railway over the Cattle Creep and Hermitage Green Road respectively, between Greyhound Lane and the County Boundary, the cost of the alterations to be paid by the Board. The necessary notices were duly given to the Company, and the works have now been completed. 115. The cost of reconstructing the Cattle Creep, which was estimated at £2,500, has been ,£2,374. The widened bridge will provide improved means of communication between the estates on either side of the railway, and the owners have contributed £1,500 towards the cost. The London County Council promised to pay one-half the balance, the contribution not to exceed £500, and to be payable when the bridge in question forms part of a thoroughfare for general traffic. Application has been made to the County Council for payment of its promised contribution, which will amount to £437. The expense incurred by the Borough Council in respect of this bridge is £437. 116. With regard to the Hermitage Green Bridge, the estimated cost of the work was £3,000, and the actual cost £2,735. The owners of the adjoining estate, who agreed to contribute one-third of the cost, not exceeding £1,000, have paid their proportion, viz. : £912. Several applications have been made to the County Council to contribute one-third of the nett cost of the improvement, but that Council has so far declined to do so. The expense to be borne by the Borough Council in this case is therefore at present £1,823. Tooting High Street Widening. 117. The owners of property in Tooting High Street between the " Castle " public-housc and Defoe Road, having completed the work of re-erecting their premises to the new line of frontage, the land required for the improvement has been thrown into the public way. The widening of the other parts of the road required in connection with the extension of the electric tramways are being carried out by the County Council. E 72 Mitcham Road, Tooting. Improvement. 118. The negotiations for the acquisition of the property required for this widening have been proceeded with, and terms settled in several cases. In a few instances, however, the compensation offered by the Council not having been accepted, it has been necessary to take steps to acquire the property compulsorily. Church lane, Tooting, Improvement. 119. In connection with the development for building purposes of the Totter-down Fields estate and the Totter down estate, 011 the north-western side of Church Lane, Tooting, the Council has arranged with the owners for the widening of the road there to 50 ft. The total estimated cost of the improvement is £1,800, the greater part of which is in respect of levelling the land added to the public way. The London County Council has been asked to contribute towards the cost, but has not yet come to a decision on the subject. Widening Bye-road, Tooting Common. 120. The attention of the Borough Council having been called to the insufficient width of a short bye-road running diagonally across Tooting Common, and forming part of an omnibus route between Streatham and Balham, the County Council suggested that the road should be widened slightly by the incorporation therein of a strip of the Common, and that the Borough Council should, at its own expense, widen, make up, and thereafter maintain the road. Upon the suggestion being considered, a proposal was made that, as an alternative, a part of West Drive, Streatham Park, should be adopted, and the road continued in a northwesterly direction to Tooting Bee Road. The schemes put forward for carrying out the last-mentioned suggestion were as follows, viz. (a) That West Drive should be continued in a direct line across private property and a narrow strip of Tooting Common to Tooting Bee Road opposite The Avenue. The estimated cost of constructing the road was £1,289, to which would have had to be added the compensation payable in respect of property required. (b) That from the north-western angle in West Drive a road should be formed leading on to looting Common and along the edge of the Common in a north-westerly direction to Tooting Bee Road opposite The Avenue. The estimated cost of the road was £ 1,474. The private property required for scheme (a) would not have been interfered with, but there would have been a sharp twist in the road where it entered the Common. 73 121. In either case it would have been necessary to widen, kerb, and channel The Avenue leading across Tooting Common from Tooting Bec Road to Hillbury Road, and the cost of this work was estimated at £1,650. It should also be mentioned that there are gates at the entrance to West Drive at the junction of Ullathorne Road and Thrale Road. Cavendish Road, Balham, Improvement. 122. In view of all the circumstances, the Borough Council did not see its way to adopt either of the two schemes (a) and (b) referred to above, and has decided to agree to the suggestion of the County Council for the widening of the short bye-road across Tooting Common. The County Council has now formally approved this proposal, the estimated cost of which is £150. 123. The negotiations for the acquisition of the property required for widening the narrow part of Cavendish Road, Balham, have been proceeded with and terms settled in all cases. Arrangements are being made for dealing with the surplus land and for the fences to be set back and the paving works carried out upon the purchases being completed. Flooding from Sewers 125. This Council has continued to urge upon the County Council the necessity of steps being taken to provide further main drainage accommodation so as to prevent, as far as possible, the flooding of premises from the sewers at times of heavy rain storms. Although, fortunately, these storms have been less frequent during the past year than in some former years, the comparative immunity from flooding which has been enjoyed is no doubt due to the relief and overflow sewers recently provided by the County Council and the Borough Council. Wandsworth Boad, Clapham, Widening. 124. In 1884. the late District Board secured the dedication to the public by the freeholders of a strip of the forecourts of the houses in Wandsworth Road, Clapham, between Union Road and Union Grove, subject to the then existing leases. These leases, with one exception, having expired, the Council has set back the forecourt fences and paved the land added to the public way in front of Nos. 419 to 457. The total cost of the works was £580. Application has been made to the London Contry Council for a contribution towards the cost of the improvement. 74 126. The work of constructing the relief sewer for the districts of Wandsworth and Battersea most severely affected by rain storms, was begun by the County Council in January last, and is being rapidly pressed forward. A new pumping station will be provided in connection with this sewer. 127. The London County Council having declined to take any steps with regard to the flooding from the sewers at West Streatham, this Council decided to deal with the matter by constructing a storm-water relief sewer in Greyhound Lane. The Council came to an arrangement with the owners of an adjoining estate for the sewer, together with a sewer for the drainage of the estate, to be laid in land abutting upon Greyhound Lane, but which will eventually form part of the public way. The total estimated cost of the sewerage works was £2,600, towards which the owners of the estate contributed the sum of £250 and agreed to give up hereafter sufficient land to make the part of Greyhound Lane between Eardley Road and the Graveney Brook 54 ft. wide. The work of constructing the sewer, which was put in hand as soon as the necessary agreements had been entered into, has now been completed, and the Council trusts that the flooding of premises in the locality will thereby be prevented. Coronation Gardens. 128. The Council has for some time past had under consideration the subject of the desirability of extending Coronation Gardens, which were presented to the Borough by Mr. W. J. Lancaster, J.P., L.C.C., during his Mayoralty. A piece of land on the south of the Gardens, and having a frontage to Pirbright Road, has been purchased for the sum of £1,250, and added to the Gardens. The necessary fencing and drainage works have been carried out, trees have been planted in the Gardens alongside the road, the land to the east of the new entrance from Pirbright Road has been sown with grass seed, and that to the west tar-paved as a site for swings. A contract has been entered into for supplying and fixing the swings for the sum of £76 5s. 0d. This expense has been defrayed by the donor of the Gardens. Garratt Park. 129. The Highways Committee have been making arrangements for the provision of a recreation ground for children on the land belonging to the Council at Garratt Park, purchased for use as a slop-shoot. A piece of land containing about two and a half acres at the south-eastern corner of the property lias been set apart for this purpose. The entrance to the playground will be in Siward Road, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth. The necessary fencing, levelling and drainage works have been carried out, and grass seed sown, the estimated cost being £300. The ground will be opened for the use of the children as soon as the grass is sufficiently matured. Pavement Lights. 130. During the past few years a large number of business premises have been erected within the Borough, and from time to time applications are received for permission to construct pavement lights in the public way in order to light the basements of the shops. The Highways Committee, who have had the matter under consideration, have come to the conclusion that as a general rule pavement lights ought not to be allowed in the highway except in cases where the land in which they would be placed has been given up to widen the road without expense to the Council. With the view of securing uniformity of practice as far as possible when permission is granted, the Council upon the recommendation of the Committee adopted regulations dealing with the matter. Copies of the regulations and forms of application for consent may be obtained at the Council House and at the offices of the Surveyors. 131. During the past year the Highways Committee have had Motor under consideration the subject of the desirability of Traction. substituting motor traction for horse traction for the Council's vehicles, and obtained a report from the Surveyors as to the estimated cost of motors suitable for the Council's purposes. With the view of making a trial of motor traction, the Council, upon the recommendation of the Committee, purchased from the Lancashire Steam Motor Company, Limited, a motor wagon with an inter-changeable tip body and water tank.. The motor has recently been delivered, and is at present used in the western district for street watering purposes. The wagon having proved satisfactory, the Council in May last decided to purchase a similar one for use in the eastern district, and this is now in course of construction. The price of the wagons is £600 each, and the Company have undertaken to keep them in repair for a period of seven years for £50 per annum each. When not required for watering, the motors will be used for conveying materials to the Council's depots. 132. There are a number of vacancies for horses at the Council's stables at Clapham and Putney, but in view of the trial of motor 75 76 traction now being made, and the cost of the Council's stable establishments as compared with the cost of hiring horses, the Highways Committee have decided not to recommend the purchase of any more horses at present. Motor Vans. 133. The Council decided on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee to purchase a motor van for the removal of infected articles for disinfection. The van was purchased from Mr. E. J. Coles for the sum of £360, including accessories, and is working satisfactorily. Inspection of Government Property. 134. The Council has had under consideration the subject of the inspection of Crown property. At present the Council's inspectors have 110 authority to inspect Government buildings, and in support of the action taken by the Lambeth Borough Council, the County Council was asked to take action with the view of such property being inspected and dealt with under the Public Health Acts. The attention of the Local Government Board and that of the Metropolitan Borough Councils' Association was also called to the matter. Disinfecting Station. 135. In July, 1902, the Council decided that in view of the necessity for additional provision being made for the disinfection of clothes, bedding, &c., and the need for use by the Surveyors' Department of the whole area of the wharf at Wandsworth, where the disinfecting station is placed, to provide a new establishment with additional apparatus for the whole of the Borough, at the dust destructor depot, Tooting. Plans for the building were prepared by the Surveyor for the eastern district, which were approved by the Council. Application was made to the Local Government Board for their consent to the borrowing by the Council of the sum required for the erection of the buildings. An inquiry was held by an inspector of the Local Government Board into the application, and the loan has now been sanctioned. A contract has been entered into with Messrs. R. Dean & Co. for carrying out the work, which is now in hand. A plan of the station was published in the annual report of the Medical Officer of Health for last year, page 120. Daily removal of House Refuse. 136. The Public Health Committee considered the subject of the removal of house refuse, and with a view to reducing the number of complaints received and at the same time to improve the system of collection, the Medical Officer 77 of Health and Surveyors ware instructed to report upon the subject. A copy of the report of the Medical Officer of Health will be found on pages 124 to 130 of his report, "Appendix E" 137. The matter was referred to a Special Joint Sub-Committee of the Public Health and Highways Committees who reported thereon to the Public Health and Highways Committees, who recommended as follows:— (a) That the refuse from the houses in the areas selected by the Surveyors, one in the Eastern and one in the Western Districts, be removed daily, experimentally in the first place for a period of 12 months from the 1st January. (b) That with a view to an unitorm system being adopted in the prescribed areas, and in consideration of the men in these areas not being allowed to pick over the refuse, the wages of all carmen employed in dusting in those areas be 27s. per week. (c) That the notice as settled by the Committee be printed and circulated in the districts selected, giving to ratepayers the necessary notice of the proposed change in the system of removing house refuse. 138. On the notices being served, numerous letters were received from residents, especially those residing in the Putney Ward, objecting to put the refuse on the kerb as required, and with the view of further explaining the scheme a second notice was printed aad circulated in the areas where the daily collection was to be carried out. A memorial was also received from Mr. J. W. Baines and 79 residents in Putney objecting to the proposed scheme, and a deputation waited upon the Council with reference to the matter. After full reconsideration of the subject, the Council decided to adhere to its decision. 139. The daily collection was commenced 011 the t2nd January, and shortly afterwards a summons was taken out against the Council by Mr. Baines (who did not place his house refuse upon the kerb as required) for failing to remove the refuse from his premises without reasonable cause. A petition was also received by the Council from residents in the area in question asking the Council to modify its requirements, so as to enable the house refuse to be left on the doorstep, or in the forecourt in the case of terrace houses, or in the side entrance in the case of detached or semi-detached houses, or in some other conveniently accessible position on the premises, for removal by the Council's scavengers. The Council, however, came to the conclusion that if this suggestion was adopted, the cost would make the system of daily removal prohibitive. The scheme depended for its success upon a rapid collection, which could only be effected by the receptacles being placed on the footpaths so that they could be lifted by the scavengers and emptied into the dust van as it passed along the street and replaced on the path. 140. The hearing of the summons was commenced before Mr. Francis at the South Western Police Court on the 9th February last, and extended over three days. Mr. Baines was represented by Mr. Cunningham Glen, and Mr. Horace Avory, K.C., appeared on behalf of the Council. The magistrate decided against the Council. 141. The bye-law under which the notices were served is made by the London County Council under the provisions of Section 16 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which is already in operation in some of the Metropolitan Boroughs. In view of the importance of the matter with which it deals and the present uncertainty of the law which the Council has to administer, the Council was of opinion that the decision of the Magistrate ought to be reviewed by the High Court, in order to decide whether or not the bye-law is valid. The Council is iherefore taking the necessary steps for appealing against the decision. 142. As considerable time might elapse before the decision of the High Court was obtained, the Council in the meantime reverted to the system of a weekly collection of house refuse in the areas in question. Administration of the public Health Act, 1891. 143. A Conference on the administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was held in July at the County Hall, Spring Gardens. Aldermen Anderson and Gay attended with the Town Clerk and Medical Officer of Health on behalf of the Council, and the following resolutions were passed, viz:— HOUSING. Houses let in lodgings. (6).

Any certificate given by an inspector shall be kept attached to the general register, and shall be liable at any time to be revoked by notice in writing from the inspector. (In calculating the number of conveniences required, any odd number of persons less than 15, 20, 25, 40 or 60, as the case may be, shall be reckoned as 15, 20, 25, 40 or 60). Shops. (13).

The resolutions were considered by the Council and were agreed to except the following, viz., 13, 16, 21 and 25. 145. With regard to No. 11, the Council suggested that the term "tenement house" should be defined in the resolution. 146. The Council suggested with regard to No. 22 that the resolution be amended by leaving out all the words after "1899" in the second line and inserting in lieu thereof the words "should be amended as regards milk." [47. The Council also suggested with regard to No. 27 that all the words after "contractor" in the third line be left out. Housing of the working Classes. 148. The subject of the housing of the working classes has received consideiable attention by the Council. Several schemes have been suggested, and one on which the Public Health Committee reported favourably was referred to a Special Sub-Committee of the Public Health, General Purposes, Highways, &c., and Finance Committees. The Sub-Committee after carefully considering the scheme and the report of a surveycr and valuer were of opinion that the cost of the land made the scheme prohibitive, and it was therefore not proceeded with. Further schemes were subsequently considered by the Sub-Committee, and the Public Health Committee decided to recommend the purchase of certain land not exceeding acres in area at a sum of not exceeding £4,000 per acre for a scheme to provide about 30 houses at a total 85 cost of about £12,000. The Finance and General Purposes Committees however came to the conclusion that the scheme was not feasible, and it was not adopted by the Council. 149. A motion to formally adopt Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, was moved at the meeting of the Council on the 29th March, but not carried. Municipal milk Depots. 150. The Council considered the subject of the establishment of municipal milk depdts. The reports which were prepared by the Medical Officer of Health on the subject for the consideration of the Public Health Committee, will be found in the report of the Medical Officer of Health, page 70, and the report of the Committee on the question is contained in the same report,, page 75. The suggestions of the Committee have been acted upon by the Council. 151. With regard to one of the suggestions—as to the notification of epidemic enteritis among infants during the months of July, August and September, the County Council having been communicated with, expressed the opinion that it was not advisable to make trial of it in the case of a population so large as London, and suggested that the Council should deal with the matter in its own Borough. The Council therefore applied to the Local Government Board for consent to add the disease to the list of notifiable diseases in this Borough during the three months above mentioned. The Local Government Board stated that while they were desirous of aiding the Council in their efforts to reduce the infantile mortality in the Borough, they were not at present satisfied that the compulsory notification of the disease would contribute largely to that end; that the Board were advised that action on the lines contemplated by the Council with regard to infantile diarrhoea might possibly yield valuable results not only in this Borough but also in regard to the consideration of the question as it might affect London as a whole, and that if, as the result of experience the Council gained this year, it should appear that notification would greatly strengthen the hands of the Council in their efforts to check infantile diarrhoea, the Board would be prepared next year to further consider a proposal to make such notification compulsory, and the Board asked to be furnished at the end of the year with a copy of the Medical Officer of Health's report on the measures taken. 86 152. The Council decided on the recommendation of the Public Bacteriological Health Committee to authorise the Medical Officer of examination of food unfit Health to submit samples of food which had been for human consumption. condemned as unfit for human consumption, for bacteriological examination, when in his opinion such a course is advisable. 153. Other information relating to Public Health is contained in the Medical Officer's report in the Appendix. 154. The number of persons using the baths has increased each year since the baths were opened in 1901. The number of admissions during the year ended 31st March, was 144,333, as compared with 118,030 during the previous year, made up as follows, viz:— 1903-4. 1904-5.

The sum of £25 183. 6d. wis received for the use of the first class swimming bath for entertainments and polo matches. Champinoship Trophy. 159. The competition for the trophy presented by Mr. W J. Lancaster, J.P L.C.C., and competed for annually by men residing in the Borough, was held on the 30th September, at the annual entertainment of the Wandsworth Borough Officers' Club. Eleven entries were received, and the trophy was won by Mr. C. F. Milnes. Mr. Lancaster again kindly gave a prize for the winner as a memento of the occasion, and the Club presented prizes to Mr. E. F. Ellis and Mr. W. G. Shettle, who finished second and third respectively. Women's Medal. 160. The competition for the medal for women residing in the Borough, presented by Mr. John Bell, J.P., was held on the 22nd October, at the annual entertainment of the Ladies' Section of the Wandsworth Swimming Club, and was won by Miss K. Turner. Competitions for boys and girls. 161. Competitions were again held for boys and girls residing in the Borough. Prizes to the value of £5 5s. were divided between the learners' and swimmers' races, which were conducted on behalf of the Council by the Wandsworth Schools Swimming Association. Repoening of Gym-nasium. 162. The floor over the first-class bath was relaid at the close of the swimming season, and the bath was again used as a gymnasium during the winter season. The swimming bath was closed on the 31st October, and the gymnasium was opened on the 12th November, when an entertainment was held at which the Mayor presided, and an excellent display was given by the male and female students of the Battersea Polytechnic Gymnasium and boys and girls from Brandlehow Road school. Gymnasium. 163. An instructor and instructress were again engaged for the season, and classes were held under their tuition. The gymnasium was used during the season by 4,649 persons, being an increase of nearly 1,400 011 the previous year, largely accounted for by the greater number attending the ladies' classes and of students from the Wandsworth Technical Institute. f 88 Pump. 164. The Council has decided with regard to the pump at the baths, that on account of the frequent breakdowns, . entailing costly stoppages for repairs, it shall be replaced by an air-lift plant. The tender of the British American Well Works has been accepted for supplying and fixing the new plant, and the work is being proceeded with as speedily as possible. Gallery in first-class bath. 165. A new entrance to the gallery in the first-class bath has been provided by diverting the stairs at the north end bath. of the bath into the corridor leading to the second-class bath, enabling that entrance to be used as an additional exit from the gallery of the first-class bath. Communication is still provided from the floor to the gallery at the southern end of the bath. Hot-Water storage tank. 166. A hot-water storage tank has been provided in connection with the heater condenser, supplying water to the slipper baths, at a cost of £29 6s. 6d., including the cost of covering the tank with non-conducting material. The water in the tank is kept at a temperature of 140 degrees, and this is raised to 180 degrees when the exhaust from the electric engine is also used, and supplies hot water for the baths, boiler feed and towel washing, without the aid of live steam. Diving stages Second -class bath. 167. Additional diving stages have been fixed in the second-class Swimming bath. Only two boards were before provided, two and eight feet high respectively. Bathers will now be able to practice diving from four different heights. 168. The floor of the gymnasium was marked out for tennis, the use of which was allowed during the mornings. The court was, however, not much used, perhaps owing to the only time during which it was available being inconvenient. It is hoped that it will be possible to make arrangements next winter for the court to be used on one or two evenings a week. 169. The provision of Baths in the Eastern District mentioned in ClaDham the last annual report, has continued to receive attention. Baths. -fhe conditions of competition for competing architects were settled by the Council, and issued to the selected architects on the 20th July. Nineteen designs were submitted, and the Council has adopted the design prepared by Messrs. Druery & Dolby. The Local Government Board have under consideration the application of the Council for sanction for raising the requisite loan. 89 Tooting Baths. 170. The Council has also decided to provide slipper or spraybaths on the site of the Tooting Vestry Hall, facing Th Broadway. A design is being prepared by Messrs Druery & Dolby, the architects for the Clapham Baths, and will provide for the following accommodation, viz:— 16 first class spray baths for men. 24 second class do. do. 8 do. slipper baths for women. One half of this accommodation will be provided in the first instance. 171. An office for the Rate Collector for the Tooting Ward will also be provided in the same building, with a separate entrance from Garratt Lane. Open air Swimming Bath. 172. The provision of an Open Air Swimming Bath has continued to receive consideration, and the attention of the London Couuty Council has again been called to this Council's suggestion that a bath should be provided on Tooting Common. With the view of inducing the County Council to adopt the suggestion and of finding work for the unemployed, the Council offered to contribute one-third of the nett cost incurred, such contribution not to exceed £2,000, but the County Council have replied that they regret that they do not see their way at the present time to incur the expenditure. 173.

REPORTS OF Libraries' Sub-Committees 253 Clapbam Public Library. EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT: 1st April, 1904. to 31ST March, 1905. SUB-COMMITTEE, 1905. Councillor C. COLMAN, Chairman. Alderman H. BULCRAIG. Alderman W. DUNKLEY. Alderman J. G. KIPLING. Councillor R. KENT. Councillor H. J. WELCH. Librarian: J. Reed Welch. 254 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE 0F CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, For the Year ending 31ST March, 1905. THE chief event occurring at the Clapham Library during the past year has been the extension of the Institution by the opening on the 6th February, 1905, of the large Upper Hall as a Reference Library and Magazine Room. These departments had previously been located in a portion of the Reading Room, which has now been made into one large room. The alteration has been much appreciated by the readers, affording as it does much more space for the public, and ensuring quiet for the students of reference books and the heavier magazines. An office for the assistant in charge has been placed in the Reference Library, and telephonic communication established between the various departments. The lighting and ventilation of the Library have also been entirely renewed and improved, incandescent gas having been adopted in place of the worn" out Wenham lamps. The number of books now in stock is 13,642, of which 10,808 are in the Lending Library, and 2,834 in the Reference Library. The number issued during the year was 95,883, an increase of 7,689 as compared with the previous year, and representing a daily average issue of 391 volumes. All betting news and tipsters' advertisements are now blacked out of the newspapers in the Reading Room, this having been ordered by the Council to be carried out in the Libraries throughout the Borough. A donation has been accepted with thanks from Mr. Paul R. Montford of plaster casts of his sculptured figures " Music and Poetry," and placed in the entrance lobby. An offer by Messrs. Willis & Co. to supply quarterly catalogues gratis for two years has also been accepted. 255 A representative collection of works of music has been added to the Lending Library during the year, and has been much appreciated. The Borough Council in December, 1904, appointed Aldermen Bulcraig, Dunkley and Kipling, and Councillors Colman, Kent and Welch, as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1905. At their first meeting Councillor Clement Colman was elected chairman for the year. A cordial vote of thanks was passed to the retiring members of Committee (Messrs. Hennings, Morgan and Rudolf), and especially to the Rev. C. P. Greene for his seventeen years' services as Chairman of the Clapham Library Commissioners and Committees from 1887 to 1904 inclusive. Mr. A. Nash, Senior Assistant, having been appointed by the Council to be Librarian-in-charge of the Allfarthing Lane Branch Library, Mr. W. J. A. Brooker was promoted to be Senior Assistant, and Mr. S. J. Rollins to be Second Assistant, and H. E. Ilott and S. H. Aubrey were appointed as Junior Assistants. In consequence of the extension of the Library the Caretaker, Mr. A. Wheatley, was engaged full time instead of mornings and evenings only, as previously. The Committee have again much pleasure in expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory manner in which the Librarian and his staff have discharged their duties. On behalf of the Committee, CLEMENT COLMAN, Chairman. 5 th June, 1905. 256 NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN STOCK On 31st March, 1905, and Volumes Issued from ist April, 1904, To 31ST March, 1905.

SUB-COMMITTEE REPORT For the Year ended 31ST March, 1905. BY the generosity of the Ex-Mayor, Councillor J. W. Lorden, a Branch for the Exchange of Books was opened in Windermere Terrace, next to the London and South Western Bank, Carratt Lane, Earlsfield. The Reading Room was opened without ceremony on February 13th, 1905. Councillors Craig and Harrison interested themselves in getting a stock of books for use here, and over 1,000 are on the shelves. During the next year more books will be placed there. At the time of stocktaking an important change was made at West Hill Library. The Reference Reading Room was enlarged by the removal of a bookcase across the room. The increased accommodation has been well patronised by the public. Owing to the shifting of the subsoil the porch cracked. The porch was underpinned and repaired by the Borough Surveyor, and the expense borne by the Council in accordance with the Public Libraries Act, 1901, Section 10. The contractor for keeping the land in front of the Library in order has done so very satisfactorily. It was necessary to employ a contractor as the Council could not spare any of its own gardeners to attend to the front. The inefficient lighting of Allfarthing Lane Branch Library received long and careful deliberation by the Committee, who, with the help of the Borough Surveyor, decided to overhaul and re-arrange the electric lighting. 288 The Emigrants' Information Office has sent a notice board for use in Allfarthing Lane Library. Agreeably to the orders of the Borough Council the betting news has been obliterated in the newspapers; also the date of issue is stamped in each book as issued. On Tuesday, 5th April, Mr. A. Nash commenced his duties as Librarian-in-charge at Allfarthing Branch Library, vice Mr. W. T. Bradley promoted to Putney. Mr. W. J. Clark, Junior Assistant at West Hill, took up an appointment in the Holborn Public Libraries, and was succeeded by Mr. W. H. Kirchner, in July. Messrs. Willis offered to print free of charge a Quarterly Guide. The offer was accepted, and the first number was being prepared at the end of the financial year.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1904. Population. The population of the Borough for the year, estimated according to the methods adopted by the Registrar-General was, including public institutions, 269,583, compared with 256,292 in 1903, an increase of 13,291. Table I. shows the population of each sub district, correctcd and uncorrected, as well as that for the whole Borough. TABLE /. SUB-DISTRICT. Census 1901. Population estimated to the middle of 1904. Corrected. Uncorrected. Clapham 51,361 54,729 54,455 Putney 24,139 26,861 26,787 Streatham 71,658 83,418 83,968 Tooting 16,473 26,382 28,179 Wandsworth 68,403 72,810 76,194 Whole Borough 232,034 264,200 269,583 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health, This estimated population is in all probability fairly correct, as the population if calculated from the number of inhabited houses and the number of persons per inhabited house at the Census of 1901 shows only a slight difference from this number. At the Census of 1901 the number of inhabited houses was 37,764, and in 1903, 42,531, while in 1904, 1,800 houses were brought into rating, making a total of 44,331. By multiplying this total by 6.1 (the number of persons per inhabited house in 1901) the calculated population would be 270,419, or 836 above the number estimated by the first method. The numbers in Table I. are, however, used to calculate the rates in this Report. The public institutions in the Borough are as follows:— Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putney:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham:—St. Anne’s Home. (St. Pancras parish). Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). Tooting:—Tooting Home. Fairfield House. (Chelsea parish). Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals— The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. Wandsworth:- The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Northlands Home for Inebriates. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). H.M. Prison. The total population of these institutions was about 6,300, but as a considerable number of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to the Borough, a deduction of 5,383 made from the uncorrected total will give approximately the corrected population, viz.:—264,200, compared with 251,000 in 1903, and 240,800 in 1902. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 5 Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 31st December, 1904, 6,927 births, 3,570 of males and 3,357 of females were registered, compared with 6,722 in 1903, and 6,440 in 1902. In Table II. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rates of natural increase for each parish, and for the whole Borough. TABLE II. Births. Rates. Sub-District. Males. Females. Total. Birth-Rate. Rate of natural increase. Clapham 747 737 1,484 27.11 12.84 Putney 272 289 561 20.88 8.79 Streatham 958 817 1,775 21.27 10.61 Tooting 401 371 772 29.26 16.22 Wandsworth 1,192 1,143 2,335 32.06 17.27 Whole Borough 3,570 3.357 6,927 26.21 13.28 The birth-rate in Clapham and Wandsworth is higher, and in Streatham, Tooting and Putney, lower than it was last year. The decrease in Tooting is specially noticeable, the rates being 35.81 in 1903 and 29.26 in 1904. This decrease is in my opinion more apparent than real and is due to the fact that the increase of population in Tooting during last year was probably less than it had been in previous years, and therefore the rate is calculated on too numerous a population. The lowest rate in the sub-districts occurred in Putney, and the difference between these rates in Putney and Wandsworth is very marked. The following Table shows the birth-rate in the Borough, the five sub-districts and London, for the past ten years and for the year 1904, compared with the average. These rates are calculated on the uncorrected population as given in Table II. of the Local Government Board’s Tables and therefore the figures for the years in question do not quite agree with those given in the Reports.

The birth-rate for the whole of Loudon for 1904 was 27.81, compared with 28.37 in 1903, and for England and Wales 27.9, compared with 28.36 in 1903. The rate for this Borough is lower than it has been since 1900, but is .04 above the decennial average, while the rate for the whole of London is the lowest recorded, and is 1.7 below the decennial average. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, was 13.28 per 1,000, compared with 14.54 in 1903. This rate was lowest in Putney, viz.:—879, and highest in Wandsworth, viz.:— 1727. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 7 Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending the 31st December, 1904, 3,296 deaths, 1,612 of males and 1,684 of females, were registered in the Borough, compared with 3,007 in 1903, 3,209 in 1902, and 3,009 in 1901. Although the actual number of uncorrected deaths is greater than in any previous year, yet it is 168 below the average of the ten years 1894-1903 corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate was 12-22, compared with 11.69 in 1903, 12.84 in 1902, 12.82 in 1901, and 13.36 the average for the preceding ten years. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in out-lying institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in public institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domicile was in other parts of London. The total number of deaths corrected for both external and internal institutions was 3,417, compared with 3,073 in 1903, 3,328 in 1902, 3,130 in 1901, and 3,527, the corrected deccnnial average. In 1903 the number of deaths was 433 under the corrected decennial average, while in 1904 it was only 110. The causes of this -will be dealt with later on in this Report. During the year 524 deaths occurred in public institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, and 29 in other places (as Nursing Homes, the River Thames, etc.), not public institutions making a total of 553, compared with 472 in 1903, and 487 in 1902. Table IV. shows these deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Table V. the deaths arranged according to causes of death, sex, age and institution in which the death occurred. 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The increase in the number of deaths in these institutions was due chiefly to an increase in the number in Tooting Bee Asylum and Tooting Home. In the parish of Tooting the deaths in institutions of persons not belonging to the Borough shows an increase from 217 to 299. In the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum the number cf deaths was two more, and in the Fever hospitals four less than in 1903. The number of deaths in the Royal Hospital for Incurables was six more, and in St. Anne's Home seven more than in 1903. In other places the number of deaths was the same as in 1903. As will be seen from Table IV., six of these occurred in Clapham, five in Putney, 11 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth. Table V. also shows that in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum the greater number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and other causes, which include diseases of the nervous system; in the Tooting Bee Asylum from Old Age, Bronchc-Pneumonia, Bright’s Disease and other causes; in the Hostel of God from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Old Age. In the Fever hospitals 17 deaths occurred from Scarlet Fever, 21 from Diphtheria, and 11 from Enteric Fever, while 13 occurred from nor.-notifiable diseases. Compared with 1903 the number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs shows an increase in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum and in the Tooting Home, while there was a decrease in the number of deaths from this cause in the Hostel of God and Tooting Bec Asylum. Of the 29 deaths in other places, five were from accidental and six from suicidal causes. Table VI. shows the number of deaths in public institutions in the Borough of persons bel ngiug to the Borough arranged according to cause of death, sex, age and institution in which the death occur 1 d. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of deaths was 116, 61 of males and 55 of females, compared with 130 in 1903. 44 of these occurred in the Fever hospitals, 53 in the Tooting Home, and 19 in other places. These deaths are allocated to the sub-districts to which they belong in Table VI. The number of deaths given on Table V., viz., 553, and that on Table VI., viz., 116, make up the total of 669—the total number of deaths in public institutions in the Borough as shown in the last column of Table XIII., and in column 9 of Table IX. 11 Table VI.

As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other parishes in the Borough in institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in internal institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, and the Tooting Home. '4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table VII.

In the several Metropolitan Boroughs the rates during the year were as follows, beginning with the lowest :— 1. Hampstead 10.20 2.

Finsbury 21.29 In the separate sub-districts of the Borough the death-rate^was highest in Wandsworth—1479 per 1,000, and lowest in Streatham— 10*62. In 1903 the sub-districts occupied the same positions,[but in 1904 Wandsworth was higher by *87 per 1,000, while Streathamjwas lower by *16 per 1,000, The rates in all the sub-districts but Streatham show an increase compared with 1903. The increases were as follows :—Clapham 1*50, Putney '48, Tooting i"36, and Wandsworth 87 per 1,000, while Streatham shows a decreased rate of -i6 per 1,000. The rates on this Table do not agree with the rates on Table IX., as the latter are calculated on the total population without deducting the population in institutions. The Chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 of population during each week of the year for the whole of London, and for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. Only on one occasion during the year was the rate for the Borough higher than that for all London, viz. :—for the fortnight ending the 6th February. A comparison with the Chart in the Report for 1903 shows that in that year the death-rate in this Borough was on the 6th February only slightly under that for the Metropolis. The next Chart shows the rate in the Borough compared with the rate for the year 1903, which shows that the rate was about the same in January, higher in February and March, about the same in April and May, slightly lower in June, higher in July, August and September, slightly lower in October, much lower in November, and slightly lower in December. The reason why the rates were higher in July, August and September, was owing to the increase in the number of deaths of infants from Diarrhcea and Zymotic Enteritis. The rate for the whole of London showed a similar increase in July, August and September. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the ten preceding years : the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. 18 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. TABLE XIV. Sub-Districts.

There is a wide difference between the percentages in the subdistricts ; Streatham being only 21 01 while Tooting was 38-96, under one year ; while at the other extreme of life the relations are reversed, Tooting being only 15-98 and Streatham 31-01. The reason why these rates differ so much is doubtless due to the fact that the age constitution and the social condition in the localities differ very much. Tooting containing a much larger proportion of persons under five years of age and also a greater proportion of the working class and labouring elements. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was •857, compared with 743 in 1903, and 809 in 1902. Of these 183 occurred in Clapham, 77 in Putney, 187 in Streatham, 134 in Tooting, and 276 in Wandsworth. 26 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The infantile mortality was 123 per 1,000 births, compared with no in 1903, 126 in 1902 and 133 in 1901. The following Table shows the number of deaths in each subd strict, the percentage to total deaths, and the rate per 1,000 births for the year 1904 and the three previous years, as well as the totals for the whole Borough. table xv.

The rate for the year, although higher than in 1903, is still under the decennial average for the years 1894 to 1903, which was 130 per 1,000 births. Only in the years 1894 and 1903 has this rate been lower. The next Table shows the deaths under one year arranged according to the monthly age periods. It is there seen that a very large proportion, about 28-5 per cent, of the total deaths, occurred in the first month of life, 46 per cent, in the first three months, and 70 per cent, in the first six months. table xv1.

Table XVII. shows the deaths under one year in the Borough and in the several sub-districts arranged according to ten different causes of death. Nine deaths only occurred from the notifiable infectious diseases, 42 from Measles and Whooping Cough, 31 from Tubercular diseases, 14 from Accident, 290 from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, 247 from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, 113 from diseases of the respiratory organs, and 111 from other diseases. Compared with 1903 there is a slight decrease in the number of deaths from Premature Birth and Developmental diseases, but a considerable increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis. The percentage of deaths from Premature Birth with Developmental diseases to total deaths under one year was 33'8, compared with 42'! in 1903, and 36 4 in 1902. table xv11. Sub-Districts.

Compared with 1903 there has been a decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, Measles, and Whooping Cough, and an increase from Influenza, Diarrhoea, and other zymotic diseases. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 31 Compared with the decennial average there has been a decrease in the number of deaths from Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, Whooping Cough, and Influenza, and an Increase from Erysipelas, Measles, Diairhcea, and other zymotic diseases. The increase is much greater from Diarrhoea than from any other disease in this group. The death-rate per 1,000 from all these zymotic diseases was i'93, compared with 1*72 in 1903, 2*18 in 1902, r8i in 1901, 2-12 in 1900, and 2*69 the decennial average. The death-rate from the principal zymotic diseases, viz., Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea was, i*6o per i,ooo, compared with 1*49 in 1903 and 1-68 in 1902. The rate in London for the year was 2'14, compared with 173 per 1,000 in 1903 and 2-2i in 1902. In out-lying institutions 58 deaths occurred from these diseases, (20 belonging to Clapham, four to Putney, 12 to Streatham, three to Tooting, and 19 to Wandsworth), compared with 32 in 1903, and 69 in 1902. Of these deaths 26 occurred in the Union Infirmary, 15 from Measles, three from Whooping Cough, seven from Erysipelas, and one from other septic diseases ; 22 in general and special hospitals, one from Measles, one from Iiifluenza, one from Diphtheria, one from Enteric Fever, 12 .from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis, and six from other septic diseases ; and 10 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, one from Measles, two from Scarlet Fever, and seven from Diphtheria. In internal institutions, 67 deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough occurred. Of these 52 occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, one from Measles, 17 from Scarlet Fever, 21 from Diphtheria, it from Enteric Fever, and two from other septic diseases. Six occurred in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, three from Diarrhoea, two from Erysipelas, and one from Puerperal Fever. Three from Erysipelas in Tooting Bee Asylum ; one from Enteric Fever in H.M. Prison ; one from Influenza Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and one from other septic diseases in St. Anne's Home; two from Inflnenza in Tooting Home ; and one from other septic diseases in a Nu-sing Home. In 1903 the number of these deaths was 57, in 1902 161, and in 4901 188. This large decrease is due in some measure to the greatly diminished mortality from Diphtheria, Of the total of 511 deaths, 41 occurred in the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, two from Measles, eight from Scarlet Fever, 24 from Diphtheria, six from Enteric Fever, and one from Puerperal Fever. Table XIX. shows the death-rate from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1904, as well as for the ten previous years. The rate above or below the decennial average is also shown. TABLE XIX. Sub-Districts. 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 190I 1902 '9°3 1904 1904 Rate above decennial average.

The rate in Clapham was 20 above last year, but '62 under the ■decennial average; in Putney 21 under last year, and '41 under the decennial average ; in Streatham 05 under last year, and 44 under the decennial average; in Tooting '43 above last year, but 'oi under the decennial average ; and in Wandsworth 54 above last year, but 06 under the decennial average. o-' 33 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Wandsworth, and, compared with the decennial average, Clapham shows the greatest reduction, Streatham the next, and Tooting the least. Notification of Infectious Diseases. The total number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts is shown on Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables. The number of notifications of cases received in this Borough since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is as follows :— TABLE XX. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 Small-pox 4 ... 29 1 15 1 2 1 ... 4 34 127 30 8 Scarlatina 453 887 1256 673 659 983 1014 703 894 672 684 1063 835 791 Diphtheria 164 242 398 321 266 286 569 581 615 454 466 743 533 403 Membranous Croup 8 17 33 22 21 3 7 8 6 6 3 7 6 6 Typhus Fevers. 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

Six cases of Small-pox were notified, compared with 28 in 1903, 127 in 1902, and 31 in 1901; of Scarlet Fever 774 compared with 882 and 1,063; of Diphtheria 406 compared with 532 and 750; of Enteric Fever 70 compared with 105 and 139; of Puerperal Fever 14 compared with 13 and 21; and of Erysipelas 267 compared with 232 and 235. With the exception of Erysipelas and Puerperal Fever all the above diseases show a satisfactory decrease. 35 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From March 7th to November 7th Chicken-pox was notifiable and during that period 892 cases were notified, 191 in Clapham, 21 in Putney, 200 in Streatham, 57 in Tooting, and 423 in Wandsworth. Thirty-four of these cases were of persons over 15 years of age, and in each one the diagnosis proved on further enquiry to be correct. None of the cases of this disease notified proved to be Small-pox. Excluding Chicken-pox the total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 5.8, compared with 6.7 in 1903, 9.5 in 1902, and 6.4 in 1901. The rates in the separate sub-districts were as follows:— Clapham 4.05, compared with 6.2 in 1903 and 9.5 in 1902; Putney 4.2, compared with 6.3 and 5.6; Streatham 5.4, compared with 6.3 and 7.9; Tooting 5.9, compared with 6.3 and 13.9; and Wandsworth 8.1, compared with 8.6 and 11.1. In the County of London the rate was 6.0, compared with 6 0 in 1903, 9.9 in 1902, and 8.8 in 1901. Twenty-one cases of Erysipelas and 13 of Chicken-pox were notified from the Workhouse; four cases of Erysipelas and five of Chicken-pox from the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum; one of Enteric Fever and one of Erysipelas from the Prison; 11 of Erysipelas from the Tooting Home; four of Erysipelas from the Tooting Bee Asylum ; one of Scarlet Fever from the Royal Hospital for Incurables; six of Scarlet Fever from the Fountain Fever Hospital; and seven of Scarlet Fever, 11 of Diphtheria, two of Enteric Fever, and four of Chicken-pox from the Grove Fever Hospital; a total of 69, exclusive -of Chicken-pox, compared with 70 in 1903 and 83 in 1902. Small-pox The total number of cases of Small-pox notified was only six, of which two were, on further examination, found not to be suffering from that disease. In 1903 the number of cases notified was 24. Of the four actual cases in 1904, one occurred in Clapham, one in Streatham, one in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth. The total number of cases notified in London during the year was 491, compared with 416 in 1903. 36 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The first case during the year was notified on the 1st February, followed by one case in April, one in May, one in September (not Small-pox), one in November (not Small-pox), and one in December. The following are the particulars of the six cases notified :— 1.—C. P., aged 27, of The Parade, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth. Notified on the 1st February. Patient came to this neighbourhood on the 18th January. He was lodging at the above address, his home being in Albion Street, Rotherhithe. No definite history of infection could be ascertained, but he was probably infected at Smithfield Market on the 17th or 18th January. The other occupants of the house were re-vaccinated on the 1st February. 2.—W. B. P., aged 38, of Crescent Lane, Clapham. Notified on the 2nd April. Patient was a restaurant proprietor, and had been vaccinated in infancy only. He was infected by unrecognised cases, as two of his waitresses had been suffering from what was said to be Chicken-pox, but one of the cases was definitely diagnosed as Smallpox, and subsequently removed to hospital. Particulars of the case were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health for the City. All the contacts in the house were re-vaccinated on the 2nd April. 3.—F. H., aged 32, of The Broadway, Streatham. Notified on the 26th May. Patient was removed to hospital on the same day. He was a clerk employed by the London County Council at the School Offices, Victoria Embankment. No history of infection could be ascertained. The Clerk to the London County Council was informed of the case. 4.—A. C., aged 9, of Squarry Street, Wandsworth. Notified on the 5th September. Removed to hospital the same day. Returned home on the 6th September, not suffering from Small-pox. 5.—C. T., aged 25, of Larch Road, Balham. Notified on the 3rd October. Patient was removed to hospital the same day. Returned home on the 7th October, not suffering from Small-pox. 6.—W. W., aged 47, of Mellison Road, Tooting. Notified on the 28th December. Removed to hospital same day. Patient was a clerk employed in Fetter Lane, E.C. No history of infection could be ascertained. All the contacts in the house were re-vaccinated. 37 Report of the Medical Officcr of Health. Vaccination. Table XXII. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Guardians for the year 1903. It shows the number of births, the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham. TABLE XXII. Sub-Districts. Number of Births returned from 1st January to 31st of December, 1903. Successfully Vaccinated.

The increase in the number successfully vaccinated still continues, but it has not yet reached the percentage recorded in 1894, viz., 75.8. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and for the vaccination subdistricts for the year 1903, as well as for the ten years preceding. The average for the ten years 1893-1902 is also given. In the whole Borough the increase in the percentage of successful vaccinations was 3.5 above the average for the preceding ten years. In c 38 Report of the Medic d Officer of Health. the district of Clapham the increase was 5.8, in Putney 15.1, in Streatham '4, and in Wandsworth 4.3. The increase in Clapham is most satisfactory, as in 1898 this percentage was as low as 51.1, by far the lowest in any of the vaccination districts. In Putney also there has been a very great increase, from 643 in 1898 to 86.5 in 1903. Streatham, which includes Tooting, on the other hand, compares unfavourably with other parts of the Borough, and compared with the rates for the same district in 1893, there is a decided fall in the percentage of successful vaccinations. In my report for 1903 I stated that this was due to the fact that a large proportion of the inhabitants of Tooting and part of Balham have come from East End districts. The percentage of successful vaccinations in this Borough compares very favourably with the rest of London and with the whole of England. In the last Local Government Board return this percentage for London was only 447, and for England and Wales 49'6. The number registered as having died unvaccinated was 563, or 8.3 per cent. of the whole. Of the remaining 1,207 children, 36 or .5 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination; none contracted Small-pox; 186 or 2 7 per cent. had their vaccination postponed by medical certificate; and 100 or 1.5 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objections had been received, leaving 885, or 131 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for. If the number of deaths registered before vaccination is deducted from the total number registered, it is seen that of the 6,169 surviving children, there were registered during 1903, 8o.4 per cent, as successfully vaccinated, .5 per cent. as insusceptible of vaccination, 3 per cent. under medical certificate of postponement, and 1.6 per cent. in regard to whom certificates of conscientious objections had been received, leaving 14.3 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination. 39 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Scarlet Fever. 744 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 822 in 1903, 1,063 in 1902, and 684 in 1901. 102 of these were notified from Clapham, 82 from Putney, 220 from Streatham, 84 from Tooting, and 286 from Wandsworth. The total number of deaths was 13, three in Clapham, three in Putney, three in Streatham, none in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth. 607, or 81.6 per cent, of the cases were removed to hospital, where 10 died, and 137 or 18.4 per cent. were treated at home with three deaths. 40 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of cases removed to hospital still shows a tendency to increase, as in 1903 the percentage was 78.1, in 1902 75, and in 1901 70.6. The case fatality during the year was 1.74 per cent., compared with 2.19 per cent. in 1903. The fatality among cases treated at home was 2.18 per cent, and among those treated in the Fever Hospitals 164 per cent. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 2.80, compared with 3.2 in 1903 and 4.4 in 1902, and in the County of London 2.89, compared with 2.7 and 3.8. The number of cases per 1,000 of population notified in this Borough was slightly under that for the whole of London. In the separate sub-districts the annual rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living was as follows for the year and for the three previous years :— TABLE XXIV. Sub-Districts. 1901 1902 1903 1904 Clapham 3.6 4.5 2.4 1.8 Putney 1.6 2.6 3.8 3.0 Streatham 2.5 3.7 2.3 2.6 Tooting 3.7 6.6 3.0 3.1 Wandsworth 3.07 5.1 4.1 3.2 Whole Borough 2.91 4.4 3.2 2.80 The rate in the Clapham sub-district is exceptionally low, and indicates the freedom of that part of the Borough from this disease during the year. Putney, although lower than last year is still above the average for the whole Borough. With the exception of a slight outbreak in Roehampton in the month of November there was nothing special in the incidence of this disease in Putney. In that month 17 cases were 41 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. notified, 12 of which occurred in Roehampton, and these were due to one or two unrecognised cases infecting others, either at school or while playing in the street after school hours. As soon as the unrecognised cases were isolated the outbreak ceased. In Streatham the number of cases notified was slightly above the average. This increase was due chiefly to the number of cases notified in the months of October, November and December, when 101 cases out of the total of 220 during the year were notified. Of these 101 cases, 69 occurred in the Streatham Ward and 32 in the Balham Ward. The majority of cases in the Streatham Ward occurred in South Streatham. The streets chiefly affected were Leverson Street (nine cases), Eardley Road (five cases), Blegboro' Road (four cases), Ellora Road (four cases), Fallsbrook Road (three cases), Besley Street (three cases), Eastwood Street (three cases), and Kettering Street (two cases). Here also the cases were chiefly due to unrecognised cases infecting others at school, although the influence of school attendance was not nearly so marked as in the cases at Roehampton. Out of the total of 69 cases 27 were in attendance at Eardley Road School, and four at Mitcham Lane, the other cases being in attendance at a number of different schools in the locality or were under school age. In the sub-district of Tooting, the greatest number of cases occurred in the months of October, November and December, when 40 cases out of a total of 84 were notified. The number notified per 1,000 persons living is only slightly above that for 1903, and is also above the average tor the whole Borough. In the sub-district of Wandsworth, Scarlet Fever was more prevalent than in any of the other sub-districts, and this prevalence continued all through the year. The minimum number of notifications was received in July and the maximum in December. In this subdistrict also a large proportion of the notifications, 108 out of 286, were received in the months of October, November and December while there was also a large proportion received in March, April, May and June. In these four months there was 110 special outbreak, as the cases were scattered over the sub-district and were not confined to particular areas. 42 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In October, however, there was a slight outbreak at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and the following report with reference to it was presented to the Public Health Committee on the 20th October. OUTBREAK OF SCARLET FEVER AT THE CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART, WEST HILL, WANDSWORTH. I have to report on the occurence of an outbreak of Scarlet Fever at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, West Hill, Wandsworth. Six notifications were received on the 3rd October, and the same evening all were removed to hospital. On calling at the Convent, I was informed by the Mother Superior that she had no doubt that the source of infection of five of the cases was M. C., aged 15, who came from Bognor on the 5th September, sickened with sore throat on the 11th, but was not seen by their Medical Attendant till the 18th. On that date, as she seemed quite well, she was allowed to come back to her dormitory and mix with the other girls. On the 30th five of the girls sickened and were seen by the Medical Attendant on the 2nd October, who notified the cases at once. He examined M. C. at the same time, and found she was peeling on feet and hands. On the 4th, one case; on the 5th, two cases; on the 10th, one case; on the 12th, two cases; on the 13th, one case; and on the 17th, four cases were notified: a total of 17 cases. 41 of the pupils and students returned to their homes on the 7th October, but owing to the occurence of four cases on the 17th, the managers of the school decided to close the Centre altogether, and the rest of the students and pupils have also returned home. The names and addresses of these have been forwarded to me, and I have communicated with the Medical Officers of Health of the districts where they reside. The patients affected did not at any time come into contact with the scholars in the day school, and no cases have occurred among the day scholars. The sanitary arrangements of the premises are very satisfactory, as the whole system was overhauled quite recently. There is no doubt that the cause of the whole outbreak was the presence in the school of an unrecognised case. Chart showing the number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during each week of the year 1904. 43 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. I also communicated with the Medical Officer of Health for Bognor, who informed me that no cases of Scarlet Fever had been notified to him for some considerable time in that place. It is to be presumed then that M. C. (the first case) was infected in the railway train while travelling from Bognor to London. In all, 18 cases were notified, and of these, four were found, on examination at the hospital, not to be suffering from the disease, making a total of 14 actual cases. There is no doubt that all the secondary cases (14 in number) were due to infection by the unrecognised case notified on the 2nd October. The death-rate per 1,000 living was .05, compared with .07 in 1903, and .09 in 1902, while the rate for the whole of London was .08, compared with .07 in 1903, and .12 in 1902. The chart shows that during the first eight months of the year there was not much prevalence of the disease, but there was a considerable increase in the months of April, October, November and December. Of the total number of cases notified, viz., 774, 311 were notified during these months, and this increase was specially noticeable in the sub-districts of Wandsworth, Streatham, and Tooting. Only on one occasion, viz., the week ending the 17th December, did the weekly number of notifications exceed 30, while on 17 occasions they were 10 or under. In the second week of August the number of notifications received was five, and in the last week of January only four. The average number of notifications received each week was about 15, compared with 16 in 1903, and 20 in 1902. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. It is satisfactory to be able to report that in 1904 there has been again, as in 1903, a diminution in the number of cases of Diphtheria notified.

The number of cases notified during 1904 shows a marked decrease compared with the average for the 10 years in Clapham and Putney, a slight decrease in Wandsworth, and a slight increase in Tooting and Streatham. Compared with the previous year there is a decided decrease in Clapham, Putney and Streatham, an increase of one only in Wandsworth, and of 10 in Tooting. The largest number of cases occurred in Streatham, and the smallest in Putney, 297 or 73 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital, where 32 died, and 109 cases were treated at home with 9 deaths. The case mortality was 10.8 per cent., compared with 8.4 per cent. in 1903, and 9.3 per cent. in 1902. The case mortality for the whole of London was 10 per cent., compared with 9.7 in 1903, and 10.7 per cent. in 1902. The case mortality among the cases treated in hospital was 10.4 and among those treated at home 8.2 per cent. In 1902 and 1903 the case mortality of the cases treated at home was higher than in the cases treated at hospital, whereas in 1904 this rate was 2.2 per cent. lower. The following Table shows the number of cases, the case rate per 1,000 living for the year and for the previous 10 years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the Borough, as well as for each subdistrict :— 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

It is also .83 under the average for the 10 years 1894 to 1903. The highest case-rate was in the sub-district of Wandsworth, and lowest in Putney. The greatest difference between the rate for 1904 and the previous 10 years was in Clapham where the rate was no less than 1.68 under the decennial average. Compared with the whole of London the case-rate is .06 lower, while in 1903 it was .44 higher. The death-rate for the Borough from this disease is low, only .16 per 1,000, compared with .18 in 1903 and .28 in the previous decennium. The rate was lowest in Putney, being only .07, and highest in Tooting, .26. The death-rate is, however, higher in Clapham, Tooting and Wandsworth than in 1903, but lower in Putney and Streatham. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases was notified in the second week of May, when 16 cases were notified, and the minimum in the first week of April when only one case was notified. Chart showing the number of cases of Diphtheria notified during each week of the year 1904 47 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The increase in May was due to the number of cases occurring in South Streatham, chiefly from Eardley Road School. There was also a maximum in October and this was also due to the number of cases in South Streatham, but chiefly affecting Immauuel School. With the exception of these two outbreaks there was nothing calling for special notice in any other part of the Borough. The Hyde Farm Estate was this year very free from Diphtheria, only two cases having been reported as attending Cavendish Road School, compared with 35 in 1903, while only eight cases were notified from the whole of that neighbourhood. Three of these were afterwards reported to me as not suffering from Diphtheria. In only 29 of the 347 actual cases notified were serious sanitary defects found at the patients' home. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the schools in the Borough :— 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXVII. SCHOOLS. January.

The total number of cases in this Table does not coincide with the total number in the Local Government Board's Table, as correction has been made for errors in diagnosis. Of the total number of cases, viz.:—347, 149, or 43 per cent., did not attend school, while 198, or 53 per cent., were at school, compared with 44.8 and 55.2 per cent. in 1903. Only 17 cases attended private schools, compared with 36 in 1903, while 181 occurred in other schools. Only two cases attended elementary schools outside the Borough compared with six in 1903. The only two schools which were specially affected were Eardley Road and Immanuel Schools, Streatham. Twenty-six cases occurred among children attending Eardley Road School in 1904 and 54 in 1903. The infection of this school continued from last year until May of this year, when owing to the number of cases occurring a special report was made to the Council. This report was as follows:— 19th May, 1904. Gentlemen, On account of the prevalence of Diphtheria among children attending Eardley Road Board School, South Streatham, I communicated with the Medical Officer to the School Board and advised the closing of the Infants' Department of such school for a period of three weeks. I have always been unwilling to close any schools for this disease until every other means have been tried to stop the outbreak, and in this case it was not until it was seen that nothing short of closure would be efficacious that I advised the Medical Officer to the School Board accordingly. I have been informed by the Medical Superintendent to the hospital to which the cases have been removed that the disease is of a markedly malignant type. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the past two years, Diphtheria has been endemic in this locality. In 1903, 54 cases occurred among children attending this school; five in January, five in February, one in March, none in April, two in May, five in June, eight in July, one in August, six in September, seven in October, 11 in November, and three in December. During the present year, two cases occured in January, four in February, three in March, five in April, and ten in May up to the present date. The Medical Officer to the School Board was fully aware of the seriousness of the outbreak, and was kept informed by the teachers of the cases occurring. In November, 1903, he made a careful inspection of the school, and the throats of a large number of children in the Infants' Department were examined, with the result that several children were excluded from attendance as they were suffering from sore throat. During the present year he made an examination on the 2nd May, and swabbed the throats of 40 children in the Infants' Department with the result that in two a positive result was obtained. These 40 children were in three classes in which there had been children in attendance suffering from Diphtheria. On the nth May, the throats of the whole of the children in Class B (53 in number) were swabbed, with the result that positive results were obtained in two cases. I am of opinion that in this outbreak, as in several others which have occurred in this district, unrecognised cases have been the main source of infection, owing to the fact that even after a careful inspection and isolation of suspected children notifications continued to be received, and the closing of the whole of the Departments in the Infants' School was advised. The whole of the rooms of this Department have been disinfected by the sanitary staff, and I trust that the means which have been taken will have the desired effect of stopping the outbreak. There is, however, one feature of some importance in regard to the infection of children in this school, viz., the attendance of children from outside the Borough. I have been informed that several children from Lonesome are in attendance at this school, and also that cases of Diphtheria have occurred among children residing in Lonesome The Medical Officer of Health for the Croydon Rural District, of which Lonesome forms a part, informs me that sore throats are endemic in 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. this locality, and cases of Diphtheria are constantly occurring. This he attributes to the condition of the soil, and also to the class of people who occupy the houses in the locality. It has not hitherto been the practice of the Croydon Rural Authorities to notify to the teachers of the schools where infected children attend of the existence of any infectious disease, although the parents were always instructed not to send the children to school. I have had a consultation with the Medical Officer of Health for the Croydon Rural District on the matter, and he has arranged that prompt information will in future be sent to the school, and also to myself of the occurence of any case of infectious disease in that locality among children attending schools in this Borough. I am, Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. The result of the school closure was that the disease was immediately checked, no cases having been notified in June or July, and only one each in August and October. The class-rooms were thoroughly disinfected in May by the sanitary staff. The other school with reference to which special inquiries were made was Immanuel School. Here the number of cases were not so numerous, and in the earlier part of the year, up to the holidays, only three cases occurred among the pupils. In October, however, ten cases occured, and the following report was made on the matter on the 20th of that month:— Gentlemen, At the meeting of the Public Health Committee, held on the 6th October, I repoited verbally on a fatal case of Diphtheria which attended Immanuel School, Streatham Common, and that this case was, in all probability, infected by umecognised cases from Lonesome attending this school. On the 6th October, information was received by me of a fatal case of Diphtheria in the person of L. B. This child attended Immanuel 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. School. I was informed that a fatal case had occurred in Lonesome, and, bearing in mind the outbreak which had occurred South Streatham in the earlier part of the year, I decided at once to communicate with the London County Council Education Department, so that the children at Immanuel School could be examined, and any unrecognised case immediately excluded from attendance. On Friday, the 7th inst., I inspected the school, and n-et the Assistant Medical Officer to the London County Council Education Department there, who informed me that he had taken 40 swabs from the throats of children in Standard II. In eight of these cases the Diphtheria bacillus was isolated, six being children residing in this Borough and two in Lonesome. On the 10th October the Medical Officer to the London County Council Education Department informed me that he had given instructions for the closing of the Infants' and Girls' Departments of the school for a period of three weeks, and on the same day the Assistant Medical Officer swabbed a large number of children in another classroom previous to the closing of the school. In two of these the result was positive. With regard to cases occurring in Lonesome, I had previously arranged with the Medical Officer of Health for the Croydon Rural District that immediate information should be given to me of any case occurring in that neighbourhood. From the 10th inst. to the 17th inst., six cases have been so notified. I personally visited the homes of several of the children who were reported to me as being ill with sore throats, and in two cases swabs were taken, but the result in both was negative. The class-rooms were disinfected and cleansed by the sanitary staff. The sanitary arrangements of the school were inspected and the drains tested. The result of the test was that grave defects were discovered, aud in opening the ground in seven places, the drains were found to be very foul and very defective. Notice was served on the trustees of the school who have given instruction for the reconstruction of the drains and the whole of the sanitary arrangements. In consequence of this I considered that it would be detrimental to the 53 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. health of the children to remain at school, and I therefore advised two members of the Committee who have power to act, to close the whole school for one month so that the necessary sanitary work could be carried out. I am, Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. The cases in Merton Road School were of a mild type, and there was no reason to believe that there were any "carrier" cases in this School, although careful inquiry was made. In Swaffield Road School although 17 cases occurred among pupils during the year, these were scattered over the whole year. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria 127 or 36 per cent, occurred among children under 5 years of age, 205 or 50 per cent. at ages 5 to 15, and 69 or 14 per cent. above 15 years of age. Of the 401 cases notified, in 54 information was received from the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board that the diagnosis was incorrect, and only 347 are shown on the table. Return cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 17 cases of Scarlct Fever occurred after the return of cases from Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board compared with 50 in 1903 and 48 in 1902. There were no return cases of Diphtheria, while in 1903 there were 11, and 111 1902 eight. Five of the cases were from Clapham, one from Putney, five from Streatham, none from Tooting, and six from Wandsworth. Two of the cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in one house in Clapham. The following table shows the date of removal to Hospital of the first case, the date of return from Hospital, the number of days the first case was in Hospital, and the date of the first symptons in the subsequent cases. D 54 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There has been a very large decrease in the number of return cases in 1904, the percentage to total cases this year being only 1.4, compared with 4.5 in 1903 The average duration in Hospital in these 17 cases was 56 days, compared with 54 in 1903, varying from 29 days to a maximum of 113. In five of the cases it was noted by the parents that the child when it returned had a discharge from the nose, in two that there was slight desquamation, and in one case that the child had a sore ear. In the others the children seemed on return to be in good health. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 55 Return Cases of Scarlet Fever. TABLE XXVIII. Sub-District. Removed to Hospital.

ENTERIC FEVER. 70 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, 16 from Clapham, four from Putney, 19 from Streatham, two from Tooting, and 29 from Wandsworth. 32 of the cases were removed to Hospital, where seven died, and 38 were treated at home, with four deaths. The total number of deaths was 11, compared with 19 in 1903, and 30 in 1902. It is also 13.7 under the corrected decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 27 per 1,000, compared with .41 in 1903 and with .41 for the whole of London. The case mortality was 157 per cent. for this Borough and 15.1 per cent. for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from fever was .04 per 1,000, compared with .07 in 1903 and .I2 in 1902. The death-rate from fever for all London was 06 per 1,000, compared with .08 in 1903. The death-rate from this disease in the separate sub-districts was as follows:— Clapham 05, Putney .11, Streatham .01, Tooting no deaths, and Wandsworth .05 per 1,000. Of the 32 cases removed to hospital eight were found not to be suffering from the disease. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during each week, the maximum number being notified during the second week of September. Special inquiry was made this year also into the causation of the disease, but it was most difficult in the majority of the cases to get exact information as to the habits of the patients. So long a period elapses between the time when the infection is contracted and the time when inquiries are made that unless something special Chart showing the number of cases of Enteric Fever notified during each week of the year 1904 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 57 happened neither the patients or their friends could give much reliable information. In 26 of the 62 actual cases some history of probable infection was obtained. In 11 the infection was probably due to shellfish, in five to water cress, in two to ice cream, and in eight cases the patients had been infected by previous cases. One case was infected at Oporto and fell ill at that place. With reference to the cases probably due to shellfish, three were from eating oysters, three from cockles, two from shrimps, one from mussels, one from winkles, and one from whelks. One of the cases from eating oysters and one from eating cockles were fatal. The following are the particulars of these 11 cases:— (1). G.T., notified on the 7th September. This patient had been on a holiday to Yarmouth and had oysters there. He went to Yarmouth on the 1st August, returned on the 15th, and the first symptoms occurred about the 18th August. This case proved fatal. (2). D.B., notified on the 27th September, first symptoms appeared about the 14th September. He had some oysters at Margate on the 1st September which were purchased from a small vendor of shellfish on the Front. (3). T.S., notified on the 5th December, first symptoms on the 23rd November. Had oysters about three weeks before onset of first symptoms, but no information could be obtained as to where they had been purchased. (4). C.R., notified on the 4th July, first symptoms occurred about three weeks previously. This patient was a vendor of cockles on Clapham Common. (5). F.D., notified on the 5th September, first symptoms on the 22nd August. This patient had cockles at a village near Teignmouth about a fortnight before the first symptoms occurred. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (6). H.B., notified on the 19th September, first symptoms on the 13th. This patient was at Yarmouth from the 2nd to the 9th September and had cockles there about the 3rd which were purchased from a shop, but the name of the owner of the shop was not known. He also had ice cream every day at Yarmouth from a stall on the sands. (7 & 8). B.W., and B.W., brother and sister. These cases contracted the disease in Brittany. The notification was received on the 18th August, the first symptoms appearing about the 6th. They were on holiday at a watering-place in Brittany the whole of July and were in the habit of eating shrimps caught on the sands. The parents stated that the water they had on the first week of their visit was not satisfactory. (9). J.M., notified on the 5th December, first symptoms on the 19th November. Patient had mussels on several occasions up to the 12th November. These were purchased from an itinerant vendor. This case proved fatal. (10). V.B., notified on the 21st January, first symptoms on the 10th. This patient had winkles on the 2nd January, purchased at a shop in Battersea. (11). P.S., notified on the 4th October, first symptoms on the 29th September. This patient had a quantity of whelks from an itinerant vendor on the promenade at Margate about a fortnight before the first symptoms appeared. Of the five cases where water cress had been taken shortly before the onset of the disease, none were fatal. Four of the cases were in children and only one in an adult. In only one of the cases was it discovered where the water cress had been grown, and in that case inquiries were made as to the pollution of the water, but no definite history of pollution could be ascertained. Of the two cases where ice cream had been eaten, the ice cream had been purchased in this Bore ugh in one case and at Hastings in the other. Of the eight cases which had been infected by previous cases, four occurred in one house, and three in an institution. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 59 The four occurred in a house in Atheldene Road, Wandsworth, and were notified on the 28th December. On inquiry it was found that one of the cases had been ill since the third week in November, and that he had cone from a house in Essex Road, Islington, a week before falling ill. This case might have been infected by his father, who was removed to St. Bartholomew's Hospital from Essex Road and died there about the end of October. The cause of death in the father's case was stated to have been Peritonitis. The other three cases fell ill on the 14th, 15th and 21st December, and one of these, a male aged 18, died on the 31st December. Three cases in the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Wandsworth, were infected by another case which occurred there on the 15th January, but in this primary case no history of infection could be ascertained. The patient came from Brockley to the Convent on the 10th and was not feeling well on her arrival. The second case was notified on the 10th February, but had been ill since the 16th January. She nursed the first case previous to her removal to hospital. The third case was notified on the 28th March. She fell ill about the 24th and had been in the habit of washing the clothes of the last patient, who was not removed to hospital, but treated in the isolation ward of the Convent. The fourth case fell ill about the 12th April, and was nurse to the second case. A case, also infected by a previous case, was notified on the 28th March. This patient nursed a sister at Birmingham who was suffering from Enteric Fever. In every case the drains of the house were tested, and in seven a result was obtained. In two of these the defects were of a serious nature and necessitated the reconstruction of the drains. In two cases the cistern for drinking water was found to be in a foul condition. 60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. During the year information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals that the patients removed to hospital were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease in 94 cases, compared with 106 in 1903, and 41 in 1902. Of the 936 cases of Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever and Enteric Fever removed to hospital the diagnosis in 94, or 10 per cent, was incorrect. In 1903 this percentage was 9-5, and in 1902 only 2 8. Enteric Fever still shows a higher percentage of error in diagnosis than the other two diseases, but this year Diphtheria shows a decided increase compared with previous years and it is to the increase in this disease that the total increase is due, as in the other two there is a decided decrease.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 61 Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 121 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 125 in 1903, 78 in 1902, and 66 in 1901. The following Table shows the number in the separate subdistricts and for the whole Borough, also the disease for which examination was made and the result of such examination : — TABLE XXX.

In 23 out of 112 examinations for the Diphtheria bacillus the result was positive, while in only one out of nine examinations of blood in suspected cases of Enteric fever was the Widal re-action obtained. Puerperal Fever. 14 cases of Puerperal fever were notified, compared with 13 in 1903, and 21 in 1902. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Four of the cases occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, three in Streatham, one in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth. Five of the cases, or 35.7 per cent. were fatal, two in Clapham and three in Streatham. One of the cases was removed to the Union Infirmary where death occurred. The death-rate was .018 per 1,000, compared with .024 in 1903. Erysipelas. 267 cases of this disease were notified and 13 deaths occurred. 200 of the cases and 12 of the deaths were in adults over 25 years of age. The number of notifications in 1903 was 232, and of deaths five. Measles. The total number of deaths registered as due to Measles was 104, 51 of males and 53 of females. 23 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, none in Putney, 23 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 49 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is five less than last year, but 5.1 above the decennial average. 21 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 75 of children from one to five years, seven from five to 15 years, and one over 15 years. The death-rate for the year was .39 per 1,000, compared with .43 in 1903 and .39 in 1902. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was .49, as compared with .44 in 1903. During the year 1,534 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Measles, 299 in Clapham, 46 in Putney, 402 in Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 63 Streatham, 83 in Tooting, and 704 in Wandsworth. Cards were left at each house so that the Sanitary Authority might be informed when the case had recovered and that disinfection could be carried out. During the year 1,115 premises were disinfected by the sanitary staff after cases of Measles, 147 in January, 30 in February, 64 in March, 105 in April, 110 in May, 149 in June, 113 in July, 17 in August, 33 in September, 103 in October, 133 in November, and 111 in December. Information respecting cases of Measles is in most cases received from the teachers of elementary schools, and only in very few cases was notification received from the parent This explains the large diminution of disinfection in the month of July, when the schools were closed. The following Table shows the number of cases of Measles and other non-notifiable diseases notified by the teachers in the elementary schools in the Borough. In all 2,291 cases were notified, compared with 3,083 in 1903. 1,543 of these were cases of Measles, 331 of Chicken-pox, 163 of Whooping Cough, 96 of Mumps, and 158 of Ringworm. With regard to the cases of Measles, 244 were notified from schools in Clapham, 36 in Putney, 295 in Streatham, 60 in Tooting, and 908 in Wandsworth. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Whooping Cough 48 deaths occurred from this disease during the year, 23 of males and 25 of females, a decrease of 39 compared with 1903 and of 34.4 compared with the corrected decennial average. Nine of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, 13 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 16 in Wandsworth. There was a decided decrease in all the sub-districts compared with the year 1903. 21 of the deaths were of infants under one year of age, and 27 of children from one to five years. The death-rate was .18 per 1,000, compared with .34 in 1903, and with .32 for the whole of London. There was a very large decrease in the number of cases notified from the elementary schools, only 163 having been notified, compared with 428 in 1903. Epidemic Influenza. There was a slight increase in the number of deaths from this cause, 57 having been registered, compared with 39 in 1903. The number is, however, 30.7 under the corrected decennial average. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 67 12 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, 16 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 20 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .22 per 1,000, compared with .15 in 1903, and .38 in 1902. Diarrhœa. The total number of deaths from Diarrhœa and Epidemic Enteritis was 208, a considerable increase over the previous year, when it was only 96. It is also 43.5 above the corrected decennial average. 33 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 24 in Putney, 35 in Streatham, 39 in Tooting, and 77 in Wandsworth. The increase was general and not confined to one particular sub-district. The death-rate was .79 per 1,000, or more than double the rate in 1903. The death-rate for the whole of London was 1.03, compared with .64 in 1903. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:—Clapham .60, Putney .93, Streatham .41, Tooting 1.47, and Wandsworth 1.07. Of the total number of deaths registered 180, or 86.5 per cent. were of infants under one year. Including Enteritis the total number of deaths was 301, compared with 162 in 1903 and 155 in 1902. The total Diarrrhœa mortality per 1,000 births was 30, compared with 36.70 for the whole of London. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhœa and Enteritis under one year of age for the four quarters, both for 1904 and three years previous. It is worthy of note that the third quarter is the most fatal quarter for both diseases, but the number of deaths from Diarrhœa is much greater than from Enteritis. In 1902 and 1903 the number of deaths was small, this being due, as mentioned in my reports for these years, to the fact that the excessive rainfall in these years was most beneficial, and this, with the low average temperature, caused a low death-rate from all diseases of the organs of digestion. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In other words, a child wholly nursed by the mother has 16 times as great a chance of living as one fed in any other way. In 79, or 60 per cent. of the deaths, cows' milk, either alone or used with some other food, was used, while in 22 cases, or 16.8 per cent., condensed milk alone was the food used. In consequence of the increase in the mortality of children from Diarrhœa and diseases of the digestive organs, the Council requested me to report on the means that might be adopted to lessen this mortality, and also to report on the provision of a Municipal Milk Depot. The followirg report was laid before the Committee:— E 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH ON DIARRHŒA, AND THE PROVISION OF A MUNICIPAL MILK DEPOT. Before considering the advisability or not of establishing a municipal milk depot in this Borough, it may be stated that it is extremely improbable that the Local Government Board would sanction any expenditure for that purpose. In the only Metropolitan Borough where such a depot is in existence, the Local Government Board auditor has, on two separate occasions, surcharged the amount expended. Municipal milk depots have been established for the purpose of trying to reduce the infantile mortality, and especially that due to Diarrhœa. In my Annual Reports, I have, for some years, called attention to the loss of life from this cause, and have stated that the causes of the mortality are exceedingly complex. It is true that it is largely due to improper food, and chiefly to milk pollution with certain bacteria, but many other questions have to be considered before coming to any definite conclusion as to the preventive means to be adopted. Owing to climatic conditions, the mortality in the years 1902 and 1903 was much under the average, in this Borough the total infantile mortality being only 110, compared with 126 in 1902, 133 in 1901, and 143 in 1900. The death-rate from Diarrhœa was only .38 per 1000, both in 1902 and 1903, while in 1901 this rate was .69. The following Table shows the rate in each quarter for the years 1901, 1902 and 1903, and for the first two quarters, and part of the third quarter in 1904 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 71 Quarter. 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904.

Carelessness, ignorance, and drunkenness of parents are not confined to the third quarter of the year, but these, combined with the presence of house flies and increase in temperature in the third quarter, may, generally speaking, be said to be causes of this increased mortality. The provision of a municipal milk depot will have no effect on any of these causes, and however much, theoretically, it may seem desirable to put into the hands of parents milk which is sterile, yet unless the other causes are dealt with, little or no improvement can possibly result. The most obvious solution of the whole problem is that mothers should nurse their children wholly for the first nine months. Mothers milk is sterile, and passes from mother to child without exposure to external sources of pollution. Owing to various causes, this is, in some cases, impossible. The best substitute is cows' milk, diluted to suit the age of the child. It is well known that cows' milk, as sold in the Metropolis, is liable to pollution in many ways, chiefly in the houses of the consumer, and specially if the consumer belongs to the poorer classes. 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. To avoid such home pollution, and to supply a milk suitable for immediate consumption by infants, is the aim of these municipal milk depots. The following statistics, however, show that so far there has been little or no beneficial result from the possession of such depots. Taking the Diarrhœa deaths in two localities where no depot exists, and in two where such depots have existed for two years, the following are the death-rates per 1,000 from Diarrhœa for the nine weeks from the 16th July to the l0th September, 1904:— Towns in which there are depots— Liverpool death-rate 11.2. Battersea „ 4.2. Compared with towns in which there are no depots— Manchester death-rate 5.4. Wandsworth „ 3.8. The infantile mortality for the same towns for the same period was as follows:— Liverpool 376 Battersea 239 Manchester 273 Wandsworth 223 In the whole of London for the same nine weeks, the infantile mortality was 246, and the death-rate from Diarrhœa 4.4. The rate for Manchester compared with Liverpool is much lower, and cannot be due either to the difference in the age, constitution of the population, or in their social status, the suburbs of both containing a very large proportion of the working classes. It may, however, be urged that the above statistics, especially the infantile mortality rate, do not give a true idea of the Diarrhœa death-rate. It is, however, the only method available, and if the lowering of the death-rate from Diarrhœa is not the sole object to be gained then there is no necessity for establishing milk depots. It is for that purpose and that alone that they have been established. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 73 On the other hand statistics have been prepared to show that the death-rate among infants fed with milk from these depots is much lower than that among infants not so fed. Dr. Hope, of Liverpool, kept close observation on 4,453 children fed at the Liverpool depots and showed that among these the infantile mortality was 78 per 1,000, compared with an average of 167.3 for the whole city for the three years 1901-1903. This method is, however, most fallacious, as to properly compare these rates they should be calculated for each month of the first year of life and not for the whole year. The mortality is much higher in the first week of life, and in the second month the mortality is much less than in the first month, falling gradually to the seventh or eighth month of life. On a very small scale the results in the creches in this Borough show that children of the poorest class, if well cared for and carefully fed, do escape Diarrhœa, as not one death occurred among the children attending these. The means which should be adopted to prevent this disease other than establishing a milk depot are as follows:— (1). The education of mothers with infants as to the proper methods of feeding such infants, especially in the hot season. (2). The education of girls in the 6th standard in domestic hygiene and the provision of continuation classes in domestic hygiene at the public day schools. (3). Frequent house-to-house inspection and the insisting on a higher standard of domestic and personal cleanliness. (4). Backyard sanitation to be more strictly attended to, and with this must be included the daily removal of house refuse. (5). The compulsory provision in all houses of proper storing places for food. In the great majority of houses provided for the working classes no provision is ever made for this. (6). All premises where milk is sold should be licensed annually by the Sanitary Authority. 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Recently a new departure has been made in the preparation of milk. It is now dried between steam rollers and sold as a powder from which nothing but water has been abstracted, and to which nothing but water requires to be added to make wholesome, clean, and sterile milk. It seems to me that this solves the whole problem of unclean milk and does away with any necessity for sterilizing it. It is in my opinion inadvisable for a Sanitary Authority to do for people what they can and ought to do for themselves. This dried milk can be easily obtained and prepared and, judging from the results already obtained, its use would largely do away with deaths of infants from Epidemic Diarrhœa. It would be advisable before next summer for this Authority to print a short circular calling attention to the high mortality from this disease and giving short and concise instructions as to how it may be prevented. These circulars could be left at every house in the poorer localities, and I am of opinion that this, combined with the education of girls at continuation classes, would have beneficial results. With regard to the cost of providing a milk depot, the first cost would not be less than £1,000, and it would in all probability cost that sum each year to keep it working properly. In Liverpool the annual cost is over £4,000 and the cost to the rates over £2,000 per annum.

CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. The Committee carefully considered the question submitted to it as to the advisability of establishing depots in this Bciough for the supply of sterilized milk, and reported to the Council as follows:— It is admitted that there is annually a considerable death-rate from Infantile or Epidemic Diarrhoea in the summer months, hence the natural suggestion that the use of sterilized milk would prevent or lessen this mortality. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. A depot was started in St. Helen's in 1901, and since Liverpool and Battersea have established similar depots. The infantile death-rate in this Borough and in other towns is shewn in the following Table prepared by the Medical Officer of Health— 1901. 1902. 1903. 3rd Quarter, 1904. — Deaths under 1 Year to 1,000 Births.

It appears that about 400 applicants are supplied daily therefrom, but that most are not of the poorest class, except those children in homes under the Infantile Life Protection Act, and in Infirmaries where they are under some supervision. During the hottest weather, when the ministrations of the depots would be most valuable, the number of persons supplied amounts only to about 200. Further, there is an annual loss of over £200. This Committee is satisfied that an endeavour is being made to, in some way, benefit the children who may be expected to be wanting such help, but the question that arises is whether this method is the best or most practical; whether it is the cause of any lessened mortality; or, indeed, whether it is anything but a supply of guaranteed milk sold at the average cost to consumers, and at a loss to the ratepayers. There can be no doubt that any scheme for guaranteeing the quality of milk generally would be advantageous, but, short of keeping herds of cows, the usual method of careful and frequent analysis of milk and prosecution of defaulters seems all that can be done. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 77 In the opinion of the Committee the causes of the infantile deathrate are farther to seek, and from evidence submitted, it is clearly due to many causes, of which the milk question is but one. The remedy must clearly be sought for in the better education of parents, better surroundings, and other matters that go to make healthier and stronger children. A loss of only ₤250 per annum would cover the cost of a Notification of Epidemic Diarrhoea, and this would probably lead to more good in giving opportunities of visiting the homes and instructing the mothers. This cost would be a Metropolitan and not a Borough charge. Further, if properly equipped depots were established over the Borough, the loss is estimated at not less than ₤1,000. The Committee is of opinion that such a sum would be more profitably spent on the salaries of several lady sanitary inspectors or health visitors. Such a sum would include about seven salaries. The Committee suggests, therefore, that the London County Council be asked to include Zymotic or Epidemic Enteritis among infants in the list of notifiable diseases during the months of July, August, and September; that in the housewifery classes in elementary schools the proper tending and feeding of infants should be systematically taught; and that any further steps, if considered advisable, should be in the direction of circularising the public as to the advantages of keeping milk covered from contamination of flies, the boiling of milk, &c.; and the engagement of extra lady sanitary inspectors to act as health visitors. This report was submitted to, and adopted by, the Council on the 26th October. It was decided to issue a circular which might be widely distributed in the Borough, giving instructions as to the proper method of feeding infants. The following circular was then drawn up and laid before the Committee, who approved of it:— Infants should be fed at the breast for at least nine months from birth. 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Mother's Milk is by far the Best Food for Infants. Regularity in time of feeding is most important both for the mother's sake and for the child's. During the first two months the infant should be fed every two hours in the day and every four at night. After two months the interval between each meal should be gradually increased to three hours in the day, but the infant should be allowed to sleep from 11 at night to 5 in the morning without a meal. If the mother has not enough milk, cow's milk should be given in addition; the two milks will not disagree. Weaning.—The infant should not be weaned before the ninth month. It should be gradual, and should never take place if possible during July, August, or September, as it is during these months that deaths from Diarrhoea among hand-fed infants are most frequent. If the infant cannot possibly be fed at the breast the best thing instead is cow's milk, which should be prepared in the following way:—Boil all the milk when it is received from the milkman, pour into a perfectly clean jug surrounded by cold water, stir the milk occasionally till cold, store it in the coolest place in the house and keep closely covered to prevent dust or flies from getting into it. Each meal should be made up as follows :— For an Infant under Two Weeks Old. Milk 1 tablespoonful. Water 2 tablespoonsful. Creain ½ a teaspoonful. White Sugar ½ a teaspoonful. Mix and then warm. Give this every two hours during the day and every four hours during the night. For an Infant from a Fortnight to Two Months Old. Milk 1½ tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 2. Water 3 tablespoonsful. Cream 1 teaspoonful. White Sugar ½ a teaspoonful. Mix and warm. Feed as before. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 79 For an Infant between Two and Three Months Old. Milk 2½ tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 3. Water 2½ tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 3. Cream 1 teaspoonful. White Sugar 1 teaspoonful. Mix and warm. Feed as before. For an Infant between Three and Four Months Old. Milk 3 tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 4. Water 3 tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 4. Cream 1 teaspoonful. White Sugar 1 teaspoonful. Mix and warm. Give this every three hours during the day and once in the night. For an Infant between Four and Six Months Old. Milk 5 tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 6. Water 5 tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 6. Cream 1½ teaspoonsfui. White Sugar 1 teaspoonful. Mix and warm. Give this every three hours during the day and once during the night. For an Infant between Six and Nine Months Old. Milk 9 tablespoonsful, gradually increasing to 11. Water 3 tablespoonsful. Cream 1½ teaspoonsfui. White Sugar 1 teaspoonful. Mix and warm. Give this every three hours during the day and once during the night. After nine months 14 to 16 tablespoonsful of milk may be given six times during the 24 hours, with the addition of one teaspoonful each of cream and white sugar. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It is Important that in all Cases thf. Cream and White Sugar should be added. When the infant is six months old, the milk may be given without anything being added, except perhaps a little white sugar or cream. Between the ages of six and eight months, give 12 tablespoonsful of milk six times during the 24 hours, gradually increasing to 14 tablespoonsful, and such quantity should be given up to 12 months. It is advisable to use a measured tablespoon. The food should not be prepared and then kept warm, but should be prepared fresh for each meal. If any is left over it need not be wasted, but it should not be given to the infant. No solid food should be given to an infant under 12 months, unless ordered by a doctor. In the summer, boil the milk after mixing with the water, cream, and white sugar instead of warming. The milk should be given in a boat-shaped bottle fitted with a short rubber teat, or in a spoon. On no Account whatever should you use the Bottle with the Long Tube. It is Impossible to keep this Bottle Clean, and its use causes the Deaths of Thousands of Infants Every Year in this Country. Wash the Bottle and Teat Carefully after Each Meal. Turn the teat inside out and hold it under the tap and then keep it in clean water. Keep the Bottle, Teat, and all the Things for holding the Milk, Cream, and Sugar Perfectly Clean. Unless ordered by a doctor never give the infant condensed milk, patent foods, skimmed or separated milk, or medicines of any kind. Note.—The above instructions are not intended to apply to infants who are ordered a special diet by a doctor. P. CALDWELL SMITH. M.A., M.D., D.P.H., Camb. Medical Officer of Health.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer and other malignant diseases was 242, a decrease of five compared with 1903, but an increase of 36.9 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate was .92, compared with 98 in 1903, and .90 in 1902. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each sub-district was as follows:—Clapham 59 and 1.07, Putney 27 and 1.00, Streatham 72 and 86, Tooting 23 and 87, and Wandsworth 61 and .83. 88 of the total deaths were of males and 154 of females, a decrease of three males and two females compared with 1903.

The total number of deaths which were registered as being due to diseases of a tuberculous nature was 380, compared with 343 in 1903, 314 in 1902, and 388 in 1901. 283 of the deaths were caused by Tubercular disease of the lungs, 38 to Tubercular disease of the brain, and 59 to other forms of Tubercular diseases. The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the lungs and other Tubercular diseases and the rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown in the next Table. Compared with last year the rate for Tubercular disease of the lungs shows a considerable increase, while from other Tubercular diseases there has been a decrease. The corrected death-rate for Tubercular disease of the lungs was 1.07, compared with .91 in 1903, and .87 in 1902; from other Tubercular diseases .36, compared with .45; and from all Tubercular diseases 1.43, compared with 136.

With regard to Tubercular disease of the lungs, Clapham, Streatham and Tooting are considerably higher, and Putney slightly higher than last year, while in Wandsworth this rate is slightly lower. The increase in Clapham is very marked, the number of deaths having increased from 50 to 68, and the rate from .93 to 1.24 per 1,000. The rate from other Tubercular diseases is 09 lower than it was in 1903, and this decrease is general in all the sub-districts. The rate from Tubercular disease of the lungs was lowest in Streatham, where it was only .79, and highest in Wandsworth 1.30, while from all Tubercular diseases the rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting and Wandsworth. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tubercular disease of the lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year as well as for the preceding ten years. f 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

From other Tubercular diseases 30 occurred under one year, 42 from one to five years, six from five to 15 years, four from 15 to 25 years, 14 from 25 to 65 years, and one over 65 years. Of the deaths from Tubercular disease of the lungs, 158 were of males and 125 of females, compared with 143 and 87 in 1903. The increase in the number of deaths of females is noteworthy, and the total increase for the year is almost wholly due to this increase. Of the deaths from other Tubercular diseases, 50 were of males and 47 of females, compared with 65 and 48 in 1903. The list which follows gives the occupation of those who died during the year from Tubercular disease of the lungs. TABLE XL. Previous Occupations of Persons who died from Consumption. Males.

In 142, out of the total of 158 males who died, the occupation is definitely stated, and it will be seen that, as in former years, labourers and clerks head the list. In the case of labourers the number of deaths was 35, compared with 17 in 1903. Among females, 115 out of the total of 125 had no occupation, while of the other 10, four were domestic servants, three were laundresses, two were waitresses, and one was a mantle maker. Voluntary Notification of Consumption. During the year, 118 cases were notified by medical practitioners, 10 from Clapham, two from Putney, 11 from Streatham, eight from Tooting, and 87 from Wandsworth, compared with a total of 88 in 1903. Two of the cases were children from one to five years, 13 from five to 15 years, 15 of persons from 15 to 25, 84 from 25 to 65, and four from 65 years and upwards. Of the 118 cases notified, 50 died during the year, 17 removed out of the Borough, one recovered, two were removed to Convalescent Homes, and 22 were removed to the Union Infirmary, leaving 26 still living in the Borough. During the year, disinfection was carried out in 144 instances, either after death or after removal of the patient. 34 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, eight in Putney, 34 in Streatham, 15 in Tooting, and 53 in Wandsworth. The adoption of the system of voluntary notification is, in my opinion, of great value, and further experience of its working shows that considerable benefit has accrued from its adoption. By no means of voluntary notification can all the cases, even among the poorer classes, be known to the Sanitary Authority, but it is better to know of 25 per cent. of the cases before death occurs, than not to be aware of the cases at all. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 89 Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 46 examinations of sputum were made by the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine—three from Clapham, four from Putney, 13 from Streatham, and 26 from Wandsworth. In 15 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had been found, and in 31 that it was absent. Circulatory Diseases. During the year, 327 deaths were registered as occurring from the above, 147 of which, 62 males and 85 females, were from Valvular disease of the heart. 89 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 39 in Putney, 70 in Streatham, 23 in Tooting, and 106 in Wandsworth. The majority of the deaths from Valvular disease of the heart were in adults, only 14 out of the 147 being of persons under 25 years. 62 of the deaths were of males and 85 of females. The increase, compared with 1903, is largely due to the increase in the number of deaths among females. Respiratory Diseases. The total number of deaths from disease of the organs of respiration was 514, compared with only 379 in 1903, and 550 in 1902. 124 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 38 in Putney, 116 in Streatham, 55 in Tooting, and 181 in Wandsworth. There has been a considerable increase in the number of these deaths in each of the sub-districts compared with 1903. The climatic conditions in 1904 were such that an increase in these deaths was expected, and the following Table shows markedly the effect of temperature on these causes of deaths. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Compared with 1903 there has been a decrease in each sub-district, especially in the number of deaths from developmental diseases. Old Age. 218 deaths ocurred from Old Age, compared with 191 in 1903; 78 of these deaths were of males and 140 of females. 47 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 70 in Streatham, 19 in Tooting, and 63 in Wandsworth. All the deaths were of persons over 65 years of age. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 9i 874 or 25.5 per cent. of the total deaths occurred in persons over 65 years of age, compared with 790, or 2570 per cent. in 1903. The percentage of deaths to total deaths in the several subdistricts was as follows:—In Clapham 28.3, Putney 25.5, Streatham 31.0, Tooting 16.0, and Wandsworth 22.2. Deaths from Other Causes. Two deaths were registered as being due to Intermittent Fever one in Streatham and the other in Wandsworth. In both cases the disease had been contracted abroad. From Alcoholism 10 deaths occurred, six of males and four of females, and from Cirrhosis of the Liver 40, 15 of males and 25 of females. From Nephritis and Bright's disease 104 deaths occurred, 52 of males and 52 of females, compared with 79 in 1903, an increase of 25. From diseases of the Brain and Nervous System 281 deaths occurred, 74 in Clapham, 28 in Putney, 88 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 79 in Wandsworth. 33 of these deaths were from Meningitis, 11 from Softening of the Brain, no from Apoplexy, 27 from Paralysis and Hemiplegia, 17 from General Paralysis of the Insane, 17 from diseases of the Spinal Cord, 12 from other forms of Insanity, 12 from Epilepsy, eight from Abscess of Ear involving the Brain, and 34 from other diseases of the Brain and Nervous System. Each year the number of deaths from Apoplexy shows a decided increase, and the number of deaths in each sub-district from this cause was as follows:—In Clapham 33, Putney nine, Streatham 38, Tooting two, and Wandsworth 28. Of the total number of deaths from all other causes, viz., 663, 161 occurred in Clapham, 65 in Putney, 204 in Streatham, 43 in Tooting, and 190 in Wandsworth. Violence. 101 deaths occurred during the year from Violence, 65 of males and 36 of females, compared with in in 1903. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 78 of these were accidental, and 23 were suicidal. 24 of these deaths belong to Clapham, 15 to Putney, 30 to Streatham, four to Tooting, and 28 to Wandsworth.

The number of deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, arranged as to sex, age, causes of death, and the institution in which the death occurred is shown on Table V., and of persons belonging to the Borough on Table VI. Water Supply. During the year the Metropolitan Water Board took over the various companies supplying water to London, and in the monthly returns after the month of July the areas supplied by these companies were termed districts. The areas supplied by the Lambeth and Southwark and Vauxhall Companies have not been altered, but the names are now the Lambeth District and the Southwark District. The following Tables, which have been extracted from the monthly reports of the Water Examiners appointed under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, show the results of the analyses of the water of the two companies or districts for each month during the year.

The water in the Lambeth district was only once (in the month of February) stated to be indifferent in quality, and once (in the month of May) fair, while during the other months the quality was stated to have been good. In the Southwark district the quality of the water was indifferent in February and fair in December, while during the rest of the year it was good. In 1903, the Lambeth Company's water was stated to have been bad in one month, very unsatisfactory in another, unsatisfactory in another, and indifferent in seven months, while it was only good in two months out of the 12. In the same year the Southwark and Vauxhall supply was unsatisfactory in two months, indifferent in three, fair in two, and good in five months of the year. An examination and comparison of the figures given in the Tables clearly show that there was a marked improvement in 1904. In the month of December there was a slight trace of ammonia in both waters, and otherwise during that month the analyses gave worse results than in other months of the year. The increase in albuminoid ammonia, organic carbon, and in the amount of oxygen required, was due to the condition of the river between the 9th and the 19th December. After the 16th, there was a great improvement in the quality of the water supplied in the Southwark district. Cutting-off Notices. During the year 44 notices were received from the Water Companies stating that the water had been cut off from certain premises. Three of these notices referred to premises in the Lambeth district supply, and 41 in the Southwark district supply. The 44 notices referred to 73 premises, and of these premises 24 were in Clapham, 22 in Putney, one in Streatham, none in Tooting and 26 in Wandsworth. 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 47 premises, for defects from six premises, in 19 the premises were empty, and in one the cause of the supply being withdrawn was not stated on the notice. Notices were served when necessary, and such notices were complied with. MORTUARIES. No change has taken place in the four Mortuaries in the Borough during the year. Several minor repairs were carried out at the Mortuary in Tooting, and all the other Mortuaries were kept in a satisfactory condition. In Clapham 47 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, in Streatham 47, in Tooting 18, and in Wandsworth 85, of which 24 were from Putney, a total of 197, compared with 212 in 1903. Negotiations are now in progress for the acquisition of land at rear of the Town Hall, Wandsworth, for the purpose of erecting a new Mortuary and Coroners' Court. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. Several meetings of the Sub-Committee were held during the year, but no definite report was submitted to the Council on the subject. The Sub-Committee are still considering the suitability of sites for this purpose. GENERAL SANITARY WORK IN 1904 The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year. (I). Aristotle Road, Clapham; High Street, Tooting near Totterdown; land between Lavenham Road and the boundary of the Borough, Wandsworth; and land at foot of Streatham High Road, with reference to complaints from occupiers of premises in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 101 neighbourhood, with respect to the burning of ballast. The nuisance complained of was caused by the smoke and fumes from these ballast heaps, and, especially in the first two places, was a serious nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbouring houses. Notices were necessary in each case, and, with one exception, the nuisance was abated forthwith. In the case of the complaints from High Street, Tooting, it was necessary to issue a summons, but at the hearing the summons was adjourned sine die, as the defendant promised in court that no more ballast should be burnt. (2) Rodway Road, Akehurst Street, Nepean Street, Roehampton, in consequence of complaints of smell from sewer ventilators in the roadway. These complaints were referred to the Surveyor and were attended to. (3). Gwendolen Avenue, Putney, in consequence of complaints of smell from sewer ventilators on the main County Council sewer. Numerous complaints were received from the occupiers of the houses in the vicinity and the matter was reported to the London County Council. The Engineer to that Authority was advised that similar nuisances had been abated in the Borough by the construction of a Reeves' ventilating apparatus in the manhole. Shortly after this apparatus was constructed in the manhole from which the sewer gas escaped most freely, and as a consequence the nuisance has been abated completely, 110 further complaint having since been received by this department. Personal inspection of the ventilator confirms this, as, although visited frequently during the year after the apparatus had been fixed, 110 smell could at any time be detected. (4). Trewint Street and Garratt Lane in its vicinity with reference to serious complaints from sewer ventilators. The complaints were unanimous in referring the smell to the premises occupied by Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co., Tallow Melters and Bone Boilers. Numerous inspections were made of the works themselves and of the sewers into which the sewage and trade refuse of g 102 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. the works were discharged and the Council were so impressed with the existence of this nuisance that two Reeves' Ventilating Apparatuses were constructed in the two manholes nearest these works, with the result that the nuisance from these particular openings was abated to a very great extent. The following report was presented to the Council in consequence of a letter to the Local Government Board by one of the owners of property in the neighbourhood. 10th March, 1904. The nuisance complained of by Mr. A. Wellings in his letter to the Local Government Board is caused by the discharge into the sewer of the drainage and waste products from the works of Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co., and also by the escape of effluvia from the works themselves. Two distinct businesses are carried on at these premises, viz:— that of bone boiling and of tallow melting, and to this may be added on a smaller scale that of glue making. These processes have been carried on at these premises for a considerable time previous to the passing of the Slaughterhouses Act of 1874, and until the passing of the Local Government Act, 1899, the works were under the supervision of the London County Council's Officials. That Act transferred the supervision of offensive trades to the Borough Councils. The premises are situated at the foot of Trewint Street,. Wandsworth, and are bounded on all sides by the river Wandle,. which divides into two about 50 yards above the bridge leading from Trewint Street to the works. Up to four years ago, the only houses in the neighbourhood were those in Trewint and Summerley Streets, and those houses on the same estate facing Garratt Lane. Few complaints were received by this Department until the houses on Garratt Park Estate were erected, and since the whole of the available building land in the immediate neighbourhood has been built on, complaints of smell from these premises became more frequent. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 103 With reference to the smell from the works themselves, action was taken by the London County Council in 1888, 1893, 1898, and in each case convictions were obtained, while since 1899 this Council has twice instituted proceedings, first in 1902 when the Magistrate decided that although he was satisfied that the best available means were used for the purpose of destroying the effluvia, yet was of opinion that owing to the want of proper care such means had not been taken advantage of on several occasions, and made an order for the payment of £10 10s. costs, but did not impose a fine on the defendants. The firm were again summoned in J une, 1903, for contravention of the London County Council By-laws as to offensive trades, and after several adjournments the case was heard on the 7th October, when the Magistrate convicted the defendants on one summons only, and inflicted a penalty of £5 and £5 5s. costs. Against this conviction the defendants appealed to Quarter Sessions, and in January, 1904, the appeal was heard and sustained. During the past year the premises have been inspected by the Sanitary Inspector 90 times, and by myself eight times. My inspections have always been made without notice and on no occasion have I been able to detect any contravention of the By-laws, although several times the effluvia from the works were smelt in the adjoining streets. Three notices were served by the Sanitary Inspector in 1902 and 1903, for contravention of By-laws (London County Council) but as already stated in one case only the costs were ordered to be paid, in the other two the cases were lost on appeal. Complaints with reference to the escape of effluvia from the works themselves have since September, 1903, been few, and nearly all the complaints received referred to smells from the sewers in the neighbourhood. Previous to September, 1903, all the drainage and waste products from the factory were discharged after a certain amount of subsidence into the River Wandle. Notice was served by the Borough Council on Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co, to construct proper drainage, and soon after this was done complaints were received. The effluent from these works consists of the liquid from the bone boiling pans, the liquid from the presses in the tallow melting 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. room, and the sewage from the two water closets. The liquids from the bone boiling pans, and the tallow melting room are discharged into a large subsiding tank or cesspool, so that any fat which exists in the fluid may be removed. From this it is pumped into a manhole at a higher level into which also the sewage from the water closets is discharged, and then into the sewer in Trewint Street. The smell from this liquid is most obnoxious and pungent and escapes at all the ventilating openings in the neighbouring streets as well as at the ventilating shafts which have been erected to take the place of the ventilating openings in the streets. The effluvium is also smelt in houses where there is no intercepting trap between the house drain and the sewer, and this more especially if the drains are in any way defective. In 13 houses in the neighbourhood this has been complained of, and, as a consequence, notices have been served for the abatement of nuisance from defective drains in these houses. The whole of the ventilating shafts and open gratings in the street have now been closed with the exception of one at the foot of Trewint Street, in which, at considerable expense to the Council, a Reeves' ventilating apparatus has been fixed, which, so far, has had the effect of abating the nuisance as far as that particular shaft is concerned, and I am of opinion that the apparatus has a decided effect on the whole of the sewer in Trewint Street. r Since the ventilating openings belonging to the Council have been closed the effluvium has found its way into the main London County Council sewer in Garratt Lane, and several complaints have been received with reference to smell from the open gratings in that thoroughfare. These complaints have been referred to the London County Council, who are, I understand, considering the advisability of taking action under their General Powers Act of 1894. In the proceedings taken in 1903 by this Council, I certified in accordance with Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, that these premises were a nuisance, but I could not satisfy myself, after a careful examination of the death returns, and the notifications of cases of infectious diseases, especially Diphtheria, from the reports 105 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of the medical men practising in the district, or from my own experience in previous years of practice in the neighbourhood, that such effluvia were directly injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the houses in the locality affected. The premises are being kept under constant observation and if any infringement of the By-laws are observed the matter will be forthwith reported to the Public Health Committee of the Council. With reference to the smells from the sewers, this has been to some extent abated by the closing of the ventilators, and by the construction of a Reeves' apparatus. No action can be taken by this Council with reference to the discharge of noxious material into the sewer, but such action can and probably will be taken by the London County Council. (5). Numerous complaints having been received from the occupiers of premises in the vicinity of the works occupied by Messrs. Levy Bros. & Knowles, with respect to an accumulation of refuse in a state of combustion, special inspections were made of the premises. The accumulation was caused by the depositing of refuse from the manufacture of sugar on a piece of land between the Causeway and the River Wandle. This accumulation has been in existence for some years, but it was not a nuisance until it took fire and produced a considerable quantity of smoke and steam, the smell from which was decidedly offensive. A summons was issued and after hearing the defendants were fined. The nuisance to some extent still continues, although a considerable quantity of the accumulation has been removed, but the premises are under constant observation. (6). Brickfields and ditches at South Streatham, near Lonesome. Special inspections were made on several occasions of the whole of this area which is situated at the extreme boundary of Streatham, owing to complaints of smell from the brickfield, and also owing to complaints from persons in the vicinity of smell from the offensive ditch which forms the boundary between this Borough and the Croydon Rural District. The ditch was cleared out and that part in Greyhound Lane leading to the River Graveney was piped and covered in. 106 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Complaint was also made of the offensive condition of the ponds on the brickfield. As this was not remedied after the service of a statutory notice the owner of the brickfield was summoned, and an order was made by the Court to abate the nuisance, and he was ordered to pay £ 1 is. costs. (7). Pendle, Nimrod, Ribblesdale and Moyser Roads, Streatham. These new streets were inspected on account of complaints of persons residing in the streets that they were in an insanitary condition. These streets have only recently been made, and at the time of my inspection building operations were still being carried on. As a consequence the roadway was in a very bad condition. Pendle Road was the worst, but this was, shortly after my visit, taken over by the Council and made up properly. (8). Special inspection was also made of the Destructor at Tooting, the property of the Council, owing to complaints that there was a very serious nuisance from the deposit of dust emitted from the chimney. The following report was made on the matter in May:— 16 th May, 1904. I have during the past year made frequent inspections of the Dust Destructor and on no occasion have 1 been able to say that there was any nuisance which would be injurious or dangerous to the health of the occupiers of the neighbouring houses. Considering the work which is carried on there I am of opinion that the premises are kept in a thoroughly satisfactory condition, and that every care is taken by those in charge to prevent any nuisance. No complaints have been received in this Department of any nuisance caused by the Destructor with the exception of one or two during the period when the fish offal was removed to the Destructor. Since the fish offal has been removed by the Contractor no complaints have been received. I have also made inquiries at the Fever Hospital which is contiguous to the Dust Destructor, and 1 have been informed by those in charge that during the past seven or eight months no nuisance from smells or the depositing of ashes or dust has been observed. 107 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The only suggestion which I could make and which I pointed out to the Surveyor on my last visit, is that a corrugated iron screen might be erected on the incline leading to the Destructor, so as to prevent the occupants of the houses in Bertal Road from seeing the carts ascending such incline. (9). Owing to several complaints having been made with respect to offensive privies at houses in course of construction special inspections were made, chiefly in Putney, to ascertain if such complaints were well founded. Several privies were discovered some of which were decidedly nuisances, but others were at a considerable distance from any inhabited house. It was decided, however, to inform builders, by letter, that when a privy was constructed, it should be constructed in accordance with the By-laws of the London County Council, and that notice must be given before a privy was constructed. The privies in Putney which had been complained of were immediately abolished, and where necessary, proper conveniences were constructed. The following letter was sent to a large number of builders in the Borough:— Dear Sir, The attention of the Council having been called to the fact that during the erection of new houses in the Borough privies are frequently constructed by the contractors for the use of the workmen, and that no notice of intention to construct the same has been given to this Council, I have therefore been instructed to inform you that in every case where a privy is proposed to be constructed notice must be given in accordance with the By-laws of the London County Council, a copy of which is enclosed. Yours faithfully, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Hea/t/.. (10.) A large number of special inspections have this year teen made of passages, yards, alleys, mews, and courts in the Borough. It was found that several of these were unpaved and undrained and after rain that they were sometimes in a 108 Report of the Mcdical Officer of Health. most insanitary condition. In previous years some of these yards, chiefly Gleneldon Mews, Caistor Road Mews, Dutch Yard and Armoury Yard had been dealt with by the Council and the improvement effected was very great. The following is a list of these yards, &c., inspected during the year:— In Clapham—Great Acre Court; Passage at rear of Nos. 27-45,. and also at rear of Nos. 55-71, Abbeville Road ; Wallis Court ; Newman's Court; Triangle Place; Carpenter's Cottages; Park Crescent Mews ; and Passage at side of 18, Old Town. In Putney—Yard at rear of No. 175, Upper Richmond Road, and also at rear of Nos. 84-94, High Street. In Streatham—Factory Square ; Passage at rear of Colmer and Danbrook Roads ; Passage at rear of Station Parade; Caistor Road Mews ; Passage at rear of Mitcham Road. In Wandsworth—Passage between Cader and Jeypore Roads ; Passage at rear of The Terrace, Merton Road ; Newton's Yard ; Field's Alley ; Stockwell Court ; Carter's Yard ; Simrose Court ; Armoury Yard ; and Dutch Yard. The following were referred to the New Streets Committee to consider as to adopting them as new streets:—Newton's Yard,. Carter's Yard, Field's Alley, Charlotte Place, Triangle Place, Great Acre Court, Carpenter's Cottages, road at rear of The Terrace,. Merton Road, passage between Cader and Jeypore Roads, and Factory Square. In the case of Carpenter's Cottages and the passage at rear of Jeypore Road the paving has been done under apportionment ; Newton's Yard, Triangle Place, and 18, Old Town, Clapham, have been apportioned ; Carter's Yard, Field's Alley and Factory Square are to be apportioned, while in Great Acre Court the work of paving was done by the owner. With reference to the passages at rear of the shops in Abbeville Road the owners have, after notice has been served, put the work, of paving in hand. 109 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. This was also the case with the passage at rear of High Street, Tooting, and that at rear of Colmer and Danbrook Roads, Streatham. A large number of other small passages and rear entrance ways have been inspected and where necessary notices were served for the abatement of any nuisance. These notices were in every case complied with. The following reports on some of the passages were laid before the Public Health Committee:— 11 th February, 1904. Newton's Yard, in the parish of Wandsworth, consists of five houses, occupied by 20 persons, and is approached from High Street by a long passage which, in wet weather, is almost impassable. Carter's Yard, also off High Street, contains four houses occupied by 17 persons, and there are also two stables and back entrances to two houses. All of yard is paved close to the houses, but the rest is in a very bad state. In Field's Alley, also off High Street, there are six houses occupied by 19 persons, and this yard also is dirty and insanitary in wet weather. In the parish of Clapham, the two more important streets which should be dealt with are Chariotte Place and Triangle Place, the former containing seven houses occupied by 36 persons, and the latter 13 houses occupied by 95 persons. In the former also are three factories, two workshops and stables, and in the latter one workshop and stables. These streets are always in a very bad condition in wet weather. The roadway adjoining 16, Old Town, has been for some time in a very dirty condition, and although there are inhabited houses in it, there is a factory, a laundry, stables, and five back entrances to private houses. Great Acre Court is not in such a bad condition as it was at one time tar paved, but the paving is very defective. The rain-water, 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. which runs from the roofs of the houses, collects in large puddles, so that the occupants have difficulty in getting to their houses dryshod. This court consists of 16 houses, constructed mostly of wood, occupied by 79 persons. 25th February, 1904. 1 have to report on the condition of the passage at Carpenters' Cottages, Clapham, and the passage at rear of Nos. 55 to 71, Abbeville Road, Clapham. Carpenters' Cottages, off High Street, Clapham. The roadway in front of these cottages and leading to the Reform Club was, on the occasion of my visit, in a very bad condition. There are eleven houses in the passage, occupied by 32 adults and 13 children. There is one gully in the roadway, but this does not drain off the water satisfactorily. 1 am of opinion that the passage should be paved throughout its whole length. Passage at rear of Nos. 55 to 71, Abbeville Road. The mews extends from Narbonne Avenue to Hambalt Road, and is very largely used by the occupants of the shops. I am of opinion that the whole of the passage should be paved to abate the nuisance. In addition to the above special inspections, 403 inspections were made of other premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance at the Police Court was necessary on 10, and at t he H igh Court on four separate occasions. The table of sanitary operations shows in detail the amount and 1 ature of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,491, compared with 1,481 in 1903. There was some increase in the number of complaints from Streatham and Tooting during the year, and a decrease in the number from Clapham and Wandsworth. 111 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of houses and premises inspected was 17,999, compared with 16,419 in 1903, and 14,703 in 1902. The increase in these inspections was chiefly in Wandsworth and Clapham, although there was a small increase in Streatham and Tooting, but the inspections in Putney show a slight decrease. 6,440 house-to-house inspections were made during the year, an increase of 1,221 compared with 1903. There has been a satisfactory increase in the number of house-tohouse inspections in each of the sub-districts, and this increase is very marked in the case of Wandsworth.

The tables of house-to-house inspections which follow show the names of the streets and the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, the percentage of defects to houses inspected, as well as the number of families living in one, two, three and four rooms and upwards. In 3,453 out of the total of 6,440 houses inspected, or 53.61 per cent., some sanitary defect, necessitating the service of an intimation notice, was found. The highest percentage was in the Balham Ward, where the percentage was 76.07 and the lowest in Southfield Ward, where the percentage was only 27.01. The next lowest was in Springfield, where the percentage was 37.46. The following table, which is prepared from the figures given in the summary, shows the percentage to total number of families of those living in one, two, three or four rooms and upwards, in the separate wards and in the whole Borough.

The number of intimation notices served was 6,491, compared with 5,797 in 1903, and of statutory notices 1,029, compared with 785 in 1902. The number of statutory notices served include By-law notices, 214 of which were served in respect of the following contraventions of the By-laws:— Yard paving 102, cistern covers 38, repairs to water closets 30, repairs to water closet flushing apparatuses 11, dirty cisterns 26, absence of manure receptacles 5, and privies 2. The increase in the number of statutory notices was chiefly in Clapham and Wandsworth. The difference between Putney and Tooting in respect of statutory notices is very noticeable. In Putney while 349 preliminary notices were served, it was only necessary to serve statutory notices in seven cases, whereas in Tooting 548 preliminary and 124 statutory notices were served. This great difference is due not so much to the class of property as to the class of tenants. It has been frequently observed that in Tooting a large proportion of the inhabitants have come from other and overcrowded parts of London, and chiefly consist of casual labourers, whereas in Putney the occupiers have in most instances resided in the district for some time, and are generally engaged in regular occupations. The number of cases of overcrowding dealt with during the year was 103—11 in Clapham, three in Putney, 30 in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 55 in Wandsworth. The cases in Wandsworth were chiefly in the Fairfield and Springfield Wards. In the Fairfield Ward, out of 34 cases, 22 were due to domestic overcrowding, while 12 were caused by sub-letting. Of nine cases in Springfield Ward where it was necessary to serve notice, six were due to domestic overcrowding, two were caused by sub-letting single rooms to other families, while one case occurred in a workshop. All the cases of overcrowding were remedied without having recourse to legal proceedings. 1,166 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 803 in 1903, and 433 complaints of non-removal of house refuse (102 from 124 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Clapham, 33 from Putney, 142 from Streatham, 33 from Tooting, and 123 from Wandsworth) were received during the year. These complaints were at once attended to by the inspectors in the Surveyors' departments. With regard to the collection of house refuse, no change occurred in either the Eastern or Western Divisions during the year. The methods of removal and disposal have been dealt with in previous reports. Owing to the number of complaints received and also on account of the fact that the number of refusals to have dust removed by the dustmen amounted to several thousands each week, the Public Health Committee instructed me to make inquiries to ascertain the methods of removal and disposal of house refuse in the other Boroughs in the Metropolis and in the provinces. The following report is a synopsis of the replies received:— SYNOPSIS OF REPLIES RECEIVED WITH REFERENCE TO THE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. 59 replies have been received from various Sanitary Authorities, 28 of these referring to the Metropolis and 31 to the provinces. To these is to be added the returns for the two divisions of Wandsworth, making a total of 60 returns received. In London the removal of house refuse is carried out in 19 cases by the Sanitary Authority directly, in five wholly by contract, and in five partly by contract and partly by the Sanitary Authority. In the provinces the removal and disposal of house refuse is in all cases carried out by the Sanitary Authority directly. With regard to the frequency of removal, in London 21 Authorities have a weekly removal, four remove twice a week, and one three times in the week. Stepney removes daily in business quarters and two or three times a week in the residential parts. 125 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Westminster once, twice or three times a week, and in some cases daily. Holborn twice weekly from April to October, and once weekly from November to March. In the provinces in one town (Dundee), the house refuse is removed twice a day ; in two (Aberdeen and Margate), there is a daily removal ; in 11 a weekly ; in seven twice a week ; in two three times a week ; and in two the refuse is removed at intervals greater than once a wee . In Eastbourne the refuse is removed twice weekly in the months of July, August and September; and once a week during the other months of the year. This rule is also adopted in Brighton In Nottingham the time of collection varies from daily to weekly. In Portsmouth once or twice a week. Scarborough twice a week in summer and weekly at other times. Leeds varies from once a day to once a fortnight. Movable leceptactes. In the provinces movable receptacles are insisted on in 19 cases, in nine cases they are not insisted on, and in one case they are preferred. In Halifax the dust bins are supplied by the Corporation. In Glasgow the dust bins must be movable if removal is daily. Size of receptacles. In London as a rule the size of the receptacles is in conformity with the London County Council By-laws, but these do not seem to be rigidly enforced. When new dust bins are provided they must in all cases be in accordance with the London County Council By-laws. In the provinces the size of the receptacles varies very greatly, no standard having been adopted. Do dustmen go on premises to collect. London.—In the City, where removal is daily, the dust bins have to be placed on the kerb. In Bermondsey they have to be placed in front of the premises. In Woolwich the receptacles are usually placed in front of premises, but 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. this is not enforced. In Finsbury and Marylebone the dust bins are occasionally placed outside. In Bethnal Green and Poplar occupiers are required to place them in forecourts. In the other London Boroughs the dustmen go on the premises to collect. In the provinces the dustmen go on premises to collect in 19 cases, and the dust bins are placed in the forecourts in four cases. In Croydon the bins are placed on the kerb where there is a daily removal. In Bristol they are generally put in forecourts, but in the better parts of the city the dustmen go on premises. In Swansea both systems are in use. In Scarborough, where the receptacles are movable, they are placed in the forecourts. In Glasgow special means of removal are provided. Type of Vans used. The type of vans generally used in London are tip vans of three to four cubic yards capacity, the same as in Wandsworth. In the City and Westminster motors are used. In the provinces two and four wheeled dust vans similar to those used in London are generally used, but in a few cases ordinary carts are still used. In Liverpool motor vans as well as dust wagons are used, while in Glasgow in the morning service two wheeled floats with crank axles are used. Method of Disposal. Generally speaking in London three methods are used—either the refuse is sent away by rail, barged, or burnt in a Destructor. 14 of the London Boroughs have Destructors which are the property of the Councils. In Wandsworth part of the refuse is burned, part sent away by rail, and part burnt in the Destructor. In the Provinces 13 of the 31 Authorities possess Destructors, in which either the whole or the principal portion of the refuse is burnt. 127 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

No statement of cost was received from Kensington, Shoreditch, or the City of London. In the Eastern Division of the Borough of Wandsworth where it is wholly carried out by the Sanitary Authority, the cost of removal per inhabited house is 7s., and of disposal 4s. 2d., a total of us. 2d.; while in the Parish of Putney the cost of removal is 8s. 6d., and of disposal 6s. 7d., a total of 15s. Id. In the Parish of Wandsworth where removal is wholly carried out by Contractors, the cost of removal and disposal is 7s. 3d. per inhabited house. No statement as to cost of renewal and disposal was received from Cardiff, Bradford, Derby, Portsmouth, or Manchester. Wages Paid. In London the dustmen in the Eastern District of Wandsworth have the lowest wage. 11 of the Boroughs pay 30s. a week and upwards, four pay 24s. as a minimum, while 17 pay a higher wage than the highest in this Borough, which is in Putney. In the Provinces the average wage is lower than in London. Birmingham and Glasgow pay 30s. and 31s. per week respectively. Gratuities. In London no gratuities are officially permitted in any of the Boroughs except Hammersmith. In the Provinces none but Leeds; in Croydon and Harrogate there is no rule to the contrary. Picking of Refuse. In Lqndon seven of the Boroughs permit the dustmen to pick out saleable articles; 20 do not; in one there is no rule; while in another (Poplar) if caught doing so they are dismissed. In the provinces four permit the dustmen to pick out saleable articles, 24 do not permit it, and in one (Dundee) if caught doing so they are dismissed. In Croydon the contractor pays 33s. per week for the privilege of picking. The total receipts amount to £ 421 per annum. In Leicester the sorting is done by the Corporation workmen, the product being sold and half given to the men. P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. 130 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The above report, along with the reports of the Surveyors, were considered by a Joint Sub-Committee of the Public Health and Highways Committees, who made the following report to the Council on the 12th October:— (a.) That the refuse from the houses in the areas selected by the Surveyors—one in the Eastern and one in the Western districts—be removed daily, experimentally in the first place, for a period of 12 months from the 1st January next. (b.) That with a view of a uniform system being adopted in the prescribed areas, and ill consideration of the men in these areas not being allowed to pick over the refuse, the wages of all carmen employed in dusting in these areas be 27s. per week. (c.) That the notice as settled by the Committee be printed and circulated in the districts selected, giving the ratepayers the necessary notice of the proposed change in the system of removing house refuse. These recommendations were adopted by the Council on that date. 983 yards in connection with dwelling houses and 66 in connection with stables were drained, paved or cleansed, compared with 822 and 69 in 1903. 4,325 rooms and 397 passages have been cleansed and repaired, an increase of 1,138 rooms and 148 passages compared with the previous year. This increase was due to the increase in the number of house-to-house inspections, 1,171 drains were cleansed or repaired, and 214 rain-water pipes disconnected from drains. 182 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent on to the Surveyors from this department ; 24 in Clapham, 15 in Putney, 64 in Streatham, 20 in Tooting, and 59 in Wandsworth. The number of water closets cleansed and repaired was 1,979, compared with 1,783 in 1903, and 1,465 in 1902. 131 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 300 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice. This nuisance is of frequent occurrence and is the cause of numerous complaints of residents in the vicinity of stables. There are approximately about 7,000 horses stabled in the Borough, 2,400 of which are owned by the omnibus companies. The quantity of manure produced by these would amount to nearly 95 tons per day, or 34,216 tons per annum. It has been estimated that nearly two thirds of the manure is produced in the stables and one third is deposited in the streets, so that from the horses stabled in the Borough alone, 63 tons is stored at stable yards and 31 tons is deposited on the public highways. If, as the omnibus companies intend, motor omnibuses take the place of horsed ones there is bound to be a considerable decrease in the amount of manure produced. 1,001 cisterns supplying drinking water were cleansed, covered or repaired, compared with 849 in 1903. This increase is also due to the increase in the number of house-to-house inspections. The circular letter which was issued by the Council in December, 1903, with respect to cleansing of cisterns is still being distributed among owners of property. 155 notices were served where animals were kept so as to be a nuisance. 19 of these were in Clapham, three in Putney, 35 in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 88 in Wandsworth. The animals chiefly concerned were fowls, and in many instances personal inspection convinced me that these nuisances were of a serious nature. In some cases the greater portions of the yards were occupied by the fowl runs, and in one case it was necessary to take proceedings for keeping the fowls so as to be a nuisance. An order was made by the Magistrate for the abatement of the nuisance, but as this was not complied with, another summons was taken out for the contravention of such order, and a fine of 20s. and costs was inflicted. The result of this was that the occupier left the premises. 33 smoke nuisances were reported during the year, four from Clapham, two from Putney, nine from Streatham, one from Tooting, and 17 from Wandsworth. 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Proceedings were taken against the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway Company on two occasions for the emission of black smoke from locomotives, and in both cases the defendants were convicted and fined. 269 soil pipes were repaired, 199 of these being in Streatham. This number is considerably under the number repaired in 1903, but this nuisance is not so common owing to the fact that the majority of premises have now had their soil pipes reconstructed in accordance with the By-laws of the London County Council. The number of unclassified nuisances was 943, compared with 792 in 1903. These include a number of minor nuisances incapable of classification. DISINFECTION. The total number of rooms disinfected after cases of infectious diseases was 2,527, compared with 2,364 in 1903, and 1,953 in 1902. The increase is wholly due to the fact that in 1904, 1,115 premises were disinfected after Measles, which is now a dangerous infectious disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. There has been a decrease in the number of lots of bedding stoved compared with 1903 and 1902. The number in 1902 was 1,892; in 1903, 1,408; and in 1904, 1,129. The whole of the disinfection by steam has been carried out at the Disinfecting Station in Bell Lane, Wandsworth, the new Disinfecting Station being in course of erection. During the current year this work will be carried out at the new Station, particulars of which were given in my Report for 1903. The 1,129 lots of bedding stoved comprised the following articles:— 754 beds, 923 bolsters, 2,050 pillows, 883 mattresses, 727 palliasses, 1,601 sheets, 1,134 quilts, 686 cushions, 6,019 articles of clothing, 2,509 blankets, 586 carpets, and 2,413 extra articles, a total of 20,295 articles, compared with 24,750 in 1903, and 44,928 in 1902. 1,115 rooms were disinfected after Measles and 144 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs. 133 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

MILKSHOPS. At the close of 1903 there were 286 of these on the Register, 31 have been added and 31 removed during the year, leaving 286 still on the Register. During the year 590 inspections were made of these premises, and 48 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. Two prosecutions were ordered in 1904, both with respect to the same premises in South Streatham. In the case of one tenant the summons was withdrawn on payment of costs. The other was fined £5 and costs, but he immediately left the district, and all efforts to trace him were fruitless. COWSHEDS.

SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. There were 23 Slaughter-houses and one Knacker's yard on the Register in 1903, but one Slaughter-house was pulled down during the year owing to the street widening in Tooting, leaving 22 Slaughter-houses and one Knacker's yard on the Register.

Hi Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The complaints received with reference to No. 3 were not so numerous as in previous years, but there was a certain number received, especially during the summer months. Proceedings were taken by the London County Council against this firm for discharging noxious material into the main sewer in Garratt Lane, and after evidence was heard the Magistrate convicted the firm and a fine was inflicted. A special report on complaints received with reference to smell from above premises is given at page 102 of this Report. 124 visits were made by the Inspectors of these premises and one notice was served. In November, 1904, the Council received a communication from the London County Council stating that the Public Health Committee of that Council were of opinion that the By-lays relating to offensive trades should be amended. The most important amendment proposed was that in the case of every business all offensive processes should be conducted in a closed chamber, provision being made for the adequate ventilation of such chamber and the destruction of offensive vapours. The amended draft By-laws also differ from the existing By-laws in the following, among other, respects :— For the purpose of receiving and conveying away all scraps, litter, refuse and residues, there is to be provided in all cases a sufficient number of vessels or receptacles, furnished with tight and close-fitting covers. All material emitting any offensive or noxious effluvium, vapour or gas when delivered on to the premises across a public footway is required to be conveyed in vessels properly constructed and covered. In all cases where a closed chamber is to be provided the cleansing of the floor of every such chamber and such part of the walls thereof as is covered with hard, smooth, and impervious material is required at the close of each working day; and all vessels, receptacles, etc., are to be kept clean so as to prevent any offensive smell. 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health, A copy of the By-laws and of a plan of the premises is to be displayed in a conspicuous position. Drains on all premises are to be maintained in good order and efficient action. In some instances a requirement is made that all liquid refuse before being discharged into any drain shall be treated in such manner as to prevent nuisance. In the By-laws relating to the business of a knacker, a provision has been inserted for the prevention of overcrowding of animals, and the cleansing of streets after the slaughter of horses by licensed knacker. A provision that the parts of walls and ceilings not covered with hard, smooth, and impervious materials shall be lime-washed between the first and tenth days of the months of March, June, September, and December had been inserted in each set of By-laws. These alterations in the By-laws were considered by this Council and approved of. The London County Council also during the year 1904, in pursuance of section 19, sub-section 1 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, declared that the business of a dresser of fish skins, that is, any business in which fish skins are trimmed, cleansed, scraped or dried, is an offensive business. ICE CREAM PREMISES. There were 192 of these on the Register at the end of the year. 49 having been added and 15 removed during the year. The total number of inspections made was 333, and 30 notices were served, chiefly for cleansing. 143 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. HOUSES-LET-IN-LODGINGS. There are now on the Register 217 houses registered as houseslet-in-lodgings. 30 were added to the Register during the year and 13 removed. Of these 13 houses six were pulled down owing to widening of streets and one was pulled down as the land had been purchased by the London County Council for other purposes. 491 inspections of these premises were made, 13 notices were served for overcrowding and 347 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. The question of alteration of these By-laws was considered by the Council, and new By-laws were framed, chiefly on account of recent decisions in the High Court, and such By-laws have been submitted to the Local Government Board for its approval. OFFENSIVE TRADE REFUSE. The arrangements entered into by the Council for the removal and disposal of offal came into force during the year and has worked satisfactorily. The following circular was sent to those requiring the removal of such refuse :— » Council House, Wandsworth, S.W. 20th February, KJ04. Sir, COLLECTION OF OFFENSIVE TRADE REFUSE. Referring to my circular letter of the 12th June, 1901, with reference to the removal and disposal of fishmongers' and butchers' offal, the Council has again had the subject under consideration and I am directed to inform you that owing to the difficulty experienced in disposing of the offal the Council has been compelled to make other arrangements for the service. 144 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. A contract has therefore been entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, who undertake to collect and dispose of trade refuse, in a similar manner to that adopted by the Council, leaving the requisite number of empty tins when removing those containing waste, upon the undermentioned charges, which are practically the same as made by the Council, viz:— Where the quantity removed does not exceed three tins per week.—One shilling.

Yours obediently, HENRY GEORGE HILLS, Town Clerk. REVENUE ACT, 1903 During the year 29 certificates were granted under the above Act, one certificate was deferred and one refused. The certificates granted referred to 962 separate tenements. One certificate was refused as I was of opinion that separate sanitary arrangements had not been provided for each family. 145 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. UNSOUND FOOD. During the year two trunks and 13 haddocks, three boxes of skate, one case of coal fish, one box of catfish, two boxes and six stone of plaice, five boxes of tomatoes, two baskets of pears, two tubs of crabs, two boxes of eels, one box of soles, seven boxes and one barrel of herrings, 16 codlings, one barrel of sprats, and 91 rabbits were destroyed at the request of the owners and the usual certificates were granted. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. This Act came into force during the year. Powers are given in the Act for the Sanitary Authority : (1.) To cause filthy, dangerous, or unwholesome articles to be cleansed or purified. (2.) To have any house or part of a house infested with vermin cleansed. (3.) To provide means for the cleansing, purifying or destruction of filthy, dangerous, or unwholesome articles, and for the cleansing of houses infested with vermin. (4.) To require the owner to remove or alter sanitary conveniences which are a nuisance or offensive to public decency. (5.) To serve notice for fixed ashpits to be removed where movable ashpits have been provided. Power is also given in this Act for the Sanitary Authority to enter on premises for inspection. For the purpose of enforcing this part of the Act, Sections 101, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 124, 125, 127, 128, 133, and 135 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, shall apply and have effect as if re-enacted in this Act. 146 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The card system of registering workshops has proved most satisfactory, and a complete register is now kept of all workshops, factories, workplaces, and outworkers' premises. The inspections made during the year are also noted on the card as well as the result of such inspections. The Tables in this portion of the Report are similar to those used in 1903, with the exception of Tables LVI., LVII. and LVIII., which are now inserted on forms supplied by the Home Office. The whole of the work done is summarised in the Tables, more especially in the extended Tables. The total number of workshops on the register was 1,649, including 159 retail bakehouses, 130 workshop laundries, 282 domestic workshops, and 1,078 other workshops, but not including 238 factories, 867 workplaces, and 233 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces and outworkers' premises, there are now on the register 2,987 premises, an increase of 311 compared with 1903. The total number of inspections made during the year was 4,946, compared with 5,554 in 1903. The decrease in the number of inspections is almost wholly due to the fact that in 1904 the total number of inspections of bakehouses was only 381, compared with 1,536 in 1903. The large number of inspections of these in 1903 was due to the fact that underground bakehouses were dealt with in that year for certificates. The total number of notices served during the year was 465, 422 intimation and 43 statutory, a decrease of 51 intimation and 25 statutory compared with 1903. The total number of prosecutions was three, two with respect to workshops and one in respect of a workplace. 147 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The particulars of these three cases were as follows:— (1). Absence of proper water supply to the workshop. An order was made for the abatement of the nuisance and the owner ordered to pay 20s. costs. (2). Failing to provide sanitary conveniences in yard. mons withdrawn as the work was in hand and costs paid. (3). Failing to provide sanitary accommodation at a timber yard. In this case the summons was dismissed as the Magistrate came to the conclusion that it was not a factory, workshop, or workplace. The premises were used as a timber yard, and when inspected four men were employed, one of these using an office which consisted of a wooden building near the entrance gates. The yard itself was used for storing timber and this timber was enclosed in some cases in temporary covered structures. The Inspector on first visiting the premises discovered a foul privy full of excreta, and served notice to abate the nuisance. This was complied with, but another notice was served to provide proper and sufficient sanitary conveniences for the workpeople. It was pointed out to the Magistrate that the judgment in Bennett v. Harding, 2 Q.B. 397 (1900), was with reference to a case of a similar nature, but the Magistrate held that the words "whether erected before or after the passing of the Act" clearly showed that either a factory, workshop or workplace must be an erection, and he also called attention to the subsequent words of the section, "persons employed in or in attendance at such building." He admitted that this was a case in which a sanitary convenience ought to be fixed, and suggested that the defendant might be compelled to provide the same under some of the other sections of the Act, but in his opinion the defendant's premises were not within the meaning of Section 38. The Magistrate was asked to state a case, but he refused to do so. It was unfortunate that this case was decided against the Council, as it is now impossible to insist on proper sanitary conveniences in other places of a similar character. 148 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Under the head of other workshops is included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale is included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. The number of inspections of factories is not very large, as only the sanitary arrangements of these is under the supervision of the Sanitary Authority. In all, 381 inspections were made of 237 factories, and 47 notices, 41 intimation and six statutory, were served. The total number of workshops on the register was 1,649, 130 of which were workshop laundries, 159 workshop bakehouses, and 1,360 other workshops. In all, 2,879 inspections of these were made, and 208 intimation and 19 statutory notices were served. In one case it was necessary to prosecute for absence of water supply to the premises. The total number of workplaces on the register was 867, and 1,449 inspections of these were made during the year, while 176 notices, 161 of which were intimation and 15 statutory, were served. Two prosecutions were necessary for insufficient sanitary accommodation. The total number of nuisances found during the year was 603, while only three were notified by H.M. Inspector of Factories, compared with 13 in 1903. For these 458 notices were served, all of which with a few exceptions were complied with before the close of the year. The others were complied with in the early part of the present year (1905), some of the notices having been served in the end of December. Seven notices were served for breach of special sanitary requirements of bakehouses, but these, as in former years, were for failing to have the bakehouse cleansed at the proper time, and were all complied with forthwith. In all, 610 defects were found and 601 remedied, but it was only necessary to serve 465 notices, for the reason stated in my last year's Report, viz. that in some minor cases of overcrowding no notice was served as the nuisance was abated at the time of inspection, and also that one notice occasionally called attention to several nuisances. 149 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The next Table shows in detail the work of the Inspectors in workshops where males are chiefly employed. The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five chief divisions—(l) Factories, (2) Workshops, (3) Domestic Workshops, (4) Workplaces, (5) Out-workers' premises. The total number of premises inspected was 1,849, compared with 1,384 in 1903, and re-inspected 1,014, compared with 2,127, the decrease in re-inspections being due, as already stated, to the large number of re-inspections of underground bakehouses in 1903. 703 of the inspections were in Clapham, 294 in Putney, 489 in Streatham, 107 in Tooting, and 356 in Wandsworth. Three workshops where males were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector, and three were reported by the Inspector to this Council. TABLE LIX. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

The Tables which follow summarise the work done during the year by the lady Sanitary Inspector. The total number of premises inspected was 1,736 (360 in Clapham, 206 in Putney, 586 in Streatham, 105 in Tooting, and 479 in Wandsworth). 71 inspections were made of factories, 966 of workshops, 66 of domestic workshops, 471 of workplaces, and 162 of outworkers' premises, while 379 premises were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. There were 17 cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with 22 in 1903, and eight in 1902, and these were all abated; four were insufficiently ventilated, 50 were found to be in a dirty condition, in one factory the sanitary conveniences were found to be insufficient, in one workshop unsuitable, in three there was not separate accommodation for the sexes, while in 23 they were defective. Out of the total number of inspections it was only necessary to serve 87 intimation and five statutory notices during the year, and I am also pleased to report that in not one case, as in 1903, was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings in any of these factories or workshops. 76 workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector, and nine were reported by the Inspector to this Council. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 157 TABLE LXI. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

The total number of lists received during the year was 36. These lists contained the addresses of 375 outworkers. Of these 249 were forwarded to other authorities and 96 addresses of outworkers working in this Borough for persons outside the Borough were received from other authorities. The following list gives the name of the district and the number of outworkers sent to each:—Battersea 61, Lambeth 55, Southwark 16, Stepney and Croydon 15 each, Camberwell 12, East Ham, Wimbledon and Bermondsey nine each, Fulham seven, Stoke Newington five, St. Pancras and Chelsea four each, Hammersmith, St. Marylebone and Ilford three each, Woodford, Enfield, Norwich, Surbiton, Willesden, Holborn, Hackney, Westminster and Bromley two each, and West Ham one, a total of 249. This number is a considerable increase compared with the year 1903, when it was only 89. 237 inspections were made of outworkers' premises, and 15 notices, 12 intimation and three statutory, were served. These notices were chiefly for cleansing and were complied with forthwith. During the year 12 cases of infectious diseases were notified from the houses of outworkers, six of Diphtheria, four of Chicken-pox, one of Scarlet Fever, and one of Erysipelas. It was not necessary during the year to serve any notices prohibiting homework, either in unwholesome or infected premises. Table LXIV. shows the nature of the work carried on in the homes of outworkers as well as the number of lists received, the number forwarded to other authorities, and the number received from other authorities. 162 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

I advised the Council to print a circular for distribution among those employers who were likely to employ outworkers. The following is a copy of the circular issued :— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. The Council calls the attention of Employers of Labour within the Borough to the following provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with respect to out-workers :— Section 107 (1). The occupier of every Factory and Workshop and every Contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the Factory or Workshop shall :— Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 163 (a) Keep in the prescribed form and manner, and with the prescribed particulars, lists showing the names and addresses of all persons directly employed by him, either as workman or as contractors, in the business of the factory or workshop, outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed ; and (c) Send on or before the first day of February and the first day of August in each year, copies of those lists to the district Council of the district in which the factory or workshop is situate. Section 107 (4). This section shall apply to any place from which any work is given out, and to the occupier of that place, and to every Contractor employed by any such occupier in connection with the said work, as if that place were a workshop. Section 107 (5). In the event of a contravention of this Section by the occupier of a factory, workshop, or place, or by a contractor, the occupier or contractor shall be liable to a Fine not exceeding Forty Shillings, and in the case of a second or subsequent offence, not exceeding Five Pounds. HENRY GEORGE HILLS, Town Clerk. Council House, Wandsworth, S.W., 3rd February, 1904. The whole of the work with regard to factories and workshops has been carried out very efficiently by the various inspectors, and the amount of work done has been most satisfactory. I am pleased to be able to report that the general condition of the factories and workshops in the Borough is very good, and that little difficulty has been experienced in having any necessary work carried out. The only matters requiring special notice are the provisions of water closet accommodation in small workshops and workplaces, and in a few instances the provision of separate accommodation for the sexes in small laundries. On the whole, however, satisfactory arrangements have been made in all these cases to comply with the Act. 164 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Canal Boats Act. During the year 35 inspections of Canal Boats were made, but it was only necessary to serve one intimation notice. The nuisance complained of was the foul and dirty condition of the cabin, and the notice was complied with forthwith. In three cases where foul cargoes were carried the Inspector reported that there was no double bulkhead. This fact was reported to the officials of the Port Sanitary Authority, and in one of the cases a double bulkhead was provided. The general condition of the canal boats inspected during the year was found to be fairly satisfactory. Statement of Work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. During the past year 750 samples of foods and drugs have been submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these, 85, or 1133 per cent., were reported to be adulterated, compared with 12.3 per cent. in the previous year. It may, therefore, be assumed that the standard of purity is increasing gradually. Taking into consideration, however, the class of trade which is carried on in this Borough, which is certainly of a somewhat higher grade than that of the average, this reduced percentage of adulteration must even now be considered a high one, but it is principally due, as in former years, to the high rate of adulteration which has been detected in the samples of milk submitted for analysis. During the period under review the percentage of milk samples taken which fell below the milk standard laid down by the Board of Agriculture was 15.3 per cent., compared with 17.2 in 1903. In 58 cases out of the 85 adulterated samples, proceedings were taken against the vendors, and in the other cases the Council, taking into consideration the circumstances of the purchase and the low percentage of adulteration, decided not to prosecute. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts was £73 135., and the costs recovered amounted to £38 8s. 6d., a total of £ll2 1s. 6d.

It would seem, therefore, that in the majority of cases the adulteration of milk takes place after its delivery to the small retailers. TABLE LXVIII. Premises. No. of Samples taken. No. Adulterated.

The adulteration of butter, as judged by the analyses, seems to have been practised to a much larger extent than during the previous year, for whereas the percentage in 1903 was 4.4, it rose to 7.2 during 1904. It is satisfactory to note, however, that the sophistication of 170 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Butter in this district is solely confined to the substitution of Margarine, and that in no sample submitted for analysis has there been found more than 16 per cent. of water, which is the maximum amount laid down in the Sale of Butter Regulations by the Board of Agriculture. Of the Grocery samples submitted only seven, or 7.7 per cent., were returned as adulterated, compared with 13.82 in the previous year. Five of the seven adulterated samples were of Coffee. Of the 20 samples of Drugs submitted for analysis not one was found to be below the standard of the British Pharmacopoeia. This is a decided improvement upon 1903, when the percentage of adulterated samples reached the comparatively high figure of in. During the year eight samples of meats have been purchased for analysis, viz.:—four of bacon and four of sausages. In every instance they were certified to contain boric acid, but with one exception (sausages containing 30 grains of boric acid per pound) the quantity was not considered to be enough to be injurious to health. The percentage of adulteration detected under the heading of Alcoholic Beverages, viz.:—25, does not actually represent the amount of adulteration carried on in the Borough. It should be borne in mind that only four samples were taken during the year, and of these one, of Brandy, was found to be adulterated to the extent of 10.8 degrees below the legal limit, and in which a conviction was obtained. In 1903 all the samples submitted were returned as genuine. The following Table shows the number of samples of Milk, Butter, Coffee, Other Groceries, Drugs, Alcoholic Beverages, Bread, and Cereals, and other samples taken and submitted for analysis, the number and percentage of adulterations detected in each class, and also the number of samples purchased by the Inspector himself and by deputies, with the respective adulterations.

The Inspector by this means endeavours to obtain samples as they would be ordinarily sold to customers. It is a matter of practical experience that without such aid the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts would practically become abortive, more particularly with regard to all samples other than milk. By careful perusal of the above Table this will become apparent, for whereas those samples purchased by deputy yielded a result of 12.2 per cent. of adulteration, those purchased by the Inspector himself yielded but 87 per cent., and in the latter case all the adulterated samples obtained by him were milk samples. The practice is still adopted of utilising a member of the disinfecting staff for this work, but with the steady increase in the number of samples taken annually it will ere long become necessary to have a man entirely employed for this purpose. Proceedings have also been instituted during the year against a milkseller for selling milk from a vehicle without having his name and address legibly inscribed thereon, in contravention of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, Section 9, and a conviction was obtained. 172 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In one case only during the year has any trouble arisen with regard to the vendor refusing to sell a sample when demanded by the Inspector. In this case proceedings were taken and a conviction obtained. The fine inflicted, however (five shillings), was by no means proportionate to the offence, with the result that at the time of writing the same defendant is under notice to appear at the Police Court to answer a summons for a similar offence. In this connection it may be noted that whereas the maximum penalty for selling an adulterated article is £100 and possibly imprisonment upon the third conviction, the'maximum fine which can be inflicted for refusing to sell to the Inspector upon demand is £10 only (42 and 43 Vict., C. 30, Section 4). A vendor, therefore, naturally prefers not to sell an adulterated article, but to incur the risk of the smaller penalty. I have also to report that in spite of the representations which have been made to the Home Office, not only by this Council but also by other authorities, respecting the inadequacy of the fines inflicted for offences under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, no improvement in this direction has taken place, and until the fines inflicted are made commensurate with the offence committed, it is certain that any efforts made to reduce the percentage of adulteration in this Borough will be futile. To the majority of vendors who adulterate the various articles from time to time detected a conviction at the hands of the Magistrate has very little moral effect unless accompanied by a substantial pecuniary loss, which then acts as a deterrent. I have also to report that no further increase has taken place during the year in the percentage of cases where advantage has been taken of Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, viz.:— "The special warranty defence." In this there always will remain a very real menace to the effective working of the Adulteration Acts which can only be remedied by the entire repeal of the legislation in this respect. Many firms do still avail themselves of this means of defence, and there is always the fear of its becoming a general practice, but it has not yet spread to the lower branches of the dairy trade to any large extent—at least so far as this Borough is concerned. One reason for this may be that the wholesale firms know full well the laxity of the law in this respect, and whilst taking every Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 173 advantage of it themselves will not give a warranty with consignments unless compelled for trade reasons to do so. The difficulties under which Borough Councils and their officers labour when "warranty" is pleaded can never be too often nor too strongly emphasised, and there seems to be great need of further combined efforts on the part of local authorities to endeavour to obtain the entire abolition of this means of defence, for without this being done the powers with which they are invested and the endeavours of their officers to obtain for the public a pure good supply will be in many instances rendered useless. The real difficulty which occurs in the administration of the Adulteration Acts in so far as milk is concerned is the fact that no distinctive marking is required for receptacles containing separated and skimmed milk. An ever-increasing number of vendors are vending both articles at one and the same time, and the practice of selling separated milk as pure new milk is still very prevalent. Both cans are carried upon one cart, and, of course, when a vendor is accosted by any stranger, who might possibly be the inspector's deputy, genuine milk is sold, whilst to ordinary customers he serves separated milk. The Corporation of the City of Chicago and their officials have had their eyes open for some time to this means of fraud, and they have consequently included in their local legislative act the following section:— "Any milk vendor who shall offer for sale any milk from which the cream or any part thereof shall have been taken, shall offer the same as skimmed milk and not otherwise, and no driver, servant, or agent of any such vendor, shall offer for sale, or sell, or deliver, any such milk from which the cream or any part thereof shall have been taken unless the can, vessel, package, or receptacle, shall be kept painted bright red, and shall have painted on two sides thereof in plain black letters not less than three inches in height and not less than six inches from the top of the said can the words ' skimmed milk,' and no skimmed milk shall be sold 174 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. containing less than 8 5 per cent. of total solids other than butter fat." The endeavours of local authorities might with considerable profit be directed to obtaining the inclusion of some such section in any future legislation dealing with the adulteration of food. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.

VI.—Alcoholic Beverages. In this division the following were examined:— Brandy 2 samples. Whiskey 1 ,, Gin 1 ,, 4 samples. Of the four samples examined in this division, one brandy was found to be diluted to the extent of 10.8 degrees below legal limit.
