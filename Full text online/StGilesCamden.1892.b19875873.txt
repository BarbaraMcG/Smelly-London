The Past Tear. The year 1892-1893, which has just closed, has been one of great anxiety to all sanitary authorities, in consequence of the fears that were entertained that cholera was likely to prove epidemic. It has also been a year of hard work to complete the machinery for giving effect to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and it has been a year of expectation in consequence of the promise contained in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of Parliament, that the long promised District Councils Bill would be at last introduced into the House of Commons. It is hoped in the subsequent pages of this report to give a satisfactory account of the work done in dealing with the ever-increasing duties cast on local authorities. 9 Ninety-one Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are the particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 19 Special 1 Total 20 Committee Meetings— Finance 21 Law and Parliamentary 5 Sanitary 17 Works 27 Special 1 Total — 71 Making in all a Total of 91 Changes in the Personnel of the Board. Mr. Wyatt Papworth, who had been a Member of the Board for many years, retired during the year under review. On receiving Mr. Wyatt Papworth's resignation, the Board passed the following resolution :— " That this Board has received with regret the information that Mr. Wyatt Papworth is no longer qualified to serve as a Member. The Board desire to express to Mr. Wyatt Papworth, upon his retirement, its sense of obligation to him for his devotion to its duties and the value of his great experience and utterances at their deliberations for the past ten years." Mr George Dibley resigned his seat on the 28th day of September, owing to his leaving the District. Mr. J. Carr, J.P., died on the 7th January, 1893. He had been several 10 years connected with the Board, and had for a long period been deeply interested in all branches of parochial work. Accounts. The accounts of the Board have been prepared in the usual form, and have been checked by the Board's chartered accountant and examined by the auditors, as will appear by their certificate on page 32. In order to afford information and to enable ratepayers to make a comparison, the following statement of income and expenditure for the years ending March 25, 1892, and March 25, 1893, has been prepared:— COMPARATIVE STATEMENT of INCOME and EXPENDITURE For the years ending 25th March, 1892, and 25th March, 1893.

During the year a very large amount of work has been done under this Act, full details of which will be found in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, but the following brief summary may be of interest : — 11,046 visits and inspections were made; 1,203 notices for the abatement of nuisances served; 39 cases occurred where proceedings were necessary; in every instance orders 12 were made by the Magistrates for the execution of the necessary works, and in some instances fines were imposed. The total amount of fines and costs recovered amounted to the sum of £39 13s. 9d. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. During the year 27 representations were received from the Medical Officer of Health with regard to houses unfit for human habitation. In 18 cases orders were obtained from the Police Magistrates, and the premises were closed. Several cases of persons occupying after notice of the closing order occurred, and in these cases summonses were issued and convictions obtained. In 7 cases, the necessary works having been performed, the closing orders were determined. Sanitary Work. A number of proceedings with reference to overcrowded dwellings, underground rooms, bakehouses, cowhouses, slaughter-houses, were taken, the details of which will be found on reference to the Medical Officer's Report. Lodging-house Regulations, 451 houses were, during the course of the year, under the scope of the regulations, made under section 36 of the Sanitary Act, 1866. These were regularly inspected. In 361 cases notices for the abatement of breaches of regulations were served, which were all complied with, excepting in 14 cases, in which proceedings were taken. In some of these fines were inflicted. The total amount of fines and costs recovered was £5 3s. 0d. 13 Parliamentary Schemes. A large number of Public Bills were examined, and various steps taken with regard to them. The Private Bills which engaged the attention of the Board were The Hampstead, St. Pancras and Charing Cross Railway Bill; The London Open Spaces Bill; The London Improvements Bill; and The Metropolitan Police Provisional Order Bill. The following brief particulars show the manner in which these Bills proposed to affect the District of the Board, and the steps taken in connection with them: — HAMPSTEAD, ST. PANCRAS AND CHARING CROSS RAILWAY BILL. This scheme for providing a railway from Hampstead to Charing Cross was referred to in the last Annual Report, and in consequence of the dissolution of Parliament was one of those measures in which further proceedings were suspended. During the session of 1893 the Bill has become law; the promoters having consented to insert clauses for the protection of the interests of the District, further opposition to the measure was obviated. THE LONDON OPEN SPACES BILL. This was a Bill proposing to compulsorily acquire the open space known as Lincoln's Inn Fields. The Board some time since, on consideration of the matter, came to the conclusion that having regard to the urgent necessity for a public open space in this central part of the Metropolis, they are strongly of opinion that powers should be conferred upon the London County Council for compulsorily acquiring, 14 regulating, and opening Lincoln's Inn Fields to the public. When, however, the Bill came to be considered, the Board felt that under the circumstances the matter was one which might be very well left with the Trustees of Lincoln's Inn Fields and the London County Council to deal with, and they therefore took no action on the measure. THE LONDON IMPROVEMENTS BILL. This Bill proposed to provide the long needed improvement of a new thoroughfare from High Holborn to the Strand, but the scheme was hampered with several conditions which rendered it necessary, in order to duly secure the interests of the District, that a Petition should be presented against the same. Ultimately, and before the Bill came before the Select Committee, the London County Council determined to strike out those portions of the Bill which related to the proposed new thoroughfare. This question is referred to later on, and nothing need therefore be said further in the matter at this stage. THE METROPOLITAN POLICE PROVISIONAL ORDER BILL. This Bill was introduced for the purpose of confirming a Provisional Order made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, enabling the Receiver of Police to compulsorily acquire certain property in Clarke's Buildings for the erection of Police barracks. In order to secure certain objects which the Board had in view, a Petition was presented against the measure. In the next Report the result of the opposition will be referred to. 15 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the year 220 samples have been purchased and analysed under these Acts, consisting of milk, butter, pepper, whisky, gin, rum, brandy and cheese. In 40 cases the samples proved to be adulterated. In 27 cases the adulteration was not, however, of so serious a character as to necessitate the taking of proceedings, but in all the other cases proceedings were taken; the fines and costs inflicted amounted to the sum of £16 2s. Proceedings were also taken for refusal to sell, and for giving false warranties. The Board and the Press. During the year it was decided to admit the representatives of the Press at the meetings of the Board, and the necessary alterations have been made in the Bye-laws, and the required accommodation provided:— the representatives of the Press have since been regularly admitted.

Lloyds Court. Feathers Court. Nottingham Court. Lascelles Court. Princes Court. Lascelles Place. Shelton Street. Little Turnstile. Twyford Buildings. Street Cleansing. The scavenging of the District was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, numbering 38 men (consisting of 1 foreman, 5 gangers, and 32 sweepers) and 28 boys, the total scavenging staff amounting to 66 men and boys. In addition to the manual labour, two sweeping machines, drawn by horses,were also used in sweeping the carriage-ways As an experiment two hand trucks for collecting horse droppings were obtained in the early part of the year ; they have been found exceedingly useful, and an additional number might with advantage be employed. 38 The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 6,291 van loads, equal to over 18,000 cubic yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares that are paved with wood and asphalte were washed frequently during the year by means of watering-carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. The market streets in the District and the streets inhabited by the poorer classes, of which the following is a list, were cleansed on Sundays between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m., those streets in the list marked with an asterisk being cleansed a second time between 12 noon and 2.30 p.m. After the second cleansing the streets were watered with a solution of permanganate of potash:- Abbey Place. *Little Earl Street. Arthur Street. * Little White Lion Street. Bainbridge Street. *Little Wild Street. Castle Street. *Lloyds Court. Colonnade. *Lumber Court. Kenton Street. *Maeklin Street. Little Coram Street.

Dyott Street. *Seven Dials. *Goldsmith Street. *Shorts Gardens. *Great Earl Street. *Smarts Buildings. *Great Wild Street. Stacey Street. *Tower Street. The following thoroughfares were also cleansed on Sundays between 6 and 10 a.m., viz.:- Bloomsbury Square (south side). Great Queen Street. Bury Street. Great Saint Andrew Street. Charing Cross Road. Hart Street. Endell Street. High Holborn. 39 High Street. New Oxford Street. Kingsgate Street. Shaftesbury Avenue. Little Queen Street. Southampton Row. Little Saint Andrew Street. Theobald's Road. New Compton Street. Tottenham Court Road. Vernon Place. The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. Removal of Snow. Snow fell on several occasions during the month of January of the present year, necessitating the employment of additional labour to deal with it. The bulk of the snow was disposed of by cartage to the Thames Embankment, whence it was thrown into the River Thames. A considerable quantity of the snow was flushed down the gullies into the sewers by the application of water obtained from the New River Company's mains. Street-orderly Bins, &c. New Street-orderly Bins have been erected during the year as follows, viz. :— Marchmont Street 2 Kenton Street 2 Russell Square 1 The total number of bins now in the District is 45. Since my last report further bins have been erected for storing shell ballast for strewing upon the asphalte and wood pavements, when their condition render it desirable, viz.:- 40 In New Oxford Street, by Hyde Street. „ Store Street, by South Crescent. On Refuge, south-east corner Bussell Square. In Guilford Street, by Russell Square. „ Southampton Row, by Bloomsbury Place. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1892-93 was as follows:- £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 3,138 14 4 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, Ac., and clothing for men and boys 768 6 10 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street-sweeping machines 3,572 0 7 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, &c. 251 11 8 Water-van hire for flushing gullies 66 6 6 Eemoval of manure 5 1 6 Total £7,802 1 6 Street Watering. The watering of the public ways was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the District which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used (including that used for washing the streets) amounted to 5,066,000 gallons. During the hot summer months a small quantity of permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering-carts. 41 £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 228 2 3 To contractors for horses, carts, and men 1025 16 6 For permanganate of potash 28 0 0 Total £1,281 18 9 Removal of Dust, The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,368.

In October last an arrangement was come to between the Board and the Foundling Hospital by which the Foundling Hospital granted the Board a piece of land in the Colonnade, adjoining the "Friend in Hand" publichouse, fur the purpose of erecting a new urinal in lieu of the existing one. The new urinal accommodates 6 persons, the fittings to the same being supplied and fixed by Mr. G. Jennings, of Lambeth ; the total cost was £113. The urinals at present in the District number 14, containing 51 compartments; 12 have water laid on to them, the others are without water supply. LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS in THE ST. GILES DISTRICT.

There are also 64 lamps of larger size at the corners of certain streets and on the 43 crossing refuges, making a total of 1,133 public lamps in the District, belonging to the Board. As in previous years, the lamps in the main public ways within the District were lighted during dark and foggy days at the cost of £14 12s. 1 d. for the year. Street "Refuges. A new street-crossing refuge was formed during the year at the south-east corner of Russell Square.

The matter was referred to your Works Committee, who after lengthy consideration of the matter and examination into several designs and estimates which were prepared by your Surveyor, ultimately recommended the demolition of the stables adjoining the Surveyor's Department, the erection of a new office on the site thereof, the erection of two new offices on portion of the vacant land at the rear of 198, High Holborn, abutting on Green Dragon Yard, the building of new stables at the southern end of the Board's stone yard, with rooms for the storage of plant, tools, and materials over the stables and the shed and office adjoining. This recommendation of your Committee was, after considerable discussion, adopted by you, and a Contract for the work was entered into by Messrs. Parkinson & Son, of 27, Southampton Bow, the work being completed and possession of the new offices and buildings taken on 1st January, 1893. The total cost of the work was £1489 6s. l1d. Miscellaneous. The premises Nos. 9 and 11 Macklin Street being pulled down, negotiations were entered into with Messrs. Pfeil & Stedall, the owners, with the view of setting back the frontage line to the line of their premises adjoining. Messrs. Pfeil & Stedall ultimately agreed to set back their frontage in the manner desired by the Board, which enabled the 45 carriage-way to be widened so as to allow of two vehicles passing at the spot. The public ways of Brewer Street and the eastern end of Shelton Street have been closed under order of the Justices of the Peace on the application of Messrs. Eyre & Spottiswoode, to whom the land has been given up. The London Hydraulic Power Company, with the permission of your Board, laid further lines of mains in Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road. Disinfecting Apparatus. The disinfecting apparatus which was erected by Messrs. Fraser & Co in the year 1870, and consisted of a large chamber into which clothes requiring disinfection were wheeled in an iron truck, the disinfection being effected by hot air and the fumes of sulphur, produced in a furnace beneath the chamber, having become worn out and beyond repair, the question of its reconstruction or the adoption of some other process of disinfection was referred by your Board to its Sanitary Committee. After giving very lengthy consideration to the subject and inspecting two apparatus, one patented by Mr. Washington Lyon and the other by Messrs. Gordon & Massey, in both of which the process of disinfection was somewhat similar, being effected by super-heated steam, your Committee ultimately selected that of Washington Lyon, and a Contract was entered into with Messrs. Manlove, Alliott, & Co., its manufacturers, for the erection of the apparatus on the site of the old one which was removed. The work was completed and the disinfector put into operation in the month of July last. It has 46 been much used since then, and appears to answer its purpose well. The cost of the disinfector was £362. Contracts. The following Contracts for materials and works have been entered into by the Board, and are now in force:- Name and Address of the Contractor.

I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. WALLACE, Engineer and Surveyor. 48 The College of State Medicine, London, 101, Great Russell Street, W.C., May 5, 1893. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, During the period extending from the 10th of May, 1892, to the 25th of March, 1893, I received from your Inspectors, Messrs. W. H. Bond and J. Robinson, 220 samples for analysis, viz., 110 samples from each Inspector. These samples consisted of 144 of milk, 16 of butter, 16 of pepper, 17 of whisky, 6 of gin, 6 of rum, 3 of brandy, and 12 of cheese. Of the 144 samples of milk 21 were of poor quality, 1 was adulterated with 4 per cent., 1 with 7 per cent., 4 with 10 per cent., 1 with 27 per cent., and 1 with 45 per cent. of added water, whilst 1 sample had been deprived of 25 per cent. of the milk fat. Four of the 16 samples of butter were found to be adulterated with 80 per cent. of foreign fat. Of the 17 samples of whisky five fell below the standard spirit strength of 25 degrees under proof, 3 samples being 27.0 degrees under proof, one 32 degrees under proof, and one 39 degrees under proof. One of the 6 samples of rum was unduly diluted with water, its spirit strength being 28.5 degrees under proof. The samples of pepper, gin, brandy, and cheese were found to be not adulterated. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAS. KEAR COLWELL. 49 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. CONTENTS.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the Annual Report on the Vital Statistics, and the conditions affecting the health of the District for the registration year ending December 31st, 1892. Vital Statistics. The District of St. Giles, comprising the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, has an area of 245 statute acres. It forms one of the central groups of districts in the Metropolis, and for civil registration purposes is divided into three sub-districts:—St. George, Bloomsbury, the parish ; St. Giles, South, that part of St. Giles-in-the-Fields to the south of a line along the middle of High Holborn and Broad Street, and to the east of a line along the middle of Great and Little St. Andrew Street; St. Giles, North, the part of the parish not comprised in the foregoing. The average elevation is very favourable, being 68 feet above Trinity high-water mark. The population, according to the preliminary report of the Census 1891, was— St. George, Bloomsbury 16,695 St. Giles-in-the-Fields, North 9,633 „ „ South 13,450 23,083 Total Inhabitants 39,778 E 2 52 The number of Inhabited Houses 4,068 Density of Population 9.7 *Number of Persons to an acre 162 Marriages and Marriage-rate. 1892.

St. Giles District 39,778 357 179 15.0 During the year 1892 the marriages of 714 persons were registered in St. Giles District, giving an annual rate of 17.9 per 1,000 of the estimated population, this rate, though above the average, is slightly below that of the preceding year. The number of marriages which took place at the several buildings licensed for the purpose is set forth as follows:— Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages Parish Church, St. Giles-in-the-Fields Established Church. 84 Parish Church, St. George, Bloomsbury ditto 102 Holy Trinity Church, Little Queen Street ditto 22 Christ Church, Woburn Square. ditto 18 Sardinia Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 32 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 9 Little Wild Street Chapel. ditto - Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street ditto 2 Keppel Street Chapel ditto 1 Soho Chapel, Shaftesbury Avenue ditto 1 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan 7 Église Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church 5 Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Unitarian 5 Superintendent-Registrar's Office, Broad Street 69 Total number of marriages 357 * In Registration London, 57.1 persons to an acre. 53 It will be seen from this table that 226 of the marriages were celebrated at the parish churches, 64 at the several chapels, and 69 were united by civil contract at the Superintendent-Registrar's Office. In London the marriages in the year numbered 37,175, and the proportion of persons married to the total population was 17'4 per 1,000. In England and Wales the marriages of 453,844 persons were registered, corresponding to an annual rate of 15.3 per 1,000. Births and Birth-rate. Registbation Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1891).

The parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, shows a slightly lower rate than in 1891, whilst the rate for the whole 54 parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, 34.7 per 1,000, corresponds to the rate of last year. The birth-rate of St Giles-in-the-Fields, 15.1 per 1,000 higher than the rate for St. George, Bloomsbury, may again be accounted for by the number of births registered in South St. Giles from the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, and the Peabody Buildings, Great Wild Street, where in this block alone the birth-rate for the past year was as high as 39.5 per 1,000. The total registered births were 210 in excess of the registered (corrected) deaths. In Registration London there were 131,535 births, corresponding to an annual birth-rate of 30.9 per 1,000. The Registrar-General states, "that this is the lowest birthrate as yet recorded in London, with the single exception of the year 1890, when the rate was only 30.7." The natural excess of births over deaths was 43.786. In England and Wales 897,270 births were registered, the natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 338,180 against an average increase in the previous five years of 345,196. The birth-rate was 30.5 per 1,000 living, a rate lower than that recorded in any previous year excepting 1890, and 1.7 per 1,000 below the mean rate in the ten years 1882-91. 55 Deaths and Death-rate.

Again corrections have to be made to the registered deaths in order to obtain a true death-rate; for this purpose the deaths of 51 non-parishioners, which took place at the Workhouse, Endell Street, and the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, must be deducted, and the deaths* of 253 parishioners, which occurred in the General Hospitals, * The eaths of parishioners in Hospitals, &c., are set forth in Table XII., Appendix. 56 Lunatic Asylums, and other Public Institutions situated outside the District, must be added. These corrections increase the total number of deaths to 919, and are set forth in the table above, where it will be seen that there was one death in every 43.2 of the population. The death-rate for St. Giles District was equal to 23.1 per 1,000, being 4.3 per 1,000 lower than the rate for the preceding year, and 0.1 lower than the rate for the ten years. The death-rate of the parish of St George, Bloomsbury, 16.7 per 1,000, was 10.9 per 1,000 lower than that of St. Giles-in-the-Fields; but in comparing the differences of the death-rates in the two parishes it must not be forgotten that the birth-rate of St. Giles parish was 15.0 per 1,000 in excess of that of Bloomsbury. The death-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, though as high as 27.6 per 1,000, shows a considerable reduction upon that for the year 1891, when it was as high as 33.9 per 1,000. In London there were 87,749 deaths, equal to a deathrate of 20.6 per 1,000, a rate 1.2 lower than the one recorded for the previous year. The rates for the three successive years have been raised considerably by the outbreaks of influenza.* In England and Wales there were 559,090 deaths, corresponding to an annual death-rate of 19.0 per 1,000, and 0.3 per 1,000 below the mean rate of the ten years 1882-91. * The total deaths ascribed to influenza in the three years being 5252, whereas in the ten preceding years it had been only 63 (Registrar-General). 57 Infantile Mortality. There were 298 deaths of children under 5 years of age, of these 180 were infants under 1 year. The deaths of infants under 1 were equal to 15.9 per 1,000 of registered births, and the number of deaths of children under 5 was equal to 32.4 per 1,000 of total deaths. The diseases which caused the greatest fatalities amongst children were Measles 44, Lung diseases 72, and Premature Birth, Debility and Convulsions 93. There were 5 children accidentally suffocated in bed with their parents. Senile Mortality. 273 deaths occurred at the following advanced ages:— Between 60 and 70 years. Between 70 and 80 years. Between 80 and 90 years. At 90 years. At 92 years. At 93 years. At 94 years. At 99 years. Total. 142 95 31 1 1 1 1 1 273 These deaths were equivalent to 29.7 per cent. of total deaths. Only 48 of the deaths were certified from "old age," the others principally occurred from diseases of the heart and lungs. 58 Inquests. Causes of Death.

In England and Wales the proportion of inquest cases was somewhat higher than in 1891. The Public Mortuary, Goldsmith Street. During 1892 there were 56 bodies received at the Mortuary—40 by order of the Coroner. 15 at the request of friends of the deceased, and 1 was brought in by the Police. The Coroner ordered post-mortem examinations in 31 of the cases. 2 of the deaths were from infectious diseases, and the bodies were placed in the chamber set apart for the purpose. 2 of the bodies were those of non-parishioners, upon whom inquests were held for the convenience of the Coroner. Uncertified Deaths. There were only 2 deaths returned as not having been certified by a registered medical practitioner or by the Coroner; these 2 cases were twin children born prematurely, and whose mother was attended by a midwife. The uncertified death-rate in St. Giles District was equal to 0.2 per cent. of total deaths. In England and Wales, in the 15,101 cases, or 2.7 per cent. of the total, the proportion remained stationary. 60 Deaths in Public Institutions. (Within the District.) The Workhouse, Endell Street. The average number of inmates in the Workhouse during 1892 was 612. The number of deaths was 98, including 15 nonparishioners. To these must be added 75 deaths at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum, giving a total of 173 deaths, and corresponding to an annual death-rate of 28.2 per 1,000, and no less than 15.7 per 1,000 lower than the rate of the preceding year. The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. There were 39 deaths from all causes, 35 were deaths of non-parishioners admitted into the hospital for treatment from various outlying parishes in the Metropolis; 29 of the deaths occurred at 25 years of age and upwards, and of these 17 resulted from diseases of the lungs and air passages. The cases of small-pox which were notified from the hospital will be mentioned under the heading Small-pox — Zymotic diseases. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. During the year 153 poor women were delivered in the hospital without any fatality occurring to them. The total number of children delivered was 153, of whom 1 died from deformity, 4 were still-born, and 6 were found to have been dead before delivery. 61 The Medical Officers report "that the sanitary condition of the hospital is still in the same satisfactory state that it has been during the last ten years; this means that there has been an absence of puerperal fever in the wards during the whole of that period." "In the out-patient department of the hospital 435 women have been delivered, but in no instance has a mother lost her life."

Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases. The seven principal zymotic diseases are small-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, fever (includes enteric or typhoid, typhus, simple continued, and relapsing forms of fever) and diarrhoea (includes cholera). These diseases are considered to be more or less of a preventable character. 69 The deaths registered from them in all London during 1892 numbered 11,983, corresponding to a zymotic deathrate of 2.7 per 1,000, and 0'5 higher than the rate for 1891. In England and Wales there were 426 deaths from smallpox, 13,167 from measles, 5,524 from scarlet fever, 5,783 from diphtheria, 12,639 from whooping-cough, 4,202 from fever, and 14,291 from diarrhoea. These 56,032 deaths correspond to an annual zymotic death-rate of 1.9 per 1,000, against 2.2, 2.1, and 1.90 in the three preceding years. The deaths from the same class of diseases in St. Giles District were 104, equivalent to a rate of 2.6 per 1.000, and 0.3 lower than the rate of the preceding year. MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—Small-Pox. (Decennial average, 4.1.) At the last epidemic of small-pox which attacked the Metropolis in 1884-85, no less than 181 cases, of which 37 were fatal, were recorded in St. Giles; since that date, with the exception of one doubtful case in 1887 and one in 1891, the District was practically free from the disease until February, 1892, when it reappeared and continued until August. During that time the following seven cases, all of which recovered, were notified, viz.:— First Case.—A male, œt. 27 years, tin-plate worker, residing at No. 13, Lascelles Place. No information could be obtained where this man caught the disease; it was stated that he had never been vaccinated, and that the factory where he worked was free from illness. 70 Second Case.—The Resident Medical Officer at the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, aged 28 years, who had been vaccinated in, childhood at the Mauritius, caught the infection from a non-parishioner attending the hospital as an out-patient. I was informed the premonitory symptoms in this case resembled an attack of influenza. Third Case.—A male, cet. 19 years, a West-End tailor's porter, residing at No. 50, Neal Street. The only information to be obtained about this patient was that he had been vaccinated in infancy. Fourth Case.—A female, cet. 25 years, a non-parishioner, residing at Harley House, Marylebone Road, sought medical advice at the French Hospital, where it was discovered she was suffering from small-pox. The hospital authorities detained and isolated her previous to removal to the hospital ship. Fifth Case.—A male, cet. 49 years, foreign restaurant waiter, a non-parishioner belonging to St. Pancras, was admitted at the beginning of March into the French Hospital with gastric disturbance; at the end of the month, upon the small-pox rash appearing, he was removed to the Asylums Board Hospital. Sixth Case.—A female, cet. 15 years, residing at No. 12, New Compton Street, contracted her illness whilst nursing a child who was suffering from small-pox in a neighbouring parish. Seventh Case.—A female, œt. 17 years, residing at No. 8, Alfred Place, caught the disease from visiting her sick aunt, who belonged to St. Pancras. It is needless to state that measures were taken in every case to arrest the spread of the disease; the patients were 71 promptly removed to hospital, their bedding, clothing, &c., properly disinfected, and re-vaccination urged upon the inmates of the infected houses. The authorities of the French Hospital were particularly active; the institution was closed for 14 days, the visits of outsiders discontinued, and the in-patients, with the entire staff, were re-vaccinated. The probable origin of the outbreak.—It is suspected that active infection of the disease was being carried out by a number of foreign restaurant waiters, who probably imported the disease from Switzerland, where it was prevalent at this time, and certainly one of the out-patients at the French Hospital was a waiter belonging to a foreign servants' club in the neighbourhood of St. Pancras, where several suspicious cases of illness had occurred during the previous two months. 2.—Measles. (Decennial average, 30.4.) The heaviest fatality from this disease was during the first quarter of the year, when 47 children died from it. As measles is a disease, from its prevalence and the mortality from it, far greater than that of scarlet fever, it should be reported to the Local Sanitary Authority as a notifiable disease. Your Board at my suggestion asked the approval of the Local Government Board for its inclusion amongst the notifiable infectious diseases, but a reply "Was received intimating that pending the completion of inquiries which are now being made the Local Government Board has deferred further consideration of the resolution for the present. 72 One of the arguments used against notification is, that there is no hospital accommodation for the patients, but this does not apply, as removal is unnecessary in the majority of the cases. Notification would enable sanitary authorities and teachers to take preventive measures to check its spread. Notification would cause medical aid to be sought for, whereby many lives might be preserved which are now lost through neglect. 3.—Scarlet Fever. (Decennial average, 9 0.) 186 certificates, of which 23 were duplicates, were received from medical practitioners under the Notification Act. Of these 3 cases were fatal. 98 of the cases were removed for isolation and treatment, the majority being sent to the hospitals of the Asylums Board. Scarlet fever with only 3 deaths is notifiable; measles with 47 deaths is not. 4.—Diphtheria. (Decennial average, 14.3.) 58 notification certificates of diphtheria were received, being double of the number sent in the previous year. The 17 deaths—nearly all children—were also in excess of last year's mortality, and that for the ten years average. 37 of the patients were removed for hospital treatment. There can be but little doubt that there is a great increase of diphtheria sickness and mortality throughout the country. 73 As regards the causation of diphtheria, Dr. R. Thorne Thorne, C.B., the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, in his lectures delivered before the Royal College of Physicians of London, regards "broad geological features as of little moment; but dampness and pollution of soil and exposure to cold wet winds are conditions frequently met with in connection with diphtheria outbreaks." In regard to the important question of school infection, Dr. Thorne Thorne is in accord with other observers "in regarding the aggregation of children at school as the most constant of the conditions under which ordinary diphtheria arises out of the prevalence of indefinite sore throats which so generally precede and accompany its outbreaks." 5. —Whooping-cough. (Decennial average, 24.3.) The 11 infantile deaths ascribed to this disease were considerably below the average, and call for no special comment. 6.—Fever. (Decennial average, 11.4.) Fever includes typhus, enteric fever, and simple or illdefined forms of continued fever. 26 notifications were received, all of which referred to enteric fever. 6 of the cases were removed to hospital. The 9 deaths in 1892 again showed a declining fatality. The total number of fever patients removed from the various Metropolitan parishes by the ambulances of the Metropolitan Asylums Board during the year was 16,118. The removals of small-pox patients numbered 306. Aggregate 74 removals from the several Metropolitan Districts during the year, including the transfer of patients from one hospital to another, numbered 32,033. DIARRHEAL ORDER. 7.—Diarrhoea. (Decennial average, 27'8.) 14 of the 17 deaths attributed to diarrhoea were deaths of young children, and nearly all under 1 year of age. The low mortality, considerably below the average, was due to the favourable character of the summer and autumn months. Cholera. In consequence of a severe outbreak of Asiatic cholera in August at Hamburg and other Continental cities, and the large traffic between their ports and the ports of this country, notably the Port of London, a circular letter dated 25th August was received from the Local Government Board, "drawing the attention of the Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolis to the necessity of taking into consideration the question of precautionary measures which should be adopted in the event of the introduction of the disease into London." Upon receipt of this communication your Sanitary Committee specially met and made the following arrangements for dealing with a possible outbreak of the disease in the district:— 1.—Hospital Accommodation. As it was considered extremely desirable that the Board should be in a position to have cholera patients removed to 75 the shortest possible distance for treatment, letters were sent to the authorities of the neighbouring hospitals asking whether in the event of cholera breaking out in the Metropolis they would be prepared to place any, and if so, what number, of beds at the exclusive disposal of your Board, and upon what terms. In reply, the managers of the French and Charing Cross Hospitals at once intimated their willingness to place a certain number of beds at your disposal. But this accommodation which the hospital authorities offered had to be declined in consequence of a communication received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board dated 29th August, which stated " that the managers had placed themselves in communication with the authorities of hospitals, infirmaries, &c., in London, with a view of ascertaining what accommodation could be placed at the disposal of the managers for cholera patients in the event of necessity arising, and urging that to avoid any overlapping of operation by the two authorities, the provision of hospital accommodation should be left in the hands of the managers of the asylums." This arrangement, the same as in 1885, constituted the managers a first line of defence for immediate action on the appearance of cholera. In addition to the accommodation thus provided by the Asylums Board, and it being highly desirable that hospital accommodation should be provided in as close proximity as possible to the place where the disease was likely to break out, inquiries were made for utilising one of the common lodging-houses in the District as a hospital for the treatment of patients in the event of the necessity arising. 76 2.—Provision of Refuges. For this purpose the premises No. 198, High Holborn, the property of your Board, were prepared and rendered suitable for the reception of persons not actually sick, but members of any family in which the disease had appeared, and who had been compelled to leave their dwellings to be disinfected, or during the sickness of any person who could not be removed. In addition, necessary arrangements were made for utilising one or more of the common lodging-houses in the district for similar places of refuge. 3.—Disinfection and Destruction of Bedding, Clothing, Sc. The arrangements for the disinfection of clothing, &c., entailed but little trouble, having regard to the fact that the Washington Lyon's new improved disinfecting apparatus had been just completed for use. With regard to the destruction of infected bedding, &c., arrangement was made with Mr. Cookson, the Board's contractor, for the removal in covered vans, and the destruction by burning in the destructor at his wharf on the Albert Embankment, of any infected articles which might require to be so dealt with. 4.—Ambulances for the Removal of Patients. The Asylums Board forwarded a statement showing where ambulances for the removal of patients were provided,* the one most convenient for this district being that situate at the Western Fever Hospital in Seagrave Road, Fulbam, S.W. * The Metropolitan Asylums Board have (at this date) suggested a list of places, within and adjacent to the District, suitable for the purposes of Cholera Litter Stations. 77 This would not suffice for the removal of patients to short distances, and hand litters would have to be provided in convenient near places for the purpose. 5.—Removal and Interment of the Dead. For this purpose communications were entered into with Messrs. Perrvman & Co., undertakers, of Little Queen Street, and the London Necropolis National Mausoleum Company, Limited, of No. 2, Lancaster Place, Strand, with a view of ascertaining on what terms they would be prepared to enter into a contract with the Board for the speedy removal and burial of bodies of persons dying of cholera. 1. Messrs. Perryman & Co. contracted to provide a sound one inch elm coffin, smoothed or covered with black baize and finished with black nails, and three pairs of handles, and inscription plate, the inside well pitched and lined with calico, a stuffed mattress and pillow and cambric ruffle, and slips, winding sheet, and men with the same to remove the body of any person of the age of 5 years and upwards from any part of the joint parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, to the Mortuary in Goldsmith Street (if complete in one journey) for the sum of £1 10s. 2. Conveying each body as above in a hearse with coachman and bearers from the Mortuary to the Great Northern Cemetery, New Southgate, for burial, for the sum of £2 8s. 3. Providing a similar coffin to above and removing the body of any child under the age of 5 years for the sum of £1. 4. For the burial of children as above the sum of £1 12s. 78 In addition to the above there will be the cemetery charge for the grave, which now is for persons of 10 years of age and upwards, 13s.; children under 10 years of age, 9s. The London Necropolis National Mausoleum Company will undertake to supply the coffins and remove the bodies with all convenient dispatch, and bury each in a separate grave, having previously exercised the following precautions, namely, the shroud to be soaked in carbolic acid, and a canister of carbolic powder to be sprinkled over the body, for the sum of £1 10s. for each child and £2 for each adult, and in each case one mourner's fare to be included. 6.—Provision of Medical Visitors. The District was to be mapped out into convenient places, and a sufficient number of Medical Practitioners appointed for the visitation of the poorer houses, and for the detection and treatment of cholera and diarrhoea cases. 7.—Nurses for the Siclc. The Metropolitan and National Nursing Association, of No. 23, Bloomsbury Square, kindly placed at my disposal 5 or 6 nurses, should their services be required. 8.—Supply of Medicines. 3 Chemists, residents in the District, agreed to dispense prescriptions and to supply medicines during all hours of the day and night at a reasonable charge.- 9.—General Sanitary Work. A temporary Sanitary Inspector was engaged specially to examine the water-closets, cisterns, and ash-bins throughout the District. 79 Your Surveyor's suggestions were adopted, viz., the using of disinfectants in watering the streets, and additional flushing of the surfaces of courts and alleys and the sewers, and the more frequent emptying of the street gullies. The following general sanitary notice and precautions suggested for dealing with cases of sickness was prepared by your officers, and after receiving the approval of your Sanitary Committee, was printed, and copies circulated throughout the District:— IMPORTANT. THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Offices 197, HIGH HOLBORN. GENERAL SANITARY NOTICE. In view of the possibility of Cholera visiting this country, the attention of the public is requested to the following general Sanitarynotice, issued with the view of preventing the spread of infectious diseases generally. All walls, passages, and ceilings of tenements should be washed, lime-whited, distempered, or painted, as the case may require. Ventilation. Every room in the house should be well ventilated by opening the upper parts of the windows as frequently as practicable. Accumulation of dirt and rubbish in cellars, basements, or elsewhere, should be removed as soon as possible. Bust Bins should be kept covered and in good repair, emptied weekly, and afterwards disinfected. All animal and vegetable refuse should be burnt at once, and not be put into the dust-bins ; the decay of such refuse matters especially in hot weather, causes offensive smells dangerous to health. Water cisterns and butts should be properly covered to exclude dirt, and cleansed at least once a month. The waste pipe, if connected with the drain or soil pipe, should be at once disconnected. Water Closets. The flushing apparatus should be kept in good working order, and the closets should be flushed whenever used, and kept ventilated by open windows. There should be a separate water supply to that used for drinking purposes, and the soil pipe should be ventilated by means of a pipe carried up to the roof of the house. 80 Overcrowding of rooms and premises is strictly prohibited by Law. 400 cubic feet of space should be allowed for each person. House Drains must be ventilated and made in strict conformity with the regulations of this Board, copies of which can be obtained at the Board's offices. Waste -pipes from Baths and Sinlcs should not be directly connected with drains. Precautions Suggested for dealing with cases of sickness, diarrhcei, and summer bowel-complaint. Avoid over-fatigue and sudden checks to perspiration, such as are occasioned by getting very hot and then sitting in draughts of air. Avoid foul smells from sinks, water-closets, drains, dust-bins, and the like. Avoid unripe or stale fruits and vegetables, tainted meat and fish, and excess in alcoholic drinks. All drinking water should be boiled. Filters if used should be cleansed weekly. All milk should be boiled before being used. In Case of Illness. Whenever diarrhoea attacks any member of the family medical aid should be obtained as soon as possible. The sick person should be isolated as much as possible. The room occupied should be well ventilated, and all discharges and evacuations immediately disinfected with chloride of lime and removed. The bed clothes and body linen should be disinfected and boiled, and all soiled and infected rags burnt immediately. The sinks and waterclosets should be flushed and disinfected with chloride of lime or carbolic acid daily. Night Stools whenever used should be thoroughly disinfected and quickly emptied. After the recovery, removal to hospital, or death of the patient, the rooms, clothing, &c., should be disinfected. The Board having provided a disinfecting apparatus at its offices, disinfect articles FREE OF COST. Should the illness end fatally the body should be removed without delay to the Public Mortuary in Goldsmith Street, Newton Street, High Holborn, W.C. No charge is made for the use of this building. 81 Medical men, clergymen, and others are earnestly requested to give immediate information of cases of infectious disease to the Sanitary Department, at the Board's Offices, No. 197, High Holborn, W.C. All inquiries and complaints as to drains, sewers, nuisances, removal of dust, &c., should be made at the offices of the Board, between the hours of 9.30 and 5.30. By order of the Board, HENRY C. JONES, September, 1892. Clerk to the Board. The following circulars were issued by the Local Government Board.— PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE INFECTION OF CHOLERA. 1. The Order of the Local Government Board, of 28th August, 1890, now in force, gives certain special powers to Port and Riparian Sanitary Authorities, enabling them to deal with any cases of cholera brought into their districts, so as to prevent as far as possible the spread of the disease into the country. But it is to be remembered that cases of choleraic infection differ widely in severity, and that persons suffering only slightly from the disease, or incubating it, are likely to be landed at English sea-board and riparian towns, and to make their way to inland places. This has, in fact, occurred in former epidemics. 2. Former experience of cholera in England justifies a belief that the presence of imported cases of the disease at various spots in the country will not be capable of causing much injury to the population, if the places receiving the infection have had the advantage of proper sanitary administration ; and, in order that all local populations may make their self-defence as effective as they can, it will be well for them to have regard to the present state of knowledge concerning the mode in which epidemics of cholera (at least in this country; are produced. 3. Cholera in England shows itself so little contagious, in the sense in which small-pox and scarlatina are commonly called contagious, that, if reasonable care be taken where it is present, there is almost no risk that the disease will spread to persons who nurse and otherwise closely attend upon the sick. But cholera has a certain peculiar infectiveness of its own, which, where local conditions assist, can operate with terrible force, and at considerable distances from the sick. It is characteristic of cholera (and as much so of the slight cases where diarrhoea is the only symptom as of the disease in its G 82 more developed and alarming forms) that the matters which the patient discharges from his stomach and bowels are infective. Probably, under ordinary circumstances, the patient has no power of infecting other persons except by means of these discharges; nor any power of infecting even by them except in so far as these matters are enabled to taint the food, water, or air which people consume. Thus, when a case of cholera is imported into any place, the disease is not likely to spread, unless in proportion as it finds, locally open to it, certain facilities for spreading by indirect infection. 4. In order rightly to appreciate what these facilities must be, the following considerations have to be borne in mind:—first, that any choleraic discharge, cast without previous thorough disinfection into any cesspool or drain, or other depository or conduit of filth, is able to infect the excremental matters with which it there mingles, and probably, more or less, the effluvia which those matters evolve; secondly, that the infective power of choleraic discharges attaches to whatever bedding, clothing, towels and like things have been imbued with them, and renders these things, if not thoroughly disinfected, capable of spreading the disease in places to which they are sent for washing or other purposes; thirdly, that if, by leakage or soakage from cesspools or drains, or through reckless casting out of slops and waste water, any taint (however small) of the infective material gets access to wells or other sources of drinking-water, it can impart to enormous volumes of water the power of propagating the disease. When due regard is had to these possibilities of indirect infection, there will be no difficulty in understanding that even a single case of cholera, perhaps of the slightest degree, and perhaps quite unsuspected in its neighbourhood, may, if local circumstances cooperate, exert a terribly infective power on considerable masses of population. 5. The dangers which have to be guarded against as favouring the spread of cholera-infection are particularly two. First, and above all, there is the danger of water-supplies which are in any (even the slightest) degree tainted by house refuse or other like kind of filth; as where there is outflow, leakage or filtration, from sewers, house-drains, privies, cesspools, foul ditches or the like, into springs, streams, wells or reservoirs, from which the supply of water is drawn, or into the soil in which the wells are situate; a danger which may exist on a small scale (but perhaps often repeated in the same district) at the pump or dip-well of a private house, or, on a large or even vast scale, in the case of public water-works. And secondly, there is the danger of breathing air which is foul with effluvia from the same sorts of impurity. 6. Information as to the high degree in which those two dangers affect the public health in ordinary times, and as to the special 83 importance which attaches to them at times when any diarrhœal infection is likely to be introduced, has now for so many years been before the public, that the improved systems of refuse-removal and water-supply by which those dangers are permanently obviated for large populations, and also the minor structural improvements by which separate households are secured against them, ought long ago to have come into universal use. So far, however, as this wiser course has not been adopted in any Sanitary District, security must, as far as practicable, be sought in measures of a temporary and palliative kind. (a.) Immediate and searching examination of sources and conduits of water supply should be made in all cases where drinking water is in any degree open to the suspicion of impurity; and the water both from private and public sources should be examined. Where pollution is discovered, everything practicable should be done to prevent the pollution from continuing, or, if this object cannot be obtained, to prevent the water from being drunk. Cisterns should be cleaned, and any connexions of waste pipes with drains should be severed. (b.) Simultaneously, there should be immediate thorough removal of every sort of house-refuse and other filth which has accumulated in neglected places; future accumulations of the same sort should be prevented ; attention should be given to all defects of housedrains and sinks through which offensive smells can reach houses; thorough washing and lime washing of uncleanly premises, especially of such as are densely occupied, should be practised again and again. 7. It may fairly be believed that, in considerable parts of the country, conditions favourable to the spread of cholera are now less abundant than in former times ; and in this connexion, the gratifying fact deserves to be recorded that during recent years enteric fever, the disease which in its methods of extension bears the nearest resemblance to cholera, has continuously and notably declined in England. But it is certain that in many places such conditions are present as would, if cholera were introduced, assist in the spread of that disease. It is to be hoped that in all these cases, the local sanitary authorities will at once do everything that can be done to put their districts into a wholesome state. Measures of cleanliness, taken beforehand, are of far more importance for the protection of a district against cholera than removal or disinfection of filth after the disease has actually made its appearance. 8. It is important for the public very distinctly to remember that pains taken and costs incurred for the purposes to which this memorandum refers cannot in any event be regarded as wasted. The local conditions which would enable cholera, if imported, to spread its infection in this country, are conditions which day by day, G 2 84 in the absence of cholera, foster and spread other diseases; diseases which are never absent from the country, and are in the long run far more destructive than cholera. Hence the sanitary improvements which would justify a sense of security against any apprehended importation of cholera would, to their extent, though cholera should never reappear in England, give amply remunerative results in the prevention of those other diseases. R. THORNE THORNE, Local Government Board, Medical Officer of the Board. August 26th, 1892. OFFICIAL COPY. General Memorandum on the Proceedings which are advisable in Places attacked or threatened by Epidemic Disease. 1. Wherever there is prevalence or threatening of cholera, diphtheria, fever or any other epidemic disease, it is of more than common importance that the statutory powers conferred upon Sanitary Authorities for the protection of the public health should be well exercised by those authorities, acting with the advice of their Medical Officers of Health. 2. Proper precautions are equally requisite for all classes of society. But it is chiefly with regard to the poorer population, therefore chiefly in the courts and alleys of towns, and at the labourers' cottages of country districts, that local authorities are called upon to exercise vigilance, and to proffer information and advice. Common lodginghouses, and houses which are sub-let in several small holdings, always require particular attention. 3. Wherever there is accumulation, stink, or soakage of house refuse, or of other decaying animal or vegetable matter, the nuisance should as promptly as possible be abated, and precaution should be taken not to let it recur. Especially examination should be made as to the efficient working of sewers and drains, and any defect therein, and any nuisance therefrom or from any foul ditches or ponds, should be got rid of without delay. The ventilation of sewers, the ventilation and trapping of house drains, and the disconnexion of cistern overflows and sink pipes from drains should be carefully seen to. The scavenging of the district, and the state of receptacles for excrement and of ash-pits or dust-bins, will require close attention. In slaughter-houses, and wherever animals are kept, strict cleanliness should be enforced. 4. In the removal of filth during periods of epidemic disease, it is commonly necessary to employ chemical agents for reducing or removing the offence and harm which may be involved in the disturbance of the filth. In the removal of privy contents these agents are more 85 particularly wanted if the disease in question be cholera or enteric fever. The chemical agent should be used liberally over all exposed surfaces from which filth has been removed. Unpaved earth close to dwellings, if it be sodden with slops or filth, ought to be treated in the same way. 5. Sources of water supply should be well examined. Water from sources which can be in any way tainted by animal or vegetable refuse, especially those into which there may be any leakage or filtration from sewers, drains, cesspools, or foul ditches, ought no longer to be drunk. Above all, where the disease is cholera, diarrhoea, or enteric fever, it is essential that no impure water be drunk. The liability of leaky water-pipes to act as land drains and to receive foul matters as well as land drainage through their leaks is not to be overlooked. And such leaky pipes, running full of water with considerable velocity, are liable to receive, by lateral insuction at their points of leakage, external matters that may be dangerous. This latter fact is not recognised so generally as it should be ; and ignorance of it has probably baffled many inquiries in cases where water services have in truth been the means of spreading disease. If, unfortunately, the only water which for a time can be got should be open to suspicion of dangerous organic impurity, it ought at least to be boiled before it is used for drinking, but then not to be drunk later than 24 hours after it has been boiled. Filtering of the ordinary kind cannot by itself be trusted to purify water. It cannot be too distinctly understood that dangerous qualities of water are not obviated by the addition of wine or spirits. 6. When there appears any probable relation between the distribution of disease and of milk supplies, the cleanliness of dairies, the purity of the water used in them, the health of the persons employed about them, and the health of the cows that furnish milk should always be carefully investigated. Even apart from any apprehension of milk being concerned in a particular outbreak of disease, it is desirable that English people should adopt the custom, which is always followed in some continental countries, of boiling all milk at once upon its reception into a house. 7. The washing and lime-whiting of uncleanly premises, especially of such as are densely occupied, should be pressed with all practicable despatch. 8. Overcrowding should be prevented. Especially where diseaes has begun, the sick-room should, as far as possible, be free from persons who are not of use to the patient. Ample ventilation should be enforced. It should be seen that 86 windows are made to open, and that they are sufficiently opened. Especially where any kind of infective fever has begun, it is essential, both for patients and for persons who are about them, that the sickroom and the sick-house be constantly traversed by streams of fresh air. 9. The cleanliest domestic habits should be enjoined. Refuse matters should be speedily removed or destroyed ; and things which have to be disinfected or cleansed should always be disinfected or cleansed without delay. 10. Special precautions of cleanliness and disinfection are necessary with regard to infective matters discharged from the bodies of the sick. Among discharges which it is proper to treat as infective are those which come in cases of small-pox and scarlatina from the affected skin; in cases of cholera and enteric fever from the intestinal canal; in cases of diphtheria and scarlatina from the nose and throat; likewise, in cases of any eruptive or other epidemic fever, the general exhalations of the sick. The caution which is necessary with regard to such matters must, of course, extend to whatever is imbued with them; so that bedding, clothing, towels, handkerchiefs, and other articles which have been in use by the sick may not become sources of mischief, either in the house to which they belong or in houses to which they are conveyed. So far as articles of this class can be replaced by rags or things of small value, it is best to use such things and burn them when they are soiled. Otherwise clothing and infected articles should be subjected to the disinfectant of the sickroom or be removed for disinfection by heat. In enteric fever and cholera the evacuations should be regarded as capable of communicating an infectious quality to any nightsoil with which they are mingled in privies, drains, or cesspools; and after such disinfection of them as is practicable, they should be disposed of without delay and under the safest conditions that local circumstances permit. They should not be thrown into any fixed privy receptacle, and above all, they must never be cast where they can run or soak into sources of drinking water. 11. All reasonable care should be taken not to allow infective disease to spread by the unnecessary association of sick with healthy persons. This care is requisite, not only with regard to the sick house, but likewise with regard to schools and other establishments wherein members of many different households are accustomed to meet. 12. If disease begins in houses where the sick person cannot be properly accommodated and tended, medical advice should be taken as to the propriety of removing him to an infirmary or hospital. Every Sanitary Authority should have in readiness a hospital for the reception of such cases. 87 Where dangerous conditions of residence cannot be promptly remedied, it will be best that the inmates, while unattacked by disease, remove to some safer lodging. 13. Privation, as predisposing to disease, may require special measures of relief. 14. In certain cases special medical arrangements are necessary. For instance, as cases of cholera in this country sometimes begin somewhat gradually in the comparatively tractable form of what is called "premonitory diarrhoea," it is essential that, where cholera has appeared, arrangements should be made for affording medical relief without delay to persons attacked, even slightly, with looseness of bowels. So, again, where small-pox is the prevailing disease, it is essential that all unvaccinated persons (unless they previously have had small-pox) should very promptly be vaccinated; and that revaccination should be performed in cases properly requiring it. 15. It is always to be desired that the people should, as far as possible, know what real precavitions they can take against the disease which threatens them, what vigilance is needful with regard to its early symptoms, and what (if any) special arrangements have been made for giving medical assistance within the district. For the purpose of such information, printed hand-bills or placards may usefully be employed, and in cases where danger is great, house-to-house visitation by discreet and competent persons may be of the utmost service, both in quieting unreasonable alarm and in leading or assisting the less educated and the destitute parts of the population to do what is needful for safety. 16. The present memorandum relates to occasions of emergency. Therefore the measures suggested in it are essentially of an extemporaneous kind; and permanent provisions for securing the public health have, in express terms, been but little insisted on. It is to be remembered, however, that in proportion as a district is habitually well cared for by its Sanitary Authority, the more formidable emergencies of epidemic disease are not likely to arise in it. 17. Provision by the public authority for disinfection by heat of bulky articles, and of those which cannot without injury be exposed to chemical agencies, ought always to be in readiness. Without such provision no complete disinfection can be effected. Partial and nominal disinfection, besides being wasteful, may be mischievous, as giving rise to a false security. 18. The following system of domestic disinfection may be commended to Sanitary Authorities who have already provided adequate public means for the disinfection and for the disposal of infected matters and things:— (a) For the purposes of the sick room, such as the reception of 88 soiled handkerchiefs, sheets, and the like, as well as for the swabbing of floors, a valuable disinfecting solution may be made with perchloride of mercury. It is well to have this solution slightly acid, coloured also in such a way that it shall not readily be confused with drinks or medicines; and proper caution should be given to avoid accidents in its use. Sanitary Authorities will find it advantageous to have such a solution* prepared under the direct instructions of the Medical Officer of Health, and supplied of a uniform strength at the infected house upon the order of that officer. (b.) In places provided with proper systems of excrement disposal, excrements of cholera and enteric fever, after being treated in detail with the same disinfecting solution in ample quantity, may be safely put into the ordinary closet; but special care as to the flushing of drains and sewers, and special frequency in the removal and exchange of excrement receptacles, will commonly be wanted. Where the only closet is one that communicates with a cesspool or privy pit, the best arrangement for the disposal of infected stools that under these improper local circumstances may be found practicable will have to be adopted. (c.) A substance generally available in the removal of filth from privies and ashpits, and for application to foul earth and the like,† is sulphate of iron (green copperas), either in a strong solution made by stirring crystals of the salt with five or ten times their bulk of hot water, or in the form of powder, to which form the crystals may be readily brought after desiccation. This agent should be used in quantity sufficient to destroy all odour, and in the removal of filth accumulations it should be well mixed with successive layers of the matter to be removed. The dry form of application is to be preferred where masses of wet or semisolid filth have to be dealt with. (d.) For disinfection of the air of rooms, after the room has been prepared by the removal of persons, and of such articles as * A solution fitted for the desired purposes may be made with ½ oz. corrosive sublimate, 1 fluid oz. hydrochloric acid, and five grains of commercial aniline blue, in three gallons (a bucketful) of common water. It ought not to cost more than 3d. the bucketful; and should not be further diluted. The use of non metallic vessels (wooden or earthenware house tubs or buckets) should be enjoined on those who receive it, and articles that have been soaked in it should be set to soak in common water for some hours before they go to the wash. † The removal of dangerous filth is here the object to be attained. It cannot confidently be stated that either the iron salt or any available substance will effect a true disinfection of such masses of filth as are here in question. 89 are best disinfected by heat, and by the closing of windows and crevices, sulphurous acid gas in ample quantity may be evolved, the doors being kept closed for six hours or more. The amount of sulphurous acid required for the disinfection of a moderate sized room can be obtained by burning 1½ lbs. of sulphur (roll brimstone) in a pipkin over a small fire placed in the middle of a room, with an old tray or the like to protect the flooring. These processes should be effected by skilled persons acting under the directions of the Medical Officer of Health. (e.) After measures of disinfecting a room have been taken, all wall paper should be stripped from the walls and be burned, and the room ought to have its ceilings and walls thoroughly washed or lime-whited. 19. For detailed information on disinfection by heat, on hospital accommodation, and on small-pox, and on questions of school administration during the prevalence of infectious disease, see the office memoranda and reports on these subjects. R. THORNE THORNE, Local Government Board, Medical Officer. Medical Department, August 26th, 1892. Other Zymotic Diseases. Glanders. In July it was reported that the wife of an ostler residing at Compton Mews, Bloomsbury, had died from glanders in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The deceased occupied rooms over a stable in the mews where a number of horses had been attacked with glanders. It was suggested at the inquest held upon this poor woman that she had been using water from a pail from which the horses had been drinking, or that she had come in contact with some clothes or towels upon which the infectious discharge had been received. 90 The London County Council, in consequence of the prevalence of glanders and farcy in London, directed its Veterinary Inspector to take all steps for the detection of cases of disease and for preventing its spread. The following suggestions were recommended:—"Owners of horses to completely isolate all animals under suspicion, and to slaughter directly where symptoms of glanders or farcy are visible. When slaughter has taken place or when any animal had died from glanders or farcy, the Inspector should exercise the greatest vigilance for ensuring the destruction of the infective germs. All appliances with which the animal or the carcase has come in contact should, if practicable, be burnt, otherwise it should be thoroughly disinfected by means of corrosive sublimate and then cleansed or whitewashed. Owners should be recommended to burn any w ooden manger or other wooden work with which the affected animal had been in contact, and, failing that, to disinfect and cleanse as above. It is desirable that Veterinary Inspectors should keep all large studs of horses in their districts under observation during the prevalence of these diseases, and when not already existing should recommend the provision of isolation stables completely separated from the rest of the premises and attended to by a separate staff" Influenza. At the beginning of the year there was a rapid extension of the disease both in this country and abroad, and when in due course the Metropolis was attacked, this District shared it, and 29 deaths were recorded, 25 of which occurred in January and February. Nearly all the deaths were of persons over 60 years of age. 91 Meteorology of the Year. The remarks of the meteorology of the year are furnished from the reports made to the Registrar-General by Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S., from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and various other stations.

Sanitary Work, On 1st January, 1892, the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (54 & 55 Vict., cap. 76), came into operation. This Act consolidates and amends the laws relating to Public Health in London. Inspections. Section 1 enacts that it is the duty of every Sanitary Authority to inspect District for detection of nuisances. 95 On referring to Table VI. appendix, page 115, it will be seen in reference to this section that the Sanitary Inspectors during the year made 11,046 visits and inspections, and served 1,203 orders for the abatement of nuisances so as to secure the proper sanitary condition of premises in the District. Proceedings at Petty Sessional Court. Section 5.—In 39 cases where the notice for the abatement of the nuisance was not complied with, the Court made on the persons liable a summary order for the abatement, prohibition, or closing, or a combination of such orders as the circumstances required. Overcrowding. 26 notices were served upon owners to reduce the number of persona living in houses or parts of houses which were so overcrowded as to be injurious or dangerous to the health of the inmates, whether or not members of the same family. Underground Dwellings, 26 underground rooms or kitchens found to be illegally occupied as dwellings were either closed or altered so as to comply with the Act, or occupied other than as a separate dwelling. Bakehouses. Section 26 of the Public Health Act enacts that Sections 34, 35, and 81 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and Sections 15 and 16 of the Factory and Workshop Act Amendment Act, 1883 (which relates to cleanliness, ventilation, and other sanitary conditions), shall, as respects every bakehouse which is a workshop, be enforced by the Sanitary Authority of the District in which the bakehouse is situate, 96 and they shall be the Sanitary Authority within the meaning of these sections. The following list shows that there are 29 bakehouses in the District, 17 in the Parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 12 in St. George, Bloomsbury. The several premises were inspected periodically throughout the year. ST. GILES-IN-THE-FIELDS. Premises. Owner. 200, Shaftesbury Avenue Mr. J. H.

Unsound Food. From time to time during the year quantities of meat, fish and fruit, intended for the food of man, were destroyed at the stone yard. h 98 Regulations as to Houses Let in Lodgings. It has not been considered necessary to frame new byelaws in accordance with section 94 of the Public Health Act, as the regulations in force in the District made in 1885, in conformity with the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, 1874, have been found to work satisfactorily. At the present time there is a total of 451 houses registered under the provisions of these regulations, as follows:—* Locality. No. of Houses. Locality. No. of Houses. Arthur Street 21 Queen Street 9 Betterton Street 26 Sardinia Place 7 Drury Lane ... 40 Short's Gardens 12 Dudley Street (now Shaftesbury Avenue) 28 Stacey Street 15 Tower Street 8 Dyott Street 13 Twyford Buildings 6 Earl Street, Little 9 "West Street 10 Kenton Street 62 Wild Court 5 Lumber Court 12 Wild Street, Great 24 Neal Street ... 41 Wild Street, Little 12 New Compton Street 59 White Lion Street, Great 8 New Turnstile 8 Nottingham Court 13 Total 451 Parker Street 3 Common Lodging-houses. (14 & 15 Vict., cap. 28, and 16 & 17 Vict., cap. 41). There are 47 common lodging-houses (all in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields), registered by the Commissioners of Police to accommodate 1,842 lodgers; the prices of the beds range from 4d. to Is. per night. * These regulations do not apply to common lodging-houses within the meaning of the Common Loo gin g Houtes Act, 1851, or any Act amending the same. 99 Inspector Blatchford and Sergeant Raven, of the Bow Street E Sub-division, have the supervision of all the houses, with the exception of No. 14, Lumber Court, which is attached to the Vine Street C Sub-division, under Inspector Shannon and Sergeant Lane.

At the opening ceremony on 25th January, 1893, Mr. Beachcroft, chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council, gave the following interesting statement about it :— " The building was designed by Messrs. Gibson and Russell, of Little Queen Street. The work was put out to tender, and that of Messrs. Holloway for £14,300 was accepted. The addition of a laundry, which will effect a saving in maintenance, and enlargement of the site, to some extent accounts for the difference over original pians of the Council for £10,000. The furnishing has cost £1,250, and h 2 100 to this the value of the site for the purpose we have put it to (£'3,700), and £1,100 for architect's commission, &c., a total is reached, say, of £20,500. To secure a return of 3 per cent. on this, and such a sinking fund as would ordinarily be required to replace the cost of building in 80 years, and after making liberal allowance for all outgoings and maintenances, a yearly gross income of about £2,450 is required. To meet this the Council has fixed the charge per bed at 5d. a night. The usual charge for a bed in a dormitory in London is 4d., for a cubicle 6d. If 6d. was charged it would, or should if there is no extravagance, mean a return of over 5 per cent, on outlay." In London there are some 900 common lodging-houses, accommodating over 30,000 persons. New Disinfecting Apparatus, During the past year your Board accepted the tender of Messrs. Manlove, Alliott, Fryer and Co., of the Broomsgrove Works, Nottingham, for the supply of a Washington Lyons' patent steam disinfector for purifying wearing apparel, bedding, &c., for the sum of £362 complete. The principle involved in this invention is the destruction of the germs of disease, &c., by the introduction of steam under regulated pressure into a specially constructed apparatus. Among the advantages claimed for this invention are:— 1. No chemicals are used in the process. 2. The short time in which the operation of disinfecting is completed. 3. The colours of the materials are not affected by the process. 4. Unpleasant smell is avoided. 101 5. Perfect control over the degree of heat is obtained without any risk of burning the articles operated on. 6. The disinfected articles are perfectly dry when taken out of the apparatus. 7. Certainty of disinfection, the pressure of the steam quickly penetrating through the thickest and most closely packed bad conductors of heat, such as feathers, beds, mattresses, rags, &c. The following is a list of articles disinfected during the year in the apparatus at the stone yard:— Articles. Number Articles. Number Articles. Number. Aprons 2 Dresses 7 Scarves 2 Bags 5 Dress Bodices 23 Shawls 48 Beds 195 Dress Skirts 24 Sheets 340 Bedcovers 10 Dressing Gowns 22 Shirts 45 Bedgowns 3 Frocks 16 Socks 2 Blankets 363 Gloves 6 Stays 16 Bolsters 27 Guernseys 6 Stockings 19 Books 1 Handkerchiefs 44 Sundries 155 Capes 3 Jackets 31 Table Covers 20 Caps 22 Mats 4 Towels 40 Carpets 14 Mattresses 64 Trousers 24 Carpet Pieces 41 Neckties 13 Ulsters 4 Chemises 25 Night Shirts 8 Vallances 27 Cloaks 3 Night Dresses 48 Vests 39 Coats 26 Petticoats 60 Wrappers 3 Collars 13 Pillows 431 Counterpanes 147 Pillow Cases 262 Total 2,910 Cuffs 4 Pinafores 9 Curtains 14 Quilts 52 Drawers 20 Bugs 58 102 Disinfectants. By Order of your Boar 1 the disinfectants used for the following purposes are :— 1. Chloride of Lime, for disinfecting the soil and refuse matter removed from the catch-pit gullies and sewers, and offensive earth taken out of excavations for sewers and house drains. 2. Carbolic Acid Powder, for deodorizing dust-bins. 3. Sanitas Powder and Fluid, for use in the Mortuary and Post-mortem room. 4. Permanganate of Potash, in street watering and flushing of courts and alleys. 5. Perchloride of Mercury, for the disinfection of drains, sewers, and gully-pits. A mixture of this is made in the proportions of— Perchloride of mercury 8 ounces (3,500 grains). Methylated spirit 2 pints. Aniline (green) half an ounce. Water to make 50 gallons. 6. Tuson's Disinfectant, for the underground convenience. 103 Trade Refuses, The portable iron bins, which your Board ordered to be placed about the principal market streets in Seven Dials for the reception of offensive substances in connection with the businesses carried on there, have served to lessen the nuisance in regard to stenches in the collection and removal of animal and vegetable matter, which formerly used to be scattered by the costermongers and others over the public way. Fish offal is removed regularly by private arrangement made by the tradesmen with the Board's contractor. Complaints were received occasionally as to nuisances arising in the conduct of the business of the marine store dealer, but considering the nature of the articles dealt in, the shops were found to be kept in fair cleanly condition.
