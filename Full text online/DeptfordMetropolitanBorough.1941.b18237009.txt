DEPT 26 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD REPORT OF THE IIEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1941 Public Health Department, Central Clinic, Anersham Road, S. E. 14. November, 1942. To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my thirteenth Annual Report in an abridged foira as prescribed by the Ministry of Health. During the first five months of the year, there were frequent air-raids with consequent dislocation of home life, many persons spending the night in air-raid shelters. The incidence of infeotious disease was low and, in 3pite of "black-out" conditions, food rationing and "shelter life", the general health of the population showed no serious deterioration. The increased responsibilities consequent upon the war have been ably carried out by the depleted staff who have continued to carry out routine duties, albeit on a necessarily reduced scale. During the year, three Health Vistors were seconded for duty in Reception Areas and the following members of the staff were in His Majesty's Forces:- Messrs. G.B.Allen, E.J.Elliott, D.K.Evans, J.L.Law and L.C.Southgate. The following briefly records the sanitary circumstances of the Borough in 1941:- GENERAL DATA Area of Borough 1.564 acres Deptford.
