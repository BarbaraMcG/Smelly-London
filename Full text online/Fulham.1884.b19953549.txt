METROPOLITAN REPRESENTATIVE. On the nth of June, 1884, Mr. George Brown was unanimously re-elected a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works to represent this Board for the ensuing three years. PARTICULARS OF DISTRICT. For the information of ratepayers who may be unacquainted with the extent and boundaries of the District, the following general particulars are printed: The District from North to South is about 4½ miles in length, and about one mile in breadth from East to West on the Northern boundary, which starts from a point by Willesden Junction, running some distance South-East and thence in an Easterly direction to Harlesden Cottages, thence in a North-Easterly direction to a point in the Harrow Road, close to Kensal Green and Harlesden Station; thence in a South-Easterly direction following the Harrow Road to the fourth house in St. Mary's Terrace, where the breadth is nearly one mile. From St. Mary's Terrace the Eastern boundary follows the boundary of All Souls' Cemetery, crossing the Canal at a point about 550 yards East of Mitre Bridge, and continuing in a Southerly direction and crossing the Northpole Road at the boundary of the glebe land belonging to Saint Clement's Church, 32 ing the rear of the houses on the East side of Latymer Road to within a point about 200 yards Northward of the Latymer Arms P.H. Here the Eastern boundary follows the line of path up to Latymer Arms P.H., and breaks away slightly to the South-East and follows the rear of the houses in Latymer Road to a point in St. Ann's Road, opposite the S.W. corner of Crescent Street ; thence in a Southerly direction, taking a portion of the houses in Latymer Road to a point 200 feet south of Clifton Street. Here the boundary again follows the path for a short distance, via Norland Road to Uxbridge Road ; this brings us to about the centre of the District. The breadth here is about 1¾ miles. The Eastern boundary then crosses the Uxbridge Road at right angles, and crossing the Holland Road in a diagonal direction and the West London Extension Railway at a point close by the junction with L. & S.W.

The Works required by the Metropolitan Board along the Malls, have, so far as the Board were liable, been completed. The Metropolitan Board have permitted the Board to allow Mr. Biffen and Mr. Welshman to have openings with tidal boards to enable them to get their boats in and out, and they (Mr. Biffen and Mr. Welshman) have entered into an agreement to indemnify the Board against any damage or loss that may be sustained in consequence of the tidal boards not being inserted in the openings. The whole of the works required to be done under the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act, 1879, so far as this Board is concerned, have been carried out. STAMFORD BROOK ROAD. The improvement of this Road, by setting back the fences of Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and No. 316, Goldhawk Road, has been completed, at a cost of £750 2s. 9d., which sum is rather in excess of what was first estimated. The Metropolitan Board refused to contribute towards the cost, although it is, without doubt, a work that comes under the category of Local Improvements; the Board, however, does not despair of, at some future time through its representative, inducing the Metropolitan Board to contribute one-half the cost. STAMFORD BROOK COMMON. The Work of Raising the Common is at the instance of the Chiswick Local Board, being carried out by this Board, and has afforded the Board considerable means of disposing of slop, road scrapings, etc. When the work is completed the Board has agreed to co-operate with the Local Board in surrounding the Common with a suitable post and rail fence, and a considerable improvement will be effected, the Common affording a useful open space for the recreation of the public. 45 school board for london expenditure. The Board is incessantly receiving letters from the various Vestries and District Boards transmitting copies of resolutions passed by them complaining of the continually increasing expenditure of the School Board for London; in March last the Finance Committee reported receiving the precept from the School Board requiring this district to pay the sum of ,£24,886 0s. 9d., being an increase upon last year's precept of £3,578 5s. 10d. and referred the matter to the Board. The Board after considerable discussion passed the following resolution:— "That this Board views with the utmost alarm the constantly increasing amount of the precepts of the School Board for London, and most earnestly entreats the Members of such Board to take every step in their power to arrest such increase and to reduce their expenditure." A copy of this resolution was forwarded to the School Board for London and to the Members of the School Board for Chelsea Division. Since that time the subject has been discussed at the invitation of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, at a conference of delegates representing the Vestries and District Boards, and the decision arrived at was that the Metropolitan Authorities should severally petition Parliament to appoint a Select Committee to enquire into such expenditure, and your Board forwarded the following petition:— To the Honourable the Commoners of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal. SHEWETH that your Petitioners are required by Law to cause to be raised the sums of money assessed from time to time by the School Board for London upon the Fulham District towards meeting the expenses of the said School Board. That the attention of your Petitioners has been drawn to the 46 continuous and enormous increase in the amount of the Precepts of the School Board for London. That the rate required for the purposes of the London School Board in the present financial year from this District is at the rate of iod. in the £. That the annually increasing burden imposed upon the Ratepayers is injurious to the welfare of the District and the Metropolis at large. That in the opinion of your Petitioners one important source of the extravagant expenditure by the School Board is that Sites for Schools are acquired in positions and neighbourhoods where such accommodation is not required, and that enormously extravagant prices are paid for such sites. That at the present moment the School Board are seeking to obtain a site for the erection of a School at Brook Green, Hammersmith, where, by reason of the valuable nature of the adjacent property, the purchase money must of necessity be very high, and where there is but a very small population of the class of persons that would require the advantage of a Board School. That an alternative site at Alexandra Road, Hammersmith, within a short distance of Brook Green, situate in the midst of a teeming population that does require such Schools, has been pointed out to the School Board by your Petitioners, and your Petitioners are credibly informed and believe that such site could be obtained at much less expense than the site at Brcok Green. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House to appoint a Select Committee for the purpose of enquiring into the Administration and Expenditure of the School Board for London, with a view to ascertaining in what respects (if any) the Administration of the Board is defective and their Expenditure is excessive, and suggesting such remedial legislation as may appear necessary or expedient to prevent an unduly lavish expenditure in future. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. Up to the time of issuing this Report nothing has been done by Parliament in the matter. 47 FORMATION OF NEW ROADS, LINES OF FRONTAGE, &C.

The Railway proposed to commence at a junction with the District Railway at Notting Hill Gate, and proceed underground down Notting Hill, underneath the West London Railway at Uxbridge Road, thence by cutting in a South Westerly direction to join the London and South Western Railway at Shepherd's Bush Road. The Bill, however, was subsequently abandoned. UNITED TELEPHONE COMPANY'S BILL. A Bill having been introduced for the purpose of giving certain powers to the United Telephone Company. A petition was prepared and presented (with others) to the House of Lords as follows:— UNITED TELEPHONE COMPANY (iL L.). Petition Against: on Merits. By Counsel. To the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal. SlIEWETH,—(1). That an Act has been introduced into and is now pending in your Right Honourable House, entitled "an Act to afford the United Telephone Company (Limited) additional facilities for Telephonic Communication, and for other purposes, which Act is hereinafter called 'the Act.'" (2.) That the preamble of the Act states (inter alia) that the United Telephone Company, Limited, (therein and hereinafter called the Company) is a Company incorporated under the Companies' Acts, 1862 to 1880, and by an indenture dated the eleventh day of April, 1S81, between Her Majesty's PostmasterGeneral and the Company, certain agreements were made as to establishing Telephonic Exchanges within a radius of five miles from a central point in London, and to establish, work, manage, use and maintain such Exchanges. That the Company have established certain Exchanges. That the Postmaster-General has on several occasions for special 49 poses extended the aforesaid radius in various directions at the request of the Company, to meet the requirements of their subscribers, and that the Company are also carrying on an increasing business to which the said indenture does not apply in private wires for telephonic communication both within and without the aforesaid radius. That by an indenture dated the twenty-ninth day of November, 1884, between Her Majesty's Postmaster-General and the Company, the before mentioned indenture was cancelled and determined, and the Postmaster-General granted to the Company (inter alia) a general license to work and use telephones and telephonic apparatus, and provide telephonic communication irrespective of locality or distance, in consideration of the payment of certain Royalties, and upon terms and conditions therein set forth. That it is practicable for the Company by means of wires carried above ground to take advantage of the powers and privileges conferred by the said license, so as cheaply, expeditiously, and without injuriously affecting any private or public rights, to bring within speaking distance of each other localities situate one hundred miles apart and upward. That it is expedient that the Company be empowered to csrry telephone wires above ground at the heights in the manner and subject to the consents (thereinafter in the Act) prescribed subject to the control and inspection of the Local Government Board. That it is expedient that the Company be afforded the powers and facilities mentioned in the said Act, with respect to the placing and maintaining of posts and telephone wires in or upon or under public roads, subject to the supervision and control of road authorities and the Local Government Board, and that powers be conferred upon the Local Government Board with respect thereto. (3.) That by clause 2 of the Act is proposed (inter alia) that The term "telephone wire" means a wire or wires used for the purpose of telephonic communication with any casing, coating, tube, or pipe enclosing the same. The term "post" means a post, pole, standard, stay, strut or Other above ground contrivance for carrying, suspending or supporting a telephone wire. The term "work" includes telephone wires and posts. The term "road" includes any highway and turnpike road, railway, river, canal and towing path, and any public bridge and county bridge, and any street, lane, footway, square, court, ally or passage, whether a thoroughfare or not. 50 The term "road authority" means (inter alia) a District Board elected under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. (4.) That by clause 4 of the Act it is proposed that the limits of the Act shall be so much of Great Britain as lies within the circumference of a circle, the radius of which extends one hundred miles from the General Post Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand. (5.) That by clause 6 of the Act it is proposed that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may suspend, place and maintain a telephone wire over, along, or across any land or road, or may alter or remove the same. That the Company may place and maintain posts in or upon any land or road, and may alter and remove the same. That the Company may place and maintain a telephone wire under any land or road, and may alter and remove the same. (6.) That by clause 7 of the Act, it is proposed that in the exercise of the powers sought by the Act the Company shall be subject to the following restrictions:— The Company shall not without the consent of the owner or occupier place a telephone wire over any land at a less height above the ground than 15 ft., or over any building at a less height than 3 ft. The Company shall not place a telephone wire over, along, or across any road at a less height from the surface of such road or way than 15 ft. without having in the first place obtained the consent of such road authority, or other person. (7.) That by clause 9 of the Act it is proposed that in the exercise of the powers sought by the Act the Company shall be subject to the following restrictions:— Sub-sec. 1. Before any road shall be opened or broken up by the Company they shall give to the road authority notice of their intention to open and break up the same seven days at least before the commencement of such operations. Sub-sec. 2 provides for superintendence by road authority of the breaking up of roads according to a plan to be agreed between the Company and the road authority, and in case of difference respecting such plan, according to a plan to be determined by an Engineer appointed by the Local Government Board, etc. Sub-sec. 3 provides that the Company shall fill in the ground and make good the pavement or soil so opened or broken up, and carry away rubbish, etc. Sub-sec. 4 provides that if the Company shall fail to give 51 notice of intention to break up any road as hereinbefore required, or shall break up any road without having given such notice, or before such plan has been agreed upon or determined as hereinbefore provided, or contrary in any respect to such plan or shall make any delay in completing any such work or in filling in the ground or making good the pavement or surface so broken up or in carrying away the rubbish so occasioned as aforesaid or in causing to be fenced guarded or lighted the place where such pavement or surface shall have been broken up, they shall forfeit a sum not exceeding five pounds for every such offence and a further sum not exceeding five pounds for each day during which such delay shall continue. Sub-sec. 5 provides that if any such delay as aforesaid shall take place, the road authority may cause the matter or thing so delayed to be done and the expenses of doing the same together with the cost of recovering such expenses may be recovered from the Company in a summary manner: Sub-sec. 6 provides that the Company shall not stop or impede traffic in any road or into or out of any road further than is necessary for the proper execution of their works, nor shall the Company close against traffic more than one-third in width of any road or of any way opening into any road at one time, and in case two-thirds of such road are not wide enough to allow two carriages to pass each other, they shall not occupy with their works at one time more than fifty yards in length of the one-third thereof except with the special consent of the road authority; Sub-sec. 7 provides that before they alter the position of any pipe, sewer or drain, the Company shall give to the person to whom the same belongs notice of their intention to do so specifying the time at which they will begin to do so, such notice to be given forty-eight hours at least before the commencement of the work for effecting such alteration; Sub-sec. 8 provides that the Company shall not execute such work except under the superintendence of the person to whom such pipe, sewer or drain belongs, unless such person refuses or neglects to give such superintendence at the time specified in the notice for the commencement of the work, and the Company shall execute such work to the reasonable satisfaction of such person. (8.) That by clause I I of the Act it is proposed that in every 52 case where by virtue of any enactment therein contained, the Company shall have suspended or carried a telephone wire over, along or across any land or road, the Local Government Board shall upon credible information being given them that any such telephone wire is or is likely to become dangerous to the public safety, make an inquiry into and inspect the condition of the telephone wire complained of, and make such order with respect thereto and upon such terms as may seem to be necessary and expedient in the public interest under the circumstances of the case and the Local Government Board also of their own motion and without receiving any such information may from time to time after twenty-four hours' notice to the Company, proceed to inspect, test, examine and enquire into the state of repair and condition of any telephone wires or posts to which such notice shall refer, and may make such order as to the removal, repair or alteration of any telephone wires or posts as shall seem to the Local Government Board necessary for the protection of the public. (9.) That your Petitioners, the Board of Works for the Fulham District, are constituted the local authority over the said District, and vested with various powers under the Metropolis Local Managements Acts,—including the control of the streets, the public sawers, etc. (10.) That the Fulham District comprises an area of over four thousand acres, and your petitioners have at present under their care and control upwards of sixty-four miles of "roads" as defined by the Act, that there are existing very many miles of new roads or streets not yet under the care and control of your petitioners, that building operations are progressing at a rapid rate in the Fulham District, and that very shortly there will be very many miles of roads or streets added to those at present under the control of your petitioners. (11.) That your petitioners strongly object to the Act for the following, among other reasons:— (i.) That the erection, suspension, and maintaining of overhead "telephone wires" (i.e., wire, or wires, with casing, coating, or tube, &c., containing the same), over, along, or across any land, or road, or building, within your petitioners' district, will become a source of great danger to the inhabitants and to the public generally. (ii.) That the erection and maintenance of "posts" (i.e., post, pole, standard, stay, strut, or other above ground contrivance) in or upon any land or road within your petitioners' district, and the suspension of "telephone wires" therefrom will create serious obstruction, annoyance, and inconvenience 53 in the said roads, and will restrict and injuriously interfere with the free use of the said roads by the inhabitants of your petitioners' district and by the public generally. (iii.) That the opening of the roads within your petitioners' district for the purpose of placingand maintainingtelephone wires under the said roads will create obstruction, annoyance, and inconvenience in the said roads. (iv.) That there are within your petitioners' district large residences with extensive ornamental gardens and grounds, and that the erection of posts or other above ground contrivances, and the placing or suspension of telephone wires over the said ornamental gardens and grounds or land at a height of 15 feet from the surface will seriously interfere with the comfort and enjoyment of the occupiers, and will certainly most seriously depreciate the rateable value of the property and injuriously affect the interests of your Petitioners' District. (v.) That the erection of posts or other above ground contrivances in or upon the roads within your Petitioners' District, and the placing or suspension of telephone wires over, along, or across any road at a height of 15 feet from the surface, will create obstruction, annoyance, and inconvenience in said roads, will injuriously affect the inhabitants thereof in the carrying on of their various trades and occupations, and will serionsly interfere with the free use of the roads by the inhabitants and by the public generally. (vi.) That the restriction imposed by Clause 9, Sub-section I, viz., that the Company shall give seven days' notice to the Road Authority before commencing to open or break up any road, is utterly inadequate, and that the period of seven days is too short to allow of due and careful consideration of any proposal that might be made by the Company. (vii.) That the provision in Clause 9, Sub-section 2, for the superintendence by the Road Authority of the breaking up of roads is not sufficient to secure the due and proper performance of the works. (viii). That the provision which enables an appeal to be made to the Local Government Board in case of difference between the Road Authority and the Company as to the plan according to which roads are to be opened or broken up is an attempt to establish a new principle in relation to the local self-government of the Metropolis. 54 (ix.) That the provision in Clause 9, Sub-section 3, as to filling in the ground and making good the pavement of any road opened or broken up by the Company is not sufficient to secure the proper re-construction and paving of the roads under the care and control of your Petitioners, (x.) That the provisions in Clause 9, Sub-section 4 and Subsection 5, are vague and insufficient to prevent delay in the carrying on and completion of work by the Company, and are inadequate to enable the Road Authority to recover expenses or penalties from the Company, (xi.) That the provisions in Clause 9, Sub-section 6, is not sufficient to provide for the necessities of the traders and other inhabitants of the roads where works are being carried on by the Company, and due provision is not made for the requirements of the general public. (xii.) That the provision of Clause 9, Sub-section 7 and Sub-section 8, are not sufficient to safe-guard the sewers under the care and control of your Petitioners, which have been constructed at the cost of the ratepayers of your Petitioners' District of nearly £100,000. (xiii.) That no periodical or other testing or inspection of Telephone wires can be carried out so as to ensure the efficient protection of the inhabitants of your Petitioners' District, and of the public generally, from the dangers arising from the erection and suspension of over-head wires; and that the provisions of the Act are wholly inadequate to safe-guard and protect the inhabitants of your Petitioners' District and the public generally from the danger, annoyance, and inconvenience which will result from the erection and suspension of Telephone wires and the posts and works connected therewith. (xiv.) That the marginal note to Clause 12 of the Act is misleading, inasmuch as it states "Local Government Board to make and enforce rules for prevention of danger from the Companies' Works," whereas the said clause gives power to the Local Government Board (inter alia) to make, alter and repeal rules to be observed by the Road Authority, and for the imposition and recovery of penalties for breach of such rules, and your Petitioners strongly object to any such clause or any such power being given to the Local Government Board. (xv.) That the Act proposes to give to the Company the use of the public roads for the purpose of their works, which works, although convenient to the public, will be carried on for the profit and advantage of the Company, 55 who would secure a monopoly for their business, and no provision is made in the Act for compelling the Company to contribute towards the rates raised in your Petitioners' District. That the preamble of the Act is incapable of proof. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that this Act may not pass into a law, and that they may be heard by themselves, their Counsel, Agents, and Witnesses against the same and the Preamble thereof, and in support of their objections thereto, and that they may have such other relief in the premises as to your right honourable House may seem meet. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 18th March, 1885. The Bill was subsequently withdrawn. bishop's meadow recreation ground. As stated in the last Annual Report the Metropolitan Board of Works had been asked to accept and lay out this meadow as an open space at the cost of the Metropolis, but in spite of the efforts of your representative the Metropolitan Board arrived at the conclusion that it was not expedient to comply with this Board's request. The question as to how the meadow is to be dealt with as regards laying it out is still under consideration. Dwelling-house inspection bill. Your Board having had this Bill under consideration, also copy of a resolution passed by the Lambeth Vestry as follows:— "That in the opinion of this Vestry the power sought to be given to the Local Government Board in Clause 3 of the Dwelling-Houses Inspection Bill would be antagonistic to full freedom of action on the part of the Vestries, inconsistent with the spirit of the Metropolis Local Management Act. 1855, altogether unnecessary, and should be resisted." Resolved to petition against the Bill, and accordingly the following petition was presented:— 56 The House of Commons—Sessions 1884. dwelling-Houses inspection bill. Petition Against; To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal. Sheweth—That a Bill has been introduced and is now pending in your honourable House, entitled "Dwelling-Houses Inspection Bill," which Bill proposes to give powers to Local Authorities to appoint inspectors, and for such appointment they shall have the same powers as are given for the appointment of Inspectors of Nuisances under the Public Health Act, 1875, but all such appointments must receive the sanction and confirmation of the Local Government Board. That the Bill proposes to provide for the periodical inspection of the Sanitary fittings, drains, water closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, means of ventilation, water supply and storage, and all other Sanitary appliances of buildings. Your Petitioners, the Board of Works for the Fulham District, are the Sanitary Authority under the powers of the Metropolis Local Management Acts, and the Nuisances Removal, Sanitary, and other Acts, and have various powers conferred upon them as to the appointment of Inspectors, and the inspections, control, and dealing with buildings and nuisances, and while your Petitioners would be glad if the powers now conferred upon them were, in the Public Interest, to be strengthened and improved, they are of opinion that the provisions of the Bill if extended to the Metropolis would create confusion in the administration of Sanitary measures in your Petitioners' District and the Metropolis generally. Your Petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will not pass the said Bill into a law, but if your honourable House should be of opinion the same should pass, then that the Metropolitan area should be excluded from the provisions thereof. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 14th May, 1884. The Bill was subsequently dropped. 57 IMPROVEMENT-BEADON ROAD. The Board have at last succeeded in coming to terms with the owners of property required for this improvement, and the works will shortly be carried out. When finished a detailed statement of costs will be submitted. IMPROVEMENT-CORNER OF HARWOOD ROAD. An opportunity having presented itself for an improvement by widening the entrance to Harwood Road, and also widening the Fulham Road by the Swan Tavern, the Board agreed to give the Railway Company £250 for the land, and to pull down the old stables and erect new boundary wall. The Company have accepted these terms, and the matter is now approaching completion. BLACK LION LANE. According to instructions the officers opened negotiations with the owners of property required for this improvement, but the total amount of the claims being so much in excess of the estimate made by the Board, the proposed improvement has been abandoned. WIDENING OF DAWES ROAD. Negotiations are in progress with owner of land abutting upon Dawes Road from Walham Green to Rylston Road, by means of which a very important improvement will be effected. IMPROVEMENT—GREAT CHURCH LANE. The Board have now effected an improvement in Great Church Lane by removing the old iron railing projecting out into the road in front of the St. Paul's Parochial Room and setting 'Same back, the Board paying the sum of £20 and carrying out the works. IMPROVEMENT-PARSON'S GREEN LANE-(De Sala's Estate) The Board hearing that it was proposed to pull down and re-erect the premises on the Eastern side of 58 Parsons Green Lane from the White Horse P.H., entered into negotiations with the owner, and succeeded in arranging for the setting back of the line of new buildings and the much needed widening of the road at this point, and the matter is now progressing, and application been made to the Metropolitan Board. improvement—nortii end road, west kensington station. The Board are now in communication with the Midland Railway Company with a view of carrying out this much needed improvement, and it is to be hoped that the matter will shortly be completed. cartage scheme. The work of slopping and watering the roads, general cartage, and the removal of dust, ashes, and domestic refuse has been carried out under the direction and supervision of the Cartage Committee. The Board have been somewhat more fortunate this year in the matter of finding "shoots" for the dust and slop, although the Board have not been able to obtain the same price for the materials. In July, 1884, in consequence of communications received from the Local Government Board, pointing out the advisability of the utmost precautions being taken by Sanitary Authorities against the possible infection of cholera, the Board ordered the weekly removal of dust and ashes from houses and premises in the District. The number of loads of dust removed and the horses employed during the year is:— Loads of dust removed. Horses employed, Fulham 10,314 2,728 Hammersmith 14,978 4,082 In November, 1884, the Cartage Committee thoroughly went into the question of the working hours of the men employed by the Board, and the following regulations were drawn up and adopted by the Board: 59 Board of Work for the fulham district.

Seven horses have been purchased during the year at a cost of ^455, being an average of £65 per horse. The total number of horses now in the Board stables is 55 cart horses and 3 nag horses.

The question as to the desirability of the Board securing a site on the banks of the Thames at Fulham for the establishment of a Wharf and Premises for dealing with the dust and ashes and slop, has been before the Joint Committee (Cartage and Works) appointed by the Board during the year. Two sites were offered to the Committee, one at Wandsworth Bridge and the other Craven Cottage Estate, and the Committee on the 29th October presented the following Report:— "Stating that having had under consideration the question of purchasing land to be used for the purposes of a Wharf, and had before them and viewed two sites, viz.: one at Wandsworth Bridge Road, lately in the occupation of Messrs. Janes, Son, and McLaren, the other being the estate known as Craven Cottage, Fulham, your Committee recommend the Board to settle an agreement to buy from Mr. Tod Heatley his leasehold interest in the latter premises for the sum of £8000, subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (the freeholders), so as to enable the Board to carry on their general business, and subject to a draft agreement between the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Board, and Mr. Tod Heatley, being submitted to and approved by your Committee." TheBoardhowever referred the matterbackfor further consideration, and upon enquiries being made as to whether the Ecclesiastical Commissioners would, if the Board purchased the leasehold interests, waive all breaches of covenant, and consent to the Board using the site for the purposes of loading and unloading stone, deposit of dust and ashes and refuse and to carry on the general work of the District; also whether the Commissioners would sell the freehold. A reply was received that the Commissioners would not sell the freehold, and the Board decided to take no further steps in endeavouring to acquire this site. The Joint Committee then communicated with Gen. McMurdo with a view to purchasing the Freehold Estate known as Rose Bank, Fulham, and the matter is still under consideration. 04 ST. JAMES s HOME-DRAINAGE OF. Your Board having received a communication from the Treasurer of St. James's Diocesan Home, Fulham Palace Road, which was drained into cesspools, resolved to construct 1250 feet of 12-inch pipe sewer from the termination of the present pipe sewer up to the Home, the Treasurer of the Home agreeing to contribute the sum of ,£200. CIIURCH STREET, FULHAM. The Board received a very influential deputation from Fulham, who presented a numerously signed memorial calling attention to the narrow and very dangerous road known as Church Street, and asking the Board to consider the matter and provide a remedy for the evils complained of in the memorial. Church Street is now one of the most important thoroughfares from the West of London to Putney, Richmond, Wimbledon, Hampton Court, Kempton Park and Epsom, and there is daily what may be termed a great Metropolitan traffic. The Board carefully considered the matter in all its bearings, and came to the conclusion that the widening of the street was an improvement which should be carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Board have accordingly asked that Board to include the scheme in one of their Hybrid Bills for improvement in the Metropolis, but up to the present time no decision has been come to by the Metropolitan Board STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. A small portion of Holland Road is situate in the Parish of Hammersmith, and an order has been made by the Metropolitan Board, under Sec. 140 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, placing the whole of Holland Road (including the portion in Hammersmith Parish) under the exclusive management of the Vestry off Kensington for the purposes of maintenance and cleansing, for which this Board pay to the Vestry the sum of £35 per annum. 65 Norland Road being partly in Hammersmith and partly in Kensington, an arrangement was made some time ago with the Kensington Vestry by which the Board contributes the sum of £40 per annum towards the maintenance and repair of the road. The arrangement is still in force. board room-letting of. In January, 1885, the Board resolved to let the Board Room lor the purpose of holding Concerts, Dances and other Entertainments, and appointed a Committee with power to make the necessary arrangements.

I have estimated that the life of a wood paved street of fairly heavy traffic may be taken at seven years, after which time it will be more or less faulty, and it will be desirable, as well as economical, to renew the wood blocks entirely ; the old blocks might then be used (or the best of them) in bye streets, with the under sides brought to the surface, as has been recently done in the eastern side of Broadway and Brook Green Lane. The first cost of paving a street with deal blocks may be taken at 10/- per yard, which is about the average of the tenders for a contract recently taken. If the necessary sum is borrowed, to be paid off in seven annual instalments, with interest at 5 per cent., and adding id. per yard per annum for maintenance, &c., the cost per yard for the first seven years will be about 1/9 per yard. (For the exact calculation see appendix.) After the first seven years the renewal will be less because the concrete foundation at first laid will remain intact and will merely require a little 68 regulating where it may have become depressed by traffic or occasional excavations, and this second laying I estimate at 7/per yard, or if the cost thereof borrowed and paid off by seven annual instalments, with 5 per cent, interest and id. per yard per annum for maintenance, the annual cost will be about 1/3 per yard. With reference to the propriety of substituting creosoted beech blocks instead of deal, I can only say that the short term of experience we have had with them in the Broadway and between the tram lines in King Street, tends to prove to a great extent the statements made by the patentees of the system in Sunderland, but without going so far as they do when they say that after 13 years wear the blocks shew but little signs of deterioration, I think it may fairly be assumed that they will last 12 years, and I estimate the first cost at 17/- per yard. The annual cost therefore would be, assuming you can borrow the money and repay the loan in the twelve annual instalments at 5 per cent, interest, and adding id. per yard for maintenance as before, will be about 1 /11 per yard. After the first 12 years (the concrete remaining as before described) the re-paving might be done for 14/- per yard, the amount for which borrowed and paid off in like manner at 5 per cent, interest, with 1d. per yard for maintenance, would be 1/7 per yard. Now as compared with the cost of the maintenance of a Mac Adam road the cost of wood will be seen to be higher in the case of the first cost of paving with deal blocks, and also in both instances with the beech blocks, whilst in the case of the renewal of the deal blocks it will be about the same, as it is estimated the cost for maintenance at the present price of broken granite of a Mac Adam road is from 1/- to 1/3 yer yard, according to the traffic and also the season. There is, however, another matter which must not be lost sight of, which seems to point in the direction of the economy of wood paving, viz.: the cost of scavenging and cleansing. This is a somewhat difficult problem to answer without actual statistics, moreover, if it were possible to answer it correctly to day, the altered circumstances and increased difficulty of obtaining slopshoots would demand a different answer in a few years time, but in Liverpool such statistics have been taken and they may fairly be referred to here as affording some reliable information on the subject. In a report on the subject I find the cost of scavenging on creosoted wood with a bitumenous concrete foundation is stated to be 2.7d. per yard per annum, while for scavenging Mac Adam roads it is said to cost 8d. per yard per annum. This 69 would seem to shew that it costs about three times as much to cleanse a Mac Adam road as it does a wood paved road. If these figures are worth anything the wood paving is the more economical. There is yet another consideration which affects nearly all ratepayers, some more than others, viz.: the comparatively less wear and tear in horse flesh and carriages of various kinds, thus giving advantage to those who are so fortunate as to be able to keep horses and vehicles, and the still greater advantage to those residing along the line of route where wood is laid, who, without having the expense of keeping horses, &c., have the unalloyed advantages of great diminution in the noise and vibration, and dust from the traffic, as well as freedom from the annoyance of the annual picking up, coating and rolling a Mac Adam road. Taking all these things into consideration I have arrived at the conclusion that a very large number of individuals derive special benefit from wood paving, whilst the remaining portion of the ratepayers who have not these special benefits are not placed at any disadvantage whatever, but after a time become absolute gainers thereby. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED C. BEAN, Surveyor. APPENDIX.

The Board, in April, having received a complaint that the Metropolitan Asylums Board were about purchasing land near Town Mead Road for the purpose of forming a Wharf and Landing Stage for the embarkation to the Hospital Ships of persons suffering from small pox, it was found upon enquiry that the measures proposed to be adopted would be in the interest of the public, and no further proceedings were taken in the matter. fulham and putney bridge. The Memorial Stone of this Bridge, which is being erected by the Metropolitan Board of Works, was laid by T. R.

The Board having received notice from the Acton Local Board of their intention to construct Sewerage Works near to Bedford Park Estate, and adjoining the Western Boundary of the District, and to construct an effluent Water Sewer passing into the Thames, close to the Boundary of the Parish of Hammersmith, at Chiswick 71 Mall caused an objection to be lodged against the Scheme which is still under consideration. telephone. It being considered desirable that the Board should be in telephonic communication with various offices in London, especially with the Metropolitan Asylums Board, Ambulance Stations, &c., arrangements were made with the United Telephone Company, and the Telephone is now in operation at Broadway House. site for board school-brook green. The Board having heard with much alarm that it was proposed to take certain land adjoining Brook Green for the purpose of erecting thereon a Public Elementary School, communicated with the School Board for London thereon, pointing out that a School was not required in this immediate neighbourhood, and asking the Board not to proceed to acquire land at Brook Green.

Sanitary Department, Broadway House, Hammersmith, Telephone 8539. 21st June, 1885. To the Fulham District Board of Works. Gentlemen, It has been my duty and privilege to present to you during the past year numerous special reports on sanitary matters, besides 4 quarterly reports containing a detailed account of all the sanitary work performed in my department, together with statistics as to the state of the public health of your District. In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 & 19 Vic., c. 120, Sec. 198, and 25 & 26 Vic., c. 102, Sec. 43) there remains for me the duty to lay before you an annual statistical report containing an account of the vital statistics for the past year, together with a statement as to the sanitary work performed. The Fulham District comprises an area of 4,003 acres, and in the middle of last year its estimated population was 140,500 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three Sub-Districts, namely, Fulham which is the Parish of Fulham, and St. Peter's, and St. Paul's, which together constitute the Parish of Hammersmith. These three Sub-Districts are hereafter designated as Fulham, St. Peter's and St. Paul's. Fulham contains an area of 1,716 statute acres, St. Paul's 2,102 and St. Peter's 185. In the middle of last year there were 22,500 inhabited houses in the whole District, against 20,379 in the middle of the previous year. On the estimated population in the middle of last year, there was an average of 62 persons to each house. Of the inhabited houses in the middle of last year, there were 13,500 in 103 the Parish of Hammersmith, and 9,000 in the Parish of Fulham against 12,879 in the Parish of Hammersmith, and 7,500 in the Parish of Fulham in the middle of the previous year. During the whole year therefore there was an increase of 2,121 in the number of inhabited houses in the whole District. On the estimated population in the middle of last year, there was an average of 35.1 persons to each acre in this District, while there was an average of 53.4 persons to each acre in the whole of London. A great many new houses have been constructed and occupied in the past year, but the increase in the population has not been as great as might have been expected under the circumstances. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in this District during the 53 weeks ending January the 3rd, 1885, was 2,737—males 1,361, females 1,376, being one death to every 51.3 inhabitants against 2,607 in the previous year, which equalled one death to each 52.9 inhabitants. Deducting the deaths of non-parishioners which occurred at the West London Hospital, the Western District Hospital at Fulham, and the Fulham Union Infirmary, and adding the number of deaths of parishioners of this District which occurred in general hospitals and other public institutions in other Districts of London, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners of this District which occurred last year was 2,683. The average number of deaths registered in this District in the past ten years was 2,283. Making an allowance for the increase in the population, the deaths last year were 126 below the corrected decennial average. The above figures represent the total number of deaths as registered in the District. The annual death rate, taking the deaths as registered, was 194 deaths per 1,000 persons living, being 9 less than the death rate ot London, which was 20.3. The mean death rate in this District in the last ten years (1875-1884) was 20.5 while that in all London during the same period was 217. The corrected death rate of parishioners of this District which occurred last year was 19.1, being 12 less than the death rate in London during the same period. Of the deaths registered last year 129 took place in St. Peter's, 1,249 St. Paul's, and 1,339 in Fulham, against 108 in St. Peter's. 1,262 in St. Paul's, and 1,237 in Fulham in the previous year. The average number of deaths registered in the three Sub-Districts during the last ten years was, St. Peter's 125, St. Paul's 1,120, and Fulham 1,278. There was therefore last year as compared with the last decennial average, and making no allowance for the increase in population, an increase of 4 deaths 104 in St. Peter's, an increase of 149 deaths in St. Paul's, and an increase of 61 deaths in Fulham. TABLE I. The following table shows the deaths registered in the three Sub-Districts in the years 1883 and 1884, also the average number in the ten years 1875-1884. Sub-District. Year, 1883.

St. Peter's 108 129 125 St. Paul's 1262 1269 1120 Fulham 1237 1339 1278 The number of deaths of infants at one year of age and under was 826 against 838 in the previous year. Of those occurring last year there were 32 in St. Peter's, 383 in St. Paul's, and 411 in Fulham, against 25 in St. Peter's, 393 in St. Paul's, and 420 in Fulham in the previous year. The deaths of infants in this District last year were equal to 30.2 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and 15.3 per cent. of the total registered births. The deaths of infants at one year of age and under in the whole of London last year were equal to 27.5 per cent. of the total deaths registered and to 15.5 per cent. of the total registered births. In the three Sub-Districts the per centages of these deaths to the total deaths and total births respectively were St. Peter's 24.8 and I3.3, St. Paul's 30.1 and 14.2, Fulham 307 and 16.7. This mortality rate therefore was as compared with the total deaths and total births greater in Fulham than in London. It was greater in St. Paul's than in London as compared with the total deaths registered, but less in St. Paul's than in London as compared with the total births In St. Peter's it was less than in London both as compared with the total deaths and total births. The infant mortality rate in this District last year was less than in the previous year, the decrease being 1.9 as compared with the total deaths registered and 1.4 as compared with the total births registered. The number of deaths of persons at 60 years of age and upwards was 499 of which there were 37 in St. Peter's, 251 in St. Paul's, and 211 in Fulham, against 35 in St. Peter's, 252 in St. Paul,s, and 217 in Fulham registered in the previous year. These deaths last year were equal to 18.2 per cent. of the total deaths registered, while the per centage of the same in all London was 20.5, the senile mortality rate was therefore lower in this District last year than in London. 105 TABLE II.

If we consider the fact that the mortality rate in this District last year was 1.1below the last decennial average, and 2.3 less than the decennial average 106 in London, although the density of the population in this District has increased during the past ten years from 210 to 351 persons to an acre, it is quite evident that the state of public health has improved.

The deaths of females exceeded those of males by 29. The proportion of deaths of males to males living was however greater than the proportion of deaths of females to females living. The actual number of deaths of females being greater than that of males was owing to the very much greater number of females living than males. The mortality rate of males is always greater than that of females. This is the cause of there being a much greater number of females living than of males. BIRTHS. The number of births registered in this District last year was 5392 (males 2685, females 2707,) against 5008 in the previous year. The number of births of females exceeded those of males by 22. Of the births registered last year there were 240 in St. Peter's (males 130, females 110, 2698 in St. Paul's (males 1329, females 1369), and 2454 in Fulham (males 1226, females 1228). The birth rate in the whole District was at the rate of 384 births per 1000 persons living per annum, being one birth to each 26.1 persons. The birth rate in the whole of London was equal to 33.7 births per 1000 persons living per annum. The births exceeded the deaths in this District last year by 2655. Estimating that the population had increased 2500 up to the middle of last year 107 the increase in the population can be accounted for by the excess in the number of births as compared with the number of deaths registered. TABLE V. The following table shows the quarterly number of births of each sex registered in the three Sub-Districts during the year 1884. #]Qtr. Sub-district of £t.

There was therefore a comparative increase of 132 in the number of these deaths of parishioners registered last year as compared with the previous year, but making allowance for the increase in the population that has taken place there was a comparative increase of 126 deaths from these diseases last year as compared with the previous year. The deaths of parishioners from zymotic diseases last year were equal to 17.7 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered and were at the rate of 34 deaths per annum per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 164 per cent. of the total deaths registered and were at the rate of 3.3 deaths per annum, per 1,000 persons living. There was therefore in this District last year a greater proportion of deaths of parishioners from zymotic diseases than in London, both as compared with the total deaths of 108 parishioners registered and with the number ot the inhabitants. This District contains so many poor class inhabitants that the death rate from zymotic diseases is always sure to be rather high. Of the 4704 (the corrected ) number of deaths from zymotic diseases which occurred last year there were 13 in St. Peter's against 11 in the previous year, 207 in St. Paul's against 156 in the previous year, and 254 in Fulham against 175 in the previous year. There was therefore a comparative increase of 2 in the number of these deaths in St. Peter's, an increase of 51 in St. Paul's, and an increase of 79 in Fulham. TABLE VI. The following table shows the deaths from zymotic diseases of parishioners of the Fulham District which took place in the years 1883 and 1884. Disease. Year 1883. Year 1884. Sub-dist.

There was therefore last year a comparative increase of 132 deaths from zymotic diseases. SMALLPOX. During last year 108 cases of smallpox ^males 69 females 39) were reported in this District. The total number of deaths from smallpox which took place in London last year was 1,251. This represents about 12,510 persons attacked by the disease. The number of deaths of parishioners of the Fulham District 109 was 17. This represents about 170 persons attacked. Of the 170 persons supposed to have been attacked 108 were discovered and 62 are supposed to have been concealed. Estimating that there were 12,510 persons attacked by the disease in London and 170 in the Fulham District, the proportion of persons attacked per 100,000 was 311 in London. The proportion of persons attacked by the disease per 100,000 of the inhabitants in the Fulham District was 121. The proportion of persons attacked by the disease in the whole of London was therefore last year more than twice as great as in the Fulham District. There can be no doubt that there would have been a much larger proportion in the Fulham District than in all London but for the course that has been adopted by your Board. The cases of smallpox reported in the Fulham District during the last eight years from 1877 to 1884 both years included were 1877—328; 1878—266; 1879—166; 1880—51; 1881—327; 1882—16; 1883— 0; 1884—108. I regret to state that the recommendations contained in the report of the Royal Commission which sat in 1882 have not yet been acted upon by the passing of a Bill to ensure the notification and proper isolation of infectious diseases. Smallpox will never be effectually dealt with until some such Bill be passed. Of the 108 cases of smallpox reported last year there were 43 in the Parish of Hammersmith against no case in the previous year, and 65 in the Parish of Fulham against no case in the previous year. It is a remarkable fact that when smallpox is epidemic there is always a larger number of cases of smallpox in the Parish of Fulham than in the Parish of Hammersmith, although there is in the Parish of Hammersmith a very much larger population. The difference in the proportion of cases has continued to decrease during every year that I have been in office. I attribute this fact to the improvement that has taken place in reference to the measures adopted to ensure the isolation of the disease. The evidence obtainable on the subject is certainly in favour of the theory that the Fulham Hospital has to a slight extent been the means of increasing the difference in the proportion of cases in the two Parishes. There can be no doubt however that the presence of the hospital has been the means of very considerably decreasing the actual number of cases in both parishes. But for the presence of the hospital near at hand to which the worst cases could be removed, these cases would have been left at home without proper isolation. They would have done very considerably more to increase the number of cases in the Parish of Fulham than the hospital could do. If however there was no smallpox hospital in the Parish of Fulham I should 110 expect to find a greater proportion of cases occurring in the Parish of Fulham than in the Parish of Hammersmith. The 108 cases which were reported last year occurred in 76 houses in 46 streets. In 58 streets the outbreak was confined to one house in each street; 44 cases occurred singly in different houses in different streets. In 8 streets there was more than one house infected in each street: thus in one street there were 4 houses infected, and in 7 streets two houses were infected in each street. In 61 houses (out of the total of 76) there was only one case in each house. In 15 houses there was more than one case in each house : thus in one house there were 7 cases, in another 5 cases, in 7 houses there were 3 cases in each house, and in 5 houses there were 2 cases in each house. Of the 108 persons attacked by the disease 105 had been once vaccinated, 3 had never been vaccinated. In no case was any evidence obtained that the patient had been re-vaccinated. The ages varied from 2 months to 59 years. The average age was 233 years. The social positions of the patients were as follows:—1 coachman, 1 wife of a coachman, 8 labourers, 5 wives of labourers, 4 daughters of labourers, 5 sons of labourers, 1 barman, 1 saddler, 1 bricklayer, 1 builder, 1 wife of a builder, 2 daughters of a builder, 1 carpenter, 3 wives of carpenters, 2 sons of carpenters, 2 coal porters, 1 wife of a coal porter, 1 blacksmith, 2 daughters of blacksmiths, 1 shop assistant, 2 clerks, I lapidary, 3 sons of a lapidary, 1 daughter of a lapidary, 1 cigar dealer, 1 mason, 1 son of a mason, 4 female domestic servants, 1 engine driver, 3 sons of barristers, 1 daughter of a barrister, 2 daughters of railway guards, 2 stokers, 1 wife of a stoker, 2 daughters of stokers, 1 milliner, 1 wife of a painter, 3 sons of painters, 2 daughters of painters, 1 turncock, 2 sons of turncocks, 1 platelayer, 1 butcher, 1 wife of a butcher, 1 railway porter, 1 daughter of a cabdriver, 2 plasterers, 1 tailor, 1 wife of a feather dyer, 2 sons of feather dyers, 1 ironmonger's fitter, 1 son of an ironmonger's fitter, 1 night watchman, 1 wife of a house decorator, 1 carman, 1 wife of a gentlemen, 1 omnibus driver, 1 omnibus conductor, 1 wife of a gasfitter, 1 postman, 1 son of a dentist, 1 wife of a book-keeper, 3 sons of an engineer, 1 daughter of an engineer, and 1 plumber. The total number of deaths of parishioners of this District was 17, this gives a mortality rate of 157 per cent. of the cases reported. Making an allowance of 62 for the cases that were concealed and never reported, the mortality rate would, as is usual in this complaint, be about 10 per cent. of the actual number of persons who were attacked by the disease. Of the total cases reported 94 were treated at hospitals and properly isolated, and 14 111 cases were treated at the residences of the patients. Eighty-one cases were removed by your Board and 10 cases were removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. One case was removed by the St George's Hospital Authorities. The patient had applied at the hospital for medical advice. Being found that he was suffering from smallpox he was detained until removed to the Smallpox Hospital at Fulham. No case was removed by the Fulham Board of Guardians. In two cases the patients walked to the hospital and were admitted. Five cases were treated at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South Western District Hospital at Stockwell. Eighty-eight cases were isolated at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Western Hospital at Fulham. One case was treated at the Highgate Smallpox Hospital. Of the 14 patients treated at home, one was treated by myself on behalf of your Board. At the time when the case was reported the patient was found to be in the third stage of labour, and consequently could not be removed. The 13 other cases were treated at the homes of the patients by private medical practitioners. The percentage of the cases reported that were removed to hospitals was 87.0, as compared with a percentage of 847 in the year 1881,when the last epidemic of smallpox occurred in this District. It is probable that the proportion of cases that were concealed has greatly decreased, for, as I have previously stated, no death from smallpox was registered as occurring in a private dwellinghouse in this District during last year. Of the 43 cases reported in the Parish of Hammersmith, 39 were removed to hospitals and properly isolated, and 4 were treated at home. Of the 65 in the Parish of Fulham, 55 were treated at hospitals and properly isolated, and 10 were treated at home. Thus of the reported cases in Hammersmith 907 per cent. were treated at hospitals, while of the cases reported in Fulham 84.6 were treated at hospitals. It is probable that the proportion of concealed cases was greater in the Parish of Fulham than in the Parish of Hammersmith. The greater proportion of cases that were concealed in the Parish of Fulham no doubt was to a large extent the cause of the difference in the number of cases that occurred in the Parish of Fulham as compared with the Parish of Hammersmith. Of the 14 cases that were treated at home in one case the patient was too ill to be removed. In 10 cases no information was received until after the recovery of the patients. In 3 cases an offer made to the relatives of the patients on behalf of your Board to remove the patients to an hospital was refused. The accommodation in these cases was not sufficient for the effectual isolation of the patients, but was not so bad, as to come 112 within the meaning of the 26th Section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and to justify an application to the magistrate to enforce the removal of the patients. Out of the 108 cases reported in only three instances did a second person contract the disease after information as to the first outbreak of the complaint was reported to your Sanitary Department. Detailed particulars in reference to all of the cases of smallpox which occurred last year have been laid before you in my four Quarterly Reports. It is, therefore, not nccessary that I should again refer to them in this Report. TABLE VII. The following table shows the number of cases of smallpox that were reported in each of the Parishes of the Fulham District during each of the twelve months of the year 1884, also the number of cases that were treated at hospitals and the number that were treated at the homes of the patients.

Contrary to what usually occurs there was a much larger number of cases in the last six months of the year than in the first. 113 TABLE VIII.

SCARLET FEVER. During last year there were 125 cases of scarlet fever, males 64, females 61, reported in this District, against 248, 180, 152, 228, 281, and 172 cases reported in the 6 years, 1878-1883. These numbers do not at all represent the actual number of cases which occurred in this District as a very large proportion of the cases that occur are treated at home and never reported at all. The above figures represent however about the relative proportion of cases that have occurred in the last 7 years. Of the 125 cases reported last year there were 57 in the Parish of Hammersmith and 68 in the Parish of Fulham against 92 in the Parish of Hammersmith and 80 in the Parish of Fulham reported in the previous year. There was last year as compared with the previous year a decrease of 35 in the Parish of Hammersmith and a decrease of 12 cases in the Parish of Fulham. The number of deaths of Parishioners from scarlet fever registered in the whole district last year was 19 against 43 in the previous year. In all London there were 1,444 deaths registered last year against 1,989 in the previous year. These 19 deaths of parishioners which occurred last year were equal to 070 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.13 per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from scarlet fever in all London were equal to 1.73 per cent. of the total deaths registered and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.36 per 1,000 persons living. In 11 out of the 19 deaths which occurred last year no information was obtained of the cases until after the deaths of the patients, and then only through the death returns. 32 cases were not reported until after the recovery of the patients. In 24 cases an offer made by your Inspector to remove the patients to an hospital was refused. In most of these cases the accommodation for the effectual isolation of the patients was not satisfactory, but the accommodation for the treatment of the patients was not so bad that a Magistrate's Order could have been obtained to enforce the removal. 25 cases were removed to the Western District Hospital at Fulham, and 26 to the South Western District Hospital at Stock well by your Board. Three cases were removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the request of your Board to the South Western District Hospital at Stockwell. 2 cases were removed by the Fulham Board of 116 Guardians to the South Western Dirtrict Hospital at Stockwell. From the number of deaths we may estimate that there were about 380 persons attacked by the disease in this District last year. When we consider the fact that there were only 125 cases reported, it is not at all surprising that the disease is not more effectually prevented from spreadingand that fresh outbreaks of the complaint are constantly occurring. Scarlet fever will never be at all effectually dealt with by Sanitary Authorities until a law be passed making the notification of infectious diseases compulsory. TABLE IX. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet fever that were reported in each Parish of the Fulham District during each of the twelve months of the year 1884, also the numbers of cases that were treated at Hospitals and the numbers that were treated at the homes of the patients.

Scarlet Fever is generally epidemic in London in the latter half of the year and more particularly prevalent in the autumn months. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet fever reported in each Parish of the Fulham District during the year 1884, the date when each case was reported, the localities where they occurred, the number of cases in each street and the number of infected houses. 117 TABLE X.

Most of the cases which were reported last year occurred in the neighbourhood of the Harwood Road Board School. At my request the 121 London School Board closed the school in consequence of the epidemic of measles in the neighbourhood. As soon as the school was closed the epidemic abated. simple continued fever. There were 5 cases of simple continued fever reported last year, 2 of which occurred in the Parish of Fulham and 3 in the Parish of Hammersmith, against 4 cases in the previous year all of which occurred in the Parish of Hammersmith.

In both of the cases which occurred last year death took place, and no information was obtained of the cases until after the deaths of the patients.

There were 95 deaths from violence, of which there were 27 in the Parish of Fulham and 68 in the Parish of Hammersmith against 88 in the previous year, of which there were 31 in the Parish of Fulham and 57 in the Parish of Hammersmith. The presence of a public hospital in the latter parish is the cause of the difference in the number of cases in the two parishes. inquests. There were 231 inquests held last year of which there were 100 in the Parish of Fulham and 131 in the Parish of Hammersmith, against 213 in the previous year, of which there were 100 in the Parish of Fulham and 113 in the Parish of Hammersmith. deaths in public institutions.

The cause of death in 15 instances last year was not certified by a registered medical practitioner or by a coroner. piggeries. During last year 16 legal proceedings were taken against persons for keeping swine in localities unfit for the keeping of swine. Of these 10 were fresh proceedings against persons who had not been previously proceeded against. Six were proceedings against persons who had previously been proceeded against, and who had disobeyed magistrates' orders by keeping swine upon their premises. Of the fresh proceedings, in nine cases the notice of your Board requiring the pig keepers to remove the swine was obeyed, and consequently no further proceedings were taken. In one case the notice of your Board was not obeyed. In this case a summons was taken out against the pig keeper. At the hearing of this case an order was made by the consent of the defendant, and he was fined a nominal penalty of is. and 2s. costs. Of the 6 proceedings against persons for keeping swine on their premises contrary to magistrates' orders, in one case the learned magistrate adjourned the case sine die to allow the defendant to remove the swine in a time to be sanctioned by your Board. One month after the hearing of the case the swine had not been removed. An application was made by your Board to the learned magistrate requesting him to again fix the hearing of the summons. At the adjourned hearing of the summons the defendant was fined 10s. with 2s. the costs. In one case the pig keeper was fined 40s. with 2s. costs. In another case the defendant was fined 10s. with 2s. costs. In one case the summons was withdrawn, as the pig keeper a few days before the day that the summons was to be heard was killed by falling out of a cart, and the swine by the hearing day had been removed. In one case a summons was taken out against the brother of the pig keeper who had been killed, for after his brother's decease keeping swine upon the same premises contrary to the magistrate's order. At the hearing of the summons before the magistrate it was contended in defence that the order which had been made did not prohibit any occupier from keeping swine upon the premises, but only the person who occupied the premises at the time that the order was made. It was also contended that the defendant, not having had a copy of the order served upon him, did not legally know of the existence of the order, and, therefore, Could not legally be convicted. The learned magistrate suggested that the summons should be withdrawn, without any order as to costs, and that a copy of the order that had been previously made 124 should be served upon the defendant. At the same time he refused to express an opinion as to whether or not the order would apply to the present occupier of the premises, or whether or not fresh proceedings would have to be taken against him and a new order made. The summons was accordingly withdrawn. A copy of the order was at once served upon the pig keeper, and a fresh notice was also served upon him requiring him to remove the swine. The notice was at once obeyed. As swine have not since been kept upon the premises it has not been thought necessary to go on with the proceedings. In one case, by the day fixed for the summons to be heard, the swine had been removed, and as the defendant promised that he would not again disobey the order, at the suggestion of the learned magistrate the summons was withdrawn, without any order as to costs. licensed slaughter-houses. The whole of the licensed slaughter-houses in the district were kept under a regular quarterly inspection during last year. In the whole district there are 26 licensed slaughter-houses, of which seven are in the parish of Fulham, and 19 in the parish of Hammersmith. At the annual inspection of slaughter-houses in September I found that three were in a satisfactory condition, and that 23 were not in a satisfactory condition Your Board ordered that a notice as to your requirements should be served upon those butchers whose premises were not in a satisfactory condition. The notice stated that if your requirements were not complied with by October 6th you would oppose the renewal of their licenses on October the 7th. In 18 cases your requirements had been complied with by October the 6th. In these cases the Ifcenses were granted without opposition by your Board. In one case in which your Board opposed the application, the applicant stated to the Bench that since your Inspector visited the premises on October 6th he had carried out the requirements, and he promised that if they were not carried out to the satisfaction of your Board he would do anything further that you might require. The license was granted on this understanding. Upon afterwards inspecting the premises it was found that your notice had been complied with. In four other cases your Board opposed the applications, and the Bench adjourned them for 14 days to allow the applicants a further opportunity to comply with your requirements. At the adjourned hearing on October 21st your notices had been obeyed, and the licenses were granted without opposition licensed cowhouses. The whole of the licensed cowhouses in the district were kept under regular quarterly inspection during last year. In the 125 whole district there are 33 licensed cowhouses, of which 18 are in the parish of Fulham and 15 in the parish of Hammersmith. In the third quarter of last year I inspected the whole of the licensed cowhouses then existing. At that time there were 19 in the parish of Fulham and 18 in the parish of Hammersmith. In the month of September 35 notices were received of intention on the part of persons to apply for licenses at the meeting of the Justices at Kensington Sessions, to be held on October 21st. Nineteen of the notices were for the licensing of premises in the parish of Fulham, and 16 were for the licensing of premises in the parish of Hammersmith. The other two cowkeepers in the Parish of Hammersmith had given up cowkeeping, and, therefore, did not apply. Of the total (35) cowhouses inspected by myself, 33 were found not to be in a satisfactory condition. Your Board forwarded notices to the applicants as to what you considered was necessary to put the premises in a proper sanitary condition, and gave formal notice to the 32 applicants that you would appear before the Justices at Kensington Sessions on October the 21st, and oppose their licenses being granted unless the requirements as stated in the notice of your Board were complied with by October 18th. Your Board also gave notice to one applicant, whose premises were situated at 100, Wharf Road, that you would unconditionally oppose the application for the renewal of the license, on the grounds that for a period of seven years, the premises had been and were at that time in a most insanitary and offensive condition, that the applicant had during a part of the previous year, and was at that time keeping 32 cows upon the premises, notwithstanding that the license was endorsed for eight only, and that the premises had been kept in such an offensive condition as to constitute a public nuisance. On October 21st your Board instructed me to appear before the Justices at Kensington Sessions. In 26 cases the whole of your requirements had been complied with. All of these licenses were granted without any opposition on the part of your Board. Your Board opposed the application of John Maguire, of Audley Cottage, Parson's Green, on the grounds that your notice had not been obeyed. The applicant said that he would not comply, as he thought your requirements were unreasonable. The Bench refused the license. In nine other cases your Board opposed the applications on the grounds that your requirements had not been complied with. The Bench ordered that the hearing of the applications should be adjourned for 14 days to allow the applicants to comply with your notices. At the adjourned hearing on November 4th, five of the applicants having complied, your Board withdrew your opposition, and the licenses were granted. 126 The hearing of the remaining four applications was again adjourned for a further period of four weeks to enable the applicants to satisfy your Board. At the adjourned hearing on December 2nd, one of the applicants having complied with your notice, your Board withdrew your opposition, and the license was granted. The hearing of the remaining three applications was again adjourned until January 6th, because your notices had not been complied with, and because your Board still opposed the licenses being granted. The Bench requested Sir Henry Gordon, one of the Justices, tovisit with me the premises at 100, Wharf Road, and decide as to what ought to be done before a license should be granted Sir Henry Gordon decided that the whole of the surface of the yard should be taken up, and the yard should be properly paved and drained. A notice as to the requirements, signed by Sir Henry Gordon, was at once served upon the applicant. At the adjourned hearing on January 6th one applicant did not apply, and the license was, therefore, not granted. In the case at 100, Wharf Road, nothing had been done to comply with the notice, and the Bench refused to grant the license. In one case your requirements had been complied with, your Board withdrew your opposition, and the license was granted. bakehouses. The whole of the bakehouses in the District were kept under a regular quarterly inspection last year. There are 125 in the whole District of which 59 are in the Parish of Fulham and 66 in the Parish of Hammersmith. In most instances they were found to be in a proper sanitary condition in conformity with your regulations. No Summonses were however taken out against those bakers who had not conformed with your regulations. sanitary work. During last year 3572 notices were served by your Sanitary Inspectors for the removal or prevention of nuisances, and during the same period 3615 notices, old and new ones, were complied with. During last year 1131 conditional summonses were ordered by your Sanitary Committee against persons for not having complied with notices which had been served upon them. Before any summons was taken out, letters were written to the persons against whom summonses has been ordered, informing them that your Sanitary Committee had ordered the summonses. They were asked if they were willing to forthwith comply with the notice which had already been served,and if they would give an undertaking in writing to at once comply with the notice. In most instances the necessary undertaking was at once given. 127 During last year 49 summonses were taken out at the Hammersmith Police Court through your Sanitary Department. 3 were against persons for keeping cows without a license. In 2 of these cases the defendants were fined £2 each with 2s. costs in each case, in the other case the defendant was fined £1 with 2s. costs. One summons was for keeping swine contrary to a notice of your Board. In this case a magistrate's order was made by consent of the defendant prohibiting him from keeping swine upon the premises and ordering him to pay a nominal fine of is. and 2s, costs, 6 were against pig keepers for keeping swine contrary to magistrate's orders, 2 were fined 10s. and 2s. costs in each case, in one case the defendant was fined 40s. and 2s. costs, 3 were withdrawn without any order as to costs, the swine having been removed by the hearing day, 32 were in reference to nuisances on private premises. In 14 of these cases magistrates' orders were made with 4s. costs in each case, 9 summonses were withdrawn on payment of 2s. costs in each case as the notice of your Sanitary Committee had been complied with by the hearing day. Eight summonses were withdrawn on technical grounds without any order as to costs, and one summons was dismissed on technical grounds. In 5 of these last mentioned cases fresh summonses were granted, one summons was against a person for exposing diseased meat for sale. The defendant was fined £10 and further ordered to pay £3 5s. costs. Six summonses were against builders for constructing houses without a proper water supply. At the first hearing of the summonses they were adjourned. At the adjourned hearing the summonses were withdrawn without any order as to costs, the water having been laid on by the adjourned hearing day. During last year 148 cases of infectious diseases were removed to hospitals by or at the request of your Inspectors, and the disinfection of houses and infected articles was curried out by your officers in reference to 528 cases of infectious diseases. A great improvement in the administration of the business of your Sanitary Department has taken place during the year. During last year your Board had under consideration the order of the Local Government Board that you should make regulations under the 35th Sec. of the Sanitary Act 1866 and the 47th Sec. of the Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, 1874. Up to the end of the year your Board had not decided to make any regulations, but the subject was still under the consideration of your Sanitary Committee. public mortuary. Nothing was done last year towards providing a proper public mortuary for the District. Bodies have been taken to the 128 porary mortuary at the Wharf Chancellors and to the mortuaries of the Fulham and Hammersmith cemeteries. During last year your Board removed one dead body of a child that had died from diphtheria to the Fulham cemetery. The mortuary Superintednent refused to admit the body, and although contrary to your Board's regulations it had to be taken to the temporary mortuary at the Wharf Chancellors. There were 26 dead bodies brought by the police to your temporary mortuary at the Wharf during last year, 11 were removed from the Parish of Fulham and 15 from the Parish of Hammersmith. public nuisances. During last year your Board took no proceedings in reference to public nuisances in the District. A memorial signed by 64 inhabitants was received by your Board complaining of a nuisance in the neighbourhood of Broomhouse Lane. Upon an investigation having been made it was found that the nuisance came from the Corrisson Oil Works situated in Townmead Road, Wandsworth Bridge Road. Your Board wrote to the Company stating that legal proceedings would be taken against them unless the nuisance was abated within a period of cne month. Since the letter was written no complaint of the nuisance has been received, but I am not able to state whether the nuisance is abated. Your Board received a complaint of a nuisance which was stated to arise from the sewer ventilator in the Lillie Road in the Parish of Fulham. Upon enquiries being made it was found that the nuisance arose from liquid refuse from the Gas Works of the District Railway Company being discharged into the sewer. Your Board ordered that a notice should be served on the Company calling upon them to cease to discharge into the sewer any offensive matter from the Gas Works. No complaint has since been received from any inhabitant of the locality. meteorology. The average mean temperature registered during last year was 50.7 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature was 94.2, the lowest 24.5. Rain fell on 150 days. The total quantity of rain registered as falling in the year was 18.05 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health
