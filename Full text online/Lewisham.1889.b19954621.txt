The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. THE BOARD'S REPORT For the year ended 25th March, 1890, Prepared by Order of the Board, pursuant to the 198th sec. of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 120). The Board of Works for the Lewisham District present the following Report of their proceedings during the twelve months ended Lady-day, 1890. The District over which the Board exercise jurisdiction comprises the Parish of Lewisham (including Sydenham Chapelry), and the Hamlet of Penge. The principal centres are:—Blackheath—Lewisham—Ladywell and Brockley— Catford—Forest Hill—Upper Sydenham—Lower Sydenham —Anerley and Penge. The area of the District is 6544 acres, and it holds a population, estimated at Midsummer 1889, at 90,812 occupying 14,503 houses. The following are some of the principal Acts the Board are called upon to administer, or by which their action is regulated:— The Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending and extending the same. The Highways Acts and the General Paving, Metropolis Act, 1817 (various sections). The Nuisances Removal Act for England, 1855; The Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Acts amending and extending the same. 8 The Sale of Food and Drugs, &c., Acts. The Advertising Stations (Rating) Act, 1889. The Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. The Board are also a Local or Road Authority under the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Acts, 1868, and the amending Acts, and the Tramways and Electric Lighting Acts, and have various powers under the Metropolitan Open Spaces or other Acts. The Board submit herewith:— A statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1890, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1887-8, 1888-9, and 1889-90. A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1890. A statement of the contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1890. The Board submit the Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the District for the year ended 31st December, 1889, on the sanitary condition of the District. On reference to that report it will be seen that the health of the District continued highly satisfactory, the annual rate of mortality was only 12.4 per 1000, which was about one-third lower than the death rate of London and other great towns, and even compared favourably with that of the healthiest seaside resorts. The Board also submit the Report of the Surveyor for the year ended 25th March, on the various works relating to the Highways, Lighting, Watering, Sewerage Works, Street Improvements, and other Works projected and carried out during the year, showing the extent of those works, and affording general information with reference to the same. 9 EXPENDITURE. The Local Expenditure of the Board in the year shows but a very small increase upon that of previous years, notwithstanding the greatly increased mileage of the roads to be repaired, lighted, and watered, and the other increased and continually increasing responsibilities of the Board, and the increased and increasing price of materials, &c. The amount estimated as required for the year in Lewisham was £35,546, being equivalent to a rate on the Rateable Value of about 1s. 6d. in the pound. In the Hamlet of Penge the estimated expenditure was £9,172, being equivalent to a rate of about 1s. 2½d. in the pound. The sum raised under the Precept of the School Board for London, and paid over to that body, was £23,123 12s. 9d. The expenses of the London County Council are not dealt with here as the same are raised by Precept through the Guardians of the Lewisham Union. The expenses of the late Metropolitan Board of Works were raised through the Vestries and District Boards, as explained in the Board's last report. LOANS. The total indebtedness of the Board on the Loan account at the 25th March, 1890, was £50,416. During the year the Board paid the sum of £5,768 in reduction of the mortgages owing by them, and raised the sum of £2,300 for New Works and Improvements. The following statement of the loan debt will show the changes made in the same in the six years ended 25th March, 1889, and the amount outstanding at the end of each financial year in that period. The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1884, was £62,734. 10 Year. Amount paid off during the year. New Loans raised. Net reduction. Net increase. Amount outstanding at the end of the year. £ £ £ £ £ 1884—5 5,434 2,150 3,284 • • • 59,450 1885—6 5,428 2,200 3,228 • • • 56,222 1886—7 5,685 3,200 2,485 ... 53,737 1887—8 6,177 4,847 1,330 ... 52,407 1888—9. 5,349 6,825 ... 1,476 53,883 1889—90 5,768 2,300 3,468 • • • 50,415 Net Reduction in the total Debt, £9,035. The following statement is given to show the amount borrowed in each period of ten years from 1856 to 1886, and the rate at which the different loans were obtained. From 1856 to 1866 the sum raised was £32,223, at £5 per cent. per annum. In the next period, to the end of 1876, the sum raised was £87,844, and the interest was £5 per cent. at the early part of the decade, and 4¼ and 3⅞ at the latter part. Following this, the sum of £68,268 was raised in the ten years ended December, 1886, and the interest was, in the first half of this period, 4½ and 4¼, but in the latter part it was 3½. This sum of £68,268 included £24,800 raised for the consolidation of previous loans borrowed at rates of 4¾, 4½, and 4¼, and the new loan was obtained, as stated in previous reports, at 3½. The sum therefore raised for new works in the third period, from 1876 to the end of 1886, was £43,468. The sums raised in the second period (i.e., 1866 to 1876) included the loans for the New Offices and for special paving works. 11 The amount borrowed by the Board up to the end of 1886 (exclusive of the sum raised for consolidation of loans) was £163,535 The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1886, was 56,222 Showing a total payment off The Loan Debt to that date of £107,313 The foregoing statements with regard to the previous Loan transactions of the Board were included in last year's report. The Board again submit the information, believing it to be of considerable interest to the ratepayers of the District. The sum outstanding at Lady-day, 1889, under each rate of interest was as follows:— 4¾ 4½ 4¼ 3⅞ 3¾ 3½ Total. £ 1050 £ 525 £ 7799 £ 8G30 £ 14,100 £ 21,779 £ 53,883 These amounts have since been proportionately reduced. RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District, at March, 1890, was— Lewisham £474,150 Penge 151,720 £625,870 The value as regards the Parish of Lewisham was obtained from the printed Valuation List which came into force on the 6th April, 1889, prepared under the Valuation Metropolis Act, 1869; and that as regards Penge was the last County Rate basis (see letter from the Comptroller of the London County Council, 2 April, 1890). THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. There have been but few patients admitted to the Board's Hospital during the year. The establishment has been 12 maintained in a thorough state of readiness in case of any emergency. Residents in the District are invited to use this Hospital should any cases of infectious or contagious disease occur in their families, the charge being only one guinea per week, covering medical attendance, board, lodging and nursing. Application for admission should be made at the Board's Offices at Catford, where forms of the requisite certificate and agreement may be obtained. SANITARY WORK. Table six in the Medical Officer's Report shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Board and the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. On reference to such table it will be seen that a large number of houses were inspected during the year, and that sanitary amendments were found to be required in a great many cases. In all such cases the proper notices were served and the required amendments were carried out. There are in so large a district many instances in which nuisances or sanitary defects can only be brought to the notice of the Board or its Officers by the occupiers or persons interested. On receipt of notice of any nuisance or defect the Board's officers will at once attend to the matter, and proceedings will be taken if the defect comes properly within the Board's jurisdiction under the Sanitary Acts. The house inspection above referred to included the inspections made under the regulations adopted by the Board as to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. Those regulations are referred to in the following pages. During the year there were 337 complaints or requests as to the removal of dust. Personal enquiry is made into each such case. In the majority of cases it is found that the men are not allowed to remove the dust on calling for the same in their regular rounds. These refusals frequently arise in consequence of some little inconvenience to occupiers or their servants at the time of the dustman's call, and as the 13 men cannot call again until their next round, the ashpits remain unemptied for a longer period than desirable. The Board, by adhering to this regulation, are enabled to carry on this work at a cost of about £3,000 per annum. Any departure from the regulation would greatly increase the cost, to the disadvantage of the ratepayers generally. The Board request all householders to observe the following suggestions:— To see that the men are not refused the dust on calling. To burn (in small quantities at a time) all animal or vegetable refuse. To place no animal or vegetable refuse in the dustbins, unless previously burnt. To cleanse and disinfect, limewash, or limewhite periodically the dustbins. To see that the dustbins are properly constructed, and fitted with covers. To forward complaints of the non-removal of dust to the Board's Offices. INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NOTIFICATION) ACT, 1889. This Act came into operation on the 30th Oct., 1889. The Board caused public notice of its provisions to be given by advertisement and an epitome of the same was also issued, and a copy was left at each house in the District. The Act requires that notice of the infectious diseases therein specified shall be sent to the Medical Officer of Health. The persons called upon to send such notices are— (1) The head of the family to which the patient belongs, and in his default (2) The nearest relatives of the patient present in the house, or being in attendance on the patient, and in default of such relatives (3) Every person in charge of, or in attendance on the patient, and in default of any such person (4) The occupier of the house. 14 The Act also requires that every Medical Practitioner attending on, or called in to visit the patient, shall forthwith, on becoming aware that the patient is suffering from Infectious Disease, send to the Medical Officer of Health a certificate stating the name of the patient, the situation of the house, and the Infectious Disease from which the patient is suffering. Every person required to give a Notice or Certificate as above-mentioned, who fails to give the same, is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 40s. The definition of "Infectious Disease" includes the following diseases:—Small-pox; Cholera; Diphtheria; Membranous Croup; Erysipelas; the disease known as Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever; the fevers known by any of the following names:—Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued, or Puerperal. The Local Authority may by order extend the above definition to any other Infectious Disease. Such order may be permanent or temporary, and may be revoked or varied from time to time. Notice of any such order will be duly given in manner provided by the Act. Forms of certificate are provided for the use of Medical Practitioners. These forms, and a copy of the epitome of the Act, may be obtained on application to the Board at their Offices. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS AND OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. The Regulations adopted by the Board under the provisions of the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, are printed in a separate form, and can be obtained at the Board's Offices. The same apply to all houses let in lodgings, with the following exceptions:— (a) Where for the purposes of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall 15 be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 6s. per week: (b) Where for the purposes of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 7s. 6d. per week. The house to house inspections under these Regulations are regularly made throughout the District. In November last a special report of the Board's proceedings under the same was prepared by the Clerk, with a view to reply to a communication on the subject the Board had received from the London County Council. The following particulars, quoted from such report, give an outline of the work done. The Regulations were adopted in 1884, and the first inspection was completed in 1885-6. The figures as reported by the Local Committees show that there were 9442 houses and other premises rated at £30 and under, and coming within the general terms of the regulations. A considerable number of such rated premises were found unoccupied, or were reported as occupied otherwise than as dwellings. Of the remainder 5811 were found to be occupied by one family each, 2206 by two families, and 270 by three families. On the first visit a great many defects were discovered, defects not coming perhaps actually within the definition of a nuisance under the Nuisances Removal Acts, but brought within the meaning of the Regulations. In Blackheath and Lewisham Division the defects found on the first visit were 572, and in Sydenham and Forest Hill Division there were 1028. In Penge, also, a large number of similar defects were found on the first visit. Notices were served in all such cases. 2nd and 3rd visits were made, where necessary, and further notices and cautions before summonses were given, and in the result all 16 the matters reported were set right without recourse to legal proceedings. The Inspectors' visits were continued until this was done. This work has been continued year by year with good results. The following figures show generally the position on the first inspection in 1885-6. Division. Number of houses on the Registers. Unoccupied, or not used as dwellings. Occupied. One family. Two families. Three families. Blackheath and Lewisham 3793 347 2479 848 119 Sydenham and Forest Hill 3859 461 2407 919 72 Penge 1790 347 925 439 79 9442 1155* 5811 2206 270 The following are the returns in respect of the Parish of Lewisham under the inspections in 1889. The inspections were commenced in April last, and were completed in October and November. Division. Number of occupied houses visited. Number occupied by one family. Number occupied by two families. Number occupied by three families. Defects discovered and remedied. Blackheath and Lewisham 3647 2566 918 163 521 Sydenham and Forest Hill 3733 2838 861 34 721 7380 5404 1779 197 1242 The figures as to Penge were not fully reported, but the houses on the registers were regularly visited by the Inspector, and all defects discovered were reported and remedied. These Regulations have been of considerable value in improving the condition of the dwellings of some of the poorer classes in the District. The Regulations, however, appear more directly to apply to a class of tenement property which exists to a greater extent in some of the more densely populated districts of the Metropolis than in the Lewisham 17 District. The whole result shows that there is but a small percentage of the houses in this District which can be said to be occupied as tenements. There are of course a large number of houses let in lodgings, but these are principally instances where. persons occupy a house and let off some portion of the same as furnished or unfurnished apartments, and in many cases where there are three families the lodgers are separate, or single individuals occupying one or two furnished or unfurnished rooms in the house. The Board here briefly refer to the results of the inspection under the Regulations, and these should be taken as altogether distinct from the proceedings of the Inspectors in their ordinary duties under the Nuisances Removal Acts. The difficulty in dealing with a large proportion of the property is that the defects are remedied from time to time, but the same are so soon again requiring repair: the water supply apparatus and dust bins are most frequently out of repair. This necessitates a continuous inspection and repeated notices to owners to remedy these matters, and the proceedings are accordingly continued year by year. BAKEHOUSES. These premises have been periodically inspected by the Board's Officers, pursuant to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1883, under which authority for such inspection is given. COWHOUSES AND SLAUGHTERHOUSES. These premises were regularly inspected by the Inspectors. In September the Medical Officer of Health made his inspection prior to the annual licensing by the Justices, when he reported that he found the various premises in a cleanly and satisfactory condition, and saw no reason to oppose the renewal of any of the licenses. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The proceedings taken by the Board under these Acts 18 show that out of 116 samples of food analysed during the year 104 proved to be genuine. In seven cases in which articles were found to be adulterated proceedings were taken by the Board, and convictions were obtained in six cases. Proceedings were not taken in the other cases, as the evidence was not considered sufficient to ensure convictions. Ratepayers are again invited to avail themselves of the facilities offered by the Board in aid of the working of these Acts. Samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left at the Board's Offices during office hours, and no further trouble in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of the sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis. The Board offer these facilities to residents who wish to test the articles sold to them for their own consumption; but it must be clearly understood that such analyses cannot be undertaken for any trade check or purpose or for advertisement. STREET NOMENCLATURE. The new road leading out of West Hill, formerly known by the various names of "The Park," "Palace Park," "Valley Road," and "Paxton Park," has been re-named "Hillcrest Road, S.E." The following Streets have been re-numbered:—Croydon Road and Maberley Road, Penge. LEWISHAM RECREATION GROUNDS. The Board reported last year the steps taken, so far as they could ascertain, as to these grounds. Not having heard from the London County Council as to the steps being taken by them, and iu consequence of several enquiries made on 19 the subject, the Board wrote asking to be favoured with an. intimation as to the manner in which it was proposed to layout the grounds and when the work would be proceeded with. The Council replied (27th February) that they could not obtain possession of the whole of the ground until the 25th March, 1890, and that the question of dealing with it would be deferred until after that date. The Board have not heard further in the matter; but they have no doubt that the London County Council will, with the least possible delay, take steps for forming and laying out these grounds, in order that the public may have the full advantage and enjoyment of the same. SHORTLANDS AND NUNHEAD RAILWAY BILL. The Board in their last report gave full particulars of their proceedings with reference to this Bill, to the date of the report, particularly in relation to the Lewisham Recreation Grounds. The Board then stated that understanding that the Bill would be further opposed, they had written to the London County Council for an interview with their Parliamentary Committee in the hope of removing the misapprehension which then appeared to exist, and of inducing the Council to withhold any further opposition. A Memorial was, in the first place, duly forwarded to the Council, and an appointment made for the attendance of the deputation on the 21st June. On the 26th June the Chairman reported the attendance of the deputation, and that, at their request, he addressed the Committee on behalf of this Board, and submitted to them that it seemed very regretable that, at the very outset of the Board's connection with the Council, there should be any difference between the two bodies when there should be harmony of action; that he had endeavoured to show that this arose not from any fault of the Board, because the position which they occupied was the same as that they took up before the Council came into existence; he also pointed 20 out that the Board had taken so prominent a part in promoting open spaces in their District, that they were not likely to do anything to injure them. That he also endeavoured to show the members of the Committee then present that the actual position was not precisely as the Council understood it to be, and by means of a very clear map which the Surveyor had prepared, he pointed out that the plan of the line as originally submitted was a very objectionable one, as the line would pass through the Recreation Ground; but through the efforts of the Board the Directors were induced to divert the line, and carry it through a very narrow neck of the ground. He also endeavoured to show that inasmuch as the new line did not interfere to any extent with the ground it would be a great advantage to the district, and would help the parish in the matter of its rates, and he stated the Board felt it their duty to give the scheme their support, and that not only had the Board taken this view, but the Bill had received the support of every other authority in the parish. The Chairman further stated that in the result the Parliamentary Committee did recommend the Council to withdraw their opposition, but that the recommendation was not adopted, and the Council decided to adhere to their position in the matter, On the 22nd June the Council wrote stating they were unable to depart from their original resolution to oppose the Bill. The Bill was proceeded with before the Committee of the House of Lords, and on the 10th July it was reported that the Committee had approved the preamble, and that it stood adjourned for some amendments in the clauses, one particularly providing for access to the Recreation Grounds. The clauses were subsequently very fully discussed before the Committee, and the provisions inserted for the protection of this Board were maintained, and certain clauses required by the London County Council were also inserted in the Bill, and it was finally approved and received the Royal assent on the 12th August, 1889. In connection with this matter a suggestion was made 21 by Mr. Robt. Vigers, on behalf of the Railway Company, for an improvement at Catford Bridge, and the Board informed him that they viewed favourably the principle he suggested for effecting an improvement in the Bridge, and requested further information as to the proposed arrangements for carrying out the improvement, the cost of the same, and the division of that cost between the Railway Company, the land owners, and the authorities interested. The matter thus remained at the end of the Board's financial year. MAIN ROADS. The Board stated in their last Report, p. 23, that this subject had received their consideration, and that they had forwarded to the London County Council a list of Roads in this district which might be deemed to be Main Roads, and at the date of publication of the Report the matter was before the Council. It has only recently been disposed of, the Council deciding that they could not accede to this Board's application. A similar communication has been addressed to the other Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis who made application to the Council on this subject. The matter rests thus at present, but in all probability it will be revived with a view to some further application to the Council. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. In July the Board received statutory notices from the following Companies of their intention to make applications for Provisional Orders for power to supply Electricity for lighting and other purposes in parts of this District:— The Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited. The House to House Electric Light Supply Company, Limited. The Electric Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited; and The London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited. 22 The Metropolitan and House to House Companies did not proceed with their proposals. On the 30th November plans, notices, &c., were deposited by the Electric Construction and Maintenance Company in respect of their scheme described as the Crystal Palace and District Electric Lighting Order, and by the London Electric Supply Corporation, their scheme including the whole area of this District. Notice was subsequently received from the Corporation, stating that they did not intend to proceed this year with their proposal as regards this District. The only remaining scheme, The Crystal Palace and District Electric Lighting Scheme, was considered by the Works and General Purposes Committee, and on the 1st February a notice of non-consent to the proposal was lodged with the Board of Trade. This course was adopted in order that the amendments and modifications to the draft Order required by this Board might receive due consideration. The amendments required were duly formulated, and negotiations were made with the Undertakers for the insertion of the same. One of the principal amendments proposed by the Board was that they should have a right (should the Board or their successors desire to use it) of acquiring the undertaking at any time after ten years from the commencement of the Order. The Electric Lighting Acts provide power for the Authorities to acquire the undertakings after 42 years from the commencement of the Order, but it was considered desirable to have power to exercise such right at some earlier period. The subject was very fully discussed, negotiations were carried on with the Undertakers, and finally an interview was arranged with the Officials of the Board of Trade. In the result an amended clause was agreed to, giving the Board power to purchase the undertaking, if they should think fit (so far as their District is concerned), after the period of seven years, and within the period of fifteen years from the 23 commencement of the Order, the price to be equivalent to the capital expenditure properly incurred with an addition of 33 per cent. for goodwill, &c. The draft Order has now been issued by the Board of Trade embodying this amendment, and the other alterations required by this Board, and the Board of Trade propose at once to apply for the necessary Act confirming the Order. The scheme is intituled "The Crystal Palace and District Electric Lighting Order, 1890," and the Undertakers are the Electric Installation and Maintenance Company, Limited. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. On the 10th July, 1889, the Board were informed of the death, on the 1st, of Dr. Fred. Wilkinson, Medical Officer of Health. The Board passed a resolution bearing testimony to the high esteem in which Dr. Fred. Wilkinson was held, and expressing their great sorrow for his widow in the trouble which had thus suddenly fallen upon her. Dr. Jolly was appointed temporarily to carry on the duties of the office until the Board were able to make a permanent appointment. In November advertisements were issued inviting applications for the office, and after due consideration of the applications Dr. Jolly, who was one of the candidates, was appointed to the office. PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE METROPOLIS. In February the Board received a letter from Sir Hugh Owen, the Secretary of the Local Government Board (31st January), stating that he was directed by the President of the Local Government Board to enclose a draft of a Bill which had been prepared for the purpose of consolidating the Law with reference to the Public Health in the Metropolis ; and asking the Board to furnish the President with any observations or suggestions they might desire to offer on the draft Bill as a Consolidation Bill; and also stating that he was especially desirous of having his attention drawn to 24 any provisions in the Bill, with the exception of those referred to in his letter, which it might be considered did not accurately reproduce the present law. The Board referred the Bill to the Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration and report. The Committee very fully considered the proposed measure upon a report thereon by the Clerk dealing with details of the same, and the Board wrote thereon to the Secretary of the Local Government Board, conveying several suggestions for alterations and amendments in the Bill; and, in reply, received a letter (20th March) stating that Board's suggestions would receive their consideration. The Bill has not yet been introduced. ADVERTISING STATIONS (RATING) ACT, 1889. This Act came into operation on the 29th September, 1889. It relates more particularly to the rating of hoardings, and in that respect comes under the jurisdiction of the Rating Authority. The provisions of sect. 5, however, are solely under the authority of the District Boards and Vestries. This section refers to the use of hoardings for advertisements, and provides that any Board or Vestry may, in granting a license for the erection of a hoarding, include in such license a condition or conditions prohibiting any advertisements thereon, or sanction the same, on payment of such sum and on such conditions as the Board or Vestry may determine. Any person using a hoard otherwise than as permitted by the license is liable to a penalty of £5, and a continuing penalty of 40s. per day during the time the offence continues after notice in writing. These penalties may be recovered in the usual summary manner, and any payments received or penalties recovered are to be applied to the expenses of the highways. The Board on consideration of the terms of the Act made the following regulation thereunder— That in all future licenses granted by the Board for the erection of hoardings, under the powers vested in the 25 Board for that purpose, a condition be included prohibiting the affixing of any advertisement to any such hoarding except in any case in which a special application shall be made to the Board for permission to affix any advertisement, and that the same be then granted, if the Board should so decidc, on payment of such a sum, in addition to the usual fee for hoard license, and upon such conditions as may then be determined ; and notice of such regulation was publicly given by advertisement. The Board have been called upon to take proceedings in one case under this Act in which their authority was disregarded. The case was heard at the Greenwich Police Court on the 25th February last, when the defendant was fined 40s. and 2s. costs. This was the first summons taken under the Act. MEETINGS OF THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES. There were in all 137 Meetings held during the year, viz., 22 Ordinary Meetings of the Board and two Special Meetings; 20 Meetings of the Works and General Purposes Committee; 11 Ordinary Monthly Meetings of the Finance Committee; and 22 Fortnightly Meetings held immediately before the Board Meetings; 21 Meetings of the Local Committee of Blackheath and Lewisham ; and 20 Meetings of the Sydenham and Forest Hill; and 19 Meetings of the Penge Local Committee.

Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, as estimated at the middle of the year 1880, amounted to 90,812, occupying 14,503 houses, as compared with 88,840 occupying 14,188 houses in the previous year. The population in 1881, at the time of the census, was ascertained to be 71,715. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1889 amounted to 2,319, of which 73, or 3.1 percent., were illegitimate. Males 1,121 Females 1,108 The Birth Rate to population was 25.5 per 1,000. In London 131,487 births were registered, the Birth Rate being 30.2 per 1,000. The Birth rate in England and Wales was 30.5, unprecedentedly low, and showed a further decline from the rates in recent years; it was 2.0 below the mean rate in the ten years 1879-88. 2 Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during tho year 1889 was 1,126, being exactly 100 less than the number registered during the previous year. Males 569 Females 557 The death rate for the year was 124 per 1,000, the lowest yet recorded. The number of deaths in Public Institutions amounted to 139, being an increase of 26 on the previous year. Of these 112 occurred in the Lewisham Workhouse; 15 in St. John's Hospital, Blackheath; 7 at the Home for Sick Children, Sydenham; 2 at the North Surrey District Schools, Anerley; and 3 at the Waterman's Asylum, Penge. During the same period the death rate in England and Wales, which in the eight preceding years had ranged from 19.0 in 1882 to 17.8 in 1888 (the lowest on record), was 17.9. The death rate of London was 17.4, while the death rate in the "Outer Ring" of suburban districts, with a population of over a million and a quarter, did not exceed 141; in both cases the rate being the lowest yet recorded. The death rate in the twenty-eight great towns, with an aggregate population of over nine millions and a-half, was 19'3, ranging between 151 in Brighton, and 30 0 in Preston. Inquests. Coroner's Inquests were held in 50 cases of death under peculiar circumstances 3 The causes of death were returned as follows:—Natural Causes 25. The remaining 25 were Violent deaths, of which 15 were returned as Accidental, 8 as Suicidal, and 2 as Homicidal. Eighteen deaths were registered as "Not Certified," no inquest being considered necessary by the Coroner after inquiry into the cases. The number of deaths from zymotic disease was 48 less than in the previous year; the deaths from measles rose from 18 to 21, as did those from scarlet fever from 7 to 9, and diarrhœa from 25 to 34. There was a very marked decrease in the deaths from the other principal zymotic diseases— those from whooping cough declining from 76 to 23; diphtheria from 37 to 5; typhoid fever from 11 to 6; while for the fourth successive year there was no fatal case of small pox. The deaths from phthisis show an increase of 17, while there is a further decrease of 21 in the number of deaths from other diseases of the respiratory organs. The deaths from cancer appear to be on the increase, one in every 18 being duo to this cause. Marriages. During the year 1889 there were 412 Marriages in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 305 were solemnised in the various Churches, 39 in Dissenting Chapels, and G8 at the Registrar's Office. During the same period there were 12G in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 106 were solemnised in Churches, 13 in Dissenting Chapels, and 7 at the Registrar's Office. 4 Total 538, as compared with 510 in the previous year. The marriage rate was equal to 11.8 per 1,000. In London it was 16.3 per 1,000. In England and Wales it was 14.7 per 1000. Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1888 and the 10 previous years.

Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of submitting my Report on the work executed and the general business transacted in my department during the past financial year, this being my Twenty-first Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. From the following Table may be seen the quantities of the various materials used during the year for the maintenance of the public Roads throughout the District:— Division. Broken Guernsey Granite. Port Philip Stone. Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total.

There was no snow during the winter worth mentioning. In the aggregate 1,242 cubic yards less material were used in maintaining the roads than in the previous year. This was due to the mildness of the winter. During the year 1028 cubic yards of burnt ballast ashes or grit were spread upon the roads and footpaths in slippery weather. The whole of the Roads at the present time are in good condition. I find it very difficult to obtain shoots for the disposal of road sweepings and slop, and this will increase year by year. ROAD WATERING. The Road Watering was carried out at Blackheath chiefly by our own horses and drivers, assisted, when required, by horses and men hired from Messrs. W. and J. Woodham, at a contract price of 7s. l0d. per horse, harness and driver per day. In Lewisham Mr. J. C. Pickernell's horses and drivers did the necessary work in conjunction with the Board's horses and men. The contract price per horse, harness and driver paid Mr. Pickernell was 7s. 3d. per day. In the Upper Sydenham and Forest Hill Division the horses and drivers for watering were supplied by Mr. W. Stimpson at 7s. 6d.; and those at Lower Sydenham at 7s. 3d. per horse, harness and driver per day. Mr. R. Winnifrith supplied horses, harness and drivers, for road watering in Penge, at 7s. 9d. per day. The mileage of roads watered is as follows:— Locality. Miles. Yards.

In my last Annual Report I drew attention to the difficulty of obtaining shoots for the dust. This has increased this year, and the whole dust collected was given away. I fear that before long we shall have to pay for shoots for it. The whole of the horses employed in this work were hired, those in the Blackheath and Lewisham Division from Mr. Pickernell, at 5s. per horse and harness per day; and in the Sydenham and Forest Hill Division from Mr. Stimpson, at 1s. 6d. per horse and harness per day; the Board finding carts, men and boys. The persons to whom the dust was given are as follows:— Locality. To whom given. Blackheath and Lewisham Division Mr. W. Appleby. Mr. Aldridge. Mr. W. Jerrard. Mr. Umfreville. Sydenham and Forest Hill Division The Beckenham and Penge Brickworks. Mr. J. Harper. Mr. Hills. Mr. H. Fisher. Mr. R. Soper. Mr. Umfreville. The total number of loads collected was 11,037. 6 Hamlet of Penge. In the Hamlet of Penge the whole of the dust was also given away. Mr. A. Mcintosh supplied the necessary carts, horses and harness at 4s. per day per horse, harness and cart. The dust was given to Messrs. Wootton, Craker, and Collier.

The total number now at work is as follows:— Parish of Lewisham 57 Hamlet of Penge 15 Total 72 The good work of constructing Flushing Tanks and manholes will be continued during the current year. There are 15 flushing tanks and 15 manholes in the Parish of Lewisham; and 5 flushing tanks and 5 manholes in the Hamlet of Penge, included in the estimates. From the foregoing Tables it will be seen that 17 flushing tanks and 36 manholes, &c., were added during the year to those already existing in the sewers maintained by the Board. The following disinfectants were used in flushing the gullies, by means of water carts, disinfecting dust bins, urinals, &c.:— Permanganate of Potash 10 cwts. Sanitas Powder 6 tons. Jeyes' Perfect Purifier 110 gallons. Carbolic Acid 30 gallons. Carbolic Powder 2 tons. Cost, about £162. An important agreement was made with the Lambeth Water Company, in which they undertook to give the Board 125,000 gallons of water for flushing purposes for every mile of road watered in the Company's District, the Board paying Is. per thousand gallons for the quantity of water used above that amount. At the present time, under this arrangement, we obtain at least 4,500,000 gallons of water per annum free of cost. This is a large quantity. With regard to the smells arising from the Perry Yale Sewer, I am very glad to say an arrangement has been made with the Forest Hill Brewery Company to construct a tank for cooling the washings of the barrels, in accordance with a plan and specification I prepared, and at the time of my writing this Report the work is actually in hand. The Sewer along the Bromley Road from Rushey Green, to Rose Lawn, was commenced on the 20th of November last, by Messrs. W. & J. Woodham, who obtained the contract for the execution of the work. It 13 is constructed with brick and backed up with cement concrete. On account of the large quantity of water met with at the commencement of the work it was not until the 16th January that the Contractors were able to commence laying bricks at the Rushey Green end. The whole of the trench had to be close timbered at the Rushey Green end, and at one time I was afraid it would be necessary to leave six feet runners in the whole length of the sewer, which would have cost a gooddeal of money. At first it took a six-inch centrifugal pump to keep the water under; but fortunately the soil changed to clay, and the wet gravel was lost. The Sewer was not completed at the 25th March; but is now finished. I think it a matter of congratulation that the houses on the Priory Estate will soon be drained. For years past it has been the one black spot in the District. There were many difficulties in the matter which had to be surmounted. The whole of the Sewers in the District have been regularly inspected and cleansed during the year. It is by the introduction of new manholes that I have an opportunity of ascertaining the condition of the older sewers, hence the importance of continuing the construction of them until manholes exist in all the sewers. RECREATION GROUNDS. A Drinking Fountain was presented, and erected in the Penge Recreation Ground, by Mrs. Blundell Maple, and opened by that lady on the 20th of July. The County Council have not commenced the work of laying out the Ravensbourne Recreation Ground; but I understand the construction of the Shorthands and Nunhead Railway is the cause of the delay. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES, &c. With reference to the Shorthands and Nunhead Railway, I had several interviews with Mr. J. Wolfe Barry, the engineer of the scheme, regarding the conditions as to the bridges and alterations to sewers and roads. I made several drawings, also a cartoon showing the manner in which the Railway affected the Ravensbourne Recreation Ground, &c., and gave evidence in support of the Bill before the Parliamentary Committee. 14 The following Schemes were deposited affecting the roads and sewers of the District, viz:— 1. The New Cross, Lewisham, Brockley, Forest Hill and District Tramway scheme. 2. The London Electric Supply Corporation Electric Lighting. 3. The Crystal Palace and District Electric Lighting scheme. The only Bill likely to come to anything is the Crystal Palace and District Electric Lighting Scheme, the other two haying been abandoned. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, ROAD IMPROVEMENTS, &c. A very great improvement, in the discharge of flood water in the River Ravensbourne, was effected by the construction of an additional weir at the Silk Mills, Lewisham. It is 90 feet long, and is constructed independently of the old wooden weir. The work was done by men in the employ of the Board; contracts being entered into for the supply of the necessary materials. A question arose as to the height. Messrs. Stanton, of the Silk Mills, contending that the new work should be six inches above the sill of the present weir. I had several interviews with them on the subject. Ultimately the new work was built three inches above the old. The new weir is faced with Staffordshire blue bricks, backed with cement concrete made with Portland cement and Thames ballast. Since it has been opened it has been found a great relief in running off flood water in the Ravensbourne. I prepared plans and specification for giving effect to the suggestions I made in my Report to the "Works and General Purposes Committee (Min., page 2G) for relieving the flooding in Penge, and on the 15th of May the tender of Messrs. W. and J. Woodham was accepted for the work. It consisted of 688 feet run of concrete culvert with wrought-iron deck beams to carry the footway, 941 feet run of 3ft. 9in. by 2ft. Gin. brick and concrete egg-shaped culvert, 570 feet run of 2ft. pipe, and 120 feet run of 12in. pipe, with the requisite number of manholes, gullies, &c., &c. The work has been completed, and in use for some time. A difficulty was experienced during the construction of the work in getting under or over, as the case might be, the various gas 15 and water mains. I think I may venture to say it has answered admirably the purpose for which it was designed, for, although we have had several very heavy rainfalls, no flooding of any moment has occurred in the Beckenham Road, where on former occasions, with the same amount of rain, the basements were flooded to the extent of several feet. I was engaged for some time in tracing a pollution of the River Ravensbourne, which eventually proved to be accidentally caused by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. A very important return as to flooding in the District was asked for by the London County Council, which was of an intricate nature, and took me some time to fill up. (Min., page 253, 14-8). Several Road Improvements were carried out during the year, the most extensive being widening the bridge carrying the London Brighton and South Coust Railway over the public road near Penge Station. It being necessary to reconstruct the bridge, advantage was taken of it to make an arrangement with the Railway Company to increase the width of the roadway from 35ft. to 45ft. In carrying out the work it appeared to me that a still greater improvement could be made by the Company giving up about 130 superficial yards of ground, to widen the road and footway between the widened bridge and the junction of the Crystal Palace Park Road. I saw the Engineer of the Company on the matter, and the result was his Directors kindly gave up the requisite ground, and a very complete improvement was made. On the application of Mr. Willcock to rebuild Colfe's Grammar School, an opportunity occurred to widen Camden Road. I made a plan showing the fence of the road set back to 20 feet from the centre of the road, and after some delay, the Leatheredlers' Company having to obtain the consent of the Charity Commissioners, the matter was arranged, and the work is now being carried out. On the rebuilding of the "Fox and Hounds," nigh Street, Sydenham, a road improvement was carried out by widening Wells Road. I prepared a plan showing the widening of this road from the corner of High Street to Mr. Early's shop. An agreement was entered into with Mr. Covel, the freeholder, to give up the requisite ground on our setting back the old fence. 16 This increased the width of Wells Road on an average from 31 feet to 38 feet. A very substantial improvement was thus effected with little cost to the Board: the work has been completed. An improvement was made in setting back the forecourt fence of Nos. 101 and 103, High Street, Sydenham, about 6 feet. During the year there were 15 communications received from the Superintending Architect of the County Council, asking for suggestions on frontage lines, &c., &c., under the 75th and other sections of the Metropolis Local Management Act. I reported on them, and the following table will show the result of these applications. There were 113 statutory notices served on builders, &c., for commencing to build before giving notice, several summonses were taken out, and in all cases where proceedings were taken convictions were obtained for this and other offences. A number of trees were planted in the roads, and a large number of street nameplates put up on walls and public lamps, &c., &c. The South Eastern Railway have not commenced to widen their main line through Lewisham, nor do I hear anything about the Station at Further Green. One hundred and eighty-two drawings and tracings were made in my office during the year, also a large number of estimates prepared, specifications, reports and letters written. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Worlcs for the Lewisham District. NEW STREET SANCTIONED. Name of Street. Locality.
