To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen,— The most noteworthy event of the year in sanitary matters was the passing of the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, which came into operation on the 30th day of October. This Act renders it compulsory for every medical practitioner attending a case of the infectious diseases mentioned in the Act, to certify, and every head of family or other nearest relative, to notify to the Medical Officer of Health the existence of the said disease in any house situated within any parish or district in the Metropolis. The fee payable by the Local Sanitary Authority to the medical practitioner certifying is 2s. 6d. for every private patient, and 1s. for every person attended by a public official in the execution of his duty ; but the amount so paid is to be refunded by the Metropolitan Asylums Board out of the rates. The diseases mentioned are small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, scarlatina or scarlet fever, typhus, typhoid or enteric, relapsing, continued and puerperal fevers. Between the 30th day of October and the 31st day of December inclusive, I received 352 certificates and 163 notifications. At first there was some friction in working the Act, but the objections thereto seems now to have passed away. The notifications sent are not so numerous as they ought to be, probably from ignorance of the duty required by the Act. I am not, however, aware of any case in which the medical practitioner has neglected to comply, 6 although he is sometimes late in doing so. There is no doubt this Act will tend to decrease the number of these cases. I have, from the first, sent notice to the Superintendent of the School Board Visitors of the occurrence of cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria (and should do so of small-pox if it occurred), so as to prevent any children being sent to school from infected houses. I have also forwarded to all parents a letter requesting that their children should not be sent to school until the medical practitioner in attendance be of opinion that it might be safely done. This Act has largely increased the work of the sanitary officers not only as regards myself, and in the clerical department, but also in visiting the houses in which the diseases occurred, as well as in supervising their disinfection as soon as the cases were removed or had recovered. Diphtheria has been prevalent during the year all over the district, and has caused a large number of deaths, as no less than 93 were registered amongst the residents of this district. In the early part of the year, before the Infectious Diseases Notification Act was in force, very few non-fatal cases came to my knowledge, but since then I have received notice of a large number. Thus the Act came into force on October 30, and during the two months ending December 28, there were 63 cases certified, and 23 deaths, whilst for the other 10 months I became acquainted with 106 cases and 70 deaths. A considerable proportion of the cases before October 28th were discovered by making special enquiries from the masters of public schools and other persons. There was only one limited outbreak in connection with one of those schools, viz., that of St. Mary's, Barn Street, Stoke Newington. As the only cases in the neighbourhood occurred amongst the scholars and their relatives, I requested the school to be closed, which was done, soon after which the disease disappeared. There were several instances of an almost simultaneous outbreak in one family, as many as 7 cases having thus occurred; in two other families 5 in each; and in two others 3 cases each. In no one of these could any 7 trace be obtained as to the source of the infection, and the . disease did not spread beyond the family attacked. In some of the houses, viz., 32, where the patients lived, nuisances were discovered, and in the others, 109 in mumber, not; but whenever imperfect drainage arrangements or other nuisances were discovered, they were speedily abated. With the exception of the St. Mary's School cases, nothing like an epidemic has occurred this year, unless those that happened in three houses in Cossy Villas, within a month, can be considered worthy of that name, I discussed the question as to the advisability of closing schools when diphtheria was prevalent in my report for 1888, and therefore need not further report on the subject. A noteworthy case occurred in Mehetabel Road, where a girl 13 years of age took into the house on April 13th a stray cat, which was affected with running at the mouth and nose, and which she nursed until it died on the 14th. On the 16th she sickened with sore throat; when a medical practitioner was called in on the 18th he pronounced it to be a case of diphtheria. On the 22nd the girl died, and the medical certificate of death was "Diphtheria' 7 days." There was not any sanitary defect in the house, or any case in the neighbourhood, or at the school she attended. In another instance, which occurred not in this District but at Bilston, the Clerk reported that he had accompanied Dr. Bruce Lawes, an Inspector of the Local Government Board, who had visited the district in consequence of an outbreak of diphtheria and croup, and had found that in three cases the disease had been communicated by cats going from house to house, and in more than one instance the children had died, and the cats also. These are not the only cases in which I had good reason to believe that infectious diseases had been communicated by cats. The Influenza.—In the middle of December, 1889, this district, in common with the rest of London, was visited by a specific fever, to which this name has been assigned. There were comparatively few cases until nearly the end of the 8 month, and judging from returns I have obtained from many of the medical practitioners in the district, it became general during the first week in January, and increased up to about the 20th, when it attained its height, and declined slowly until the first week in February, after which cases were comparatively rare. This course is about the same as in previous epidemics, and the symptoms ran much the same, the attack being very sudden, the fever being high, and either the nervous, respiratory, or gastro-intestinal organs being chiefly affected. The outbreak was preceded by a similar disease amongst horses and oats, as well as to a smaller extent amongst dogs. These animals were attacked as early as the beginning of October in some stables, and the disease lasted for nine or ten weeks until the end of November or first week in December. In another very large stable it broke out on November 1st, reached its highest point on November 25th, and ceased on December 22nd, having been later in the outbreak and shorter in duration than in most other instances. The total number of deaths from the disease up to March 15th, 1890, was 25, of whioh one was returned as having occurred without complication ; another from fever, two from syncope (heart disease), one from croup, one from congestion of the brain, and 19 from inflammatory diseases of the lungs. The list of deaths shows that although the predominant local disease accompanying influenza was inflammation of the lungs, yet that other organs were sufficiently affected to have been the cause of death. There were 3 deaths under 5 years of age; 2 between 5 and 20 years; 5 between 20 and 40 ; 6 between 40 and 60 ; and 9 above 60 years old. As many as 20 deaths occurred in females, and only 5 in males. I have no return of the cases, and, therefore, cannot say whether or not a greater number of deaths in proportion to attacks occurred amongst females. The first case, so far as I know, occurred on December 7th, the first death on January 7th, 1890, and the last on April 30th, 1890. There has been a good deal of controversy as to 9 the manner of spreading, and in reply to a circular sent to those medical practitioners whom I considered to have the largest practices, the opinion was almost universally expressed that the disease was spread through the atmosphere, but that it also was capable of being spread from person to person. The attaoks of animals some time before man became affeoted is somewhat suggestive, especially as the same occurred in the previous epidemio. That animals can originate a disease and spread it to man is undoubted, but how far this occurred as regards influenza, is not yet shown. This could best be disoussed from evidence afforded in countries first affected, which I am not aware has as yet been done. Several deaths, however, occurred since this report was written, the last was, as before stated, on April 30, 1890. Statistics.— The number of deaths in the district is below the total for 1888, as only 3,352 deaths were registered in 1889, against 3,646 in 1888. The exceedingly low death-rate (15.5 per 1,000) for that year no longer remains the lowest on record, as for 1889 the very low rate of 13.6 per 1,000 inhabitants has been reached, against 17.5 for all London, and 17.9 for the whole of England and Wales. This latter I ascertained from the Quarterly Returns. The number of deaths is the smallest recorded in Hackney since 1880, so that as a very large inorease of population has taken place since then, it is evident, whether the population be accurately calculated or not, the death-rate must be muoh lower than hitherto. The calculated increase in the population is greater than in 1888, as the proportion of empty houses has decreased, and the building of new houses has continued at about the usual rate. The number of inhabited houses in 1881 was returned at the census as being 27,503, and is now 36,500, or thereabouts. 10 TABLE I.

The table gives the calculated population in the Hackney District on July 1st, 1889, to have been 244,109, whilst I state it to have been in my opinion 246,114. This, considering the census was taken in 1881, is a singularly close agreement. The death-rate assigned in the " British Medical Journal" is 13 7, whilst I have calculated it at 136. The number of deaths from diphtheria in Hackney is given at 97; in Kensington 111 (population calculated at 196,226); in Bethnal Green 102, out of a population calculated 132,079; and in Shoreditch 69, in a calculated population of 125,340. I mention this as it has been supposed, which is not the case, that Hackney has suffered more from diphtheria than any other district or parish in London. As regards the deathrates in other districts, the four smallest are Kensington, 12.4 Hampstead, 13.1; Lewisham, 13.3; and Hackney 13.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. Now, considering the much smaller proportion of servants in Hackney as compared with these districts, and the larger proportion of poor, I think we may be congratulated on these figures. Islington is returned at 150; Bethnal Green 20.6; Shoreditch 19 6; City of London 223; Stepney 23.1; and St. George's-in-the-East 26.5; Whitechapel being only 22.9 per 1,000 population. As regards the deaths of children under one year old to 1,000 births, Plumstead is returned at 112, Hackney 114, Kensington 134, Hampstead 122, and Lewisham 131; in St. James', Westminster, there were 183, in St. George's, East, 181, and in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields as as many as 212. These show that the chance of a newly-born child living to about one year old is greater here than in any other metropolitan district with the exception of Plumstead, This is considered to be one of the best tests of the salubrity of a 12 locality, although, of course, the mortality will vary partly according to the social status of the inhabitants. The marriages were more numerous than in any other year in the table. The table also shows the great increase in the population, and the corresponding increase in the number of persons per acre, which Dr. Farr considered to be one of the chief controlling agents of the death-rate. It is certainly extremely satisfactory to have such a much lower death-rate now than in 1871, when it was 22.4 per 1,000 inhabitants, and the density of population was as nearly as possible one-half only what it is at present. How far the improvement in the sanitary state of the houses will explain this very large decrease,—I cannot say, but I believe I can confidently claim a very large proportion, for the active sanitary work that has been carried out in this district for so many years past. There is no doubt that part of the reduction has been caused by the comparative absence of infectious diseases, except diphtheria, from the district, and the smaller number of deaths from diarrhoea, which arose chiefly from the unusually low temperature and the prevalence of rain, in the months during which this disease is generally most fatal. The number of births was somewhat larger than in 1888, having been 6,674, against 6,511 and the proportion to deaths was 199 to each 100, which is more favourable than for all London. I may mention here that the deaths I report are those which occurred between January 1st, and December 31st, both days inclusive. The number registered under 1 year of age, and also the total under 5 years were smaller than for any other year in the table. 13 TABLE II.

In London the fall has been less, but was still great, viz., from 35.5 in 1879 to 30.7 in 1888 and in 1889. As already mentioned, the death. rate has also rapidly fallen from 18.8 in Hackney to 13.6; and from 22 6 to 17.5 in all London, since 1879. The deaths amongst infants under 1 year to total births, which is a very good test of the salubrity of a district, was lower in Hackney 14 District than I ever knew, having been only 107 per 1,000 births, against an average for the preceding 10 years of 130, and of 141 (in 1889) for all London, against an average of 155 in the preceding 10 years. The reduction even on the low rates prevailing in the district previously was greater than for all London. The proportion of deaths at the same age.period to total deaths was equally satisfactory, having been 213, against the decennial average of 240 and of 273 for the year 1880. In these respects the figures for 1889 compare favourably with any period since 1851, when there were proportionately fewer poor than there are now, and, consequently, there should have been a lower rate of mortality amongst the newly.born. As infants pass the greater part of their time indoors, I think these figures speak eloquently as to the improved sanitary state of the distriot. The low death.rate amongst infants was, however, greatly influenced by the weather, as there was a considerable reduction in the number of deaths amongst them from inflammatory diseases of the lungs and from diarrhsea, as compared with many former years.

Including Atrophy and Debility, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth, in children under 1 year. 5. Inoludes Infantile Hydrocephalus, Meningitis, Convulsions and Teething, under 1 year. The table shows that the proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases, including diarrhœa, was much smaller than in any other year in the table, and, indeed, in any year within my recollection. In all London the death-rate from these diseases was 2.2 per 1,000, which is the smallest since 1870, so that the low rate of 1.63 for Hackney is the more satisfactory, especially as the death-rates from these diseases has usually nearly equalled those for all London. The deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs were also much below the average, as the death-rate was only 2.60 per 1,000, against 3.32 in 1888; 3.42 in 1887; 3.18 in 1886; and 3.59 in 1885. The same can be said as regards the deaths from other diseases in the table, except tubercular affections, which, although lower than in 1885 and 1886, caused in 1889 a rather larger mortality than in 1887, and a decidedly larger (1.97, against l-64 per 1,000) in 1888. As, however, there was a much smaller rate from the cognate class of disease grouped together as wasting and convulsive diseases of infants, it is to a certain extent more apparent than real. The total number of deaths from these causes, per 1,000 population, was very much smaller in 1889 than in any other year, having been only 7.76, against 10.77 in 1885, and 9.13 in 1888. 16 TABLE IV.

Measles caused 66 deaths, but these were fewer than in any year since 1884. The cold weather in the early part of the year was not attended with so large a mortality from this disease or from inflammatory diseases of the lungs as I should have expected. In 1888 the deaths from measles reached the large number of 128. From scarlet fever tbe mortality was small, as 41 deaths only were registered during the year, against 58 in 1889, and 55 in 1888. As the disease has been comparatively quiescent for three years, the average for 10 years having been 76, it is probable that it will be epidemic to a greater or a less extent in the autumnal or' winter months of 1890. In all London the deaths from this disease in the years 1887-89 were 1,443, 1,209, and 784 respectively, which were more than in 1885 and 1886, when the deaths were only 722 and 690; whilst in Hackney the number of deaths in 1886 was in excess of those in either of these three years. This shows that scarlet fever differs in its death-rate in different districts at the same time. Diphtheria has already been discussed, so I need not refer to the high mortality except to point out that this disease has been on the increase in this district since 1885, when only 29 deaths were registered; but as a similar prevalence has occurred in all London, it is evident that some general cause has been in operation to produce the excess. Part of this may have arisen from the tendency to assign a death to a prevailing. 18 disease rather than to another, when there is a doubt on the subject. This, however, cannot account altogether for the marked increase in the mortality. The deaths from whooping cough were fewer than in any year since 1877. Id 1888 the number was 134, against only 52 in 1889, and an average for 10 years of 119. From enteric or typhoid fever the mortality was also below the average, as only 32 deaths were registered from the disease, against a mean for 10 years of 49, and with the exception of 1888, there has not been so small a number of deaths from this fever since 1880. Indeed, allowing for increase of population, there is very little difference in these years in the number of these deaths. The continuous decrease of mortality from typhoid in this district for more than 20 years is one of the most important testimonies to the value of sanitary measures, for although defects in drainage are not invariably found in connection with typhoid fever, yet there is a general belief amongst sanitarians that the habitual prevalence of typhoid in a locality indicates defective means of drainage. The systematic inspections, not only of houses occupied by the poor, but of those inhabited by persons in more affluent circumstances, for the removal of bell traps, cutting off sink wastes and rain water pipes from direct communication with the drains has, I believe, had much to do with the improved public health of this district. There was an inorease in the number of deaths from diarrhoea, compared with last year, as it was 93 in 1889, against 78 in 1888. The mean of the preceding 10 years was 130. 19 The Deaths Registered at different Ages from all causes during the Years 1879.89, the Deaths of Non.Residents in the Fever and Small Pox Hospitals being excluded but of Inhabitants in Hospitals and other Public Institutions outside the District being included.

To a certain extent, however, they are of value for purposes of comparison, and the table shows that compared with former years the number of deaths of infants under 1 year to total deaths was unusually small during the year. The same remark applies 20 but in a smaller degree to next period of 1.5 years; whilst at all ages above 45 the proportion was in excess of the means. The total number of deaths at the age-period 45.75 years was, however, smaller than even in 1888, but at the period 25.35 years it was decidedly in excess of that year. The excess of deaths above 45 may merely be an indication that there is a comparatively larger number living here at that age than in 1876.85. This can be ascertained only at the next census.

There was a small increase in the number for Stoke Newington, West Hackney, and Hackney, but a decided decrease in South Hackney, as only 1,318 were registered in 1889, against 1,349 in 1888, and 1,406 in 1887. As before pointed out, the birthrate has been diminishing in England and Wales, until in 1889 it had reached a lower figure than in any year since the registration of births and deaths was commenced The deathrate had also declined in a greater ratio than the birth-rate.

There has been a large reduction in the mortality in Hackney Sub-district, which might have been expected, as it includes a larger proportion of poor than any other, and because the weather was unusually favourable, and work more plentiful than usual. The numbers given are not absolutely accurate, as all the deaths of persons drowned, and deaths in extraneous hospitals having the word 'Hackney' only given, have been carried to this sub-division. Besides this, the City of London Union, the Fever, French, and 22 German Hospitals are in this sub-district, and after the most careful distribution of the deaths, some must have been assigned to the wrong sub-district. This does not matter much, as I have not deduced any result or calculated any percentages from the figures. The numbers assigned to each sub-district cannot be far wrong, as the proportion of births to each 100 deaths in Stoke Newington was 218; in Stamford Hill 208; in West Hackney 198; in Hackney 188; and in South Hackney 208. As the hospitals and two large unions are in Hackney Sub-district, and very few births occur in them, the proportions to births and deaths are about what might have been expected. There is also another reason for the deaths in the Hackney Sub-district being somewhat in excess, viz., because as the mortuary is in the sub-district, and all persons found drowned, or who died otherwise without being claimed (but few in number) are included in the deaths for this sub-district. Disinfection. — The number of houses and articles disinfected during the year has varied to a certain extent during the last four years, but it will be greater in 1890, in consequence of the Infectious Diseases Notification Act. Since the cessation of small-pox, the total number of other cases reported here has not altered much during any year. TABLE VII. Articles Disinfected for the Years 1886 to 1889 Years Beds Mattresses Palliasses Bolsters Pillows Blankets Sheets Quilts Other Articles' Totals Houses Disinfected 1886 96 50 15 74 195 299 50 55 206 1040 381 1887 110 64 16 79 238 185 43 67 230 1032 367 1888 121 79 18 108 289 247 17 50 211 1140 274 1889 120 65 9 86 243 233 37 36 229 1058 299 23 All the articles taken to the Board's disinfecting ohamber were, previously to their removal, disinfected with sulphur to remove infection from the surface of the articles, and thus prevent risk of spreading the disease in carrying them through the house and across the pavement to the truck. In some cases not included in the table, the disinfection was performed under the superintendence of the patient's medical attendant, who certified to its efficiency. The Mortuary.—The number of bodies received at the mortuary was considerably in excess of those in former years, as the numbers in 1886, 1887, and 1888 were 77, 75, and 113 respectively, but in 1889 they amounted to 155, of which 109 were removed by order of the coroner. I am informed that the relatives of the dead who are of a better class prefer the removal, as it saves them the trouble and annoyance of a visit from the jury; and the jurors also much approve of it, as they are often saved a long walk, and attending the inquest at a public house; but the poor frequently do object. The coroner pays the expense, and when a post mortem examination is made, it is evidently far better that it should be done at the mortuary than in a small and often dark room. There have only been 7 bodies taken there by my order, but several of those removed by the coroner's order were retained in the mortuary until the funeral took place, as there was not sufficient accommodation for safely keeping the body in the houses from which they were moved. The deaths in the other cases were caused as follows: from drowning 16, including 5 suicides; by poison (suicides), 8; accident 1; fever cases 2. These latter bodies were placed in the air-tight receptacle, and the coffin screwed down before being brought in, filled up with sawdust and a solution of bichloride of mercury, so that no infection could be spread. Artisans' Dwellings.—During the year I have inspected all the dwellings occupied by the poorer classes, which from my own knowledge, from complaints, or from information received 24 from the inspectors, I thought might require action being taken under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Acts. I found a good, deal of structural work requisite to he done, as since my last inspection many had become deteriorated by age, wear, and tear. As a result of the inspection, nearly 80 houses were improved either as regards the ventilation or otherwise in their structure. 26 houses were pulled down, 10 without a summons, and 16 in consequence of a magistrate's order to close them until thoroughly repaired, and 1 house shut up and will not be opened again. I shall have to visit others in 1890, in which the process of dilapidation was slowly but surely proceeding. The number of houses removed, during the last 10 years, and new ones of a better class built, has been very large, but as most are occupied by a similar class of persons to those ejected, their destruction did not necessarily lead to overcrowding in the rest of the district Indeed, there are so many houses unlet that the overcrowding here is, except in a few instances, not of a glaring character. The District Surveyors of the London County Council when they last reported stated that there are not any underground dwellings in this district within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act. As there have been many dwellings for artizans chiefly of the better class, erected in the district during the last 10 years, I append a list which will probably afford information to most members of the Board on this subject. I have divided them into block buildings, which are those usually termed artizans' dwellings, and dwellings in flats of three or four rooms, complete in themselves. Streets of the latter have been lately built and the flats let readily at good rents. Premises for single room letting is scanty, except in the poorer streets, where the accommodation is by no means good, and the price comparatively high, and where an almost continuous supervision is necessary to keep them in a good state, as the water-closets and drains are frequently blocked up, the water supply apparatus injured or thrown out of gear, and in many cases dust bins and other conveniences destroyed. 25 Artizans' Dwellings—Blocks.

River Lee.—The state of the Lee during the year varied very little from its ordinary condition since the Tottenham effluent has been carried into the Hackney sewers in the summer months. Towards the middle and the end of May the water has always deteriorated considerably, but this year it did not to so a great extent as usual, in consequence of the low temperature of April and the excess of rain in May. There were some hot days in May, immediately after which the river assumed a dark colour and gave off a slightly offensive smell, but the rain and cooler weather checked the progress of the deterioration. In October, when a low temperature and much rain prevailed, the river was not so bad as in 1888. On October 1st a sample of the effluent was obtained a few hours after it had ceased to run into the Hackney sewers, when I reported that it was by no means good, as it had a strong urinous smell, contained a large quantity of chlorine and much ammonia. The effluent varied at different times during the winter, but was rarely in a satisfactory condition. On one occasion, in February, it was dark and offensive; also contained much chlorine and a considerable deposit. In one or two other instances it had the smell of having been kept too long in the precipitating tanks, or of the sludge not having been removed sufficiently often. Altogether, the present is by no means a satisfactory arrangement, as owing to the small amount of water ordinarily flowing into the Lee-cut above Tottenham' and especially in summer or in dry weather, and also the large proportion of the effluent to the water. In my opinion no sewage effluent should be allowed to run into it. This applies a fortiori to any proposal to carry any effluent, however good, into the Lee in the summer months, as it is admitted by all having a thorough knowledge of the subject 27 that no ordinary means of purification will remove a sufficient proportion of the urine, or of the organie matter from sewage, to render it fit for forming part of what in summer time, and with an ordinary rainfall, is almost an elongated stagnant pool of sewage. In fact, years ago that part of the Lee which is in Hackney Parish was little better than a sewer in summer time. Dust Removal for the year 1889.—The number of loads removed, and the cost of the removal, increases every year, partly from the larger sums paid per load. The number of loads removed in 1889 was 33,881, being an increase of 2,142 above those removed in 1888, and the wages paid to the men employed by the Board was £748 14s. 7d., against £701 13s. 11d. in 1888, so that the increase in wages was not so great as in the number of loads removed. The sum paid to the contractors amounted to £4,345 7s. 3d., against £3,944 8s. 6d. in 1888. The amounts paid to the contractors and our men plus the inspectors' salary make a total of £5,203 5s. 10d., being an excess of £447 19s. 5d. above that in 1888. This is rather less than the estimated excess, which was £500. There is not any sum payable, as in most parishes and districts, for wharves on which to deposit, and for barges to carry away the dust after it has been collected, so that this sum, although large contrasts favourably with the total cost in other parishes. As usual, the number of loads removed from each sub-division were olosely approximative, as there were 11,244 loads removed in 1889 from the A Division, against 10,442 in 1888; 11,567 loads in 1889 removed from the B Division, against 10,744 in 1888; and 11,070 loads removed in 1889 from the C Division, against 10,555 in 1888. This close relation will not last very long, as more houses are being built in the A and B Divisions than in the C. The number of requests to remove dust contrasts very favourably with some adjoining parishes, in which a different system of collection and removal obtains. The usual house-to-house visitations of many of the poorer 28 streets to obtain the removal of dust, has been continued this year, as poor people often object to their dust being taken away until a large accumulation has occurred. Cowsheds and Slaughter-houses.—The number of the former diminishes every year, as there were only 83, against 85 in 1888. They were found on inspection to be in a better condition than usual, and as all the work required by the View Committee was done before the licensing day, no opposition to the renewal of the licenses was requisite. This is the first year since the present system was inaugurated in 1863 that no opposition was requisite. The Inspection of small houses occupied by the poor was continued, as well as a much smaller number of better-class houses, to ascertain their state as to the drainage arrangements. The total was 4,716, against 5,401 in 1888. The decrease was caused by a considerable portion of Mr. Sortwell's time being occupied in inspecting canal boats, under the Canal Boats' Act, and by Mr. Legg having practically to devote during the last two months of the year his whole time to the inspection of houses in which infectious diseases had occurred, so that the other two inspectors were called upon to assist Mr. Sortwell, and to take up Mr. Legg's old work at the expense of their own. This necessitates the appointment of another inspector, otherwise the usual inspection, and removal of nuisances from the houses of the poor, must be considerably curtailed. The total number of houses visited during the year for infectious diseases was 518, and the whole of the nuisances found thereon were abated. It must not be supposed that the first inspection is the chief work to be done, as not only was disinfection in the larger number carried out by the officers of the Board, but in many cases frequent visits were subsequently made to obtain the removal of nuisances found on the premises. The number of defects in the drainage arrangements of the houses inspected in the ordinary way, or visited 29 from complaints, was very large, viz., 2,612, of which 1,148 consisted of choked drains, which were cleansed and repaired or re-constructed; a number in excess of former years. Choked or broken water-closet pans Teceived attention in 337 houses, and in nearly all cases were caused by the filthy or careless habits of those using, or rather misusing the closets. New traps were provided on 537 premises, the old bell traps, which are most inefficient, having been removed, and sink-wastes, which were connected with the drains, were disconnected on 428 premises, and 126 stack pipes having a direct communication with the drains were cut off. The number of houses and yards inspected was larger, viz., 3,872, of which 506 were of yards newly paved or in which the old paving was repaved, 632 in which the dust bins were repaired or new ones provided, 561 in which leaky roofs were repaired, and 2,132 where whitewashing, and certain Tepairs were carried out. The number of defective watersupply apparatus to closets requiring repair was, as usual, large, as for no less than 1,027 was it necessary to serve notices. The defects were not confined to the poorer houses, although they occurred chiefly there; but as the number was smaller than in 1887 and 1888, I trust nuisances from this cause will diminish in future, but, certainly, unless stronger flushing boxes and apparatus than those lately employed are used, this is scarcely to be expected. Means of obtaining water from the main supply pipe to the house were provided in 145 instances by means of a screw down tap, and a length of pipe connected therewith, being attached to the main pipe. The total number of nuisances removed during the year was 9,519, against 9,268 in 1888. The total number of houses inspected without complaint was 4,710, and on complaint 1,107. Nuisances were found on no less than 3,337 houses, which were inspected without complaint, many of these included better-class houses, which were examined to ascertain the state of the drainage arrangements 30 and appliances. These figures show the necessity for an active supervision of houses occupied by the well-to-do as well as by the poor, even although no complaint had been made to your officers.

Meteorology.—The chief characteristics of the year were frequent rain without many very heavy falls, and a low temperature during nine months of the year. In January the mean was—1.3, the highest temperature reached having been deg., the lowest 24'0 deg., and the rainfall 0.65 inch, which fell on 12 days. The mean temperature was lower than in 31 1888, but higher than in 1886, and there was a good deal of fog. In February the mean temperature was 37.0 deg., or 0.1 deg. below that in January, but it was higher than in 1888, when the weather was very cold. There was more rain than in January, viz., 1.75 inches, which fell on 17 days The highest temperature recorded was 58.4 deg., and the lowest 21.4 deg., which was the lowest for the year. There was a thunderstorm in London on the 2nd of this month. In March the highest temperature was 60.6 deg., and the lowest 21.8, giving the large range for March of 38.8 deg. The mean temperature was 40.6 deg., or 0.9 below the average. The total rainfall was less than in February, being l.37 inches, but it fell on nearly as many days. The general characteristics of the month were coldness and cloudiness. April was also a rainy month, as 1.92 inches fell on 20 days. The highest temperature recorded was 64.6 deg., and the lowest 34.2 deg., the mean for the month being 45.7 deg., which was still below the average to the daily extent of 1.2 deg. The weather was generally unsettled and cloudy. In May a marked change occurred, as it was generally warm, but rain prevailed to a great extent, as no less than 3.44 inches fell on 14 days. The temperature rose as high as 81.2 deg., and on some days it was more than 10 deg. above the mean, and for the month was 4.0 deg. above it; the lowest temperature recorded was 44.2 deg., giving a range of 37.0 deg. June was a singularly fine month, as rain fell on 8 days only, but the total was 1.71 inches. The highest temperature in the year was recorded in this month, viz., 84.6 deg., the lowest having been 39.6 deg., giving a range of 45.0 deg., and the mean temperature was as high as 61.4 deg., being also the highest for the year, and 2.5 deg., in excess. There was an unusual amount of sunshine, but no unusual amount of diarrhoea, as the ground and water had not been heated up to the temperature when this disease becomes epidemic. In July, after the 13th, a decided change for the worse occurred, so that the mean temperature for the month 32 was lower than in June, the sunshine small, with much rain, which fell on 18 days, when no less than 3.67 inches were collected in the rain guage during the month. The highest temperature recorded was 80.5 deg., and the lowest 31.9 deg., giving the large range of 48.6 deg., whilst the mean temperature was only 61.0 deg., being 1.2 deg., below the average. August was generally cold and rainy, although the total fall, 1.71 inches, was much below that for July in amount, and 2 days' less as regards frequency. The highest temperature was 83.8 deg., and the lowest 47.6 deg., the mean 60.0 deg., or 1.4 deg., below the average. Although the mean for September was still below the average, viz, 55.8 deg., yet the early half was warm and dry. The mean was pulled down by the unusual cold during the last 10 days. The highest temperature recorded was 80.0 deg., and the lowest 34.8 deg., giving the great range for this month of 45.2 deg. In October the mean temperature was only 48.6 deg., against 55.8 in September, showing the great difference of 7.2 deg., between the mean temperature of the two months. The highest temperature recorded was only 61.0 deg., whilst the lowest reached was 36.4 deg. The rainfall was very large, viz., 3.61 inches, which fell on 22 days. November was generally fine but dull, and there was but little sunshine, although a total of only 0.64 inches fell on 21 days. The highest temperature was 60.0 deg., and the lowest 30.4 deg., the mean for the month being 44.3 deg., which was 0.8 deg. above the average. The first half of December was generally cold, after which there was a warm week, and then cold prevailed till the end of the year. Fogs were very prevalent, the rain fall not large, viz., 1.23 inches which fell on 15 days. The highest temperature recorded was 54.4 deg., and the lowest 24.0 deg., the mean temperature having been 2.2 deg., below the average. Altogether the meteorological events for the year were favourable to health. I have pleasure in reporting that the officers in my department have, I believe, carried out their duties to the best of their 33 ability, and certainly to my satisfaction. The work has been unusually harassing, owing to the new duties cast on three of the officers, so that it could not be carried on in the usual systematic way. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for the Hackney District. March 18th, 1890. Received and ordered to be printed. HENRY T. TIDDEMAN, Chairman.
