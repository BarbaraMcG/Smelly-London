To the Chairman and Members of the Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Contrary to my usual practice, I wish to start my report this year with an acknowledgment to the staff of the Public Health Department. Following on the removal to new premises in December, 1959, structural alterations on the building were started in Autumn 1960 and for about six months the indoor staff have had to work under very trying physical circumstances. In addition, owing to illness, holidays and resignations the shortage of technical staff became really acute for a few months, and I would like to express my appreciation of the way members of the department carried on cheerfully, willingly, and without complaint. I turn now to more general matters. As in 1959 more detailed information about infant deaths is given in this report, and it shows an increase in the neo-natal and perinatal mortality rates. It is interesting to note that the infant mortality rate for legitimate infants has risen while that for illegitimate infants has fallen. It looks as though women are not taking advantage of all the ante-natal care which is available to them. In the case of adults coronary disease continues to take the greatest toll of deaths, particularly of men, while the incidence of suicide (another stress disease) is rising. Cancer of the lung still ranks high among the causes of death and in 1960, 27 men died of this disease compared with a total of 38 who died from all other forms of cancer. I have been concerned for some time about housing in the district and the cramped conditions in which some families live, conditions which inevitably lead to friction and to mental health problems. During the year the Council's housing points scheme was reviewed carefully by a special committee. The committee 3 decided to allocate medical joints for other conditions in addition to tuberculosis and consideration is now given to the amount and severity of the disability and to its expected duration. The application of these principles seems to be working fairly smoothly, but it is too soon yet to be able to assess any overall benefit to the community. The problem of radiation hazards is concerning public health workers more and more and there have been several discussion sessions on the subject during the year. At present control is exercised on a national level and Medical Officers of Health have no official knowledge of the nature and extent of radio-active material used within the boundaries for which they are responsible. Furthermore, public health workers are very conscious of their ignorance about radiation but in answer to the demand, courses on radio-activity are now being organised in various parts of the country. Arrangements have been made for two Public Health Inspectors and myself to attend such courses to be held locally early in 1961. During 1960 a Home Safety Committee was set up as an off shoot of the local Council of Social Service. It is a purely voluntary body but includes Council representatives among its members, and I attend the meetings in an advisory capacity. Home Safety has tended to be a Cinderella in safety campaigns, but it deserves to receive more attention. Three deaths occurred in the current year following accidents in the home, but the total number of accidents can only be guessed at. Generally speaking it is a tragedy that people will not spend the few extra shillings which would buy a satisfactory fireguard for instance, or a flame-proof garment, while a locking cupboard in which to keep attractive looking but poisonous medicines, should be an essential in all homes. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the members of the Council and Especially of the Public Health Committee for their support and co-operation during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (census 1951) 65,608 Population (raid-year 1960, Registrar General's estimate of civilian population 69,400 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1960 20,261 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1960 £1,281,902 Product of penny rate £5,247 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births: M F Total Legitimate 579 512 1091 Illegitimate 24 20 44 1135 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 16.4 Comparability Factor is 0.94 giving a corrected birth rate of 15.4 Birth rate for England and Wales 17.1 Birth rate for County of Middlesex (adjusted) 15.4 Illegitimate Live births expressed as a percentage of total live births 3.9 Still births: M F Total Legitimate 15 11 26 Illegitimate - - - 26 Rate per 1,000 live and still births 22.4 Total Live and Still Births: M F Total 618 543 1161 Infant Mortality (deaths under 1 year): M F Total Legitimate 17 6 23 Illegitimate - 1 l 24 5 England Cty. & of Wales Mdx.

This table was compiled from local figures which may differ from the total given by the Registrar General on page 7. HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA INCLUDING CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Infectious Diseases. The incidence of infectious diseases was low during I960, particularly in the last quarter of the year when a total of 23 notifications was received. There is a definite downward trend in the occurrence of new cases of tuberculosis, and routine testing of school children has shown that fewer are coming into contact with the disease during their school life. This means that they are more vulnerable when they start work and move out into the world. The incidence of acute anterior poliomyelitis was low again, only two cases being notified, but the amount of encephalitis is increasing. Pour cases were notified compared with only one last year. Immunisati at and Vaccination. I commented last year on the changed programme of immunisation and vaccination, and the effects of this can be seen in the tables on pages 12 and 13. The figures were supplied by the Area Medical Officer and show details of protection against tetanus and tuberculosis as well as diphtheria, whooping cough, smallpox and poliomyelitis. Many mothers do not seem to know or remember what protection has been given to their children. This is particularly unfortunate when a child who has been immunised against tetanus has an accident which necessitates boosting this immunity, as unless the operator is told this, antitetanus serum will be given and a serum reaction may occur. I think it is well worth the extra minute required to ensure that the parent knows what protection the child has received, and is given a written record of it. This will not cover the situation when the patient is unconscious and there is no one to speak for him, but until a national (or international) system of recording is adopted, we must rely on whatever individuals can do. Maternity and Child Welfare Services etc. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council and there are numerous sessions for ante-natal and post-natal care, 10 child welfare, immunisation and school health services in clinic buildings, church halls, schools and the mobile clinic During the year a new clinic was opened in Northolt adjoining the boundary with this district. Ey arrangement between the Area Medical Officers concerned, one Child Welfare session weekly is held especially for the benefit of Hayes residents. Medical Examinations of Council Employees. The total number of examinations carried out during 1960 was 148. Of these 41 were for superannuation purposes alone, 27 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, 38 for Sick Pay and Superannuation and 42 for various special purposes. Water Supply. Water is supplied to the district by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and the South West Suburban District Water Company. The supply is adequate and samples taken during the year have reached a satisfactory standard. The water in this district is hard and does not have a plumbo-solvent action; its natural fluoride content is low. There are no dwellings supplied by standpipes, but there are approximately 130 caravans in the district and these draw their water from standpipes on the various sites. Samples from these pipes have been satisfactory. One house in the district is still supplied by a well. Samples from this have been variable, and the occupants have been advised to boil all drinking water. There appears to be no prospect of connecting a mains supply to this house in the immediate future. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment. There are now seven establishments registered under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, six of these are for chiropody and one for physiotherapy and all are of a satisfactory standard. 11 12 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION, 1960 AGE NUMBER OP CHILDREN IMMUNISED Diphtheria only Whooping Cough only Tetanus only Combined Diphtheria/ Whooping Cough Combined Diphtheria/ Tetanus Combined Diphtheria/ Whooping Cough/ Tetanus First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster Under 1 100 - 86 - 1 - 123 - 12 - 727 - 1 38 - 28 - 1 - 35 - - - 81 9 2-4 15 77 11 1 6 - 10 30 2 20 34 58 5-14 26 1045 6 - 6 4 15 92 4 37 19 132 15 + - 3 - - - - - - - - - - TOTAL 179 1125 131 1 14 4 183 122 18 57 861 199 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox Vaccination Poliomyelitis Vaccination Primary Re-Vaccination Primary Re- Vaccination 1956 627 195 - - 1957 1,030 327 2,295 - 1958 659 141 10,278 3,299 1959 865 177 8,050 11,403 1960 737 241 4,915 6,165 13 TUBERCULOSIS New Cases and Mortality during the year, 1960 New Cases Mortality Age Periods Respiratory NonRespiratory Respiratory Nonrespiratory M P M P M P M P Under 5 years - - - - - - - - 5-14 1 1 - - - - - - 15 - 24 4 2 1 - - - - - 25 - 44 10 4 - 2 - - - - 45 - 64 5 - - 1 3 - - - 65 & over 1 1 - - 2 - - - Age unknown 1 1 - - - 2 - - TOTALS 22 9 1 3 5 2 - - 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 New Cases 59 51 49 45 43 35 Deaths 12 5 8 6 5 7 B.C.G.

It is, unfortunately, less satisfactory in most respects than any of its predecessors. For the last nine months of the year the Department lacked the services of a General Assistant. As a result, no facilities were available for dealing with blocked drains, rats, mice, wasps nests, etc. Some of the work normally done by the General Assistant fell on to the Public Health Inspectors and aggravated a situation which was already acute through staff shortages. Throughout the last five months of the year there was a vacancy for one Inspector and during part of this period, for two. Consequently the routine inspection of dwelling houses, food premises, shops and factories, the sampling of food, water, icecream etc. went by default and the Council's obligations under the Public Health Act and Housing Act to cause the district to be inspected were not effectively discharged, Happily, during the closing days of the year, the Council agreed to revised conditions of service for the General Assistant and the Additional Public Health Inspectors, which should ensure that next year it will be possible to report the usual high standard of sanitary administration for which this Authority is known. As reported last year the Public Health Department moved, as a matter of urgency, from Wood End House to Springfield House, Hayes End Road during December, 1959. The work of the Department was at first handicapped by lack of privacy and proper telephonic facilities and later, by the noise, dirt and general inconvenience of building operations. However by the end of the year the completion of repairs, alterations and extensions was in sight. To end on a cheerful note it can be reported that the Smoke Control Programme proceeded without interruption. This work falls mainly on unqualified staff and the shortage of Public Health Inspectors did not, therefore, have a serious effect on this important part of the Department's activities. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following headings:- I. Sanitary Administration, viz:- inspection of the district, summary of complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, 17 offensive trades, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent control, destruction of vermin and insect pests, disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses. II. Air Pollution, viz: - smoke control areas, height of chianeys, new furnaces, the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958, grit and dust, byelaws re new heating and cooking appliances, pollution from road vehicles, pollution from railway, measurement of atmospheric pollution, publicity, co-ordinating committee. III. Pood, viz:- milk supply, ice cream, inspect ion of meat and other foods, food hygiene, hawkers of food, sampling of food and drugs, food poisoning, complaints about food, inspection of food premises. IV. Housing, viz:- inspection, repair, demolition, closure, overcrowding, improvement grants, certificates of disrepair, moveable dwellings, new houses. V. Factories and Shops, viz:- inspection of factories, (See Appendix I), outworkers and shops etc. VI. Miscellaneous duties, viz:- Petroleum (Regulation) Acts, 1928-36, Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act, 1951, Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, Pet Animals Act, 1951, Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956, Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 (Dealers in Old Metal), swimming pools, official searches.

Chief Public Health Inspector. 18 PART I - SANITARY ADMINISTRATION Inspection of the District Visits to dwelling houses re-disrepair, nuisances etc. 770 Visits to dwelling houses re overcrowding and rehousing enquiries 196 Visits re improvement grants 308 Visits re certificates of disrepair 122 Visits re defective dustbins 233 Visits re defective drainage 1108 Visits re disinfection and disinfestation 121 Visits re accumulations of refuse and refuse tips 249 Observations re smoke, noise and smell nuisances 1295 Visits re smoke control areas 1516* Inspections of public conveniences 87 Inspections of piggeries, stables etc. 67 Inspections of moveable dwellings and caravan sites 126 Visits re infectious diseases 455 Visits re Shops Act (during normal office hours) 343 Visits re Shops Act (outside normal office hours) 11 Visits re inspection of food 276 Inspections of dairies and milk shops 22 Inspections of ice cream manufacturers premises 10 Inspections of ice cream dealers premises and vehicles 182 Inspections of food shops, cafes etc. 2019 Inspections of licensed premises 37 Inspections of hawkers' vehicles and store places, and mobile canteens 68 Inspections of factories, workplaces and outworkers premises 399 Inspections re rodent control 1139 Inspections re music and dancing licences 23 Visits re sampling of milk, water, ice cream and other foods 146 Interviews with builders, owners etc. 570 Inspections of petroleum stores 223 Inspections of ditches, watercourses, etc. 56 Inspect ions of schools 19 Inspections of swimming pools 40 Miscellaneous visits # 1809 14035 In addition 1098 visits were made to premises where access was not obtained. * These figures include visits made by the General Assistant for Smoke Control Areas. # Miscellaneous visits include visits re Fireguards Regulations, Pet Animals Act, Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, Scrap Metal Dealers etc. 19 These figures are the lowest since 1950 and reflect the staffing difficulties referred to in my foreword. The reduction has been greatest in those classes of visits of a routine nature e.g. the inspection of dwelling houses, food premises, shops, factories, stables and piggeries. In other classes particularly those which arise from infectious diseases, complaints or requests for information there has been an increase. The number of visits about Improvement Grants has again shown a substantial increase. This trend is being encouraged as much as possible and is now an important and satisfying aspect of our work. Complaints. The number of complaints received was 25% less than last year. The largest reductions were offensive accumulations and deposits from 47 to 20, vermin or insects from 112 to 41, rat and mouse infestations from 319 to 210, unsound food from 40 to 11, dust, smoke and noise nuisances from 56 to 32. Summary of Complaints. Choked and defective drains 255 Insanitary or dilapidated conditions of houses or premises 96 Offensive accumulations or deposits 20 Defective dustbins 103 Vermin or insects 41 Gypsies 2 Rat and mouse infestations 210 Unsound Pood 11 Nuisances from animals 1 Overcrowding 7 Dust, smoke and noise nuisances 32 Other nuisances 47 Total 825 20 Notices Served. Informal Notices served 200 Statutory Notices served:- Public Health Act, 1936, Section 39 4 -do- Section 75 11 -do- Sect ion 83 1 -do- Section 93 17 Factories Act, 1937, Section 7 4 Shops Act, 1950, Section 38 1 Clean Air Act, 1956, Section 12 120 Middlesex County Council Act, 1944, Section 38 3 Pood & Drugs Act, 1955 (Food Hygiene Regulations) 6 The number of informal notices served was less than half the number served last year. Whilst the number arising from complaints has remained steady the number attributable to our own initiative has fallen considerably and is a direct result of the low number of routine visits made by the Public Health Inspectors. Legal Proceedings. Food and Drugs Act, 1955. (i) Proceedings under Section 2 for selling bread containing a quantity of charred material were taken against a local baker. The case was found proved but an absolute discharge was granted on payment of £3. 3. Od. costs. (ii) Proceedings under The Milk & Dairies Regulations 1959 were taken against a national dairy company for using a milk bottle that was not in a state of thorough cleanliness. A fine of £5 was imposed with 10/6d. costs. Clean Air Act, 1956. (iii) Proceedings under the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations were taken against a local company for emitting black smoke from their boiler house chimney for a longer period of time than that permitted by the Regulations. In addition the company was charged with installing a furnace not capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke, in contravention of Section 3(1) of the Act. The company was fined £5 on each summons and ordered to pay £3. 3. Od. costs. 21 Public Health Act, 1936. (iv) The occupier of a dwelling house which was suspected to be filthy refused to allow an inspection to be made. An application for a warrant to enter was granted by the Magistrates and entry was subsequently gained. (v) Proceedings were taken against the owner of a dwelling house for failing to comply with an Abatement Notice requiring certain items of disrepair to be remedied. The Magistrates made a Nuisance Order requiring the work to be done within 6 weeks and ordered the owner to pay £2. 2. Od. costs. Offensive Trades. There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on. In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage and Sewerage. Little time was available for negotiating with property owners for the abolition of cesspools and pail closets and the following table shows little variation from last year, the only difference being a reduction of 2 in the number of pail closets. With these exceptions all premises in the district are on main drainage. Cesspool drainage Pail Closets A. Premises within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 7 2 B. Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension 5 2 C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available 16 9 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon 2 1 Totals 30 14 22 Pour small private sewage disposal plants are in use. A 50% grant is available for the conversion of pail closets to water closets and for the abolition of cesspools. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Due to labour difficulties it was not possible to follow the usual practice of clearing stopped drains. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under Section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure etc. Rodent Control. During the early weeks of the year the post of rodent operator twice fell vacant. On the second occasion repeated advertisements failed to attract any suitable applicants and the vacancy remained unfilled for the rest of the year. Treatment carried out during this time was of a rudimentary nature and consisted mainly of providing householders with poisoned bait and giving them instructions how to use it. Only the least toxic of available poisons was used. When infestations occurred at non-domestic premises the occupiers were advised to enlist the services of one of the many private operators engaged in this work. The statistical report on rodent control is set out in Appendix XI. Destruction of Vermin and Insect Pests, During the year the following treatments were carried out:- Ants 8 Bugs 4 Plies 1 Cockroaches 1 23 Many requests were received for assistance in destroying wasps nests but for reasons which have already been explained these could not be met; applicants were referred to a private operator. Disinfection. In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases of which tuberculosis is a typical example. All library books however, which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library. Facilities for the steam disinfection of bedding are available when required at St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, but it has not been necessary to use these facilities during the year. Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses, etc. The routine inspection of these sites for rodent infestation, pollution, general nuisances and mosquitoes was carried out on a reduced scale and remedial action taken where necessary. 24 PART II - AIR POLLUTION. (a) Smoke Control Areas. The ten - year programme to bring the whole of the Urban District under Smoke Control continued according to schedule and by the end of the year the following progress had been made:- No. of Smoke Control Orders Acres No. of Dwellings Involved Other Buildings Involved Local Authority Private In operation 12 2937 1811 3358 226 Confirmed but not yet in operation 2 339 98 1278 174 Submitted for confirmation 2 176 114 1582 93 Preparatory work in progress 1 106 45 1028 125 17 3558 2068 7246 618 These areas account for 69% of the area of the district and 41% of the dwellings in the district. Once again all Smoke Control Orders submitted for confirmation duringthe year were duly confirmed without any objections having been lodged. The Detailed Survey which takes place before an Order is submitted for confirmation and involves a visit by the Smoke Control Assistant to all premises in the Area, provides an excellent opportunity for discovering possible objectors. Our immunity from objections may be partly due to the fact that in every case where opposition to smoke control is found I make a personal visit and discuss any aspect of smoke control which the complainant wishes to raise. Wrong ideas about the possible effect of a Smoke Control Order or the cost of complying with it are fairly common and once these misconceptions have been removed the rest is not difficult. Contraventions against the requirements of Smoke Control Order are quite few considering the number of premises now affected. Elderly people who, understanderably, find it difficult to change long established habits form a large proportion of the offenders. Demonstrations of the proper use of coke- 25 burning grates have been given by the North Thames Gas Board specially for the occupants of Old Peoples bungalows and flats. (b) Height of Chimneys. Under Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, plans of new industrial buildings deposited for byelaw approval must be rejected if the height of any chimney shown on the plan is insufficient. Such plans are passed to me by the Engineer and Surveyor for a decision on this particular point, although it is usual for consultations to take place with builders or architects before plans are submitted. During the year five plans were examined for this purpose. In every instance the original proposals were unsatisfactory but the proposed chimney heights were increased after consultation with the parties concerned. (c) New Furnaces. Seven notifications under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act were received regarding the installation of new furnaces but no applications for prior approval were made. Successful proceedings were taken against a Company that installed a furnace which was not capable of operating continuously without emitting smoke in contravention of Section 3(1). (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. These Regulations lay down the maximum period for which dark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. One contravention was observed and successful proceedings were taken. The firm concerned subsequently effected a remedy by carrying out adaptations to their boiler plant which had been previously suggested to them by your Officers. (e) Grit and Dust. Little progress can be reported on the two cases mentioned in previous reports. Although no complaints have been received 26 it is considered, by reason of the type of fuel used and the method of firing, that neither of these furnaces complies with Section 5 of the Act requiring the emission of dust and grit to be minimised and efforts will be continued with a view to grit arresting plant being installed, (f) New Building Byelaws re Heating and Cooking Appliances, A new building byelaw, made under Section 24 of the Clean Air Act, has been in force in this district from the 1st Septenber, 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating and cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, oil or solid smokeless fuel. (g) Pollution from Road Vehicles. Although the Council have no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co-operative attitude is met with. Increased activity by the Police in the enforcement of Regulations made under the Road Traffic Act resulted in several successful prosecutions being taken. (h) Pollution from Railway. The main line of the Western Region of British Railways runs through the industrial part of the district. Substantial progress has been made in the replacement of steam locomotives by diesels, (i) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution. Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. An electric ref lectometer is used for assessing smoke stains and the figures obtained are therefore far more accurate than if obtained from visual comparison with a shade card. The measuring station at William Byrd School is situated 27 in fairly close proximity to the Bath Road and London Airport but it is a considerable distance away from any source of smoke particularly in a southerly and south westerly direction; the station at Coldharbour Lane is in the centre of the town where it is likely to receive the full effect of industrial pollution and the station at Grange Park School is in the middle of a modern residential area.

Whilst it would be unwise to draw conclusions from the comparison of figures for only two consecutive years - the trend over a number of years is the only safe basis - it is encouraging to note that the reduction shown at the Grange Park School station which is situated on the fringe of an area which came under Smoke Control on the 1st September, is considerably greater than at the other sites. It is also noteworthy that the substantial reduction in the smoke pollution figures is accompanied by a similarly substantial reduction in the sulphur figures. No serious fog occurred during the year. (j) Publicity. The Coal Utilisation Council's demonstration centre was sited in the district for 6 months and made a very valuable contribution to the spread of information on smokeless fuels and modern appliances. The North Thames Gas Board's mobile showroom was also frequently used, A lar ge number of pamphlets provided by the gas, electricity 29 and solid smokeless fuel manufacturers have been distributed in proposed smoke control areas. A Clean Air Display loaned from the Central Council for Health Education was exhibited at the three branch libraries in the district for a total period of one month. (k) Co-ordinating Committee. The Committee met three times during the year. A useful interchange of ideas and experience took place and fully justified the formation of the Committee. The original members, Ealing, Feltham and Hayes & Harlington were joined by representation, at officer level, from Heston & Isleworth and Southall, The five authorities now represented on the Committee have a total population of nearly 500,000. 30 PART III - FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are:- Milk Distributors 20 Dairies 4 The following licences were issued;- Designation Dealers' Licences Supplementary Licences Tuberculin Tested 11 10 Pasteurised 12 10 Sterilised 16 12 An order made under Section 37 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is compulsory, is in force. During the year 12 samples of pasteurised milk were taken for bacteriological examination; two failed to pass one of the Prescribed tests (Methylene Blue) and were referred to the licensing authority (the Middlesex County Council). Two licences were issued by the County Council in respect of the use of the special designation "Pasteurised" for milk processed within the district. These premises were regularly inspected by officers from the County Council who took 85 samples of pasteurised milk, all of which proved to be satisfactory. In addition ten samples of raw milk were taken in the district by officers of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli; all gave negative results. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. 31 Ice Cream. Fourteen premises are registered for the manufacture of Ice cream but only two of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further 102 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream: in the majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. The methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are used by both manufacturers in the district. Thirty-two samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, for bacteriological examination. The use of the special standard devised by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, has been continued and is, for convenience, set out below:- Grade Count Faecal Coli I below 500 Nil II 500 - 10,000 Nil III 10,000 - 100,000 Nil IV Over 100 , 000 or present The grading of samples taken was as follows:- Grade I 12 or 37.5% Grade II 14 or 43.75% Grade III 2 or 6.25% Grade IV 4 or 12.5% Once again it is possible to report an improvement in the quality of ice cream sold in this district. The proportion of samples falling in Grades I and II was 81.25% compared with 70% in the previous year and 64% the year before, and on the very high standard by which these samples are graded this can be regarded as satisfactory. In sampling, attention has been concentrated on manufacturers whose products have been found to be of inconsistent bacteriological quality. All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. 32 The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. The Slaughterhouse report, made to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food under the Slaughterhouse (Reports) Direction, 1959, was submitted to, and formally accepted by the Minister. Subsequently the Minister made Orders (S.1s Nos. 2154 & 2155 - 1960) appointing 1st January, 1961 as the date from which all slaughterhouses in the district must comply with the construction regulations contained in the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958 and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations, 1958. The practical effect of these Orders will probably be that the only licensed slaughterhouse in the district will fail to qualify for renewal of its licence. This slaughterhouse was not used at all during the year and consequently the usual table showing the number of carcases and offal inspected and condemned is a "nil" return. Byelaws relating to sanitary conditions and management of private slaughterhouses are in force in the district. They are based on the Model Byelaws but improve on them by making provision for (a) hanging accommodation for meat outside the slaughtering or dressing room (b) covered accommodation for the storage of manure (c) the taking of all reasonable precautions to prevent access by domestic birds or animals not intended for slaughter into slaughterhouses. Two slaughtermen's licences were issued. 33 The following foods were condemned during the year:- Meat (tinned) 2,4273/4 lbs. Meat (raw) 721 lbs. Offal 54 lbs. Pish (tinned) 404 lbs. Pish (raw) 476 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 4,28914 lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 315 lbs. Tomatoes (tinned) 2213/4 lbs. Ice Cream & Lollies 11 doz. Miscellaneous Frozen Foods 252 pkts Milk (tinned) 343/4 lbs. Cream (tinned) 23/4 lbs. Miscellaneous (tinned) Foods 137½ lbs. Miscellaneous (other) Foods 50 lbs. Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried, under supervision, on the Council's refuse tip. Regulations requiring the sterilizing and staining of meat unfit for human consumption came into force and should provide a satisfactory safeguard against the improper use of diseased meat. Food Hygiene. Owing to staff shortages the number of visits to food premises was 25% down on last year. As far as possible attention was directed to the education of food handlers which is now the most important aspect of this part of the Public Health Inspector's work. Pull advantage was taken of supplies of posters on this subject issued by the Central Council for Health Education and the Ministry of Health. They were distributed to all food premises and particularly to large canteen kitchens, and were changed at frequent intervals so as to retain the interest of catering staff. The open-fronted fish shop appears to have had its day. During the year further progress took place in converting this type of shop to the more hygienic, and aesthetically more satisfying fixed shop window. 34 New Codes of Practice for hygiene in the Retail Pish Trade issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food lay down standards which are already common practice in the district. No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955, have been granted. Byelaws made under Section 15 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950. Hawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and, since the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, came into force, has extended to all classes of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Pood Hygiene Regulations. Mobile shops from which groceries, meat, fish, ice cream, refreshments, etc. are sold, are all fitted with wash basins, and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. Number of hawkers registered 46 Number of hawkers' storage premises registered 8 Sanpling of Food and Drugs, (a) For many years it has been the practice to take samples, for bacteriological examination, of those classes of food such as cream cakes, meat products, shell fish etc. which have been found to be associated with outbreaks of food poisoning. For reasons already stated this practice had to be discontinued during the latter half of the year. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory, for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following 35 table and supplementary information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (New) 134 16 Milk (Var.) 37 - Butter and Margarine 14 - Cakes 5 - Cream 8 - Drugs 12 - Pish & Pish Products 27 3 Fruit - Fresh and Canned 7 - Ice Cream 13 - Meat & Meat Products 25 - Preserves 4 - Sausages etc. 4 - Spirits 3 - Sweets 4 - Vinegar 10 - Miscellaneous 14 - Total 321 19 "New Milk. Twelve of the samples shown to be unsatisfactory were found to contain added water. All these samples originated from the same farm and the average added water content on three separate consignments sampled were found to be 2.4%, 2.46%, 1.52%. The farmer has been in business on the same farm for 41 years without any previous complaint and having reached the age of 70 years was due to retire. The matter was dealt with by an official caution." "The other four samples shown to be unsatisfactory were slightly deficient in butter-fat content and were drawn from single churns forming part of large consignments. The average butter-fat content for the whole consignment was satisfactory. "Fish. Three samples of fried Haddock and Chips were purchased in the district from the same shop. The fish proved to be Cod. Legal proceedings were instituted and the defendant Company was fined five guineas on each of two charges and were ordered to pay three guineas costs. 36 "Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 . 19S3. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926 are complied with. These orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, toiratoes, currants, raisins, sultanas, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. Inspections were made at 92 premises and of 168 displays of these foodstuffs. Any infringements detected were of a minor nature and were dealt with by verbal warning." "Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the Registered Trade Mark of the packer and labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name if any, and in the case of a compound food with the name of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 167 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 72 different premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above regulations. "False and Misleading Descriptions. Pood advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the Local Councils and work under this heading is combined with inspections made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Pood Order." "Examples where corrective action was sought are doughnuts described as "Cream Doughnuts" but containing imitation cream, "butter cream fancies" which contained imitation cream, descriptions of sweets which falsely suggested that they contained fruit, oranges falsely described as seedless, and cheese spreads described as "cream cheese" . Special Designated Milk. During 1960 my Council issued two Dealers (Pasteurisers' ) Licences in respect of premises within your area where milk is processed. These premises were regularly inspected and compliance with statutory requirements was well maintained. A total of 85 designated milks was taken, all of which proved to be satisfactory." 37 "Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, ten samples of raw milk were procured within your area and submitted to tests for the presence of tubercle bacilli. No contamination was revealed." Food Poisoning. One outbreak of food poisoning involving seven persons occurred during the year. The causative organism was Clostridium Welchii (heat resistant) and whilst it was not possible to obtain any samples of food from the suspected meal for bacteriological examination it is probable that braised steak eaten in a factory canteen was the cause of the outbreak. Complaints about Food. Only eleven complaints were received, compared with forty last year, about food alleged to be contaminated, unsound or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded; proceedings were taken in two instances. Inspection of Food Premises. (a) Inspections Premises Total Number in District Inspections made Restaurants and Cafes 95 557 Ice Cream Dealers and Manufacturers 116 192 Licensed Premises 40 37 Dairies and Milk Distributors premises 24 22 Preserved Pood Premises 61 111 Bakehouses 17 58 Butchers shops 39 268 Grocers shops 70 400 Fish shops 18 94 Greengrocers shops 50 256 Food Hawkers premises 8 20 Mobile Canteens 4 18 38 (b) Defects remedied Cleanliness improved 74 Structural repairs 15 Lighting improved 4 Ventilation improved 2 Equipment improved 9 Hot water supplies improved 9 Clean towels provided 44 Food storage accommodation improved 3 Rodent infestations abated 14 Sanitary accommodation provided or improved 9 Sinks provided or renewed 5 Other improvements 35 39 PART IV - HOUSING The clearance of unfit houses proceeded on a small scale but the duty of carrying out the routine inspection of dwelling houses went by default during most of the year. Inspection of Houses during the year. 1. (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 414 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 807 2. (a) Number of dwelling houses which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations 1925 and 1932 42 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 81 3. Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation _ 4. Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-heading) found not to be in all respect reasonably fit for human habitation 88 Remedy of Defects, etc. during the year without the service of Formal Notices. (a) Number of dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers 43 (b) Number of dwellings in respect of which voluntary undertakings not to re-let on termination of present tenancy were given - (c) Number of unfit dwellings closed in pursuance of voluntary undertakings - (d) Number of unfit dwellings demolished voluntarily - Action under Statutory Powers during the Year. (1) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act. 1957. (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs - 40 (b) Number of dwelling houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (i) by owners - (ii) by Local Authority in default of owners - (2) Proceedings under Public Health Act, 1936 (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 17 (b) Number of dwelling houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices: (i) by owners 20 (ii) by Local Authority in default of owners - (3) Proceedings under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made or Undertakings given (b) Number of dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders 2 (4) Proceedings under Section 16 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of dwellings in respect of which Closing Orders were made - (b) Number of dwellings closed in pursuance of Closing Orders 1 (c) Number of dwellings in respect of which Closing Orders were determined, the dwellings having been rendered fit - (5) Proceedings under Section 44 of the Housing Act, 1957. (a) Number of Clearance Areas declared 1 (b) Number of unfit dwellings included in Clearance Areas 8 (c) Number of unfit dwellings in Clearance Areas demolished 16 Overcrowding. At the end of the year only 14 dwellings were known to be overcrowded. This figure represents 0.07% of the total dwellings in the district showing that statutory overcrowding has now ceased to be a problem. The legal standard for overcrowding is however a very low one and generally held to be out-of-date and In need of revision. 41 A child under 12 months of age is not taken into account when determining the number of persons who may occupy a house, a child between one and ten years old is only deemed to require half the space that an adult occupies, all rooms (except the kitchen) are expected to be available for sleeping purposes and the definition of sexual overcrowding fails to recognise the right of husband and wife to occupy the same bedroom. Improvement Grants. The increased interest in Improvement Grants mentioned in my last report continued throughout the year and the number of applications received, whilst still not large, was much greater than in any previous year. Twenty-two applications for Standard Grants were received; one was subsequently withdrawn and two were refused on account of the proposals not complying with the statutory conditions. Nineteen applications for Discretionary Grants were received. One was withdrawn before it was considered by the Public Health Committee and one application was refused for reasons which are set out below: in the other seventeen cases maximum grants were approved. In the case which was not granted the applicant had a growing family and had an urgent need for an additional bedroom, which formed the basis of his proposals. The Act provides for grants for the "enlargement " of dwellings and the Clerk and Solicitor of the Council was satisfied with the legality of the application. Quite fortuitously, however, and only a matter of hours before the matter was to be considered by the Public Health Committee, it was learned that it was now contrary to Ministry policy to allow this type of improvement for grant and that in the event of the Council approving the application the usual re-imbursement by the Ministry of part of the expenses, would not be forthcoming. When Improvement Grants were first introduced by the Act of 1949 the Ministry issued Practice Notes which gave Local Authorities a fairly clear picture of the kind of improvement which was eligible for grant. These Notes were withdrawn in 1954 but it appears that a revised set would serve a useful purpose to Local Authorities and their Officers who are entrusted with the administration of this scheme. 42 Certificates of Disrepair. The following action was taken under the Rent Act, 1957 in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 8 Landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 7 Undertakings given by Landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 4 Undertakings by Landlords not accepted - Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) 11 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair refused (Form R.C.3) 3 Certificates of Disrepair cancelled (Form R.C.2) 6 Applications by Landlord or tenant for Certificate as to the remedying of Defects which Landlord has undertaken to remedy (Form 0) 6 Certificates issued as to the Remedying of Defects specified in a Landlord's Undertaking to remedy Defects (Form P) 9 Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 5 Moveable Dwellings. The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, came into force during the year. It makes it necessary for site operators to obtain planning consent before a site licence can be issued. Model conditions for incorporation in licences have been laid down by the Ministry. To avoid involving both the Public Health Committee and Town Planning Committee in this matter and as planning consent is an essential preliminary to a site licence, the enforcement of the Act has been entrusted to the Town Planning Committee. Consultation between the Engineer and Surveyor's Department and the Public Health Department takes place on applications for Site Licences. 43 New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and Private Developers:- Council: Houses 22 Old Persons' dwellings - Flats 99 Maisonettes 12 Private Development: Dwellings 128 Housing Association: Dwellings - 44 PART V - FACTORIES AND SHOPS Factories Act, 1937. There are one hundred and sixty-two factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including:- Aircraft, bread and confectionery, building materials, car accessories, caravans, carbon products, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, electrical transformers, electronic devices, furniture, lubricating oil, optical lenses, radar, gramophone records and gramophones, rubber products, tarmacadam, steel wool and wood block floors. Pull details of the inspections carried out and notices served are set out in Appendix 1 to this report. Outworkers. Part VII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons carrying out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. There are 97 outworkers in the district and 84 inspections were made; in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops Act. All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to 665 premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 343 visits. In addition 11 tours of duty were undertaken outside normal office hours i.e. in the evenings and on Sundays. As a result three informal notices were served but in no instance was it considered necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises, is held in the Public Health Department. 45 PART VI - MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulations) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide, During the year 106 licences were issued in respect of: - 155,885 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures. 34,785 gallons of cellulose solutions. 896 lbs. of calcium carbide. All licences now incorporate the Model Licensing Conditions suggested by the Home Office in 1957 and the latest recommendations of the Home Office for electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps have been adopted. This work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified officer in the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. During the year 223 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and one minor infringement was dealt with by warning letter. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district the Act does not apply to any of them as the type of filling generally used is outside the scope of the Act. All premises used for upholstery and similar trades are visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and the type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas, electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted. Such appliances are sold at 41 shops in the district and all were visited by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are 46 sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Three premises are licensed under the Act and 12 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the Licence. Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act, relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and in this district, which is still partly rural, serve a useful purpose. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the local authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises of which there are four, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. Swimming Pools. There is no public swimming pool in the district. A practice pool at a local secondary school is equipped with automatic dosing equipment. Pressure filters giving continuous filtration are part of the installation. A swimming pool is one of the amenities provided at a new hotel in the district. Continuous filtration and automatic chlorination is carried out. Samples of water from both these pools were taken regularly and only one out of 14 was unsatisfactory. These results show that the arrangements for purification of the water were working satisfactorily. Official Searches. During the year 1407 applications for information from Persons proposing to acquire premises in the district were dealt with. Each one required answers to questions about sanitary notices or orders (outstanding or contemplated). Smoke Control Orders, Certificates of Disrepair and Slum Clearance. 47 48 Appendix I Part A.
