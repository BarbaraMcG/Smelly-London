AC. 439(1) ENF 45 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1961 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1961 3 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1961. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Enfield. I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for 1961. Steady progress continues to be made in improving environmental conditions which affect our health and well-being. The prevention and control of infectious disease must still be considered to be one of the most important aspects of the work of the Health Department, although medical and other influences have, over the years, tended considerably to change the emphasis of our efforts and methods. During the year, measles was the most prevalent infection and faithfully followed its expected course. With the advances being made in work on viruses, perhaps we may expect in due course, an effective vaccine against this disease. The number of cases of pneumonia showed a considerable increase, possibly due to climatic conditions affecting the elderly. Whooping Cough and most of the other notifiable diseases were of very low incidence. There were only four cases of Sonne dysentery notified. This is unusually low for this type of infection, but it is a condition likely to vary considerably in its incidence as it is so easily influenced by careless personal hygiene. Although the number of cases of tuberculosis was somewhat higher than the previous year's low figure, the number of deaths was only two from the respiratory form and one from other forms, a total of three which is the lowest ever recorded. With this figure of two deaths from respiratory tuberculosis one must compare the forty-three from cancer of the lung and 4 bronchus, which surely brings forcibly home to us the alarming problem of lung cancer and its related causes, upon which so many authoritative pronouncements have recently been made. At the end of the year information was received of the diagnosis of a case of smallpox in the London area, and subsequent weeks were spent in dealing with contacts of cases by vaccination and surveillance, but no case developed in the Borough. There was a very great demand for vaccination from the public generally, but it was not considered necessary nor desirable in the circumstances to arrange public vaccination clinics. It is hoped that this timely reminder will encourage parents to ensure that children are vaccinated against smallpox in infancy as this is the most suitable and desirable time for primary vaccination which can safely be followed in an emergency by re-vaccination if circumstances warrant it. I have been stressing for many years the need for greater acceptance by parents of the facilities available for vaccination, and in addition, as long ago as 1950, I referred in my Annual Report to the fact that I considered a case could be made for greater powers to deal with the control of smallpox contacts, and also greater powers to ensure the possession of a valid vaccination certificate from persons entering this country from infected areas. The vital statistics of the Borough will be seen to compare favourably with those for England and Wales and no special aspect requires to be mentioned. Unauthorised parking of caravans created considerable concern during the year and much time and effort was expended in dealing with this ever-recurring problem. The question of private caravan sites and the possibility of a municipally controlled site have also received careful consideration and some progress was made. This leads me to the question of satisfactory housing conditions which are essential for the health and well-being of the community. During the year over one hundred houses were reported by me to be unfit for human habitation. Although one may consider the problem of unfit houses to be relatively small in Enfield when compared with many other areas, nevertheless, continuous effort must continue to be made in this direction because it is not a static problem. The programme of clearance of unfit houses for the five years ended December, 1960, was not quite achieved, and the programme submitted for the following five years, containing over four hundred houses, will create problems of rehousing, but the Council hopes to 5 be able to overcome those difficulties in the interests of public health. It was interesting to receive a visit in the early summer from the Medical Officer of Health of the City of Enfield, South Australia, who showed keen interest in the Health Organisation in the Borough, and who was given the opportunity of visiting several of the local Health establishments. In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the service of the Staff of the Health Department during the year. Wii.liam D. Hyde, Medical Officer of Health. 6 BOROUGH OF ENFIELD Alderman E. J. Rayment, J.P. Mayor Councillor E. T. Hendrick Deputy Mayor Mrs. G. M. Jay, J.P. W. G. Bowyer, Esq. D. R. J. Boxall, Esq. Miss C.

Of the 33 infants who died before reaching the age of 1 year, 27 died within the first 4 weeks of life, and of this number, 25 occurred in infants under 1 week. The infant mortality rate for the Borough is 21.14. INQUESTS Thirty-six inquests and two hundred and twenty-two post mortem examinations without inquests were held during the year. Of these, two hundred and twenty-five deaths were due to natural causes, 25 to accidental causes and 8 to suicide. 12 FATAL ACCIDENTS During the year under review there were 9 fatal home accidents to Enfield residents being 4 more than the previous year. All except one of these accidents occurred amongst elderly people, 4 being over 80 years of age and 3 between 70 and 80 years of age. The precipitating cause of death in 8 cases was a fall leading in most instances to fractured bones followed usually by lung complications, and the remaining case was a child aged 15 months who was accidentally suffocated whilst in her cot. The number of fatal Road Accidents to Enfield residents during the year was 14 which was an increase of 2 on the previous year. Unfortunately there were also 8 (6 male and 2 female) cases of suicide, 3 of which were in the 25-45 years age group, 4 aged between 45 and 65 years and one aged 70 years of age. It is disquieting to note the sum total of human misery recorded in these paragraphs and to ponder over the fact that so much could and should be prevented. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 AND 1951. No action was necessary during the year under these Acts. Such cases as were brought to the notice of the Health Department were dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health in cooperation either with the Medical Practitioners or Welfare Officer, and the patients voluntarily agreed to go to Hospital or suitable Institution. Most old people show a natural reluctance to leave their homes, which sometimes consist of a single room in a dirty and unhygienic state owing to their inability to look after the premises. Some should not be living alone, and although we must not be hasty to criticize, there appears to be in some cases a need for the awakening of responsibility of the family to its aged members. In some instances, where reluctance to leave their homes is encountered, provision of Home Help and District Nurse Services can be arranged and a careful watch on the situation maintained by members of the Health Department Staff. Compulsory removal in the interests of the old person is rarely enforced, as persuasion usually succeeds in the end. 13 AMBULANCE SERVICE The headquarters of this service which comes under the control of the County Medical Officer, Middlesex County Council, are at Kenton, Middlesex. All telephone calls and enquiries regarding the ambulance service in Enfield are routed through an ambulance control depot which is situated in Edmonton. The Emergency telephone call service can be used for urgent calls, and for dealing with emergencies in Enfield, one accident ambulance is kept at Ponders End Fire Station and another at the Ambulance Sick Removal Depot, The Ridgeway, near Chase Farm Hospital. There are also kept at the Sick Removal Depot, a number of ambulances for dealing with more routine duties including the transport of outpatients and sitting cases to hospitals for treatment. WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, except for part of the Hadley Wood and Cockfosters area, which is supplied by the Lee Valley Water Company. Both of these Authorities take regular and frequent samples for analysis. Copies of the reports on these are sent to the Health Department, and have shown satisfactory results. There was no cause to suspect any contamination during the year. The question of well-water supplies, both in connection with dwelling-houses and industrial premises, throughout the Borough has received the careful attention of the Department during the year, and every care has been exercised to see that such supplies are not used for drinking purposes where mains water supply is available. There is now only one dwelling in Enfield which relies solely on well water for its water supply and this is under regular supervision. MEDICAL ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYEES. The following medical examinations or assessments of employees were carried out during the year:— (1) Superannuation Act: Medical examinations 38 Assessments without medical examinations 68 (2) Sick Pay Scheme: Medical examinations 91 Assessments without medical examinations 61 14 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1961 This Act, which is an important contribution to public health legislation, came into operation in October. The purpose of the Act is mainly to amend the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, relating to building bye-laws and trade effluents, and also public health matters formerly dealt with under local acts. Part II of the Act deals with building byelaws, sewers, drains and sanitary conveniences; buildings and structures; accumulations of rubbish; and filthy or verminous premises and articles. Part III deals with the prevention and notification of infectious disease, and gives powers of medical examination of persons in certain circumstances; makes provision for information to be furnished by the occupier of premises in cases of notifiable disease or food poisoning; provides for the exclusion of children from places of entertainment, etc., with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease; makes provisions for compensating persons who, on the request of the Medical Officer of Health discontinue work to prevent the spread of notifiable disease and in connection with the selling to children under the age of fourteen years, by dealers in rags and old clothes, adds any animal, fish, bird or other living thing to "article" as used in the Public Health Act, 1936. Part IV deals with streets and public places. Part V deals with trade effluents. Part VI deals with a miscellaneous number of items, including the power to reduce the numbers of pigeons and other birds in built-up areas, as well as powers to make bye-laws relating to hairdressers and barbers. (Byelaws have been in existence in Enfield since 1937.) HOUSING Number of new houses erected during the year by:— (a) Local Authority 80 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons 143 With State assistance (included in above totals):— (a) Local Authority 80 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons — 15 1.

The Minister intends making Regulations whereby a local authority may require satisfactory management of houses let in lodgings, persons managing such property being responsible for the provision of services and facilities, and repairs and cleanliness, including satisfactory arrangements for the disposal of refuse and litter. A local authority may serve a notice requiring the execution of specified works if the amenities are unsatisfactory, and are also empowered to carry out these works in default. Provision of means of escape from fire, as the local authority considers necessary, may be enforced by the service of a notice, and the number of persons occupying a house let in lodgings can be limited with a view to preventing or abating overcrowding. Another provision of the Act is that, in respect of a house where a demolition order has become operative, local authorities have power under this Act to determine the demolition order, and substitute a closing order to enable the house to be used otherwise than for human habitation. 17 HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 This Act which came into operation on 14th June, 1959, made provision for house owners and certain leaseholders to claim, as a right, half the cost up to a maximum of £155 of installing five basic improvements:—a bath or shower, a wash-hand basin, a water closet, a hot water system and a food store. To qualify for a standard grant, a house must, after improvement, be provided with all five standard amenities and they must be for the exclusive use of the occupants. If a house is already provided with some of the standard amenities, a grant can be claimed towards the cost of installing the remainder. The popularity of this Act is evinced from the increased number of visits made by the inspectorial staff, 2,350 against 2,232 for the previous year, for in addition, there is the existing Discretionary Grant Scheme where grants are payable for a wider range and more extensive forms of improvements including the conversion or adaptation of larger houses and other buildings. Commencing with a preliminary inspection to determine the fitness of the property and its suitability for a grant, it is necessary, upon the Council agreeing to make a grant, to make several subsequent visits to ensure that the conditions of the Grant Scheme are being observed. RENT ACT 1957 No. of applications received for Certificates of Disrepair 27 No. of undertakings received from landlords 16 No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued 10 No. of applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair received from landlords 4 No. of objections to cancellations received from tenants 2 No. of Certificates of Disrepair cancelled 3 No. of Certificates as to Remedying of Defects which the Landlord has Undertaken to Remedy: Issued to tenants — Issued to landlords 3 THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES ACT, 1958. THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES (HYGIENE) REGULATIONS, 1958. THE SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS (PREVENTION OF CRUELTY) REGULATIONS, 1958. THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE REPORTS (APPOINTED DAY) ORDER, 1959. As stated in my report last year the Council submitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the required 18 house Report on the existing and probable future requirements of the District, and the facilities which were available to meet those requirements. The Minister has since replied stating that he proposes to accept the Slaughterhouse Report, and will make the Appointed Day, by which the sole slaughterhouse in the Borough shall comply with the requirements of the Regulations, to be 1st January, 1963. Unsuccessful endeavours have been made to find an alternative site for this slaughterhouse. Meanwhile, an appeal against the planning authority's refusal of planning permission to allow work in connection with the development of the existing slaughterhouse has been made.

Method of Disposal of Condemned foods All unfit foodstuffs were destroyed in the Council's Refuse Destructor furnaces. THE FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960. The importance of food hygiene was stressed on every possible occasion during the year. One thousand and thirty-three visits 21 were made to food premises of all types, including stalls in the openair market. There are twelve food stall-holders trading regularly in the Market. These are, five dealing in fruit and vegetables, two pre-packed groceries, two wet and dry fish, one fresh meat, one sweet confectionery, and one refreshment. The Regulations respecting stalls were enforced, but these are less stringent than those applying to permanent premises. Co-operation with the local Hospital Management Committee was continued in maintaining hospital kitchens at the standard set by the Regulations. Two new factory canteens were erected during the year to replace less satisfactory premises, and another, additional to existing arrangements, was completed. Plans for four others were advanced and work commenced on them during the year. The Women's Voluntary Service converted and equipped a room at its premises in the Borough for the preparation and cooking of " meals-on-wheels " for elderly folk. Improvements of a general character were carried out in thirty-five food premises. As during previous years, protection of food on display by refrigeration continued to increase. The importance of this form of display and protection is being increasingly appreciated by many food traders. Amongst the many complaints investigated were those about food and drink containing articles such as dirt, part of a cigarette, glass, string, mould, and larvae, pupae and adult insects. Complaints about discolouration and abnormal smells and taste of foodstuffs were also investigated. Proceedings were instituted against an ice-cream vendor in respect of contraventions of the Regulations committed whilst selling ice-cream from a van as a result of which a conviction was secured resulting in a fine of £40, plus £2 2. Od. costs. Proceedings were instituted against the proprietors of a cafe in the Borough in respect of various offences against the Regulations which were committed on the premises. A conviction was secured resulting in a fine of £100, plus £5 5s. 0d. costs. These premises were later found to have been abandoned and locked up, and unused food had been left exposed, resulting in the breeding of a very large number of blowflies. As entry to the premises could not be obtained, insecticidal powder was pumped under pressure through the letter-box, and when entry to the premises was effected, the flies were swept up and found to be sufficient to fill a fairly large cardboard carton. 22 As a result of a complaint which was received regarding a mouldy malt loaf, proceedings were taken against the proprietors of the shop from which the loaf was purchased, resulting in a fine of £5, plus £3 3s. Od. costs. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 The following table gives details of the samples of foods and drugs procured under the above Act in Enfield by the Food and Drugs Authority during 1961:- Article. Total samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Milk (various) 26 — Milk (new) 168 19 Butter and Margarine 12 — Cakes and Bread 6 1 Sausages 5 — Preserves 5 — Meat and Meat Products 40 1 Cream 2 — Drugs 10 — Fish and Fish Products 9 — Sweets and Chocolate 5 1 Spirits 25 — Fruit—Fresh and Canned, etc. 21 3 Vinegar and Non-brewed ments 23 1 Fruit drinks 7 1 Miscellaneous 17 — Totals: 381 27 Of the 19 New Milk Samples shown as unsatisfactory, from churns being delivered to a dairy in Enfield, 17 were below the presumptive standard. In each case, however, the content of these churns was part of larger consignments, and the milk fat and solidsnot-fat of the bulked delivery was satisfactory. The remaining two samples were from two churns in which the solids-not-fat was below the presumptive standard. In no case was the presence of added water detected. The unsatisfactory sample of bread was a loaf which contained a cigarette end. The seller was prosecuted and fined £5, and ordered to pay £3 3s. 0d. costs. 23 The three samples of fruit not satisfactory were "Lavine" applies, of Italian origin, which in one case were sold as Newtowns (a much more highly prized apple), in another as Winter Pearmains, and in the third case as Cleo's. In respect of two of these cases cautions were issued, and in the third the seller was prosecuted and fined £5 on each of two summonses, and was ordered to pay £4 4s. 0d. costs. The fruit drink sample was a blackcurrant health drink which was deficient in ascorbic acid, and this matter is at present being dealt with. A butcher's manager was prosecuted and fined £15 as the person directly responsible for selling and displaying stirk liver as calves liver. A shopkeeper was given a written warning for selling as chocolate, a confection which contained other hydrogenated oils in addition to cocoa butter fat. A retailer was cautioned for selling non-brewed condiment deficient in acetic acid. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953. Most of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts is to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders (which relate to the indication of the country of origin of certain goods) are properly observed. Visits of inspection were made to 264 premises in the Borough; 111 displays of meat, 561 of apples, 272 of tomatoes, 134 of poultry and 23 of bacon were examined. Minor infringements were dealt with by verbal warning to the shopkeeper by the inspector concerned. One butcher's manager was prosecuted for marking Imported beef as English, and was fined £5 on each of 7 summonses, and ordered to pay £5 5s. 0d. costs. A butcher was cautioned for displaying Argentine beef and Australian liver without indicating the country of origin. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller (or with a registered trade mark); and also to bear on the label its common or usual name, together with a list of the ingredients of which it is composed. The Order also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals are disclosed. 188 premises were visited, and 801 articles of food were examined. One infringement (a mushroom cream soup in which the ingredients were disclosed in the wrong order) was dealt with by letter. 24 Safe Milk. Twenty-four samples of raw milk were procured in Enfield and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. Ninety-five samples of milk were procured and checked for efficiency of pasteurisation or sterilisation. Two samples failed the methylene blue test, and the prescribed notices were sent to the sellers. Visits of inspection were made to 125 premises licenced for the storage of designated milks. Advertising and Labelling Infringements. In addition to the volume of work carried out in Enfield many of the samples procured in other parts of the county are foodstuffs and drugs nationally retailed, and this has the effect of protecting the residents of Enfield as well as the rest of the county. Examples of such samples on which action has been taken in 1961, are as follows :— The manufacturer of a non-alcoholic wine was challenged on the ground that the description was a contradication in terms and the label was amended to " non-alcoholic beverage." The importer of a slimming food was challenged on claims made in advertising literature as to the vitamin concentration claimed to be present, and the literature was subsequently corrected. A manufacturer's claim of slimming properties for "reducing perles" was challenged and the product was withdrawn. The claim relied on the presence of purgatives and bladderwrack. The slimming claim made for a lemon juice in a television advertisement was modified after the manufacturer had been challenged as to the efficiency of the product as a slimming agent. A label on butter "the creamiest of butters "was withdrawn after the manufacturer was challenged on the ground that the butter contained about 82 per cent. of fat, not "the creamiest of butters" which would be nearer 88 per cent. of fat. A "rum and butter" candy which contained no rum was objected to and relabelled " rum flavour and butter candy." An importer was advised that cod caviar was a false description, caviar being the roe of the sturgeon. A sample of cream cheese of Scottish origin was found on analysis to contain 41 per cent. of butter fat, below the standard of 50 per cent. set by several Middlesex courts, and the manufacturer agreed to increase the butter fat content of his cheese to conform to this standard. Another manufacturer was advised that" mushrooms in creamed sauce "would be a misleading description because butter fat was absent. A sample of a breakfast food which had been procured for analysis was claimed to be "real banana flavour." The flavouring 25 used was in fact artificial. When this was pointed out to the manufacturer he modified the original statement and removed the suggestion that real banana was present. The manufacturer of a starch reduced potato crisp agreed to amend the label on his product when challenged on the ground that the starch was reduced by only 5 per cent. as compared with samples of ordinary potato crisps and that therefore the claim " starch reduced" was misleading. There was one instance of a butter not properly labelled with a prescribed indication of origin. The manufacturer corrected the labels as soon as the infringement was brought to his attention.

Some reorganisation was carried out in this Section during the year. The vacant post of Rodent Officer was not filled, but an additional operative was appointed, making a total of four operatives. Two of the operatives have been fully occupied for some time in completing a survey to ascertain the exact location of all sewer manholes throughout the Borough and have carried out concurrent sewer treatment by Sodium Fluoracetate in damp coarse oatmeal involving 1,900 manholes. The other two operatives dealt with surface infestations. The 31 Council provides this service to the occupiers of all dwellinghouses free of charge. Industrial and business premises are dealt with at the request of the proprietors who pay the full cost of any disinfestation undertaken at their premises. 1,520 premises were inspected during the year for rats and mice infestation, and of these 695 were found to be affected. The total number of treatments carried out by the Department including domestic, business and factory premises, was 695. During the year the Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Investigating Staff made 4,315 visits concerning rat infestation. DISINFESTATION Number of Council Houses suspected to be infested 5 Number of Council houses disinfested as precautionary measure 12 Number of other houses suspected to be infested 15 Number of other houses disinfested as precautionary measure 17 Number of articles of clothing, bedding, etc., disinfested 169 Householders are urged to seek the assistance of the Health Department immediately they suspect the presence of bugs or similar pests. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS' INSPECTIONS AND VISITS The following report, in condensed form, gives details of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1961.

There are four premises in Enfield which are registered under this Act. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 This Act makes noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. 35 It also deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft nor to noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers. Several investigations regarding complaints of noise were carried out during the year. CARAVAN SITES AND CONTROL OF DEVELOPMENT ACT, 1960 This Act makes provision for the licensing and control of caravan sites, and authorises local authorities to provide and operate caravan sites. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has also issued Model Standards under section 5 of the Act. Reference to the control of caravans is made in the preamble to this Report. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act controls the keeping of pet shops. During the course of the year five premises previously licensed by the local authority were re-licensed. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953. The above legislation requires fireguards to be fitted to gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters of types so designed that they are suitable for domestic use, and so constructed that without a guard there is likelihood of injury by burning, or of ignition of clothing by reason of contact with, or proximity to the heating element or flame. Each of the Public Health Inspectors is a duly appointed officer under the Act. OIL BURNERS (STANDARDS) ACT, 1960 and REGULATIONS. This Act, which came into operation on 1st January, 1961, provides for the issue of Regulations, not made by the end of the year, to ensure minimum safety standards in the manufacture of oil heaters and component parts, and the issue by manufacturers of instructions as to the working and use of such oil heaters. 36 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 TO 1959 A register is kept of all the factories in the Borough, and during the year 178 inspections were carried out. 1.—INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Public Health Inspectors).

Byelaws were made in 1937 for the purpose of securing the cleanliness of any premises used for carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber and of the instruments, towels, and materials used in such premises. These byelaws have proved useful in maintaining a high standard in the premises of the Borough. PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Number of inspections of sanitary accommodation 75 38 OFFENSIVE TRADES By the end of the year the Enfield (Offensive Trade) Order, declaring a business dealing with butchers' waste to be an offensive trade had not been confirmed, certain objections to the Order still being under consideration. Unfortunately, complaints concerning this business continued to be received during the year. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The provisions of this Act include those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisance and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. The second Enfield Smoke Control Order became operative on November 1st, and the response by householders in complying with the provisions of the Order has been encouraging. Meanwhile, work proceeded apace with the Council's Smoke Control programme, two further areas having been surveyed and reached the stage of submission of the Orders to the Minister for confirmation. In carrying out the Smoke Control programme, a very considerable amount of work is involved on the part of both the inspectorial and administrative staff. After the initial survey, the proposals of the householder in adapting and converting appliances must be approved by the Health Department, and after completion the work must be inspected and claims investigated before the grant is finally paid. National Survey of Pollution. A report by a Working Party set up by the Co-operating Bodies in the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, suggested changes in the method of measurement of pollution as the system in operation was not giving a wholly satisfactory record of atmospheric pollution in the country as a whole. To obtain uniform results nationally, the Working Party considered it necessary to standardise the observation sites, and also to recommend a standard method of measurement. For this latter purpose the Volumetric Sulphur dioxide method, which entails daily measurement of smoke by air filtering and daily measurement of the concentration of sulphur dioxide by the hydrogen peroxide method, was considered to be the most suitable, and the Working Party recommended that a national 39 survey, using the Volumetric sulphur dioxide method, should be made by one hundred specially selected towns. Enfield was one of the authorities selected for the survey, and as the Council agreed to participate, apparatus was purchased for installation at four stations situated at Honilands School, Merryhills School, Bush Hill Park Library and Brimsdown Pumping Station with the intention of starting observations early in 1962. The present system of measurement used in Enfield which is by deposit gauge and lead peroxide method can then be discontinued. SWIMMING BATH AND POOL Enfield has two public swimming pools, a relatively modern open-air pool, built in 1932, situated next to the Sports Stadium, and an indoor bath at Enfield Lock, built in 1895, but greatly improved by extensions and modernisation. As regards the purification of the water, the up-to-date method of chlorination, filtration and aeration is used at both premises. This gives a safe and pleasant bathing water. Reports on the twice-daily examinations for chlorine and alkalinity of the water are sent to the Medical Officer of Health, and the Public Health Inspectors take samples for bacteriological tests at appropriate intervals. At both the open-air pool and the indoor bath, slipper bath facilities are available. PUBLIC MORTUARY There is now no public mortuary in Enfield, but use is made at present of a Hospital Mortuary.
