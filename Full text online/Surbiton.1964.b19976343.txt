Telephone No; HEALTH & WELFARE DEPARTMENT, Elmbridge 5111 - Ext. 63. TOLWORTH TOWER, SURBITON. JULY, 1965. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the former Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report 1964 Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1964. The report is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. l/65 dated 11th January, 1965, and follows the general lines as for previous reports. It completes a long series of Annual Reports on the Health and Social Welfare conditions of the Borough of Surbiton and the information shall be passed on to the Medical Officer of Health of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, The health of Surbiton still remains satisfactory and there has been no serious outbreak of any particular disease. Population; The Registrar General's estimated mid-1964 population figure is given as 63,760, an increase of 310. The vital statistics in this report are based on this figure. Infectious Disease; A table showing the incidence of infectious diseases during the past ten years will be found on page 11. The number of infectious disease notifications received in 1964 was 120 compared with 857 for 1963. This decrease is due to the greatly reduced number of cases of'measles. I am pleased to report a low incidence of infections generally. The number of cases on the Tuberculosis register continue to decrease There were no cases of Diphtheria or Poliomyelitis occurring in the Borough during 1964. Births; The statistics supplied by the Registrar-General show that during 1964 the total number of registered live births belonging to Surbiton was 1088 (541 males and 547 females). This gives a Birth Rate of 17.06 per 1,000 of the population compared with 15.93 for the previous year. There was an increase of 3 illegitimate births compared with 1963, the figure for 1964 being 63, comprising 26 males and 37 females. This represents 5.79 per cent of the total live births. There is a continual increase in the number of births taking place annually, and a continuous rise in the total population. There is every indication of this natural increase continuing. Deaths; The number of deaths recorded in 1964 is 657 compared with 763 for 1963. This gives a death rate of 10.30 per thousand of the population compared with 12.02 for 1963. 2. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1964 is 14 giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 12.86 compared with a rate of 13.84 for 1963. The causes of death of these infants will be seen on page 10. Causes of death; The main causes of death during 1964 weres- Heart and circulatory disease 98 Cancer 150 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 90 In view of the importance of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer the relevant figures for Surbiton residents are given below:- 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 M F M F M F M F M F M F Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus 22 4 34 1 24 5 20 10 31 9 40 5 : j TOTALS 26 35 29 30 40 | 45 Posters of varying design carrying messages of warning against smoking were exhibited throughout the Borough during the year. Housing: The overall need for increased housing provision persists and in particular additional accommodation is required for elderly people. As the expecation of life continues to increase so more and more old people require carefully designed buildings where they can live under a certain amount of supervision. The trend previously noted of demolition of family houses and replacement by blocks of flats and maisonettes continues. All efforts to conserve open space and land must be made by allowing taller buildings for dwellings in the residential areas, and judiciously increasing densities. Vital Statistics: The vital statistics are favourable, maintaining the satisfactory trend of recent years, and upholding the fact that Surbiton is a good place in which to live and work, and that the health services are proving effective. Staff: Details of the staff of the Public Health Department are set out on page 1. 3. It is with much pleasure that I take this chance of paying tribute to Mr. H.J. Eldridge, the Chief Public Health Inspector, in this year's Annual Report, which is to be the last for the Borough of Surbiton, having regard to the advent of the new Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames on the 1st April, 1965. Although this report concerns the year 1964, it will be published after the 1st April, 1965. Mr. Eldridge decided not to continue in his profession with the new Borough, and after serving the Council for over thirty years resolved to retire. His enthusiasm, devotion to his work, and his ever ready assistance to myself, the general public and his colleagues will always be appreciated, and I take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the invaluable help given by him to all members of the department. Also, Mr. E.C. Reeve, who retired on the 5th July, 1963, and was re-engaged in a temporary capacity, finally made his departure from his long association with local government and I acknowledge with thanks the way he constantly carried out his duties. I am pleased again to record my thanks to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for their support and encouragement throughout the year, and to Mr. Eldridge, Chief Public Health Inspector, and his Inspectors, Mr. Elms and the clerical staff, and to Dr. Kinstrie, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STARKEY Medical Officer of Health. 4.

The presence of so many in the older age group emphasises the necessity to co-ordinate, organise and maintain more comprehensive geriatric services and special housing for the old folk. BIRTHS.

These Regulations apply particularly to food handlers in foodshops, also cooks, and kitchen hands employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year two such certificates were issued. DIPHTHERIA The Borough has now been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation services offered, there is no reason why the disease should not remain entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rested with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who was also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organised the service within the Borough. Administrative work on immunisation was conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35 of a clerk's salary was reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria, whooping cough and other immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisation carried out in the course of his practice; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from Grange Road Health Centre, Kingston upon Thames. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Monday mornings at 1, Gosbury Hill, 9.30 to 11 o'clock. Chessington. Telephone: Lower Hook 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings at Ewell Road, Surbiton. 11 o'clock. Telephone: Elmbridge 4897 (or Diphtheria Immunisation may be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). 13 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1964 Reinforcement doses during 1964 Age under 1 year 428 | I 1 Age 1 year to 4 years 490 379 j j Age 5 years to 14 .vears 26 808 The following table sets out the number of children immunised in each of the last eight years:- Year Primary Immunisations Reinforcements 1957 691 1,399 1958 799 1,162 1959 859 1,267 1960 956 1,002 1961 1,064 2,280 1962 793 918 1963 847 955 1964 944 1,187 SMALLPOX Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat. There is very close liaison between local authorities and the sea and air ports, and contacts of this disease are kept under strict observation wherever they may be during the maximum incubation period of 16 days. The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1964 wass- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over TOTAL Vaccinations 64 430 35 10 5 544 Re-vaccinations - - 8 8 2 18 The Standing Medical Advisory Committee now advise that smallpox vaccination should be offered to children during the first two years of life, but preferably during the second year. 14 .. . SONNE' DYSENTERY This is a highly infectious condition and can spread rapidly among members of the same family and of groups such as classes in school and, if given time, widely among school children. Hence the importance of early recognition, notification and the institution of measures to prevent the spread and cure of individual cases. The following table shows the number of cases occurring since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton in 1951:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 62 - 10 12 25 289 202 28 123 2 - 12 76 4 POLIOMYELITIS The figures since 1950 are given below:- YEAR CASES DEATHS 1950 8 1 1951 1 - 1952 2 1 1953 3 - 1954 2 - 1955 8 - 1956 1 - 1957 6 - 1958 - - 1959 - - 1960 - - 1961 1 - 1962 - - 1963 - - 1964 - - Arrangements are made whereby doctors may collect antipoliomyelitis vaccine from the Public Health Department. Vaccination with Sabin oral vaccine was started in April 1962 and has since been increasingly used. The vaccine given by mouth, not only provides protection but also prevents protected persons from harbouring natural dangerous poliomyelitis virus and spreading disease to unprotected persons. This type of vaccine would be of great value during an epidemic because it works quickly. FOOD POISONING. There were two confirmed cases notified by general medical practitioners; the causative organisms were identified as shown belows:- S. Typhi murium 1 case S. Brandenberg 1 case The ages of the two persons were as follows:- 16 years S. Brandenberg 44 years S. Typhi murium No source of origin of infection could be traced in either of the cases. No outbreaks of food poisoning in the town were notified in 1964 15 LABORATORY FACILITIES Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); and opportunity is taken gratefully to acknowledge the co-operation of Dr. D.R. Gamble and his staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our soecimens are taken. Apart from routine samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the inspectors in the course of investigating suspected cases of dysentery, para-typhoid, food poisoning, etc. and taken to the Laboratory.

It was not neqessary to take any action under these Regulations during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936 (Section 172) No action was taken under this section. 18 KINGSTON & DISTRICT TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE This is a local voluntary Committee which raises funds and gives help to families with tuberculosis and other chest diseases. It worked with the Surrey County Council official services and was formed from representatives of the four District Councils in the North Central Division together with other interested persons. The Town Council appointed two representatives annually and the representatives during 1964-65 were as follows:- Alderman Mrs. A. Woodgate, J.P. Mr. J.R. Ashton. During the year 1964 an amount of £2,468 was spent on giving help to 104 families in the Division, 25 of these were Surbiton residents. MEDICAL EXAMINATION During the year 73 medical examinations were carried out at the Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service, also members of staff attaining the age of 18 years to determine their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme, members of the Borough Engineer's outdoor staff after completing six months service to determine their suitability for entry into the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, also to examine special cases referred for investigation. The latter usually necessitated a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospital specialists. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE There is in the Borough much voluntary work devoted to this cause such as provision of weekly clubs, daily centre, arranging seaside holidays, distribution of Christmas gifts and visiting of house-bound. The work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life and presided over by The Worshipful the Mayor. The Town Council leased to the Committee a large house known as "Alfriston", Berrylands Road, which after extensive works of repair and re-decoration, was opened in September 1958 as a Centre for old people, including clubrooms, recreation rooms, handicraft room, chiropody clinic and canteen; tne chiropody service being conducted on behalf of the County Council. A meals on wheels service is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society, and the Council makes a contribution towards the cost involved. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was approximately 4,090. The Borough Council has provided one hundred and six special flats for aged people. There can be no exaggeration of the importance of this work for the old people, or of its increasing urgency as year succeeds year and more survive to the older age groups. 19 NURSING IN THE HOME (District Nursing) The Headquarters of the District Nursing Association is at 21-23, Upper Brighton Road (Telephone Number Elmbridge 3027) where application should be made for the services of a district nurse or midwife. Such applications have to be supported by the family doctor under whose direction all home nursing is given. The District Nursing Services were administered by the Surrey County Council through the Divisional Medical Officer of Health who was also Medical Officer of Health for Surbiton. There is at the District Nursing Headquarters in Upper Brighton Road a very valuable and successful training school for District Nurses and Midwives. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS The ante-natal clinic can serve as the focal point for all activities relating to the expectant and nursing mother. The health visitor from the ante-natal clinic follows up cases at home for the purpose of advising and helping expectant mothers in all matters relating to pregnancy. Mothers are also encouraged to attend these clinics after their confinement to make sure that full health and normality is restored. This service is additional and designed to supplement that which an expectant mother is entitled to receive from a general practitioner and midwife. HOME HELP SERVICE Persons desiring to avail themselves of this service should apply, supporting their application with a medical certificate, to the Medical Officer of Health, Tolworth Tower, Surbiton, who will arrange for the Home Help Supervisor to visit and investigate the application. WATER SUPPLY The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises havo a direct mains supply and there are no wells or standpipes in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. This dependable first class water supply is a tremendous factor in maintaining the good health of the people of Surbiton. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Hogsmill River is the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. The River Thames is the northern boundary and whilst there is no bathing a pleasant riverside promenade gives much pleasure to many people and boating and yachting are popular pastimes. The island known as Ravens Ait belongs to the Navy League and Sea Cadet Corps and is used as a national boat training station for sea cadets. 20 SWIMMING BATHS. Publicly owned bath. The Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is from Metropolitan Water Board mains and is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition eighteen samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School baths. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine with changes of water as necessary. Pour samples were taken by the Public Health Department to ensure adequate chlorination and fitness for bathing, all of which proved to be satisfactory. There is also a swimming bath at a primary school with sterilisation, filtration and heating plant. Three samples were taken during the year and were satisfactory. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved under contract for disposal into privately owned pits. SEWERAGE. There are very few cesspools remaining, nearly all properties in the Borough being connected to the public sewerage system. Sundry remedial works have been carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department to deal with flooding during times of heavy rainfall, and a new surface water sewer in the Tolworth area is shortly to be constructed. 21 COMPLAINTS.

IMPROVEMENTS GRANTS. The Council continued to operate the Discretionary Grant scheme in cases (a) where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, and (b) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/ or the system of water heating. These grants are paid solely at the discretion of the local authority. During the year one application was received and approved, details being as follows:- 26 Serial No. 134 Amount Granted £351. 19. 4d. (£200 in respect of the ground floor flat and £161. 19. 4d. in respect of the upper flat). Approved Works Conversion into two self-contained flats of two-storied semidetached house. In addition, the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, requires local authorities to make grants towards the cost of providing "standard amenities" in dwellings, and made certain amendments to the existing rrovisions relating to improvement grants. Further amendments to the scheme were introduced by the 1961 and 1964 Housing Acts. Twentytwo standard grant applications were received during the year, 20 approved, 1 withdrawn and 1 refused. Particulars of such applications arc as follows:- Serial No Maximum Grant approved.

The Council has delegated to the Public Health Committee its powers relating to Certificates of Disrepair, and this materially helps in dealing with applications in an expeditious manner which is so important in common fairness to the parties concerned. The position up to the end of the year is shown in the following summary 6th July to 31st Dec.1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1.

H0USES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION On 22nd May 1952, the Minister of Housing and Local Government made regulations under the Housing Act, 1961, to deal with squalid living conditions in houses in multiple occupation, and there were amendments to these provisions in the Housing Act, 1954. Until 1954 byelaws existed which could be applied to such premises, but these were then repealed and replaced by a general power which proved to be an unsatisfactory substitute. The new provisions are far-reaching and should considerably strengthen the hands of local authorities in dealing with properties of this type for which, despite lack of essential amenities, there seems to be an ever-increasing demand by people whose circumstances compel them to seek accommodation in rooms in houses let to a number of individuals or families. Although there are no such properties in this Borough to which the description "squalid" properly applies there are houses let to a number of families or persons which would come within the scope of this legislation and where improvements might have to be called for. Some progress was made during the year in locating and inspecting houses occupied in this way, but it is very time-consuming and will take a long period to complete. 29 COMMON LODGING HOUSES A common Lodging-house is defined as "a house (other than a public assistance institution) provided for the purpose of accommodating by night poor persons, not being members of the same family, who resort thereto and are allowed to occupy one common room for the purpose of sleeping or eating, and includes, where part only of a house is so used, the part so used". There are no such premises in this Borough. FOOD INSPECTION Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not fit were surrendered by the owners and destroyed by burning or burying. The total weight of such goods was :- cwts. qrs. lbs. ozs. 10 3 6 11¾ There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough, consequently the only meat inspection carried out is in butchers' shops, canteens, etc. Nineteen samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination in the laboratory as a routine measure to check on fitness for human consumption. All were satisfactory. FOOD HYGIENE Fiftyeight premises are registered under section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved foods intended for sale for human consumption (including the preparation of meat or fish by any process of cooking and the cooking of poultry). Nine hundred and sixtyfive visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public houses, food-handling businesses, and vehicles, to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation:- Protection of food from contamination 25 Protective clothing for staff 4 Sinks provided 2 Washhand basins provided 2 Hot water supply provided 4 Wastepipes repaired or renewed 2 Food rooms cleansed 19 Walls and ceilings repaired 6 Floors repaired 2 Water pipes and cisterns repaired - W.C.s cleansed or repaired 8 W.C.s lighted or ventilated 1 Rooms ventilated 2 Drains cleansed or repaired 12 Refuse bins provided 2 Accumulations removed 5 Renewal or cleansing of equipment 12 Name and address on vehicle 3 First aid kits provided 12 Soap, towel and nail-brush provided 3 Smoking abated in foodshop 4 30.

Lengthy negotiations with the manufacturers took place and they maintained that the rusk was an essential part of the product. Meanwhile production had ceased. The manufacturers were informed that as tbe«y considered the proportion of rusk found an essential ingredient then in our opinion the name "Welsh Rarebit" is not 33 FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) appropriate. If this description is continued and such high proportions of rusk found we should have to regard it as an adulteration, FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955. Foreign matter in food. A variety of complaints about articles of food were received during the year, and the following were considered sufficiently serious to necessitate report to the Public Health Committee for instructions. (1) Foreign matter in Sliced Loaf. Complaint was made by a resident who found a foreign object in a loaf of bread purchased at a shop in the Borough. The foreign matter was subsequently identified as a piece of paper of the type which is sometimes used to make paper sacks, possibly a milk powder bag. The Council issued a warning letter to the manufacturers in this case. (ii) Alleged unsound cooked pork. A complaint was received from a local resident concerning the condition of some sliced cooked pork which had been purchased at a shop in the Borough. The complaint was investigated and the matter taken up with the firm concerned. As there seemed to be an element of doubt concerning the condition of the pork at the time of purchase, the Council decided to take no action beyond intimating to the shopkeeper that they would not hesitate to authorise the institution of legal proceedings should any justifiable complaint arise in the future. (iii) House fly in loaf of bread. A resident purchased a loaf of bread at a shop in the Borough which was found to contain a house-fly. After hearing the explanation of the manufacturers the Council decided that a warning letter be sent to them. iv) Nail in Fruitie Bun. A resident found a nail in a fruitie bun purchased at a shop in the Borough. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers and the Council decided that a strong warning letter be sent to them. (v) Chocolate Sponge affected with Mould. A resident of a neighbouring district purchased a chocolate sponge at a shop in the Borough. When the sponge was cut, it was discovered that there was a mould growth running through the cake in addition to a heavy growth on the underside. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers and retailers concerned and the Council decided to institute legal proceedings against the retailers. At the hearing before the Magistrates the retailers pleaded guilty to an offence under section 2(1) of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955. A fine of £25was imposed and the Council awarded £5. 5. Od legal costs and a further £3. 5. Od. in respect of the Public Analyst's fee. 34 Foreign matter in Food (Cont.) (vi) Nail in iced walnut cake. A resident of another district purchased an iced walnut cake at a shop in the Borough and subsequently found a one inch nail therein. Investigation revealed that the nail amost certainly came in the Chinese walnut crumbs. After considering the explanation of the local baker and the importers the Council decided that the matter be dealt with by a warning to the baker. MILK SUPPLY 1. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. At the end of the year there were 70 Dealers' (Pre-packed Milk) licences in force, as shown belows- Pasteurised 37 Sterilised 18 Untreated 15 2. Registration. At the end of the year there were entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk (Premises in the Borough) 34 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough- 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 3 The Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 - Dirty milk bottle. A local resident complained of the dirty condition of a milk bottle delivered to her house. Upon examination, puparia, identified as being those of the Drosphila Fly, were found adhering to the inside of the bottle. Section 27(1) of the Regulations requires every distributor to ensure that vessels used for containing milk should be in a state of thorough cleanliness. After hearing a report on correspondence with the suppliers the Council decided that a warning letter be sent to them. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963. These Regulations provided, inter alia, as from the 1st October, 1964, "Untreated" would replace "Tuberculin Tested" as the special designation for raw milk. A dealer's licence granted on or before 31st December, 1965, would remain in force (unless suspended or revoked) until that date: thereafter licences would be renewable for the same five-year periods as other dealers' licences. No changes were necessary in respect of the special designations "Pasteurised" and "Sterilised". 35 MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) Milk Sampling. 51 samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests:- Turbidity Test. Methylene Blue Test, Phosphatase Test. Animal Inoculation Test. Pasteurised - 21 21 - T.T. Pasteurised - 17 17 - Pasteurised C.I. - 3 3 - Sterilised 4 - - - Untreated - 3 - - Tuberculin Tested - 1 - 2 The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the animal inoculation test is for the purpose of detecting the presence of living tubercle bacilli or brucella. All samples conformed to the required standards except in the case of two samples of untreated milk which failed the methylene blue test. These were both from a vending machine and after correspondence with the vendor, who is also the producer, subsequent samples were satisfactory. It is understood that he will shortly install pasteurising plant at his dairy which is outside the Borough. Ice Cream Grade 1 53 96.367% 100% Grade 2 1 1.82% Grade 3 1 1.82% Grade 4 Nil 55 ICE CREAM. (i) Registrations One hundred and sixty-two premises are registered by the Counci under Section 16, Food & Drugs Act, 1955, as under;- For manufacture, storage and sale 4 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 4 For storage and sale but not manufacture 153 For storage only 1 (ii) Samples: 55 samples were taken, details being as follows:- 36 The Public Health Laboratory Service advised that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six-monthly period, 50% of a vendor's samples should fall into grade 80% into grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into grade 3 and none into grade 4. There is now no ice cream manufactured in the Borough except from soft ice cream machines fitted on vehicles. THE LIQUID EGG (PASTEURISATION) REGULATIONS. 1965." There are no egg pasteurisation plants in the district, and no samples were taken for Alpha-Amylase test. SHOPS aCT. 1950. One hundred and twenty-five visits were made in the administration of this Act and eight infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purpose of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1964 wass- Antique dealers and secondhand furniture 6 Bakers 17 Boots & Shoes 30 Builders and Decorators Supplies 28 Butchers 36 Cafes and Restaurants 39 Chemists 23 Confectioners, Newsagents and Tobacconists 91 Cycles, Radio and T.V. 27 Dairies and Milkshops 6 Drapers and Ladies Outfitters 57 Electrical Supplies 15 Fishmongers and Fried-fish Shops 16 General Stores 16 Greengrocers, Fruiterers and Florists 54 Grocers and Provision Merchants 65 Hairdressers 46 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 28 Licensed Premises 54 Motor and Cycle Dealers and Engineers 31 Tailors and Outfitters 13 Upholsterers and House Furnishers 14 Watchmakers and Jewellers 9 Miscellaneous 106 Total 827 THE OFFICES. SHOPS & RAILWAY.PREMISES ACT.1963. The above Act with some of the many accompanying regulations came into force during the year. The registration of premises within the scope of the Act - a responsibility of employers - should have been effected by the 31st July, 1964, but not surprisingly at that date the task was far from complete. 37. THE OFFICES, SHOPS & RAILWAY PREMISES ACT. 1963 (Cont.) Efforts were therefore concentrated on checking premises and calling for registration where this had not been done, and by the end of the year 610 registration forms had been submitted. This operation is continuing because although the number of premises covered by the Act is not known it is thought that this figure is probably about two-thirds of them. DISINFECTION. (a) (i) During the year disinfection was carried out free of charge at 9 premises as under;- Tuberculosis 6 Glandular Fever 1 Miscellaneous 2 (ii) Disinfection of bedding and premises was also carried out, where non-infectious illnesses had occurred, on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. There were twenty-five such cases dealt with during the year. (b) The total number of articles disinfected wass- Blankets 8 Mattresses 9 Cushions 2 Pillows 14 Pillow-cases 2 Rugs 1 Sheets 2 Curtains 1 Wearing apparel 69 Towels 1 Counterpanes 3 Bolsters 1 Miscellaneous 2 115 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 26 No of library books disinfected 31 DISINFESTATION (a) Insect Pests.

(b) Wasps Nests. The Council has no responsibility for the destruction of wasps nests on private property, but many calls for assistance are received (48 this year). All complainants are visited and suitable advice given; in most cases the nests are easily disposed of by the occupier using a recommended insecticide at sundown when it can be applied with no danger to the operator. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. The Council gave very careful consideration to Circular No. 69/63 dated 17th December, 1963, from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government on the subject of smoke control areas and availability of smokeless fuels. They decided to re-affirm their last resolution on the subject (in February 1962) which was as follows, and to review the matter in not more than two years' times- "That the Minister be informed that this Council (A) re-affirm that they are in full agreement with the desirability of reducing the emission of smoke from domestic chimneys, (B) are of opinion that residents are voluntarily changing to smokeless fuels at a satisfactory rate, it being unlikely that this rate will be significantly increased by legislation, (In this respect, the Council further believe that emission of smoke in the Borough is not excessive at the present time). MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. The following sites remained licensed under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960- 1) The Riverhill Estate, the lease of which is held by a local Sports Club and where 36 caravans are permitted. 2) One caravan in the orchard of a private house. As in previous years, some trouble was caused by itinerant caravan-dwellers who placed their vehicles on sundry open sites in the Borough and were reluctant to move on. All the offenders were eventually removed after some difficulty, in one case resort being had to towing off. There are seven effective Orders under the Surrey County Council Act in force in the Borough prohibiting the parking of moveable dwellings. PUBLIC MORTUARY. The mortuary was closed throughout the year, and arrangements were made with the Kingston Group Hospital Management Committee for the reception of bodies in the mortuary at Kingston Hospital. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 The Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Four premises were licensed during the year. There were no infringements of the licence conditions. 39 THE ANIMAL BOARDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1963. Three licences were granted under this Act, one to keep 40 dogs, one to keep 2 dogs, and one for 6 cats. All the premises were well-conducted and there were no infringements of the conditions imposed in the licences. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 - SECTIONS 47 and 50 NATIONAL-ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951. No action was necessary during the year under any of these sections. FACTORIES ACT, 1961. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 286 (254 mechanical, 18 non-mechanical, and 14 works of building construction). Two hundred and fifty three visits were made to these premises and work was carried out to remedy contraventions as followS:- Particulars: No. of cases in which defects found and remedied.

Where necessary they may serve upon the owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. The policy of the Council is, however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff to give advice and practical help where appropriate, without charge, subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. The Council is under no legal obligation to do this and does not undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but allows its staff to help as far as time permits. The Council is, however, responsible for its own property, including sewers, and the following tables show the extent of the work carried out during the year. 42 Forty-eight schools, business and industrial premises were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned.
