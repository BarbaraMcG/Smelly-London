THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, BEING THE REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1888 TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, In comparing the statistics of St. Pancras for 1888 with former years, it is seen that the death-rate is by far the lowest yet recorded, having fallen below 19 per 1000, and that the birth-rate is also decreasing from year to year. All the tables in the body of the Report and those appended to it have been corrected by the inclusion of parishioners and exclusion of non-parishioners, and by the distribution of the births and deaths not referable to any particular SubDistrict to the various Registrar's Sub-Districts according to population. As in the previous year, the insertion of many tables in the text has been avoided by placing them in an Appendix at the end of the Report, especially the tables worked out in detail for the Registration Sub-Districts. A new feature at the extreme end of the Report, to which your special attention is directed, is the spot map, on a scale of 9 inches to the mile, of infectious diseases occurring in the District. The proximity of the blocks of houses and the narrowness of the intervening spaces give an approximate idea of the density of population and its distribution. The absence of general notification of infectious diseases doubtless materially affects the appearance of the maps, but nevertheless some lessons may be learnt from the compilation. Smallpox calls for no remark. Typhoid, or Enteric Fever, on the other hand, deserves careful observation. It will be noticed that the brown spots of Typhoid cluster round definite centres. For instance, there is such a cluster in the centre of the northern half of the Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District, south of the east end of the Euston road; again, there is another such cluster in the centre of that part of the Somers Town SubDistrict lying between Seymour Street and Pancras Road; again, there is another but smaller cluster in the southern part of the Regent's Park Sub-District, just north of the west end of the Euston Road; again, there is a larger but more 6 diffused cluster between the Chalk Farm and the Kentish Town Railway Depots If more cases of this disease were notified, it is probable these clusters would stand out still more distinctly. The importance of localising Typhoid is due to the fact that the amount and situation of this disease mark the insanitary condition of the drainage of an area more certainly than any other disease. Diphtheria shows its peculiar characteristic preference for high ground. The green spots increase in number in proceeding from the south to the north of the district (stopping short of the extreme north, which is sparsely inhabited, and by high-class residents). This is shown more clearly in figures in the mortality statistics for the sub-districts in Tables 8, B and C, and reasons for this are suggested under the head of Diphtheria, amongst Causes of Death, page 15. Scarlatina, or Scarlet Fever, like the two preceding diseases, also shows its most characteristic peculiarity, rapidly spreading from person to person and house to house by personal contact. This is very marked upon the map by the strings of red beads, and shows how easily one infected person becomes the first link in a chain of cases, and how necessary is the immediate separation of the affected person from others, and the prevention of convalescents from exposing themselves to disseminate the disease. METEOROLOGY. First Quarter. January.—The month was dry, snow falling in the last week. Fog was prevalent in the second week; generally, the weather was fine.

PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Inmates.—The Staff of a Public Institution, being permanently resident, forms part of the population of the Sub-District in which it is situated, and deaths of members of the staff form part of the deaths of the Sub-District. The number of inmates of a Public Institution are re-distributed, to the several SubDistricts, and proportionately to the population the births are similarly re-distributed, but the deaths of inmates are re-distributed according to previous residence.

A Quinquennial Census of the principal large towns and cities becomes yearly more necessary in order to estimate the changes that take place in the number, age, sex, marriage, and occupation of the population. The populations of the Parish and of the Sub-Districts are based upon the annual increase of numbers estimated in the Reports for 1886 and 1887. Sub-Districts. Enumerated Census, 1881.

The birth-rate in the several SubDistricts is id the following order from highest to lowest:— MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during 1888 was 2139; this is 57 above the number recorded in 1887, and 43 below the average annual number for the past ten years. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered in St. Pancras during 1888 was 7349; this is 579 below the average for the preceeding ten years. The rate per 1000 of population was 30.09, the lowest on record, the rate of the preceding decennium being 32.7. The proportions in the Sub-Districts are given below, the 227 Births occurring in Public Institutions having been distributed to the Sub-Districts according to population:— Sub-Districts. Number of Births. Birth-rate. Regent's Park 1075 26.67 Tottenham Court 697 25.90 Gray's Inn Lane 875 28.36 Somers Town 1200 35.23 Camden Town 492 29.97 Kentish Town 3010 31.46 St. Pancras 7349 30.09 Table 2 at the end of the Report shows the steady annual fall in the Birth-rate, whilst the fall in the number of Marriages is not so steady nor so great, in proportion, as the number of Births, as seen in Table 1. DEATHS. During the 52 weeks ending December 29, 1888, the corrected number of Deaths of St. Pancras parishioners was 4628, equal to a rate of 18.95 per 1000 of population. The number is 230 below the number of 1887, and 264 below the average of the ten preceding years. This is the first year in which the Death-rate in St. Pancras has fallen below 19 per 1000,and is without exception the lowest on record. The Death-rate of London during 1888 was 18-5 per 1000, this also is the lowest rate yet recorded for the Metropolis. 12 The following are the Death-rates for the Sub-Districts, 237 Deaths from all causes not referable to any particular district being distributed to the several Sub-Districts according to population. Sub-Districts. Number of Deaths. Death-rate.

The corrected number of deaths at several ages in St. Pancras and the several Sub-Districts, 228 not referable to any particular sub-district being distributed according to population, were as follows:— Under 1 Under 5 5-60 Over 60 Total Regent's Park 154 245 231 164 640 Tottenham Court 118 185 178 115 478 Gray's Inn Lane 163 276 219 148 643 Somers Town 204 330 315 196 841 Camden Town 69 134 104 62 300 Kentish Town 401 703 602 421 1726 St. Pancras 1109 1873 1649 1106 4628 13 Under one year of age the number of deaths and proportion per 1000 births and per 1000 total deaths from all causes are shown below, 15 not referable to any particular sub-district being distributed according to population.

ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The principal Zymotic Diseases caused 645 deaths, a diminution of 74 as compared with the previous year, the diminution being due to Scarlatina, Diarrhœa, and Whooping Cough, whereas Enteric Fever, Diphtheria, and Measles showed an increase. Compared with the annual average numbers of the previous ten years there is a diminution of 77 due to the same diseases, and the same diseases showing an increase. 14 The Zymotic death rate was 2.64 per 1000 of population, that of London being 2.53, and the proportion per 1000 of total deaths was 139 compared with 147 for the previous ten years. The incidence of deaths from Zymotic Diseases in the Sub-Districts is shown in the following table {###}Sub-Districts. Numbers. Per 1000 Population.

SMALL-POX. One death only occurred from Small-pox in 1888; in the previous year there was no death from this disease, and but two in 1886. The effect of the action of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in removing cases of small-pox out of London and transferring them to Darenth, is slowly but surely being felt. Compare the number of deaths of the previous ten years in Table 5. MEASLES. This is one of the diseases the deaths from which have shown a decided increase, the numbers being in excess of any other year during the decennium. This was due to an epidemic of the disease which swept across the Parish from north-west to south-east, in spite of elimination from school of all children affected or coming from infected houses, and of the exercise of strict vigilance by enquiry at all infected houses. In the short time it took to accomplish this it was found that the epidemic was abating, and the drastic alternative of closing the schools was not resorted to. It is very doubtful whether closing the schools is of as much value as supposed, an epidemic of measles rapidly expends itself, and by the time it lias been found necessary to close the schools, is generally on the wane. An important point to decide is whether the children are any the less likely to come into contact playing together promiscuously' out of school, than they are in the classrooms or school-ground. It was found that the very young children not attending school were a fertile source of the disease. The best means of checking the spread of measles is a subject that requires serious consideration, seeing that more deaths were caused by this disease than any other Zymotic disease, not excluding Diarrhoea. Some earlier action than the crude method of closing schools would appear to be 15 necessary, since to close a school is to admit that it has been allowed to be:ome generally infected to a dangerous extent. It would not be justifiable to close a large school for a few cases of measles, yet they may be the forerunners of a general outbreak. The death-rate of measles is variously estimated from 1 or 2 per cent, to 10 or 20 per cent., according to the virulence of the epidemic. Taking 10 per cent., or 1 in 10, as the average in this instance, then the 206 deaths represent over 2,000 cases, probably the number occurring during the epidemic would be about onehalf of these, as the remainder would be spread over the rest of the year. SCARLATINA. This disease caused 56 deaths, or 4 less than the previous year, and 38 less than the average of the previous ten years. The good effect of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals is seen at a glance by comparing the annual numbers in Table 5. Notification of this disease will still further reduce the mortality by preventing the exposure of convalescents still infected, whom the medical attendant has ceased to visit or advise; this, together with neglect of disinfection, being the most fertile method of its propagation. TYPHUS. It is now five years since a death from this disease has been registered in St Pancras. WHOOPING COUGH. From this disease there were 142 deaths against 199 in the previous year, and an average of 181 in the ten previous years. DIPHTHERIA. This is another disease which shows a decided increase in mortality. The number of deaths was 72, against 59 for 1887, and 46 for the decennium. Not only in St. Pancras, but throughout the metropolis, this disease shows a gradual and decided increase. It is interesting to observe in Table 8, B and C, that the mortality is lowest in the lowest and southern districts, and increases gradually towards the northern or highest districts This peculiar affinity of diphtheria for the higher-lying districts has frequently been observed, and has been attributed to the currents of sewer air in sewered towns, but the same phenomenon has been observed in rural districts without sewers. Diphtheria has been assumed to be due to some low form of growth. The growth is evidently averse to the water or swamp of valleys, although, like most low forms of type inimical to man, requiring a certain amount of moisture, and this it can find equally well in the midden upon high ground, as it can in the crown of high-lying sewers with considerable gradients, which rarely run as full as those lying in low or level ground. The conditions are not dissimilar, and certainly do not justify but tend to contradict the assertion that sewers do not propagate Diphtheria, in support of which we have also the characteristic sewer-gas throat. It is possible that the continuous crown of the network of London sewers may, in a measure, assist the ramification and growth of Diphtheria. 16 In the autumn of this year three children of the same family succumbed within twenty-four hours to Diphtheria in Euston Buildings, and an inquest was held in the third case. Suspicion was directed to the water supply and drainage, but incorrectly. It transpired, from searching inquiries made by your Sanitary Department, that the cause of the outbreak was the advent of a maid affected with the disease into the family. This maid, an aunt, brought the disease with her from a house in Sutherland Gardens, Paddington, where severe sore-throat had run its course successively through a number of children in the same family, and upon dismissal from this house, the maid, not being admissable into the Asylums Board's Hospital, slept at her married sister's, whose three children she infected. It was established that the maid, before and after leaving Sutherland Gardens, was suffering from a severe form of sore-throat, and was attending as an out-patient at a general hospital. The Coroner's Jury sent a recommendation to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, requesting them to admit cases of Diphtheria into their hospitals, and after representations from the Society of Medical Officers of Health, various Boards of Guardians and Sanitary Authorities, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with the approval of the Local Government Board, incurred expenditure making provision for receiving and isolating Diphtheria cases in their hospitals for the future. CONTINUED FEVER. One death only occurred from this disease, which is probably only a mild form of enteric fever. TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER. This disease was the cause of 57 deaths, the number for the previous year being 28, and for the decennium 25. The proportion per 1000 of total deaths being 12.3 against 52. for the preceding ten years. The increase in the mortality is most apparent in Tables 8, A B and C in the Regent's Park, Somers Town and Kentish Town Sub-Disticts, and the spot map shows the particular areas of these Sub-Districts affected, and also the concentration of the cases that have occurred in the Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District within a small area. DIARRHOEA. The 114 deaths registered as ultimately due to this disease were fewer in number than in any year of the previous decennium, the cool summer being, probably, unfavourable to the development of the disease. 17 TUBERCULAR DISEASES. The principal Tubercular Diseases (see Table 7 E and following) were the cause of 617 deaths, 22 less than in the previous year, and the incidence was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Numbers.

Violence was the cause of 157 deaths, or 15 less than in 1887. Of these, 130 were due to accident or negligence, 4 to homicide, and 23 to suicide. 18 UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. The number of uncertified deaths was 5, of which 4 were registered in the Kentish Town sub-district, the numbers for the preceding five years being' respectively 15, 4, 11, 9, 9. INQUESTS. 421 inquests were held in St. Pancras during the year, a number slightly below the average. COMPARATIVE MORTALITY OF THE SUB-DISTRICTS. Per 1000 Population. Sub-Districts. Birth-Rate.

Kentish Town incurred the highest mortality from Measles and Diphtheria, and the second highest from Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Scarlatina, and Enteric Fever. SANITATION. MORTUARIES. The Mortuaries were opened at the end of January 1888, and from that date to the end of the year, the following number of bodies were deposited. Public Mortuary 319 Infectious 13 329 The Coroner's Court was opened at the same date, and during the eleven months of 1888, inquests were held in the Court upon 324 cases out of 421 held in St. Pancras during the year.

House to house inspections were carried on regularly during the year, as in former years, and a list of streets inspected together with the numbers of houses, rooms and persons will be found at the end of the Report. Industrial Dwellings were extended by the erection of Somerset and Endsleigh Terraces in Duke's Road and the extension of Clarence Buildings, Kentish Town Road. A list of Industrial Dwellings, with particulars, is appended. Common Lodging Houses, of which there are 30 in the Parish, were maintained in good condition, a list of these dwellings is appended. Canal Boats, used as dwellings, are now so carefully registered and supervised, that any infringement of the sanitary regulations rarely takes place in St. Pancras. Caravans or Tents., used as dwellings, have not been pitched in any part of the Parish during the year. WATER SUPPLY. A much needed improvement is the application of the Constant Service System by the West Middlesex Water Company, to the district lying north of Gloucester Gate and West of the London and North Western Railway. During the hot days in the middle of summer the thoroughfares of London would benefit by a greater and more frequent use of water. The hydrants fixed every few yards along the pavements, unless utilized, will have been fixed in vain at great expense. Flushing the streets with water not only allays dust but allows easy and rapid cleansing of the surface, replenishes and traps the gulleys, and clears and deodorizes the sewers. Such flushing is the nearest approach to imitation of nature's method of cleansing and purifying by rain showers. 24 DRAINAGE. Reference to Table 9 A of the sanitary work accomplished during 1888 will show the amount of work in connection with drainage. The following were the results of testing drains of doubtful condition during the year :— No. Tested. RESULT. Satisfactory. Defective. Upon Complaint 108 30 78 After Typhoid Fever 51 34 17 „ Diphtheria 37 27 10 Totals 196 91 105 310 drains were reconstructed and 1,177 repaired. It is to be hoped that the New County Council will undertake what has been so long neglected and what the County Council alone possesses the power of doing, viz., to draft bye-laws for the regulation of drainage in the Metropolis. SEWERAGE. The sewerage in the Gray's Inn Road and neighbourhood has been much improved, the good effect of which will in course of time demonstrate itself. The streets catch-pits intercepting the road refuse continue to be treated with an antiseptic to prevent decomposition. The ventilation of sewers requires attention for its improvement, reference to the spot-map shows the prevalence of diphtheria in the higher situated parts where ventilation above the house-tops may be most advantageously carried out. Periodical flushing of sewers since the introduction of the constant system of water supply and the fixing of numerous hydrants becomes a matter of routine of great value sanitarily. REFUSE REMOVAL. The mews and stable yards in the Parish are regularly inspected, and during the warm weather special attention is directed to the removal of stable refuse every forty-eight hours, but the use of peat, sawdust, and other litter in the place of straw produces such rapid fermentation that a few hours suffice to render the process of disturbance in removal sickening. In large Stable Yards the turning over of the manure might be avoided, and some labour saved by substituting a van for the manure bin and driving it away without disturbance. The extra cost of a second van to replace that removed would probably be recovered by the saving of labour. 25 The removal of domestic refuse is still the source of many complaints, and will continue to he until the adoption of a system of weekly collection from house to house. Other London Parishes appear to have adopted improved systems with benefit, and their experience would form an invaluable guide to improvement. NUISANCES. During the past year 2,532 Notices were issued for Sanitary Amendments, 164 Orders were made, and 18 Prosecutions (as well as 28 under the Food and Drugs Act) were instituted as under :— Under the Metropolis Local Management and other Acts.
