I AC 4361 ISC 93 1964 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITIONS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON. VICTOR FREEMAN, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON I have the honour to present my 24th Annual Report which is also the final Report for the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. It was inevitable that 1964, and particularly the latter half of the year, should have been very much taken up with the forthcoming changes consequent upon the implementation on 1st April 1965 of the London Government Act 1963. Nevertheless, every effort was made to ensure that major administrative and staff changes and problems arising caused minimal interference with all the services that the public rightly expected to continue to receive. In fact, additional functions and responsibilities were placed on the metropolitan borough as an environmental health authority during the year. The total number of births, although a little higher than last year at 5,795, has been steadily held around this figure for the past three years and the birthrate continued to be substantially higher than the corresponding rate for England and Wales. The vital statistics for 1964 showed gratifying features in some respects: in particular, there was a substantial reduction in the number of deaths from bronchitis which were the lowest on record due to this cause. If this reduction is linked with a reduction in atmospheric pollution, it will be a matter of considerable interest and importance to-follow the trends in future years. 1964 was also marked by maintaining the lowest recorded death rate for lung tuberculosis as in 1963. Due to the coming into force in the latter part of 1963 of more stringent regulations dealing with smallpox surveillance for any person coming from a suspect area abroad, there was increased follow-up visiting. There was no single reported case either of poliomyelitis or diphtheria and only 231 cases of dysentery were reported against nearly 1,400 in 1963. The body of the Report contains details of three confirmed cases of typhoid fever, (none of which incidentally was connected with the Aberdeen outbreak), and also mentions precautionary measures taken by the department at the time of the occurrence. The Report mentions the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, which came into operation during the year as the most considerable and major piece of public health legislation for some time. Additional staff had to be engaged to enable the Council to carry out its duties under this Act. It was apparent from information obtained at an early stage that the Act should prove beneficial and obviously desirable. Even though the Act has been in force for a relatively short time, considerable improvements have been effected under it in the matter of safety precautions for working staff and general improvement in working conditions and installation of amenities. A duty mentioned in the Report which has proved most useful in practice has been the periodic all-night visiting carried out by two inspectors. This has enabled noise complaints, for example, to be investigated and dealt with when the noise nuisance could be at its maximum. Night supervision in connection with food handling has also proved most useful. As a matter of some historic interest, abattoirs sited for over a century at the Metropolitan Cattle Market were closed and associated offensive trades transferred to premises outside the borough. In connection with the campaign for reduction of atmospheric pollution, the Report gives further information on the extension of smoke control areas and other matters, and by the end of the year, approximately one-third of the borough was included in smoke control areas. In connection with space heating arrangements, the Council agreed during the year to give publicity to the danger of using out-of-date oil heaters and offered to collect such heaters through the Cleansing Department. Housing conditions in Islington constitute the most important social problem in the borough. 25 houses were represented for slum clearance under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957, and seven Closing Orders were made during the year in respect of whole houses and parts of houses. Under the Housing Act, 1961, eight Management Orders were made and considerable attention was given to the Housing Act, 1964, which came into effect, and which it is hoped will prove useful in future by strengthening possible action which might be taken by local authorities for installation of additional amenities under the 1961 Act, and also by other provisions which enable the local authority to improve tenanted dwellings and tenement blocks. Services for elderly persons continued to improve during the year. The modernization scheme for special assisted bathing at the Treatment Centre, Seven Sisters Road was completed, and the meals service delivered to the homes of elderly people was increased with additional meals offered to each person as well as more recipients taking advantage of this service. 1964 closes a chapter in the local authority health services of the Metropolitan Borough, and it has been my privilege to have served as Medical Officer of Health for a substantial proportion of the time from when the first Medical Officer of Health was appointed to the original Vestry in 1856 which later became the Metropolitan Borough. The London Government Act will inevitably entail many more personal changes including severance of old associations than has ever occurred before, not excluding the changes brought about in 1948 by the National Health Service Act. It would not be possible for a Medical Officer of Health to carry out his functions without the full support of his staff, and I desire to place on record my grateful thanks to every member of the Health Department. Most particularly do I wish to express my personal appreciation for their work and loyal and unstinted cooperation over the past few years to my colleague and Deputy, Dr. J.P.J. Burns, to the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. W.C. Bartlett, to the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. H. Plinston, and to the Chief Clerk, Mr. E.J. Sharp. The work of the Medical Officer of Health and that of his department must also be carried out, if it is to be done effectively, with the full support and understanding of the responsible committees. The relationship of a Chief Officer to the Chairman of his Committees is a most important factor in local government, and I have been fortunate over the past few years in having been associated with the Public Health Committee under the Chairmanship of Alderman A.J. Rogers, and similarly with Housing Committee under the Chairmanship of Alderman E.J.W. Bayliss. V. FREEMAN.

From one to twelve months the greatest risk to infants was due to respiratory disease; of a total of 27 infant deaths in the age group one to twelve months, 15 were due to pneumonia. Maternal Mortality In a total of 5,886 live and still births, there were 3 maternal deaths: one was a fatal issue following instrumental interference and was therefore undoubtedly avoidable. The other two were due to (1) focal myocarditis (full term pregnancy) and (2) haemorrhage (Caesarian Section) with Pulmonary collapse due to mucoid bronchitis. Respiratory Tuberculosis The death rate for lung tuberculosis in 1953 was the lowest recorded at 0.04 per 1,000 population, and the same rate was maintained for 1964. Deaths due to Pneumonia and Bronchitis If respiratory illness is affected by atmospheric pollution which is generally accepted, it would be expected that ultimately the effects of reducing pollution would show in reduced mortality for respiratory causes. In 1964, 159 deaths were ascribed to pneumonia and 138 to bronchitis. The Islington 10-year averages (including 1964) for these causes were respectively 180 and 221. The 1963-64 winter was relatively mild as against a severe winter for the previous year. The pneumonia deaths in 1963 at 229 were substantially above average, but the bronchitis deaths for the same year at 230 were not greatly higher. The bronchitis deaths in 1964, however, were the lowest on record, and future returns will be observed with interest in the hope that 1964 was the beginnig of a really significant and continuing reduction in the effects of bronchitis, linked with a reduction in atmospheric smoke pollution due to the increasing proportion of Islington and surrounding areas which are subject to Smoke Control Orders, as well as a general tendency to increase the use of electricity, gas, oil, for space heating instead of burning raw coal in open grates. Malignant Growths of Lung and Bronchus Lung cancer deaths in males have not varied very greatly over the last eight years, with figures between approximately 130 and 150 deaths per annum:- 9 Deaths Male Female Total 1951 104 23 127 1952 107 20 127 1953 114 19 133 1954 98 25 123 1955 103 17 120 1956 119 22 141 1957 127 25 152 1958 130 24 154 1959 145 26 171 1960 156 26 182 1961 141 29 170 1962 144 22 166 1963 147 20 167 1964 136 38 174 The same situation applied up to 1963 in lung cancer deaths in females, although, of course, at a very much lower level of 20 to 30 deaths per annum. In 1964, however, the highest number of female deaths due to this cause was recorded. Of the total of 38, 13 were under the age of 55 as against 3 in 1963, and 9 aged 55-65 against 4 the previous year. Over the age of 65, and with a total of 16, there was an increase of three in the previous year. Whilst no conclusions can be drawn from one year's figures, it would not be out of place to expect an increase in female lung cancer cases to occur about this time, on the basis of a 15 to 20 year incubation period, and following the wartime and post-war increase in cigarette smoking in women.

They were reported to be proceeding to addresses in Islington and were not in possession of valid international certificates of vaccination. In accordance with the new regulations regarding international certificates of vaccination, which came into force on 1st August, 1963, all the arrivals were visited and kept under surveillance for the required period of time. One of these references was from the Port of London Health Authority concerning the s. s. "Devonia" which made an unscheduled stop at the port of Tangier for the purpose of landing a case of non-infectious sickness. Tangier is an endemic smallpox area, and on board the s.s. "Devonia" there was a large party of school children, none of whom landed. Routine surveillance was carried out in respect of two adults and 32 Islington school children who were absent from school for any reason during the quarantine period. Medical advice was sought for two patients suffering from rashes of a type where it was desirable to exclude smallpox as a possible cause:- 1. A male Nigerian iged 25 years, presented himself one Sunday at a general hospital, with a rash that had developed that morning, and the possibility of smallpox could not be excluded. He was seen by the Deputy Medical Officer who considered the case to be one of chicken-pJx. A Consultant Physician on the Smallpox panel concurred with this diagnosis and arranged for the case to be transferred to an infectious disease hospital. 2. The other patient was a male Nigerian aged 27 years, who was also found not to be suffering from smallpox. The following is the table of successful vaccinations performed over the past seventeen years:- 1st January - 3rd July 1948 1, 124 1956 2,590 * # 5th July - 31st December 1948 702 1957 3,624 • 1949 1,628 1958 3,449 • 1950 2,307 1959 2,692 * 1951 3,291 1960 2,753 * 1952 2,450 1961 3,782 * 1953 3,055 1962 32,795 1954 4,052 1963 1,009 •• 1955 5,942 1964 2,036 (Figures kindly furnished by Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council) * Including Re-vaccinations # Group Sessions for Schoolchildren discontinued ** Implementation of the Ministry of Health advice regarding the timing of such vaccinations i.e. at 16 - 19 months of age instead of at 5 months. 13 Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation - Authentication - Ministry of Health Circular 60/48 Applications for authentication to be dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health numbered 1,705 as against 1,355 for the previous year. The applications comprise requests for authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation against smallpox, cholera, typhoid, etc. and constitute a substantial item of work. Measles the number of cases notified in 1964 was 1.715, and most of them occurred from June onwards in the outbreak which continued into 1965. The great majority of cases were relatively mild and uncomplicated, but 54 were referred to hospital. No case was fatal.

There can be no doubt that vaccination with both the Salk Vaccine given by injection and the Sabin Vaccine given orally have been responsible for the local elimination of poliomyelitis over the past two years. Continued immunisation and regular health publicity stressing its advisability, will be necessary if this situation is to be safeguarded.

"Open Sessions" are held and attendances at these is not restricted by place of residence, hence it is not possible to give the number of Islington residents who have attended. The following figures show the numbers of persons who have been protected at L.C.C. Clinics and by medical practitioners in 1964 in the whole of the Division comprising the areas of the Boroughs of Finsbury, Holborn and Islington.

This of course, extremely gratifying and although it may now be said that diphtheria is a comparatively rare disease, it will only remain so if the greater majority of children continue to be immunised. Even so, however, we can expect an occasional limited outbreak as was experienced in 1963 and this should certainly indicate that immunisation against the infection cannot be relaxed. Diphtheria Immunisation, 1964 Dr. Wilfrid G. Harding, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, has kindly supplied the following figures in respect of Islington for the current year. As immunity tends to wane with the passage of time, the Immunity Index relates only to children who have been inoculated during the last 5 years by general practitioners, and in L.C.C. Welfare Centres and Schools. This is consonant with the Immunity Index given by the Ministry of Health.

In accordance with Circular 2/50 of the Ministry of Health, the table summarising this outbreak is as follows:- Date No. of No. of No. of No. of Foods involved and Notifi- persons cases deaths Organisms responsible cations served reported 13.5.64 - 75 13 - Brisket of Beef Q. Welchii Outbreak Report Information was received in aid-May of thirteen cases occurring amongst staff and residents at a Jewish Old People's Home. Onset of symptoms commenced approximately 14 hours after consumption of Brisket of Beef. This had he en purchased the previous day, boiled for two hours, allowed to cool for one hour and placed in a refrigerator until due to be served. Samples of Brisket of Beef and most of the faecal specimens froa staff and residents examined showed Heat Resistant Cl. Welchii present. The Medical Officer of Health of the area in which the meat was purchased, was informed and as a result of his investigations the butcher's premises, staff, food preparation and general hygiene were found to be satisfactory. A report was sent to the Jewish Board of Guardians giving advice on the preparation and cooling of food and recommendations of the Public Health Inspector. Lead Poisoning Information was received from the Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, Health Division III, of a female child who had been admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children because of a raised lead blood level. This case had been previously referred from this Hospital in 1959. A domiciliary visit was carried out by a Senior Public Health Inspector, but he could find no toys of a lead nature, nor any other articles with a lead content, among the child's possessions. He could find no source of lead in the household, but three samples of paint from her tricycle, a window frame and railings near the front door were taken and these were sent to the Public Analyst. His report stated that each of the samples contained only traces of lead, indicating that they were not derived from a lead-based paint. This was the only reference for lead poisoning received during 1964. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever There were three confirmed cases of Typhoid Fever in the borough during the year. 19 The first was a female aged 27 years, living in the Highbury area, who was admitted to hospital in late January and was found to be a confirmed case of Typhoid Fever She had returned to this country from a village near Naples on the 18th January after a month's visit Domiciliary enquiries were made and routine bacteriological investigation of primary contacts carried out Both medical practitioners of Islington contacts and the Medical Officers of Health of the areas where other contacts resided were kept fully informed Subsequently, two of these contacts, one Of whom was resident in Islington, developed symptoms and were removed to hospital for observation and investigation In neither of these cases was typhoid confirmed. Hie next case was discovered following bacteriological investigation of contacts of a suspected dysentery, when an adult male Nigerian was found to be excreting Salmonella typhi His medical practitioner was informed and treatment arranged Further bacteriological examinations of both the carrier and all contacts were carried out. One of these contacts was a midwife at a local hospital and another a food handler in another borough The respective authorities were kept informed The third case was a female child, aged 2& years who was admitted to an Isolation Hospital on the 25th October and was found to be suffering from Typhoid Fever Previously the child had been an in patient in a General Hospital outside the Borough, from 20th to 23rd October She was transferred to another General Hospital which is situated in the borough, on the 23rd October The patient had been on holiday in France with her mother and younger brother for 2 months, returning to England on the 3rd October During this period the father had spent a week in France with the family during August It is presumed that the infection was contracted abroad Family and other contacts were kept under observation and their medical practitioners informed Bacteriological examination of all contacts proved negative. Information was received in early June from the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health of cases of Typhoid Fever in Aberdeen which were thought to be associated with cold cooked meat purchased from one store 20 Several enquiries were received in regard to persons who had recently returned to Islington from Aberdeen. It was suggested that if any such visitors were brought to the specific notice of a practitioner, in regard to the desirability, or otherwise, of precautionary measures, the Medical Officer of Health would be pleased to advise having regard to the circumstances of any particular case. Conversely this department arranged to communicate with the practitioner concerned, regarding a person brought to the notice of the department for any reason which could possibly be connected with the outbreak. The Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health had advised, as a precautionary measure, due to the association of cold cooked meat, including corned beef, with the Typhoid epidemic, that 6-lb. tins of corned beef processed within certain dates should be held back, although there was no proof at the time that these tins carried special risk. All establishments in the borough connected with food were informed that if they held any tins in these categories, the department should be informed immediately. There was no evidence against smaller tins. A communication was also sent, as a precautionary measure, to all establishments connected with food requesting information of visits to and from Aberdeen by any of their employees. The Ministry of Health and the Scottish Home & Health Department had advised that apart from special groups of people in constant daily contact with the disease, such as hospital staffs, inoculation was not desirable as a routine protective measure during the epidemic. Reports of 7 groups of contacts of Typhoid & Paratyphoid "B" Fever were also investigated during the year as below:- 1. A boy aged 7 years, not resident in Islington, was found to be suffering from Typhoid Fever. An Islington family who were in contact with the patient during the incubation period was investigated. All bacteriological examinations proved negative. 2. A Steward was admitted to hospital from a ship which docked at Tilbury on the 4th May, and was found to be suffering from Salmonella typhi. The patient joined the ship on the 7th April in Bombay and reported sick on the 28th April. The date of onset was, therefore, likely to be on or about the 24th April. A crew member who proceeded to an Islington address was investigated. Bacteriological examinations proved negative. 3. A 2-year old boy, residing outside the Borough, was admitted to an Isolation Hospital and subsequently diagnosed as typhoid fever. It was reported that this child had been cared for during the day at an address in Islington. 21 Domiciliary enquiries were made and bacteriological examination of 9 Islington contacts all proved negative. 4. Information was received from the Port Medical Officer, Southampton, of the s.s. 'CJiusan" which had been on a three weeks cruise, calling at ports in the Mediterranean and docking at Southampton on the 16th September, 1964. Subsequently, two of the passengers were reported suffering from Paratyphoid "B" Fever, with onsets on the 16th & 19th September 1964. Four passengers had proceeded to addresses in Islington. They were all visited and bacteriological examinations proved negative. The remaining three groups were reports of fourteen hospital & ward contacts of both typhoid & paratyphoid "B" fever cases found in two neighbouring hospitals. All Islington contacts were visited & kept under observation. Bacteriological examinations all proved negative. Typhus Information was received of a Cypriot adult female, who was admitted to hospital a short time after arrival in this country. She had developed symptoms whilst on board ship. Results of serological tests showed that the patient's illness was due to a variety of Mediterranean tick typhus. Dysentery The incidence of Dysentery in 1964 (231 cases) was considerably less than in 1963 when there were 1378 - a record. From the detailed analysis it will be noted that 73 cases (32%) were under 5 years and 80 cases (35%) of schoolage. The infecting organism in nearly all cases was Shigella Sonnei and the illness was rarely severe or dangerous Whilst the source of infection was undiscovered in the greater proportion of cases, there were three minor outbreaks, two in Islington schools and one in a private Day Nursery, and three other small groups of cases associated with a school, a Day Nursery and an L.C.C. Home outside the Borough. It will be seen from the dysentery table on page 22 that arising out of the extensive enquiries made, only one case was found to be employed as a food handler although 19 food handlers were discovered who were direct or indirect contacts of dysentery cases. 22 DYSENTERY IN ISLINGTON . 1964 Month 1964 No. of Cases Notified Coming to knowledge Confirmed Cases Sex AGE GROUPS Cases employed as food h and1 ers Food Handler Contacts Water Closet Accommodation i 0- 1- 5- 15- 25- 45- 65- Same family Separate family Separate Shared J anuary 27 16 11 12 M 2 5 2 - 1 - - - 1 - 14 13 F - 3 4 4 4 I 1 - February 45 36 9 26 M 1 5 9 2 1 - 1 1 6 3 26 19 F - 7 11 3 5 - - .

The Tuberculosis Care Committee is able to assist patients in many ways, including the provision of extra nourishment, while loans of beds, bedding and medical appliances were made to 10 patients from the L.C. C. loan stock, others were referred to various organisations for assistance. The Care Committee administers an occupational therapy service with occupational therapists employed by the L. C. C. The following figures show the service being provided in a typical week: No. of sessions of instructions in homes during a week 14 No. of patients receiving instruction at home 35 26 Scabies and Vermin Scabies Vermin Children under 5 years - Number treated 79 33 Number of baths given 208 - Number of treatments - 33 L.C.

There was a further rise in the numbers treated for scabies in 1964 - 388 compared with 369 the previous year. The numbers treated for vermin infestations also showed a steep rise to 392 compared with the previous year* s total of 239. These conditions continue to be dealt with at the Council's Treatment Centre and are of course related to personal hygiene. Bacteriological Examinations The number of specimens sent to the Public Health Laboratory, County Hall, S.E.I, for bacteriological examination was 2,236. This represented a more average yearly figure as compared with a record total of 9,839 specimens submitted last year due mainly to the various Dysentery outbreaks occurring at that time. Examinations carried out Total Swabs (Diphtheria) 144 Sputum (Tuberculosis) 8 Faeces & Urine (Enteric Fever) 206 Blood (Enteric Fever) - Faeces (Food Poisoning) 169 Food (Food poisoning) 6 Faeces (Dysentery) 1,609 Faeces (Poliomyelitis) 1 Swabs (Streptococci) 49 Swabs (Pertussis) - Swabs (influenza) - Vesicle Fluid scrapings (Variola) - Other specimens 44 TOTAL 2,236 (I am indebted to Dr. Wilfrid G. Harding, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, for the 1964 figures in connection with vaccination, diphtheria and whooping cough inoculations, and chest clinics.) SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA (In conjunction with Mr. W.C. Bartlett, Chief Public Health Inspector) The work of the department was restricted during the year by the impending merger between Islington and Pinsbury to form the new London Borough of Islington on the 1st April, 1965. This fact had an over-shadowing effect, because of the uncertainties the position created in regard to staff and duties. The establishment of Public Health Inspectors was still under strength, there being eight vacancies at the end of the year. Repeated advertisements did not attract candidates and the deficiency was increased at the end of the year. The most important new item of legislation which affected the department and became operative during the year was the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963. The Council approved the appointment of an additional Senior Public Health Inspector and two Technical Assistants to carry out duties under the Act. Some of the responsibilities, especially in regard to safety precautions and machine guards, constitute functions new to the department. Fortunately, the staff recommended by the Council were recruited and although the Act was in force for only part of the year, the details of the work done as set out on page 44 and as reported to the Minister of Labour amounted to a very considerable volume. Prom the findings of the inspections done under the Act, it is apparent that it was a very necessary measure. Considerable improvements in safety and working conditions have already been effected and much more is likely to follow. In spite of staff difficulties, there was a very considerable increase in the number of summonses taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, listed in detail on page 31. A number of complaints of noise has necessitated Inspectors carrying out all night duty. It is usual for two Inspectors to carry out this duty commencing at about 9 p.m. and completing the duty between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. The matters which received attention included complaints of noise, the inspection of clubs and refreshment houses, food factories which wark on shifts and the supervision of early delivery of milk. The quinquennial inspection of basement bakehouses required under the Factories Act, 1961, was completed and any necessary repairs carried out to comply with the Council's requirements. Certificates of suitability were, therefore, continued upon the satisfactory completion of the work. On 1st January, the provisions of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1963, came into operation in regard to the Metropolitan Cattle Market. As a result, the abattoirs and the market ceased to operate and the remaining offensive trades re-sited outside the Borough. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, in a circular letter in February 1964, drew attention to the Poisons Rules 1964, which restricted the sale of fluoroacetamide in the same manner as certain other poisons. The effect will be that in future, it will be obtainable only on a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health of the Local Health Authority or a duly authorised officer of the Ministry for 27 use only as a rodenticide in specific locations, for example, sewers, by employees of the authorities or persons carrying on a business of pest control. A full report was made to the Public Health Committee regarding control of the stocks of fluoroacetamide in the department, protective precautions taken by the staff, and the instruction of the staff in the use and possible risks of fluoroacetamide, and the precautions taken in the laying of bait. The substantial number of immigrants in the borough necessitates consideration in a new context of many matters which may be brought to the Health Department. For example, with certain immigrant groups e.g. Turkish or Greek Cypriots and Pakistanis, the language problem may present certain difficulties. However, the Inspectors often find that where families have been in this country for some years, the children are able to speak English quite well and if old enough, may be a considerable help in assisting their parents to understand what is required to comply with the Council's requirements in their respective cases. Having regard to the fact that immigrants vary in their recognition of social life and good relations with neighbours, either in the same house or in the same street, cases of difficulty are bound to arise. Overcrowding occurs in a number of instances, but the families concerned are afraid to complain because of possible eviction. Some landlords increase the rent where children are accommodated and this fact affects immigrants to a very high degree. There is an impression among the staff concerned that during the year, more complaints were received from immigrants than previously and they appeared to have increasing regard for the public health staff as available to assist them in the same way as other tenants. In this connection, the Council's Welfare Officer for immigrants who took up his appointment during the year (also referred to inSection F) has been of considerable assistance to the Public Health Inspectors in the implementation of their duties. It has also been the experience that a very considerable number of residents are out during normal working hours, so that it has not been easy to complete inspections of houses in multiple occupation, in particular, without recourse to evening visits. Such visits and also week-end visits have been increased.

Disinfection and Disinfestation (a) General Number of rooms disinfected after cases of infectious disease 210 Number of rooms treated for vermin 1,071 Number of rooms included in the above figure treated for vermin (free of charge) 185 (The majority of free cases were carried out on behalf of elderly or infirm persons or persons of limited means). The department also undertook the disinfection of wards in a number of hospitals upon request for co-operation in the control of hospital infection, and also continued to do the routine disinfection of pillows and woollen blankets from a hospital in the Borough. 35 1,432 bags containing blankets and pillows were disinfected in accordance with an agreed procedure. 26 visits were paid by the Public Health Inspector to a factory to supervise the treatment of 1,738 bales of clothing and other material for export. The total weight of bales treated was 55 tons 16 cwts. In addition 12 oven loads were steam disinfected at the Treatment Centre for the Company concerned. (b) Steam Disinfection 7,879 articles of clothing or bedding were steam disinfected. (c) Fly and other Infestations Anti-fly treatment at Ashburton Grove Depot commenced on 15th April, pour treatments being carried out during the summer months. The evidence of infestation was slight. Two Council's housing estates were treated for Red Clover Mite. Complaints alleging that other estates were infested were received but not confirmed. Specimens of the Red Tailed Maggot (Enstalis tenox) were recovered from a ffooded gulley in the Borough. These were the larvae of Hover Flies - possibly the Drove Ply. Sixteen complaints of wasps were received. Thirteen nests were destroyed. In one case the celling had to be removed in order to get at the nest. Twelve complaints of bees were received. Three nests were destroyed. One swarm was removed by a Bookeeper and one swarm moved on. (d) Static Water Tanks - Air-raid Shelters - Vacant Sites The nuisance arising from the tipping of refuse on vacant sites is decreasing due to redevelopment. The majority of sites are fenced round thus preventing, as far as possible, access for the purpose of fly tipping and by children. The depositing of refuse and the accumulation of water in static water tanks is still a problem The Cleansing Superintendent upon application from the Public Health Inspector arranges for the removal of the refuse by his Department. The stagnant water is then pumped out by the London Fire Brigade, but refuse is soon deposited again and the nuisance recurs. A number of tanks were demolished during the year and thus the number of nuisances has decreased. Notices are displayed where possible drawing the attention of the public to the fact that the depositing of refuse on war damaged sites is an offence. Visits paid to bomb damaged or vacant sites 203 Visits to air-raid shelters and static water tanks 81 Inspection of derelict buildings 126 The placing of abandoned vehicles on vacant sites is on the increase. The cooperation of the Cleansing Superintendent is sought for their removal. Complaints are frequently received in respect of derelict buildings. Such buildings may be dangerous and become a health hazard by the depositing of all kinds of refuse. There is often difficulty in tracing owners and in certain cases the Council has to remove the refuse itself. Rats are attracted to such premises sometimes 36 gaining access through an unsealed drain fitting. Caravan Sites and Control of Developnent Act, 1960 Caravans An application for approval to site a caravan in the Borough was given but not acted upon by the Owner. In another case a caravan was sited in a private roadway and although nuisances were alleged none were confirmed. Every endeavour is being made to get the caravan removed. Atmospheric Pollution - Clean Air Act During the year Circular 46/64 was issued by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. This Circular draws attention to the effect which Section 95 of the Housing Act, 1964, has upon the expression "new dwelling" . As defined by the Clean Air Act, 1956, a new dwelling is now a dwelling the erection of which or the production of which, by conversion, was begun on or after 16th August, 1964. The Circular also deals with the designation of appliances, approval of expenditure and discretionary grants. In addition the provision of gas or electric ignition appliances are now eligible for grant. The Minister also issued Circular 60/64. In accordance with this Circular all electrically operated space heating appliances are excluded from grant aid with the exception of those which operate or mainly operate by storing heat in material which is incorporated in or forms part of the structure and where the appliance takes its current for heating purposes from a circuit designed to act at an "off peak" electricity tariff. The Minister has already recognised that the cost of conversions is likely to be increased, and gave approval to a notional cost of £25 per room where it was not possible to determine precisely the items of expenditure which would be reasonably necessary. During the year two Smoke Control orders came into operation. There appears to be an increasing trend away from solid fuel. Complaints were received of smoke emission from one hospital in the Borough.

Public Health (London) Act. 1936 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937 Noise Abatement Act, 1960 - Noise Nuisance Complaints continue to be received of noise arising from the use of power machines in domestic premises, from wireless amplifiers, juke boxes, and noisy parties. Motor repairs carried out on the highway were also the subject of complaints but with the co-operation of the police these were discontinued. Complaints were lodged concerning an alleged use of an all-night launderette. A noise sufficient to justify legal action was not confirmed. In addition the collection, storage and loading of tubular steel scaffolding became the source of a real nuisance in one case, but with the co-operation of the owners the noise was minimised. Press publicity was given to the use of power drills in a road widening scheme. This complaint was found to be justified and the nuisance was remedied within a period of a few hours after the attention of the firm had been drawn to this by the Inspector. The majority of complaints are satisfactorily disposed of voluntarily, an interview by the Inspector being sufficient to secure an abatement of the nuisance:- Number of complaints received 134 Number of inspections 310 Number of confirmed casps abated 66 Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (Part IV) Offensive Trades Details of the respective offensive trades in the Borough are as follows:- (a) Tripe Boiler 26/40 Vale Royal, Messrs.

The danger associated with the use of oil heaters has been publicised from time to time. Used oil heaters are sometimes seen for sale without a guard. Upon the inspector drawing the attention of the proprietor to this fact such heaters have been withdrawn from sale and broken up. Publicity on the risks and disposal of old oil heaters is referred to in Section F of the Report. Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 This Act, probably the most important measure of hygiene and safety legislation for many years, came into effect in 1964. In general, the Act is concerned with cleanliness, overcrowding, internal temperature, ventilation, lighting, sanitary conveniences, washing facilities, supply of drinking water, accommodation for clothing, office furniture, eating facilities and common parts, such as floors, passages and stores. It also provides for the fencing of dangerous machinery in offices, for the protection of yougg persons and for the general supervision of people working with dangerous machines. It is also concerned with noise and vibrations, with the prohibition of heavy work and with the provision of First Aid. Employers are required to notify their employees of their rights under the Act. As from the 1st May 1964, anyone intending to employ people in shops, offices or railway premises was required to notify the Authority reeponsible for enforcing the Act. The relevant sections of the Shops Act, 1950 enforced by the Borough Council were repealed on the 1st August, the measure being incorporated in the new Act. Several of the requirements cover new duties for the Oouncil's inspectors, in particular those relating to the safety of floors, passages and stairs^ the fencing of exposed machinery, the training and supervision of persons working at dangerous machines and the prohibition of heavy work. It is estimated that there are approximately 6,000 premises requiring insnection in the first instance, although it is also estimated that a number of these are likely to be exempt from the requirements of the Act for one reason or another. The Public Health Committee and Oouncil approved the formation of a separate section of the inspectorate under the Chief Public Health Inspector to carry out the work of this Act. The staff comprised a Senior Public Health Impector assisted by two Technical Assistants. The Oouncil were required to submit to the Minister a report of the work done under the Act between 1st August and the 31st December, and this was done. The following relevant information is extracted from the report. 1.474 premises had registered under the Act and at the end of the year 1387 remained registered. Of these, 1,348 received general inspection. As a result of these inspections 1,180 letters were sent by the Department giving details of deficiencies. In the early stages nearly all premises were found to be below the standards prescribed in the Act, but as occupiers became aware of the statutory requirements, an endeavour was made to bring their premises up to the necessary standards. 45 Most premises had no thermometers or first aid facilities and the local demand for these items was, at one time, oo great that there was difficulty in obtaining them fro® the main suppliers. Inspections of all types of premises revealed that a considerable proportion of floors and staircases could be classed as hazardous, if not dangerous, to the employees; a major deficiency in shops was the lack of a constant supply of hot or warm running water. It is too early to state how many premises have complied with the written intimations that have been sent. Re-visiting commenced in December and early indications are that a high percentage of premises now comply or action has been taken with a view to compliance. The provisions relating to dangerous machinery have proved difficult to administer in some respects. Inspectors have given advice to occupiers on the guarding of various machines but difficulty in obtaining the recommended type of guard required has been experienced. This applies in particular to Gravity feed slicing machines and handoperated paper cutting guillotines. During the part of 1964 in which the Act has been in force, nine accidents have been notified of which three required further investigation. As a result of these investigations a letter was sent in one case recommending measures that could be taken to prevent recurrence. It is felt that only a few occupiers are aware of their responsibility to notify accidents and that further publicity both at national and local level may prove necessary. A provisional estimate of the number of properties to be registered in the Borough compared with the number of registrations received suggests that possibly only half of the premises concerned have registered. Further publicity is necessary to secure 100% registration. A table giving details of the contraventions found is overleaf. 46 Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 Summary of defects found and intimations served up to December 31st, 1964.

Thirteen rat infestations were found to be caused by defective drains, five were caused by disused or unsealed drains and two by defective sewers. Appropriate action was taken in each case. At one premises in the Borough, a heavy infestation of rats continued over a long period, although every effort was made to secure disinfestation. It was subsequently found that the drain in adjoining premises was defective and since this was re-iaid no further complaints have been received. At another property 30 feet of disused drains were found to exist. These were sealed off and the infestation of rats ceased. At one Council estate a large hole occurred in the grounds and subsequent baiting proved that this was being actively used by rats. Upon excavating, a disused interceptor and a short length of outlet drain were revealed. These were seiled off and no further trouble was experienced. On another estate four disused drains which originally served air-raid shelters allowed rats to infest the grounds. These drains were sealed off, terminating the nuisance. No infestation by Ship rats were recorded. Other Infestations A complaint was received with regard to an accidental infestation by Glis Glis this is a dormouse which it is said the Romans used to regard as edible. They are now kept as pets and are easily tamed. Fluoroacetamide The Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food in a circular letter dated 6th February. 1964. drew attentioh to the Poisons Rules, 1964, which extend to fluoroacetamide the restrictions on the sale of certain other poisons. The practical effect of this is that as from 7th February, sodium fluoroacetamide, like salts of monofluoroacetic acid, can only be obtained on a certificate from a Medical Officer of Health of a local authority or a duly authorised officer of the Ministry for use only as a rodenticide in specified locations, viz. sewers, etc., by employees of the authorities mentioned, or by persons carrying on a business of pest control. The 48 object of these restrictions is to ensure that fluoroacetamide is used under proper control and in suitable locations only.

Water Supplies The Metropolitan Water Board is the responsible Authority for the supply of water to Islington. The supply is satisfactory both in regard to quality and quantity. One sample was taken from the mains supply for bacteriological examination and one for chemical analysis, and were found to be satisfactory. There are 47,537 dwellings in the Borough supplied directly from water mains serving the entire population of the Borough (227,090) Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 95 1. 72 applications were received for Water Certificates and 72 Certificates were issued in respect of 304 dwellings. 2. 23 Intimation and 11 Statutory Notices were served under this Section requiring the provision of water supplies to tenement houses. Eight water supplies were provided and 17 were improved during the year. (a) Well Water Of the 28 bore holes or wells known to exist in the Borough 19 continue to be unused being effectively sealed. Six of the remaining wells are out of use. Three samples were taken for bacteriological examination and five for chemical analysis respectively. The results were considered satisfactory as the water from these sources is used solely for industrial purposes. 50 (b) Water Supplies - Miscellaneous Four samples of sub-soil water were taken for chemical analysis. The results indicated sewage contamination. (c) Swimming Bath Water 105 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and all were reported as being satisfactory. 10 samples were taken for chemical analysis and a satisfactory report was received in each case. By courtesy of the Chief Superintendent and Engineer of Baths and Wash-houses, the following information is included in this year's Report. *There are eight swimming pools at present under the control of the council and included is the newly reconstructed and modernised Hornsey Road Baths establishment. This pool has been built to national standards, and is one of the finest pools in the country with up-to-date amenities. A modern boiler house has also been installed with electronically controlled equipment and machinery to ensure that the building and water will be maintained at the required temperature. The Metropolitan Water Board supply the water for this bath. The method of treatment for purification is by chemical dosage: alumina ferric is the coagulant used to fulfil the function of forming a film on sand. Soda ash is the alkaline salt to counteract acidity. A pH value of between 7.4 and 7.6 has proved most satisfactory to the swimmers using these baths. Aeration is maintained by means of an air compressor. Sterilisation: Chlorine gas is used, a residual of 0.5 to 0.75 p.p.m. being strictly adhered to. In the summer months when heavy loads are to be expected, it is kept to 0. 75 p. p. m. The frequency of changing the baths water is governed by the flow through the filters which in the case of these establishments is approximately once every four hours. In the summer months when the baths are open for 12 to 14 hours daily, a complete turnover of three times per day is necessary." The School Health Service at the London County Council Divisional Health Office, Clerkenwell Road, reported that at a school swimming session, some children had been affected by what appeared to be excessive chlorination. Pour of the children were referred to hospital and received treatment for eye soreness. The children were not detained, and the possible cause of a temporary excessive chlorination was taken up for investigation with the Chief Superintendent of the Baths. Seven samples of the water at Highbury Fields Open Air Swimming Pool which is controlled by the London County Council, were taken during the summer season for bacteriological examination. The results, included in the figures given at the head of this section, were satisfactory and the London County council were informed accordingly. 51 Common Lodging Houses There are no licensed Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the Borough are reasonably adequate. Flooding of basements does occasionally occur however in certain areas when the sewers are surchaged with storm water. 52 SECTION D HOUSING (In conjunction with Mr. W.C. Bartlett , Chief Public Health Inspector) Housing Act, 1961 The survey of houses in multiple occupation continued during the year. It Is quite apparent that where persons of different nationalities, habits and customs share the amenities in this type of property social problems arise which require the exercise of much tact on the part of the Inspector. 351 Informal Notices were served upon the persons in control of individual premises together with relevant extracts from the Landlord and Tenant Act 1962. In each case a summary showing the additional facilities and amenities required to satisfy the Council's Code of Practice was sent at the same time. This informal approach resulted in the provision of improvements in 48 properties. In conjunction with this work both the Borough Council and the London County Council required applicants for advances under the respective House Purchase Schemes to satisfy the requirements of the Department whenever a house was to be occupied in multiple occupation. In this connection 181 properties were inspected and works of improvement carried out. Eight Management Orders were made during the year and in one case the Owner appealed against the making of an Order to the Magistrates Court. On appeal the Owner failed to appear and the Court dismissed the appeal and awarded the Borough Council £4 4.-. costs. Two Directions under Section 19 were also made during the year. Housing Act, 1964 With the advent of this Act in August 1964, the powers given to Local Authorities under Part II, Housing Act 1961, were considerably strengthened and extended. The Local Authority* s expenses under Part II, Housing Act 1961, are now made a charge on the premises to which a notice relates and on all estates and interests therein. Formerly Section 18(4) of the Act of 1961 charged expenses on the estate or interest of the person on whom the notice was served and this proved to be a grave defect where properties were leasehold of short duration or where ownership had been difficult to establish. Provision is made for a penalty on summary conviction to be made for failure to execute works under Part II, Housing Act 1961, quite apart from the exercise of the local authority of their powers of carrying out work in default. Another most useful provision allows the service of notice under Section 15, Housing Act 1961, specifying the works which in the opinion of the Local Authority are required for rendering premises reasonably suitable for occupation by a smaller number of individuals or households than the number accommodated for the time being on the premises. It is anticipated that there are cases where the application of a Direction under Section 19 at the same time will ensure that overcrowding will be reduced and in some cases prevented. The entirely new power to make a Control Order and take over the control and management of a multi-occupied house summarily where conditions warrant such action is welcomed. It has not yet been necessary to use this power. 53 Part II, Housing Act 1964, enables Local Authorities to improve tenanted dwellings in improvement areas and tenement blocks; and elsewhere at the personal request of the tenant. The Borough is at present being surveyed to identify areas suitable for improvement and which are not included in any other schemes to be carried out by the Council. It is considered that intensive publicity must go hand in hand with the declaration of improvement areas in order to obtain the maximum support from tenants and owners of properties and every inducement given to owners to apply for grant aid in carrying out house improvement. Housing Act, 1957 - Part II During the year seven Closing Orders were made in respect of whole houses and 25 in respect of parts of buildings. 24 houses were repaired to Housing Act standard and existing Closing Orders determined. Housing Act, 1957 - Part III The undermentioned areas were represented to the Council: 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 Eden Grove (5 houses); 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, 9, 10. 11, 12. 13, 14. 15. 16, 17, 18. 19, 20 Bishops Grove (20 houses) Close liaison was maintained with the London County Council In respect of areas represented by that Authority, and where necessary, supporting evidence given at Public Inquiries. Miscellaneous Arising from this work it is pleasing to note that the Housing Inspectors receive frequent enquiries in respect of private improvement works proposed by owners and the contacts established with architects and builders have proved most useful in ensuring that a high standard of Improvement and workmanship is attained. Details of housing progress up to and including 31st December are as follows:- Permanent Dwellings Completed Pre-War 1,817 Completed Post-War 4,234 Under Construction 330 To be erected on land acquired 805 To be erected on land being acquired 1,473 Temporary Bungalows Lettings provided by Repair/Conversion of purchased houses 675 The number of houses and flats erected in the Borough during the year was Borough Council 172 + 20 repair/conversion London County Council 104 + 49 repair/conversion Private Enterprise 122 Flats + 1 house 54 The number of municipal flats and houses erected since the war is Borough Council 4,263 + 63 Repair/Conversion London County Council 3,385 + 29 rebuilds from war damage + 49 repair conversions The total number of dwellings (i.e. flats and houses separately assessed) in the Borough at the end of the year was 47,537.

Bartlett, Chief Public Health Inspector) The following legislation was made during the year which had inter alia the effects indicated. The Mineral Hydrocarbons in Pood Regulations, 1964, which prohibit, subject to certain exemptions, the use of any mineral hydrocarbons in the composition or preparation of food, the sale of food containing any mineral hydrocarbon and, on and after 15th February next year, the consignment, delivery, or importation of any food containing any mineral hydrocarbon. These Regulations re-enact with amendments the Mineral Oil in Pood Orders and Regulations, 1949/1955. The Soft Drinks Regulations, 1964, which revoke previous legislation and replace with amendments the Pood Standards (Soft Drinks) Order, 1953, as amended. Among the principal changes are that standards of composition have been introduced for semisweet and low calory soft drinks and labelling provisions for these drinks are laid down. The use of cyclamic acid is permitted as artificial sweetener in soft drinks in place of or in conjunction with saccharine. In addition the descriptions of soft drinks sold from vending machines and where appropriate a declaration of the artificial sweetener content must appear on such machines. Protection of Animals (Anaesthetics) Act, 1964. This Statute amends the schedule of the Protection of Animals (Anaesthetics) Act, 1954, and enlarges the classes of operations in which anaesthetics must be used. The Meat (Treatment) Regulations, 1964. These make it an offence to sell, consign or deliver any raw and unprocessed meat intended for sale for human consumption which contains any added substance of a kind specified. These substances include Ascorbic acid, Erythorbic acid, Nicotinic acid, Nicotinamide or any salt or other derivatives of any of these substances. The Dried Milk Regulations, 1964, which re-enact with amendments the Regulations of 1923/1948. The Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959, Approved Chemical Agents. Circulars 3, 12, 21 and 25 were issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood approving specified products for the cleansing of milk containers, vessels or appliances as an alternative to scalding with boiling water or steam in accordance with Regulation 27(6)(a) of the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. With regard to the Bread and Flour Regulations, 1963. These came into operation on 1st September this year. The Regulations prescribed permitted ingredients for certain breads and a composition containing milk solids or added protein, and also controls labelling and advertising. All-night inspections were carried out by two Inspectors on several occasions during the year. Refreshment houses, night clubs, vehicles used in the transport of meat and other foods, and food factories working outside normal hours, were included in the inspections. These visits have a salutary effect upon the staff engaged in such undertakings and proprietors or employees are now beginning to accept 57 and expect such visits being paid during the early hours of the morning. Many legal proceedings have resulted from the visits including the seizure of unsound food at 2 a.m. which with the resultant successful prosecution must be considered exceptional. Contraventions of the Pood Hygiene Regulations are often observed and advice given by the Inspectors with a view to an improvement being made in order to bring the premises up to satisfactory standard. In some cases employees were found to be smoking in rooms where open food was stored or sold and appropriate action was taken. In order to assist in the education of immigrants engaged in food handling and to inform them of their obligations under the Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations a quantity of pamphlets were printed in Greek, Turkish, Chinese, Urdu, Bengali and Italian. These have proved to be helpful in the promotion of hygienic practices and have assisted the Inspectors in securing compliance with the required standards. Complaints of alleged unfitness were received in respect of the following: - Biscuits, excess of fatty acids Mouldy pie (7) Bitter roast pork , Mouldy bread (11) Bad taste of sweets Mould in tinned meat (2) Bread causing sickness Margarine instead of butter Bitter orange ice lolly Mould in margarine Bad taste to meat pie Mould in sponge Cap in milk bottle (2) Metal in apple tart Cement in milk bottle Nail in loaf of bread Cigarette in loaf of bread Pineapple and rice causing sickness Disinfectant in mineral water Plastic in fruit cake Discoloured corned beef Paraffin odour in orange juice Decomposition of tinned meat Rubber band in cake Dirty milk bottle Rancid butter (2) Dirty medicine bottle Soiled dough in bread (4) Foreign body in loaf of bread (2) Stale cake Foreign substance in milk (2) Sand in powered chillies Fibre in chocolate Sugary condition of jellies Glass in cereal Tin of pineapple Glass in medicine Unfit apples Hairs in span roll Unsound pork Insects in milk Wire in chocolate Insects in cereals Wood in tinned luncheon meat Mussels Details of the proceedings taken in respect of the above complaints, and other action by the Inspectors appear on pages 59 - 61. Mould still plays an important part in complaints, showing a lack of good housekeeping either by the retailer or the purchaser. Sometimes there is a misunderstanding in the use of refrigeration particularly in the case of meat pies - the stated shelflife of which should not be exceeded. Inspectors are only too pleased to advise retailers on this or any other aspect of food handling or storage. The receipt of such complaints show the awareness of the public who demand a clean and wholesome article of food. The Inspectors found that in many cases the occupiers of food and other premises make structural alterations and commence business without due regard to the legislation in force. Upon being found later it is difficult to secure compliance with the Council's requirements. 58 As a result of an epidemic of Typhoid fever in Aberdeen, which was thought to be associated with cold cooked meat including corned beef, it was considered advisable, as a precautionary measure only, to hold back 61b. tins of corned beef processed within certain dates and bearing specified marks. It was found that in three cases only tins of this size and bearing the specified mark were in stock and upon return of these to the supplier no further action was found necessary.

The Public Health and Cleansing Committees agreed that the respective departments should co-operate in this matter, and a poster and a leaflet were printed as under:- Metropolitan Borough of Islington Public Health Department OLD OIL HEATERS - DISPOSAL There were 727 fires in the Borough of Islington in 1963; many were caused by faulty oil heaters. Several people lost their lives in the fires. Old oil heaters are dangerous, and should not be used or resold. If you are not certain whether your oil heater is safe, please get in touch with the Public Health Department and an officer of the Council will call on you and advise you. The Metropolitan Borough Council of Islington realise the danger of old oil heaters, and have arranged for the Refuse Collectors to collect them with the ordinary household refuse. If you would like an old oil heater to be taken away, please pierce the tank to empty it of paraffin oil and leave it by the dustbin marked 'to be taken'. V. FREEMAN Medical Officer of Health " The poster was bill-posted on sites throughout the Borough and the Chief Librarian assisted in the distribution of leaflets. The Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council also assisted in publicity. On 11th March, Dr. Burns, Deputy Medical Officer of Health, spoke to the Junction Road Congregational Church Fellowship on the "Prevention of Accidents in the Home" and on the 25th May and 1st June, he gave lectures on "Home Safety" to members of a local branch of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade. In 1964 the Home Secretary issued regulations banning the sale of children's inflammable nightwear under the Children's Nightdresses Regulations, 1964, as a result of increasing awareness of the fire hazards of children's nightwear. The number of deaths and serious injuries owing to clothing igniting is reliably estimated to be 300 deaths and 1,000 injuries per year. The Regulations apply to all nightdresses having both a finished garment chest measurement not exceeding 38 inches and overall length not exceeding 46 inches. The Regulations do not apply to any nightdresses which although coming within both of these measurements is so made or designed that it is unsuitable for wear by a child under the age of 13 years, nor do they apply to any nightdress which is designed as an infant's gown suitable for wear by a newly born baby. 68 The responsibility for the sale of children's nightwear after 1st October, 1964, lies with the retailer while enforcement of the Regulations rests with the Local Authorities. One of the laboratories authorised by the Secretary of State to carry out, on behalf of Local Authorities, the testing of nightdresses to determine whether or not they comply with the prescribed low-flammability requirements carried out a demonstration in October which was attended by the Chief Public Health Inspector.

The Public Health Committee earlier in the year, approved my proposal to enter in the procession a float which had as its theme the comparable costs of smoking 20 cigarettes a day for one year and a holiday for two persons in a sunny climate. The weather on the day was appropriate to the theme of the float which appeared to attract considerable attention:-(see illustration). A useful variation from our regular publicity on the subject was the display in the Town Hall of sixteen anti-smoking panels provided by the Public Health Department of the London County Council and appropriate literature from the same source was also distributed. In addition, publicity was carried out relating to this subject by bill-posting on poster sites in the Borough and the Distribution of literature provided by the Ministry of Health, Central Council of Health Education, and the Chest and Heart Association. In October I attended a meeting sponsored by the Ministry of Health on Smokers' Advisory Clinics. The meeting was opened by the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry, Sir George Godber, who stated that it was desirable to pool experience gained from running anti-smoking clinics and that these clinics had a value demonstrating that it was possible to stop smoking. Among the speakers was Dr. Harding, Divisional Medical Officer of Health, Health Division 3, London County Council, who spoke of methods of organising and staffing a clinic after two years in Islington. This was run jointly by the Islington Chest Clinic, the Islington Public Health Department and the Public Health Department of the London County Council. Financial provision sufficed for two doctors, a health visitor and a clerk who all had the advantage of being ex-smokers. Meetings took place on Tuesday afternoon from 5 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. It is interesting to observe the results obtained from a summary based on particulars supplied by 18 of the 30 clinics started in this country. Out of a total of 2,249 people who attended the clinics concerned 28.7% stopped smoking by the end of Health Department Float in Carnival 16th May, 1964. (Photograph by Mr. E. J. Sharp) 69 their clinic sessions, 34.7% had failed to attend more than two sessions. It was thought that the rest had reduced their smoking to a varying degree. The meeting felt that it was essential that Smokers' Advisory Clinics should continue to work and in increasing numbers. The risks of cigarette smoking are well known and urgent and intensive action at national and local levels is necessary. This type of clinic is likely to play an increasing part in this campaign in the future. The Advisory Smoking Clinic mentioned above continued to function at 32 Drayton Park, N.5, where those who wished to give up the smoking habit met together in a group therapy course or undertook an individual course. General Publicity Regular publicity by means of leaflets and posters, according to season and topicality, together with the distribution of 1,000 copies per month of "Better Health" mainly through the Islington Public Libraries, and the provision of "Family Doctor" for reading, continued throughout the year. We are also indebted to the Public Libraries Department for public health and other publicity during the year. In their monthly issues of "Borough Council News" from January to March, and "New Islington" from April onwards, short articles appeared month by month on the following topics:- January - Infectious Disease February - Infectious Diseases. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever March - Noise Nuisance - Noise Abatement Act, 1960 April - Services for Elderly Persons May - Cleansing of Elderly Persons July - Meals- on- Wheels, Lunch Clubs, Holidays for elderly persons, Parcels for elderly persons, Work Centre August - Give up your old Oil Heaters September - Nuisance by Pigeons October - Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act November - Winter Hazards - Fireworks safety, etc. December - Safety for Christmas Health Education The Cohen Committee on Health Education was appointed in 1959 by the Central and Scottish Health Services Councils. The report by this Committee stated that it was difficult to fix exact boundaries to health education but it was regarded as being involved where the prime factor of information or instruction is to promote mental and physical health. The four main types of health education programmes were specified as:- 70 (i) specific action (e.g. vaccination and immunisation); (ii) habit or attitude changing (e.g. avoidance of overeating; attitude to mental illness); (iii) support for community action (e.g. for clean air, fluoridation); (iv) education which leads patients to know when to consult their doctors, especially at the early stage of serious illness. Reference was made in the report to the fact that much more health education is already being carried out and considerable success has been achieved in vaccination, immunisation and community X-ray examinations. There have also been marked improvements in the standard of maternity and child care, in sanitary cleanliness and food hygiene and, probably, in attitudes to mental illness. The Committee thought that there is clearly a continuing need for health education in these fields and that insufficient health education is at present being directed towards particular groups, including notably schoolchildren, teenagers, fathers, middle-aged men and those of limited intelligence in all groups The Cohen Committee recommended the establishment of a Central Board to promote a climate of opinion favourable to health education, develop "blanket" programmes of education on selected priority subjects (securing support from all possible natural sources, commercial and voluntary as well as medical) and assist local authorities and other agencies in the conduct of programmes locally. Such a Board would foster training of specialist health educators, promote the training in health education of doctors, nurses, teachers, and dentists and evaluate the results achieved by health education. The Cohen Committee further recommended that over the next five years health education should be more vigorously promoted by the expenditure of another £500,000 on staff for new, stronger, central organisations in England, Wales and Scotland; on pilot habit changing campaigns on social surveys; and on the strengthening of the new and yet small profession of health educators. Expenditure of this amount would be less than two per cent, of what is estimated to be spent annually on advertising sweets and cigarettes. The Public Health Committee of the Council considered in detail the Medical Officer of Health's review and summary of the Cohen Committee Report, and recommended that the Borough Council support the Cohen Committee proposal to set up a Central Board for Health Education, and to inform the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee accordingly. The Health Department and Immigrants There is a very considerable population of immigrants in Islington, and their presence has given rise to certain problems which affect the work of the Health Department. The 1961 Census Returns disclosed that there were nearly 10,000 residents originating from Cyprus, about 8,000 from the Caribbean territories and less than 2,000 from India and Pakistan and Ghana and Nigeria respectively. Problems of friction on housing matters have not infrequently been brought to the department with complaints from one party or another. Since many of the immigrants, particularly those from Cyprus, are concerned in the food trades including restaurants and cafes, and as owners of food premises, and also as kitchen workers, as well as other aspects in which the health department is concerned, problems of new aspects of health education as well as enforcement arise. 71 There are also language problems in some cases, particularly in immigrants from Cyprus and India and Pakistan, which may render communication difficult and, taking all these matters as well as the more general aspects of immigrant welfare into account, the Council decided to make the appointment of a welfare officer with experience of social welfare work, who would come within the purview of the Public Health Department under the jurisdiction of the Medical Officer of Health. It was decided that the duties of this welfare officer should include the investigation of problems arising from the Council's statutory functions (e.g. on food hygiene, housing, rent control) as they affect the immigrant community and co-ordination with the appropriate officers. He would also help with the integration of immigrant citizens into the local community, carry out reconciliation case work, assist in the development of community activities with immigrant groups, and effect liaison with existing services, including working closely with the Islington International Friendship Council. The Borough Council appointed Mr. A.G. Bennett to the post of welfare officer and this turned out to be appropriate, as are. Bennett himself is an immigrant from the West Indies. He took up his appointment about the middle of the year and was able to effect most useful public relations and liaison functions within the terms of his appointment.

The Borough Council continued to give financial assistance to the Islington Old People's Welfare Council and the Women's Voluntary Service under the provisions of Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, which authorises local authorities to make contributions to the funds of voluntary organisations, whose activities include the provision of recreation or meals for old people. As mentioned in previous Reports, the Borough, largely through the Public Health Department, effects liaison with voluntary organisations as well as other statutory authorities, assisting old people in one form or another. In the voluntary sphere, acknowledgments are again due to Miss D.E. Church, the Honorary Secretary, and the members of the Islington Old People's Welfare Council and to Mrs. E. MacGregor, M.B.E., Centre Organiser of the Women's Voluntary Service and her colleagues. Visiting of Elderly Persons The greater part of the organised and systematic visiting of elderly persons is carried out by members of the Public Health Department, who visit for the purposes of the Public Health, L.C.C. (General Powers) and National Assistance Acts. The Elderly Persons Register maintained in the Department comprised, at the end of the year, a total of 3,881 persons over 65 years of age. The Department's Visitors called on 631 new cases during the year and re-visits totalled 4,623. They made 4,397 references during the year to persons or organisations 74 outside the Department and, in present circumstances, it is most unlikely that this kind of help could have been given in any other way in the absence of the Department's own staff. These references covered requests for provision of meals and home help services welfare home or hospital admission, National Assistance or grants and introductions to clubs Work Centre and associations dealing with blind and handicapped persons registrations with medical practitioners, and help in contacting relatives Gas and Electricity undertakings were notified of defective appliances and recommendations were made to the London County Council for the provision of fireguards in an additional 26 cases. 135 cases were also recommended for home nursing equipment supplied through Che County Council. The Borough Council's grant to the Old People's Welfare Council for the year, utilised mainly for the provision of holidays, clubs, and part-time employment for the elderly, totalled £9,285.

During the year 422 washings comprising 3,491 articles, were carried out on behalf of 19 recipients Stoke Newington Borough Council A similar agreement was entered into as with Holborn Borough Council. During the year 451 washings comprising 4 195 articles, were carried out on behalf of 23 recipients. Corporation of London Washings - 76 Articles - 950 Number of recipients 5 75 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, Section 43 Cleansing of Elderly Persons The service of the bathing of elderly persons must be closely associated with the laundry service mentioned above. Home bathing may be carried out by the Department's own staff in the person's home if he or she is homebound. Alternatively, bathing may be done at the Treatment Centre, Seven Sisters Road, and those who can leave their home but would have difficulties with public transport can be taken to the Centre in the Department's own specially-designed vehicle. 312 persons were thus assisted by the department's nursing and bathing staff, and this entailed 1021 home visits and 722 baths given at the Treatment Centre. All this work is carried out under the supervision of the Nurse-in-Charge at the Centre. The modernisation of the baths section at the Treatment Centre was completed in 1964, and described in last year's Annual Report, together with a sketch plan of the conveniences. The two new shower compartments, in particular, have proved most useful. National Assistance Acts, 1948 and 1951 It was necessary to invoke the procedure for the removal to suitable premises without delay in respect of two elderly persons in accordance with the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. An order under subsection (3) of section forty-seven of the National Assistance Act, 1948, for the removal of any such person as is mentioned in subsection (1) of that section may be made without the notice required by sub-section (7) of that section if it is certified by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner that in their opinion it is necessary in the interests of that person to remove him without delay. Details of the statutory action taken are given in the overleaf statement which has been compiled in the form required by the Ministry of Health. 76 Aged and Infirm - Action taken under Statutory Powers Case No. Name and Age Reason for Council's Action Period Named in Order Type of Accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 1 Mr. B. 85 years This elderly man who was suffering from arteriosclerosis and had burnt his right arm and hand was in need of hospital treatment. His medical practitioner obtained a hospital bed but when the ambulance called Mr. B. refused to go and the doctor asked for assistance in persuading Mr. B. to enter hospital for treatment. He was visited by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health who agreed that hospital admission was necessary. As Mr. B. persisted in his refusal it was necessary to go to a Justice of the Peace for compulsory removal. Such order was obtained on the 20th April, 1964 and Mr. B. was admitted to hospital that afternoon. Mr. B. settled fairly well in hospital and an extension of the order was not necessary. Not exceeding three weeks Geriatric Hospital Died at home 9.8.64 2 Mr. K. 88 years Mr. k. first came to notice of Public Health Department late in 1964 when there was a suggestion that he might accept Part III accomnodation. He declined and as he was then quite active, no further action was taken. Mr. K. visited the Department from time to time with regard to chiropody appointments and meals service. A telephone call was received from his medical practitioner that Mr. K. was ill, had refused examination and treatment and would not go to hospital. A visit was made by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health when he again refused examination or hospital admission. In view of Mr. K's condition an application was made to a Justice of the Peace for an order for compulsory removal and Mr. k. was admitted to hospital that afternoon. Not exceeding three weeks Geriatric Hospital Died in hospital two days later Fortunately, in only the two cases mentioned above was Order for removal of the elderly people under the National Assistance Acts. The following are examples of the ways in which the Department's health officers were able to take action or ameliorate conditions. 77 Aged and Infirm Action taken under Statutory Powers (contd.) Mrs. W (79 years) Mrs. W. came to notice of Health Officer in July 1961 She lived alone in two rooms. Mrs W. was active and had meals at local cafe. She refused service of Home Help and was not prepared to enter Welfare Home Frequent visits were made during 1962/3 and Mrs. W. being obstructive, kept her rooms locked. It was not until August when following a visit by the Deputy Medical Officer that she accepted services home bathing, laundry and meals-on-wheels. The back room was then reasonably clean but the front room was cluttered with rubbish Some rubbish was cleared. In February 1964, Mrs w agreed to go temporarily into a Welfare Home, while her rooms were cleansed and builders carried out repairs Repairs and redecorations were completed, the rooms cleansed and rubbish removed ready for Mrs W. to return home However, she still remained in the Welfare Home at end of year Mrs. H. (85 years) Mrs. H. was referred by Hospital Almoner for friendly visit late in 1954. Found to be a difficult and abusive person living alone. However she accepted a Home Help and chiropody She objected to Health Officers calling, nevertheless visits continued to be made She was admitted to hospital in August, 1961 and remained until June 1962. She was offered vacancy in Welfare Home but refused Home Help assistance was given daily but the Home Help found conditions very difficult - Mrs. H. was very often abusive and refused admission, Similar experiences were encountered with meals-on-wheels service and home bathing Mrs. H. was admitted to hospital early in April 1964 following a fall and died a few weeks later. National Assistance Act 1948 Section 31 National Assistance Act 1948 (Amendment) Act 1962 Meals Services for Elderly Persons The importance for elderly persons in particular to maintain a good standard of nutrition has been referred to in many previous annual reports. It is, therefore, gratifying that the supply of meals both in the home, through the clubs, increased substantially during the year. The meals-on-wheels service became a direct responsibility of the Public Health Department in March 1963:, and 1964 was the first complete year in which the Council was directly responsible. Approval was given at the end of 1963 to the purchase of an additional van, but the Town Hall staff canteen which has co-operated most willingly in the preparaticn of meals for the elderly, found itself unable to increase its supplies still further. An approach was, therefore, made to the Welfare Department of the L.C.C. to explore the possibility of additional meals for the elderly being appropriately supplied from Hillside, the large Welfare Department home in the north of the borough. Co-operation was most willingly offered, and the third van supplying meals on wheels prepared at "Hillside" commenced an additional service in September 1964. A total of 50 meals daily were prepared, and the arrangement has permitted an increase in the number of recipients generally, and has allowed a third delivery on a Friday to an area which had previously received meals on Monday and Wednesday only. Although the cost to the Council was rather higher, it was decided that the charge to the elderly should be at the same rate, namely, 10d. per two-course meal, whatever the source. The meals supplied during the year were as follows:- 78 Meals-on-Wheels 23, 385 (16.909) Lunch Clubs Gifford Hall Mission 4,063 (3,445) Caxton House Settlement 1,726 (1,132) Total number of meals provided 29,174 (21,486) 1963 A lunch club at St. Giles Christian Mission, Bride Street, N.7 also produced 2,180 meals with the help of their own voluntary workers and Council grant-aid. Another lunch club, situated in the Borough of Finsbury at Claremont Central Mission, White Lion Street, also caters for Islingt on residents and receives a £50 grant from this Council. Elderly persons who are able to travel to clubs may have the advantage of being provided with a meal communally. The existing lunch club facilities in and around Islington, are extremely limited. The Committee, therefore, welcomed the formation of a club at St. Matthew's Hospital, which could be attended not only by Islington ex-patients, but also by other residents in the vicinity. It was proposed that not only would the club provide luncheon eventually up to 25 meals a day for five days a week, but would also allow for recreational and other activities. The Council agreed to give financial support to this club. Towards the end of the year, the lunch club at the Caxton House Settlement commenced a regular Wednesday luncheon in addition to the existing club each Friday. Food Supplements The Public Health Committee considered a report on the provision of Complan as a food supplement to be provided for elderly persons at special prices. It was pointed out that a number of other authorities had approved the sale of Complan, and that directly or indirectly, it was agreed that the Public Health Department should arrange for the purchase of Complan; distribution to be arranged through the various old people's clubs and similar organisations, and also on the recommendations of the elderly persons' Visitors. Holidays for Elderly Persons The holiday scheme is administered by the Old People's Welfare Council aided by a Borough Council grant of £2,750 for this purpose. Assisted holidays were arranged for 583 elderly people, most of whom were able to make a contribution towards the holiday expenses. Most applicants pay small weekly sums which are collected by Miss Church, Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Welfare Council. Parcels for Elderly Persons The Borough Council authorised the expenditure of £100 on Christmas gift parcels and with this and other voluntary aid, the Islington Old People's Welfare Council were able to distribute about 650 parcels to elderly persons. Work Centre The Centre is sited at the Elizabeth Whitelaw Reid Club, Cloudesley Street, N.1. and has continued to provide part-time employment for 90-95 persons, which is the maximum capacity at the Centre. Each person attending works five half-days per week, and local firms continue to provide an interesting variety of work. The Work Centre 79 fulfils a most valuable function in providing interest as well as small additional payments to those attending. It is hoped that the London Borough of Islington will be able to find suitable sites or premises for the establishment of Work Centres in other parts of the borough. Chiropody Islington Old People's Welfare Council has continued to administer its chiropody service for elderly persons with the aid of a grant from the London County Council. Approximately 80 persons are treated each week at 11 weekly sessions. Most useful domiciliary service has provided the treatment of 312 infirm persons in their own homes. PUBLIC MORTUARY By agreement with the St. Pancras Borough Council, the premises of the St. Pancras Mortuary, Cramley Street, N.W.1., are used for the reception of bodies from Islington.
