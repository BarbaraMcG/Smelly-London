STPAN 24 Saint Pancras, Middlesex. TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of health, For the Year 1867. Gentlemen, Iu presenting another Annual Report on tlie sanitary condition of this Parish, I am enabled to congratulate you on a much lower death-rate than has prevailed for several years past. Although the population of the Parish has much increased in the past six years, the number of deaths registered in 1867 was lower than in any year since 1862. The actual number of deaths registered as having occurred in St. Pancras during the year 1867 was 4852, from which should be deducted 112 for deaths, in the Strand Union, of persons not in any way belonging to this Parish. This will bring the number to 4740. At a distance of six years from the last Census, it is impossible accurately to determine the population of the Parish, so as to calculate the annual rate of mortality. The population was estimated in 1866 at 219,024; it was no doubt over 220,000 in 1867. If this be taken as an approximation to the number living in St. Pancras in the middle of 1867, the death-rate last year was 2.154 per cent, or 215-4 to every hundred thousand living. Th6 death-rate in 1866 was 2.350 per cent. ,, 1865 ,, 2.372 ,, 1864 „ 2.585 ,, 1863 „ 2.306 ,, 1862 ,, 2.160 In the whole of London the death-rate in 1867 was 2.298 per cent., which is the lowest rate since the year 1860; the deatli-rate of the Northern 2 Districts, of which St. Pancras is one, was 2.319. The mortality of this Parish was therefore lower than that of the rest of London, or of that part of London in which St. Pancras is situated. The birth-rate in St. Pancras during 1867 was 3.41 per cent, (the population being estimated at 220,000 and the births at 7514, which is 25 more than the number registered in 52 weeks or 364 days). Amongst preventible causes of death, Small Pox stands with a higher mortality than in 1866, giving 65 deaths, besides 11 of St. Pancras parishioners who died in the Small Pox Hospital at Highgate. From Scarlet Fever the number of deaths was 101, which is fewer than in the previous year ; from Hooping Cough 166 children died, which is fewer than in 1866. From Diarrhoea 185 children and 26 adults died, which are very nearly the number registered in 1866; from Cholera, however, there were only 4 deaths, in contrast to 112 which occurred in the previous year. Typhus and Typhoid Fevers were also less fatal than in 1866; they are registered as the causes of 98 deaths besides 15 of Typhus and 5 of Typhoid which occurred in the London Fever Hospital. From Diphtheria there were 44 deaths, from Croup, 26; the mortality from Measles was low, giving 83 deaths. The number of deaths from the under-mentioned diseases in London and St. Pancras respectively, were:— London. St. Pancras. Small Pox 1332 76 Diarrhoea and Cholera 3183 215 Typhus and Typhoid (including deaths in the Hospital) 2174 118 Scarlatina 1438 102 Hooping Cough2251 166 Measles 1125 83 Pulmonary diseases (including Phthisis) 21050 1523 Phthisis alone 8817 667 The population of St. Pancras is very nearly one-fourteenth of that of the whole of London. Assuming this as the exact ratio, it appears that the rates of mortality from Small Pox, Diarrhoea, and Typhus were lower in St. Pancras than in the whole of the Metropolis. The mortality from Scarlet Fever and Measles was about the same ; whilst the mortality from Hooping Cough, Pulmonary disease (including Consumption) and from Consumption alone was higher in St. Pancras than in London. The different sub-districts exhibit a mortality varying from 18-6 to 23.6 in the thousand. They stand in the following order, beginning with the subdistrict whose rate of mortality is lowest:—Camden Town, Regent's Park, Kentish Town, Somers Town, Tottenham Court and Gray's Inn Road. The details are exhibited on Table A. The numbers can only be taken as an approximation to accuracy from the impossibility of ascertaining the present populations of the several sub-districts. I have assumed that 3 Somers Town and Camden Town are less populous than at the Census of 1861, owing to the number of houses pulled down in those localities. Tottenham Court Road and Gray's Inn districts I have assumed to be nearly stationary, whilst Regent's Park has become more populous, and Kentish Town I have estimated to have increased by nearly one-third in the six years. On Table B. the proportions of births to deaths in the several parts of the Parish are given. On this plan of estimating their salubrity, they stand nearly in the same order:—Camden Town, Kentish Town, Somers Town, Eegent's Park, Tottenham Court and Gray's Inn Eoad. On comparing the Tables of quarterly mortality for 1867 with those of 1866, it appears that the first quarter was more unhealthy in 1867—showing 1479 deaths instead of 1395 in 1866, whilst the second, third, and fourth quarters had each of them a lower death-rate in 1867 than in 1866, as under:— The mortality from epidemic disease was lower than it has been for several years past. It is not safe to attach too much importance to the statistics of a single year ; but I cannot help thinking that the sanitary work done in the houses of the poor during the Cholera epidemic of 1866, and the attention paid to the sewers as regards flushing and deodorizing, both in 1866 and 1867 have had some considerable influence in keeping down the death-rate. I believe also that good has been done by the demolition of some of the more crowded streets in Somers Town, Agar Town, and near the Old Pancras Eoad by the Midland Eailway Company; although very serious inconveniences have been suffered by the poor who were ejected. The houses into which they have removed, though many of them are ill adapted to receive them, yet have for the most part the advantage of being built farther apart, so as to allow of full access of air both behind and before. The Improved Industrial Dwellings' Company have established two large places, one named Stanley Buildings, in the Old Pancras Eoad, and one named Derby Buildings, in Britannia Street, near Gray's Inn Eoad. The former of these consists of 104 separate dwellings, and accommodates about 500 persons. The number of deaths in 1867, was only three, which gives a death-rate per thousand of six only. In 1866, when the buildings were almost new, the number of deaths was 10. Derby Buildings consist of 168 tenements, of which at present nearly one hundred are completed and occupied; only 30 or 40 have been occupied since the end of 1867. When they are finished they will accommodate 840 persons. Each of the tenements at Stanley Buildings has a separate water-closet, and an abundant supply of water, a coal cellar, scullery, and a copper for washing. Second quarter 1866 1307 deaths 1867 1102 „ Third quarter 1866 1255 ,, 1867 1123 „ Fourth quarter 1866 1294 „ 1867 1141 „ 4 Derby Buildings consist of six blocks of buildings, two only of which were completed last year. One of these blocks comprises separate and distinct tenements for twenty-four families; the other block is upon a new plan, comprising thirty-six tenements of two rooms each. One scullery is here made to serve for three tenants, and two water-closets (one for each sex) also serve for three tenants. The object of this arrangement was to reduce the cost of the structure, so that the rents might be lower. It is found, however, that the application for tenements, separate arid complete in themselves (at higher rents) are vastly in excess of those for the cheaper sort of rooms. " This is quite in accordance with the previous experience of the Directors at other estates; it is invariably found that the applications for tenements are always most numerous for the best kind of accommodation afforded by the Company's buildings. The Directors think it right to refer to this subject as a land of rejoinder to the remark which is sometimes made that the dwellings provided by the Company seem to be of too high a class, and that they do not meet the wants of those persons who are most in need of assistance in this respect. The Directors have always believed that the only effective way of surmounting the innumerable difficulties and dangers which arise from the overcrowding incidental to large cities, is to provide really decent homes, in as large numbers as possible, for those persons who are best able to pay rent which afford a fair return upon the outlay. A competition with the tenements slightly inferior to those newly provided is thus set up, from which all classes of persons below, as well as those actually occupying the new tenements, reap a proportionate advantage. It must be remembered, too, that the buildings now being erected are for the accommodation of the next two or three generations, and due account must be taken of the fact that, as the working classes succeed to their share of the increasing prosperity of the country, the demand for better home accommodation will constantly increase." These remarks of the Directors of the Industrial Dwellings' Company appear to mo to be judicious. There is no doubt that the artizan class, living in large towns, will be obliged, in common with all other classes of the community, to pay higher rents for their. dwellings than they used to pay. As this class becomes educated to appreciate the comforts of a home, habits of sobriety and prudence will be formed, which will enable them to spend on house-rent money which is now wasted on drink, or mis-spent owing to want of economy and good management. Until lately there were few places in London where a man with a family could obtain for less than ten shillings a week a separate tenement with the necessary appliances for washing, storing coal, and other requirements of civilized life. He was obliged to live in one or two rooms of a house, intended but for one family, but actually occupied by several sets of tenants. There is in such houses usually but one water-closet, one scullery, one wash-house, and one tap for the supply of water, in a house occupied by from three to six or eight families. By those living on the upper floors every drop of water for domestic purposes must be carried from the basement, and, when used, must be taken down again. As a natural result of this, water is but sparingly used, dirt necessarily accumulates, and the tenants soon forget what cleanliness is. The passages, closet, cellars, and outhouses also, belonging to a number of distinct tenants, and to no one in particular, are 5 allowed to get very dirty and unwholesome. This Company supplies, at rents varying from four to eight shillings per week, all the conveniences of a separate cottage. It proceeds upon the principle of being self-supporting, and has been able to pay a dividend of five per cent, per annum. There is another Society which has been longer established, called " The Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes." This Society has a building in the Old Pancras Eoad (Pancras Square), which accommodates 110 families, with a population of 635 persons. The number of deaths in 1867 was only four, which gives the very low death-rate of less than seven per thousand; the average deathrate in 12 years has been somewhat below 17 per thousand. This speaks very well for the salubrity of this class of buildings. The classes of people who occupy Stanley Buildings appear to be artizans, policemen, postmen, compositors, cab-drivers, laundresses, and so on. On the accompanying table are brought together details, referring to a number of places in the parish occupied by the poorer classes. The deathrate which prevailed in some of them last year was not so high as usual, whilst in others the rate of mortality was very high as usual, and contrasts strikingly with what prevailed in Stanley Buildings or the Parish at large. For instance, the following exhibited a death-rate over 40 in the thousand: Midford Place, Derrv Street, Poplar Place, and Wilson Place. Midford Place, Derry Street, Poplar Place, and Wilson Place. The following show a death-rate of between 30 and 40 in the thousand:—Mary Place, Fitzroy Place, Wellington Square, and Ferdinand Place; and the following between 25 and 30 in the thousand :—Compton Place, Henry Street:— Karnes of Streets, &c.

Since that Report was presented, the Public Baths and Washhouses have been opened in King Street, and will, undoubtedly, be of great service to the public in that neighbourhood by the facilities which they afford both for bathing and for laundry operations. The Commissioners and the Vestry are to be congratulated on having erected on a limited plot of ground such commodious premises, in every way adapted for the purposes contemplated. Whatever promotes habits of cleanliness has a tendency to improve both the health and the morals of the people. I should now like to see a second establishment erected in another parf of the Parish, where there might be laundries of the ordinary kind, as well as a distinct department for the purification of infected clothing, such as has been provided in Liverpool. This would be a comparatively inexpensive matter, whilst it would be of immense value in checking the spread o infectious diseases, and in affording to the poorer classes a place for washing and other laundry operations. If it were thought desirable, a few private baths might be fitted up in connection with this second public wash-house, the expense of swimming baths being avoided. In Liverpool two disinfecting establishments have been provided, and are found to be of great service. The Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Trench, writes to me, "I am so satisfied with the good effects of the apparatus, that I should like to see them introduced into every jail, workhouse, and corporation throughout the kingdom." The apparatuses are on two distinct principles; the hot-chamber is heated by steam-coils in one case, and by hot air in the other. Dr. Trench recommends the latter as more effectual, because a higher temperature can be obtained, and the risk of burning the clothes may be avoided by ordinary care on the part of the superintendent. At each establishment there is a house for the keeper, a receiving-room for infected clothes, a wash-house, drying closets, and disinfecting chamber, with a depositoiy for the clean clothes. The cost of one establishment was £900, and of the other £1,300 ; this latter might have been diminished by reducing the number of stoves. The establishments are in daily use, and nearly 200 articles are disinfected in each, every week. No charge is made for the use of the disinfecting establishments. "They are used alike by rich and poor; indeed, the greatest number of articles, beds, &c., come from people in a rather well-to-do condition of life." A van has been provided for the removal of infected clothes, and the expense for horsing the van is arranged by contract— so much for each journey. In my last Annual Report I called your attention to the importance of making a provision for the disinfection of clothes and bedding in St. Pancras. I should recommend that a laundry be established in another part of the Parish, and that there should be two distinct departments, one for ordinary soiled linen, and the other for infected clothes. A public laundry in the south of the Parish would be a very great boon to the poor, 7 and the additional expense of adapting it for disinfection would not be large. I believe that a good disinfecting establishment might be made quite self-supporting if it was thought desirable to charge for the u e of it— for there is great need in London for a place to which bedding and furniture, which have been used by patients with Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, and similar diseases, can be sent for thorough purification. It would serve in a great degree to check the spread of these diseases. In my last Annual Report, and in another report during the past year, I called your attention to the 27th and 28tli Sections of the Sanitary Act, 1866, by which you are empowered to provide a mortuary building for the reception of corpses previous to interment, as well as a place for conducting post-mortem examinations oil dead bodies in cases of coroners' inquests. The importance of these clauses and the want of such buildings were, I believe, generally admitted by you when the report was considered. You determined chiefly on the score of economy, and on account of the many heavy expenses recently incurred by the Parish, to take no action in the matter at that time. I trust, however, that the subject will not be lost sight of, and that soon St. Pancras will be furnished with a suitable mortuary, independent of the deadhouse supplied for paupers by the Guardians of the Poor. At the present time the Guardians are contemplating the erection of a mortuary for the Workhouse on the Old St. Pancras Burial Ground. It might be suggested that by joint action, an establishment could be erected for the public as well as for the paupers, more economically than by independent action. The objection to such a plan is that it is undesirable to accustom people who are not obliged to do so to resort to parochial relief in any shape, or to make them too familiar with the Workhouse, lest they regard it as the place in which they may reasonably expect to end their days. It is important that the feelings of those who are opposed to receiving parochial assistance, should be encouraged rather than otherwise. A much better site than the Old St. Pancras Burial Ground is the Burial Ground of St. Martin's, in Pratt Street. The Trustees of that ground are quite prepared to let on building lease a portion of that Cemetery at the North-East corner for the purpose of a public mortuary. An Act of Parliament was passed during the year of 1867, entitled " The Workshops Regulation Act." It is likely that after a short time this Act will entail much additional work on the Officers of the Sanitary Department. By this Act—(1). No child under the age of eight years shall be employed in any handicraft. (2). No child under 13 years of age shall be employed on any one day in any handicraft for a period of more than six and a half hours, and such employment shall take place only between the hours of six in the morning and eight at night. (3). No young person (between 13 and 18 years of age) and no woman shall be employed during any period of twenty-four hours for more than twelve hours, with intervening periods for taking meals and rest amounting in the whole to not less than one hour and a half, and such employment shall take place only between tbe hours of five in the morning and nine at night. (4). No child, young person, or woman shall 8 be employed in any handicraft on Sunday, or after two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, except in cases where not more than five persons are employed in the same establishment, and where such employment consists in making articles to be sold by retail on the premises, or in repairing articles of a like nature to those sold by retail on the premises. (5). No child under the age of eleven years shall be employed in grinding in the metal trades, or in fustian cutting. If any child, young person, or woman is employed in contravention of this Act, the occupier of the workshop shall be liable to a penalty of Three Pounds, and the parent of, or the person deriving any direct benefit from the labour, or having the control over the child, young person, or woman, shall also be liable to a penalty of Twenty Shillings. The local authority for enforcing the provisions of this Act in St. Pancras is the Yestry of that Parish. If, on the complaint of your Officer of Health, or Inspector of Nuisances, it appears to any Justice that there is reasonable cause for believing that any of the provisions of this Act, or of the Sanitary Act, 1866, are contravened in any workshop, it shall be lawful for such Justice to empower the complainant to enter into such workshop at any time within forty-eight hours, and to examine such workshop; and any person so empowered may examine any person whom he finds in such workshop on matters within the provisions of this Act, or of the Sanitary Act, 1866. There is no doubt that there are many workshops in this Parish in which the provisions of these Acts are contravened, and when the public generally are aware of the existence of these laws, your officers will probably often receive information which will render it necessary for them to take proceedings under the Workshop Regulation Act. The provisions of the Sanitary Act, which are specially referred to, are those referring to the cleanliness of workshops, to their ventilation, and to overcrowding. There are also a number of regulations in this Act, enforcing the at' tendance at school of all children under thirteen years of age ; these regulations are to be enforced by the Inspector of Factories. The workshops to which this Act is applicable are those not specified in the Factory Acts' Extension Act, and in which from five to fifty persons are employed. The businesses which will especially require inspection are milliners, tailors, shoe-makers, dress-makers, and wax-flower makers, and many others. It will be advisable to issue hand-bills announcing to the public the several provisions of the Act, and cautioning them against incurring its penalties. 9 SMALL POX AND VACCINATION. The mortality from Small Pox was higher during 1867 than it has been in any year since 1863 ; and with the exception of that year the number of deaths was higher than it has been for more than 12 years past. In 1867 the number of Small Pox deaths was sixty-five, in 1866 the number was forty-three, in 1865 twenty-seven, in 1864 fourteen, in 1863 eighty, in 1862 nineteen, in 1861 only seven, in 1860 thirty-one, in 1859 thirty-seven, in 1858 twenty-two, 1857 eleven, in 1856 eighteen, and in 1855 the number was forty-two. This is not a satisfactory state of things, and I am quite convinced that if Vaccination of the best sort were carried out throughout the whole parish in as complete a manner as is provided for by Acts of Parliament, such a death-rate from Small Pox would be impossible. It is to be hoped that the New Vaccination Act, and the regulations issued by the Privy Council will tend to render Vaccination more thorough and more general than it has been. The duty of enforcing the Vaccination Acts is imposed by the Legislature on the Guardians, and not on the Vestry, who are under nearly every other Act of Parliament the Guardians of public health, and the local authority for enforcing sanitary law. The return of Vaccination, supplied to me by Mr. Moore, Clerk to the Guardians, for the year ending Michaelmas, 1867 (see page 11), shews that for 7,552 registered births, only 2,561 children were successfully vaccinated by the Public Vaccinators under the age of one year. It must be remembered that there are also two Government Vaccine Stations in St. Pancras, which are not given on this list, at which are vaccinated nearly 2,000 children, a large proportion of whom belong to this Parish. Still after allowing for these Stations, and also allowing for children vaccinated by private medical practitioners, and also for children who die under the age of three months, or whose health renders them unfit for the operation, there can be no doubt that the vaccination of a large number of children is delayed much too long, or altogether neglected. The number who refuse to have their children vaccinated, from a belief that the operation is an objectionable one, is so small that it does not appreciably affect the proportions of unvaccinated to the number who are born. The Guardians of St. Pancras have already decided to reduce the number of public Vaccinators from 17 to 6, in accordance with the Regulations of the Privy Council. It might appear at first sight that such a measure, by reducing the number of places at which the public can get their children vaccinated, would diminish the facilities for vaccination ; but in practice exactly the opposite is the case. " Facilities for vaccination " require, above all things, that parents should not have to make fruitless visits in search of vaccination; and that they should not be supplied with an indifferent kind of vaccination, that is both unprotective to their children and distasteful to themselves. The best kind of vaccination is from arm to arm, and such a number of cases should come together at each time of 10 vaccinating as will ensure plenty of healthy subjects from whom to select the best possible lymph. This kind of vaccination is also by far the most popular with parents, and in practice it is found that they will take no little trouble to obtain its advantages for their infants. A first-class station, then, which must be frequented by at least 500 persons a year, cannot be maintained unless there is a population of from 25 to 30 thousand to supply the requisite number of children. It is very important that as the number of stations is reduced, their positions should be fixed as nearly in the centre of the district as possible, so that no one in the Parish will live at a great distance from a Vaccine Station. There is an attempt in the New Act to render the registration of vaccination much more complete than it has hitherto been. The duty of seeing that the vaccination is registered is imposed on the public vaccinators in all the cases which they vaccinate; but when the child is vaccinated by private medical men, the duty of registration is thrown on the parent. The Registrars are required to present to the Board of Guardians, half-yearly, a hst of all parents respecting the vaccination of whose children the proper certificate has not been received; and the Guardians are then required to inquire into the circumstances of the cases, and in cases of default, to take proceedings against the offending parties. If the Guardians carry out the provisions of the Vaccination Acts as efficiently as they have been carrying out the provisions of the Metropolitan Poor Law Act, there is no doubt that such a mortality from Small Pox as was recorded in the death-registers of 1867 and 1863 will not continue to be met with.

In the Appendix is given a Table, kindly supplied me by Mr. Worrell, Chief Clerk in the Department of Works, of the principal works of sewerage executed in the Parish during the year 1867. From this it appears that of large brick sewers 2649 feet have been constructed; of pipe drainage 709 feet have been laid down; and of brick barrel drains 1,921 feet have been made. A large number of sewers were repaired during the year, and nearly 2000 feet of drainage were constructed by private builders. During the summer months the sewers were deodorized with carbolic acid. Annexed is a return of the chief sanitary improvements carried out, under the inspection of the officers of the sanitary department:—The amount of work recorded during the past year is not go much greater than that reported in 1866 as might be expected from the addition to the staff. It is, however, certain that the work is now thoroughly done ; that notices served are followed up until the required improvements are carried out. Formerly, in consequence of imperfect book-keeping, many things commenced were lost sight of, and many nuisances detected were not got rid of when the first notice was neglected. More time is often expended in getting one nuisance abated, if the parties at fault are refractory, than in finding out and getting twenty nuisances abated if the defaulters are ready to comply with the first notices. The number of sanitary improvements effected is not therefore always a criterion of the amount of time and labour necessarily expended upon them by the Inspectors. But the quality and thoroughness of work are of the utmost importance, and are more valuable than mere quantity of work with imperfect results.

Clerk to the Sanitary Committee. 14 METEOROLOGY OF GREENWICH IN 1867. The mean temperature of the year was 48.°6, which is 0.2 of a degree higher than the mean of 98 preceding years, but 0.07 lower than themean of 27 years. The mean daily range of temperature was 15.06, or 0.04 less than the averange of 27 years. The rain-fall measured 28.4 inches, which is 0.8 of an inch more than the average of 52 years. The first quarter was 0.07 colder, the second quarter was 0.06 warmer the third quarter was 0.03 cooler, the fourth quarter of the year was 2.05 colder than the corresponding quarters of 26 previous years. The mean daily amount of horizontal movement of the air was 283 miles, which is more than any year since 1848. To sum up, there was nothing very notable in the general meteorogical conditions. The chief differences from the means of other years were a lower temperature of the last three months of the year, and a greater amount of wind throughout the year. The general temperature, the rain-fall, and the degree of moisture which prevailed was very nearly what has been noted in previous years. REPORT ON THE GAS SUPPLY DURING THE YEAR 1867. The average illuminating power during the whole year, at the time of my testings, on 144 different days, was equal to 14.2 standard candles. (On each occasion ten observations were made and the average taken). The mean of the monthly maximum results was 15.2, and the mean of the monthly minimum results was 13.4 candles. The highest illuminating power observed was 15.6, and the lowest was 12.1 candles. Traces of ammonia were detected by turmeric test-papers almost constantly ; the gas was on all occasions free from indications of sulphuretted hydrogen. The amount of sulphur in the gas varied on different occasions, from 7 grains to 16.3 grains in 100 cubic feet. On no occasion during the year was the amount found to exceed the limit defined by the Act. The mean of all the testings was about 10 grains to the 100 feet of gas. APPENDIX.
