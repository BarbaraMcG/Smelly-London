Telephone No. EDMonton 3000 Ext. 16 COUNCILLORS Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, The health of Edmonton shows a further slight improvement in 1961. The social statistics show a decrease in population, but an increase in the number of inhabited houses and separate dwellings. There is an increase in the rateable value and an increase in the product of the Id Rate. The vital statistics show the number of live births to have been a little less than in 1960 and this, together with the decrease in population suggests an increased birth rate. There was a marked rise in the still birth rate and there was also one maternal death. Child birth was more dangerous in Edmonton in 1961 for both mother and baby, than it had been in 1960. The death rate again rose and the corrected death rate was in 1961 higher than that for England and Wales. The crude death rate remained below the England and Wales figure and one's judgment of the corrected death rate entirely depends on the faith one can put in the Registrar General's correction factor. I must admit that there was a substantial increase in the number of deaths and that undoubtedly a number of these deaths could have been prevented. The main increase in deaths has been in heart disease and diseases of the chest. The deaths have been mainly between the ages of 45 and 65 years. An Influenza epidemic at the beginning of the year undoubtedly played some part in both these increases. There was a marked decrease in deaths from Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus. This suggests that the Lung Cancer epidemic in Edmonton possibly reached high tide in 1960. Housing repairs and slum clearance proceeded fairly briskly and 182 houses with 591 people in them were represented during 1961. A further Smoke Control Area (No.3.) was brought into operation and the 1962 Area (No.4.) submitted to and confirmed by the Minister. The Autumn of 1961 was memorable both for the National Fire Prevention Week and for the visit of the Regional Hospital Board's Mass X-Ray Unit to the Borough. The Spring was marked by a measles epidemic and there were scattered food poisoning incidents in both Spring and Autumn. There was also a short sharp outbreak of food poisoning in a factory canteen in August. - 5 - PART I.

The reduction however, is in deaths after the age of three months. There is no improvement in the rates below this age and it is possible that the' services to the expectant mother are not as good as they should be.

In 1961 only one accidental death from coal gas poisoning was recorded. Angina in each sex accounted for more than ten deaths than in 1960. Those who were physically energetic, whether by the nature of their job or by personal inclincation, seem less liable to Angina. The plumper souls among us seem more liable, but whether this is because they eat too much or move too little is difficult to say. Bronchitis and Pneumonia There were no more deaths from Pneumonia than in 1960. There was a sharp rise in deaths from Bronchitis and also (excluding Cancer of the Lung) in deaths from other diseases of the respiratory system. Influenza infection plays a part in deaths both from Influenza and from Bronchitis. It is probable that the Influenza epidemic was responsible for the main increase in respiratory deaths. It may also have played a part in the increase of deaths from heart disease. Cancer of the Lung It was most unusual to record a decrease in Cancer of the Lung deaths. It is possible that 1960 was the high water mark of the incidence of this disease as the 1962 figures, now available, are much higher than those of 1961, but are about the same as those for 1960, In Edmonton so far, deaths from Lung Cancer in women remain common and the main bulk of deaths occurs among men. A few men die from this disease between the ages of 35 and 45 years, but the main instance is between 55 and 75 years. A cigarette smoker can reasonably look forward to getting his family off his hands before Lung Cancer claims him. Hypertensive Heart Disease The incidence was about the same. Influenza There were not many deaths, but an increase from one death to six is a notable increase. Leukaemia The number of deaths again rose. There were ten deaths, three under the age of 45 years and seven over. Cancer of the Stomach There was a noticeable increase in deaths from this cause, which is disappointing after a reduction in 1960. In the country as a whole, 1961 was not regarded as a year of prosperity, and it is therefore not impossible that this - 8 - disease fluctuates with nutritional standards. If that was so, it would suggest that nutrition was the trigger mechanism rather than the underlying cause. The reverse is usually thought to be the case. Ulcer of the Stomach and Duodenum (Peptic Ulcer) Here again there was an increase and nutrition might well have a trigger effect on Peptic Ulcers. Gastritis, Enteritis and Diarrhoea The figures remain about the same and these are preventable deaths. This is another point in which the Public Health Service could be improved. Nephritis and Nephrosis There were three deaths, one in relatively early life between 25 and 35, the other two over the age of 55. This is a feature of nephritis. The sufferer is either carried off relatively early or lives until the 50's. Heart Disease There is an increase in deaths from heart disease. The increase was about 10% and was fairly evenly spread through the age groups 45 and upwards. Compared with 1960 there were four more deaths in the 45 to 55 group from heart disease and this is the only factor that seems at all significant. It is possible that in this group the same factors are operating as in Angina. Tuberculosis There were again four deaths all over the age of 35. Two men and two women died of the disease, one woman being over 35 the other over 75, both men being over 45. Suicide If suicide is a sign of mental ill health, Edmonton was relatively healthy in 1960, and relatively unhealthy in 1961. In 1960 there were four suicides and in 1961 thirteen. In 1961 men predominated, nine out of thirteen. Hyperplasia of Prostate This is of course, a male disease. The four deaths were all in men. It is possible that this disease is preventable, but we have not at the present moment sufficient knowledge to prevent it. Cancer of the Breast The rise in deaths from this cause is disturbing. Breast feeding is said to protect against Cancer of the Breast, and these figures may be a reflection of the decline in breast feeding that has been going on over the past 40 years. - 9 - Cancer of the Uterus Deaths from this cause have also gone up from five to ten. Here it is possible that the number of deaths can be reduced by early diagnosis, This means of course, that women must consult doctors about symptoms which they may personally regard as trivial. I do not think that this is a matter that can be dealt with on mass lines like diseases of the chest. Clinics are needed rather than mobile units. Vascular Lesions of the Nervous System Most of these deaths are from cerebral haemorrhage. The haemorrhage is usually due either to increased arterial blood pressure or a weakness of the cerebral arteries or both. Deaths from this cause are rare before 45. The largest group of deaths was between the ages of 75 and 85, Four people died between 45 and 55, and 19 between 55 and 65. Motor Accidents No children died in motor accidents in Edmonton, which indicates the Road Safety message is well understood by the under 15's. Even in the 15 to 25 group, generally regarded as rather reckless, there were only two deaths, and the main instance was in those aged 45 and over. The North Circular Road runs east-west through Edmonton and the Cambridge and Hertford Roads run through it north-south. In these circumstances there were fourteen deaths, which means that safety education has not been wholly successful. The record is fairly goodj.

This is about the same as in 1959, rather more than in 1960. I do not think that this means housing conditions are deteriorating fast, but rather that tenants, possibly as a result of higher rents, are becoming less tolerant of defects in their houses. Fewer certificates of disrepair had to be issued than in 1960. 229 houses in sixteen areas were represented in 1961 for clearance. In the case of 47 houses in the Town Road, Hertford Road and New Road areas represented in July 1961, the Council did not feel that they had the resources at that time to proceed with a compulsory purchase order, and no action was taken. Compulsory purchase orders have been made in respect of the other areas. In June 1961 6 to 20, Church Lane; 1 to 7, Eldon Road; 13 to 23, Eldon Road; 27 to 33, Eldon Road and 109, 111 and 115 to 125, Bounces Road were represented- At the same time 95 and 97, Dysons Road and 117 to 130, Angel Road and 77 to 89, Dysons Road were represented. 53 houses with 160 people in them were therefore put forward for clearance in this month. In July, 1961, 63 more houses in which lived 85 people were put forward and 16 of these inhabited by 38 people subsequently became subject to compulsory purchase order. These were 1 to 8A, Second Avenue. In December 1961 a further 130 houses in which 393 people lived were represented for clearance. These houses were 11 to 27, Cavendish Road, 201 to 209A, Brettenham Road, 213 to 273, Brettenham Road, 154 to 180, Brettenham Road, 184 to 206, Brettenham Road, 309 to 345, Brettenham Road and 120 to 256, Brettenham Road.

No charge is made for the use of any part of any Public Convenience on either Male or Female side. Free hand washing facilities are provided and paper towels are supplied. An additional wash and brush up service is available on the payment of a small charge. There are two Attendants in each convenience, one on the Male and one on the Female side and premises are kept extremely clean and neat. There is no doubt that the public conveniences in Edmonton are among the best in the Greater London area. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948 The following work has been carried out under the above Acts:1.

(Discontinued 30.6.61.) 0 August - No readings taken of St, David's deposit gauge o October - Town Hall deposit gauge found broken - no readings * 30.6.61 - Discontinued Deposit gauges do not accurately measure pollution of the air itself. It is the dust and grit falling through the air that they record, and it tends therefore to be pollution from factories and possibly railway locomotives that is mainly shown in deposit gauge results. The recorded deposit for gauges (a) and (b) show an appreciable reduction in pollution compared with the figures for 1960. A more accurate measure of air pollution is given by a volumetric filter which measures smoke and sulphur dioxide in the air. Continuous flow of air is pumped through the instrument and daily the sulphur dioxide is chemically measured and the stain produced by smoke measured by means of a filter paper. A second smoke filter was installed at Cuckoo Hall School (now Mandeville School) on 1st July, 1961. Details of the readings of the recorder installed at the Latymer School in May 1959 and Mandeville School, are set out overleafo 25 It is intended to install three further smoke filters so as to give adequate information on atmospheric pollution in the Borough; when the new apparatus is installed, the use of the existing deposit gauges will be discontinued. 1961 Concentration of Smoke Milligrams per 100 cubic metres of air Average daily value Parts of Sulphur Dioxide per 100 million parts of air.

November and December were cold and foggy and the home fires were therefore burning brightly with the smoke from time to time tending to be trapped in fog. The Latymer School has its own playing field around it, a public recreation ground to the west of it and lies within Smoke Control Area No. 3. which came into force on the 1st October, 1961. The Mandeville School is within a built-up area which is not yet a Smoke Control Area. Smoke Control Area No. 1. is north of the Latymer School and Smoke Control Area No. 2. immediately west of it and it can therefore be said to have buffer zones to the west and north. There are no Smoke Control Areas immediately near Mandeville School. 26 The Council has decided to make the Borough wholly Smoke Controlled and it is planned to deal with an area each year.

AREA - A detailed survey of this area was carried out during the year - The Order was confirmed by the Minister and will come into force on 1st October, 1962. The area in question is bounded on the south by Church Street, Latymer Road and Harrow Drive, on the west by the Great Cambridge Road, on the north by the Enfield Branch Line of British Railways and on the east by Hertford Road and The Green. The Table set out above shows details of confirmed Smoke Control Orders. During the year 312 observations of industrial chimneys in the Borough were made by the Public Health Inspectors. 27 RODENT CONTROL Your Senior Public Health Inspector, as Officer-in-Charge, Rodent Control, reported as follows An Assistant Rodent Officer and two Operatives carry out rat and mice destruction under the general supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Domestic premises are treated without charge and business premises on repayment. Wherever possible the poison used in treating infestations is "Warfarin" which is very successful and comparatively harmless to human beings and domestic animals. In cases where rat infestations are suspected to be due to faulty drainage, the Public Health Inspector makes a full investigation and where repairs are found to be necessary, the matter is taken up with the owner. Prevalence of Rats and Mice: Local Authority Dwelling Houses All other including Business and Industrial Total Properties inspected as a result of notification 22 755 55 832 Other properties investigated 2 1,680 41 2,439 Properties found to be infested Rats (a) Major infestations – – – – (b) Minor infestations 26 545 24 595 Mice (a) Major infestations – – – – (b) Minor infestations 6 61 8 75 Number of properties treated by Rodent Operators 26 606 38 670 Number of inspections 168 4,709 1,117 5,994 RAT DESTRUCTION IN SEWERS The Council's Rodent Operatives took over the treatment of sewers from the private contractors who previously carried out the work.

A Formalin Chamber is used for the disinfection of books, leather goods, etc., articles that would be damaged by steam. The number of books and other articles thus disinfected was 281. Eight Council properties and 81 other houses were found to be infested; the total number of rooms disinfested was 201 The whole of the work is carried out by the Department, the materials used being insecticides containing D.D.T. as a base. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 No new licences were granted during the year.

The following is a list of particulars of quantities etc., affected by these licences Petroleum Spirit 514, 889 gallons Petroleum Mixtures 8,928 gallons Rubber Solution 100 lbs. and 800 gallons PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Twenty-three inspections of cinemas and other places of entertainment were made in accordance with the Circular of the Ministry of Health of 1920. Conditions were found to be generally satisfactory. EPIDEMIOLOGY Dysentery In view of the fact that there was an outbreak of Dysentery of some proportion in 1960, it is perhaps not surprising that there were relatively few cases in 1961. Thirty-one cases were too many, but they did not constitute a serious problem. Measles 1961 was a measles year, and as usual, the disease affected mainly those under the age of 15. Surprisingly enough 28 of the cases were of the age of 10, 6 were of the age of 15, and 2 over the age of 20. Measles is not now entirely confined to childhood. Pneumonia The 54 cases of pneumonia notified were another sign of the influenza epidemic. Twelve of the 54 were removed to hospital. Pneumonia as a cause of death is a much wider term than pneumonia as an infectious disease; the deaths and notifications cannot therefore be compared. In fact the deaths from all forms of pneumonia amounted to 55. Poliomyelitis and Diphtheria There were no notifications of either disease. It would appear that the population of Edmonton is well protected by immunization against both. Food Poisoning It was not possible to trace the probable source of infection in the Salmonella outbreaks. The course of events in the outbreak due to Clostridium 33 Welchii was fairly clear. This outbreak of food poisoning followed a meal in a factory canteen. Eighteen people fell ill during the following evening and night. It was not possible to obtain any of the food eaten at the meal (on August 2nd), but the Manageress was found to be infected and she stated that she had herself had symptoms at about 6 p.m. on August 3rd. The most probable means of infection was via the roast lamb which has been cut up and boiled in a stock previously prepared. The boiling took place on 1st August. The lamb had remained in a large pan in the pantry covered with a cloth until the morning of 2nd August, when it was reheated for service at lunch beginning 12 noon. Between 12 and 2.30 p.m. the stew was being kept hot on a hot plate, and those who suffered illness had obtained their meal at 12.30 p.m. or later. The Manageress herself ate at 2.30 p.m. and her symptoms started earlier than anyone else's, between 6 and 7 p.m. Similar outbreaks occurred in the same canteen in June 1959, and on that occasion also the Manageress had been found to be infected. The organism was Clostridium Welchii in each case, but type 5 in the first outbreak and type 4 in the second.

This is rather a high rate of puerperal abnormality, but it is no higher than in 1960 There were 143 cases in 1960 Scarlet Fever Fifty cases of Scarlet Fever is not a great deal, since there is no effective immunising agent against this disease and some isolation of cases and contacts has therefore to be practised at present. Only 13 children needed to be moved to hospital. Scarlet Fever in Edmonton remains relatively mild. Whooping Cough This is a much more infectious disease than Scarlet Fever, yet only 24 cases were notified. These figures bear witness to the effectiveness of Whooping Cough antigen as an immunising agent. Tuberculosis The total number of cases on the register again dropped slightly to 1,326. There has been a slow but steady drop in the number of cases on the register since 1958. The number of new cases was about the same as in 1960 in the case of Respiratory Tuberculosis, but there was an increase in the amount of NonRespiratory Tuberculosis in males. Pulmonary Tuberculosis used to be considered a disease of youth, but it now appears to be becoming a disease of maturity and middle age. A smoker's cough is not always an indication of Bronchitis. It may be a sign of Tuberculosis of the lung. The North-East Metropolitan Regional Board's Mass Radiography Unit 6A, which is a mobile unit, visits Edmonton about every three years. This year the Unit tried to be as mobile as possible. The Angel Road Ward was extensively canvassed with the aid of the British Red Cross, and the Unit then toured the Ward almost from street to st.eet. 2,159 people were x-rayed in the Angel Road Ward and 47 of these were found to be requiring further investigation. The other wards were covered less intensively, but the Unit was in Edmonton from September 1961 to January 1962, and during this time every citizen had at least one chance of attending the Unit while most had two or three. The number x-rayed at normal 'walk-in' sessions, including those in the Angel Road Ward was 4,613, while 8,261 were x-rayed at special sessions for shops and factories and hospital staff. 149 hospital patients were also x-rayed. The total number x-rayed was 13,023. The Unit was not open to those under 15 years of age on this occasion, so that if those attending for x-ray had all been Edmonton residents, about one person in six would have been x-rayed. Even allowing for the fact that a number are not residents, this figure represents a fair sample of the population and the fact that only 12 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis requiring immediate treatment were found suggests that the incidence is now relatively low in Edmonton. 35 On the other hand the bringing under supervision of 54 sufferers of Pulmonary Tuberculosis not previously known may reduce the pool of tuberculosis infection, and reduce the incidence further in later years. The incidence of cancer in the lung and bronchus in the sample was small. With 55 deaths in the whole population however, one would have expected a number of cases of lung cancer to be detected among 13,000 odd persons to be in single figures.

There were at that time 279 staff and 1,026 manual workers. A note was made of absences notified as due to respiratory disease during the period 25th November, 1961 to 30th April, 1962. Fourteen of the 140 unvaccinated staff suffered from a respiratory illness. The total absence from work, of course, in this group was 308 days. Seventeen of the 139 vaccinated staff suffered from respiratory illness, the absence in this group was 269 days. The groups being comparable in size, the saving can be directly estimated at 39 days. It is possible that the vaccinated staff protected the unvaccinated staff to some extent since the expected absence from respiratory disease in 297 staff during a winter period would normally be about 840 days. The absence was in fact 577 days in spite of a moderate Influenza epidemic in the early months of 1962. Owing to differences in the working week in different groups, it is not possible to make a fair comparison between the days absent in the two groups of manual workers. There is however, a marked contrast in the numbers absent with respiratory disease in the two groups; 644 workers were not vaccinated, and 96 of these suffered respiratory illness leading to absence. 422 were vaccinated and 38 of these suffered from respiratory illness leading to absence. The incidence of respiratory illness in the vaccinated may therefore be roughly estimated at 9 per cent, and in the unvaccinated at 14.9 per cent. Vaccination would appear to have reduced the numbers absent in the vaccinated group by about one third. The cost of the immunisation operation including equipment and staff time, did not exceed £225. From the figures I have given it would appear to have saved the Council work to the value of at least £350, even in the short term. In the long term the reduction of respiratory illness in the Council's staff and employees is probably much greater than shown here. Smallpox There were no cases of smallpox in the Borough in 1961, but action had to be taken as the result of a case in another Borough. A Pakistani living in St. Pancras developed what later turned out to be smallpox. When he felt too ill to remain in his home he and his family went to University College Hospital by ordinary taxi. The driver of the taxi was later vaccinated by St. Pancras Public Health Department; when they discovered he lived in Edmonton they notified me. I vaccinated his family and his neighbours on 29th December, and vaccination was successful. The taxi operates from Islington and is supervised there, and the driver in question stayed away from work and received compensation from the Council. Close contacts traced and vaccinated in Edmonton amounted to five, supervision was subsequently carried out for fourteen days without there being any incident. -42- Notification of the main Infectious Diseases are presented in tabular form below: TABLE A Disease Total No. of Cases Number Removed to Hospital Deaths - to 1 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 10 10 to 15 15 to 20 20 to 35 35 to 45 45 to 65 65 and over Scarlet Fever 50 13 - - 1 2 3 10 27 6 - 1 - - - Measles 1,773 18 - 58 167 235 220 272 785 28 6 2 - - - Whooping Cough 24 - - - 3 3 5 1 11 1 - - - - - Pneumonia 54 12 55 1 - 1 2 - 2 - 1 3 2 24 18 Puerperal Pyrexia 142 - - - - - - - - - 11 107 24 - - Erysipelas 8 2 - - - - - - - - - - 2 5 1 Food Poisoning 24 2 - 1 1 3 2 1 7 3 - 2 3 1 - Poliomyelitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 1 - 2 - - - - - - - - - - - Dysentery Meningococcal 31 1 - - 1 3 6 2 6 2 1 7 1 2 - Infection 2 2 - - 1 - - - - - - - - 1 - Acute Encephalitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Paratyphoid 'B' 1 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - The following table indicates the wards from which the various cases were notified: TABLE B Disease Bury Street Ward Church Street Ward Angel Road Wa rd Silver Street Ward North Middx.

COUNCIL'S EMPLOYEES During 1961 a total of 331 visits were paid to those employees who had been on the sick list for longer than a fortnight and when necessary, at fortnightly intervals. Of these, 66 were 'not at home' and 67 had already resumed duty. Also during the year, the following medical examinations or assessments were made prior to appointment to permanent posts:- Medical examinations 52 Assessments without medical examinations 78 Medical assessments (not appointed) 91 HEALTH EDUCATION The emphasis was again on Home Safety and the dangers of cigarette smoking. Home Safety was dealt with during the first quarter of the year and the last quarter and emphasised the dangers of a cigarette in March, April, May, September and part of October. During the latter period, bookmarkers and pamphlets were distributed to the Libraries. A National Home Safety Campaign began on the 30th October, 1961, with a National Fire Prevention Week which lasted from the 30th October to the 4th November. During November and December 2,000 copies of the Fire Prevention Code were distributed to the Libraries, and 2,000 copies were distributed to the Edmonton Trades Council. During the latter part of October and November there was a Poster Competition in the Schools on the subject of Fire Prevention; 212 entries were received from seven Junior Schools and one Senior School. The best Senior School poster, the best Junior School poster and the best Infants School poster received prizes from the Council and also went on to compete in the County Competition. The pupil sending the best poster from each of the other schools received a prize and smaller prizes were given to highly commended entries. The posters were judged by Mr. Leonard Butcher, Art Master at Enfield Grammar School. Obviously there can only be one best poster in each School, and in each class, but every entry got a small prize whether or not he or she won a school or group prize. This small prize was a red and white ball-pen bearing the slogan "Fire: Prevent It". The prizewinners were subsequently presented with their prizes by the Mayor in the Council Chamber on 13th February, 1962. -46- CARE OF THE ELDERLY (a) The most important part of the care of the elderly is carried out by the County Council both as Local Health Authority and as Welfare Authority. In its first capacity, the County Council gives a great deal of nursing assistance to elderly people who have to be nursed in their own homes, provides Home Helps both for those who are ill and for those who are unable to carry out a full programme of housework. Periods at convalescent homes are also provided free upon the advice of family doctors for old people recovering from bouts of illness. As Welfare Authority the County Council pays for alterations and adaptations of the homes of old people when, as often happens, they are physically handicapped. It also gives a substantial grant to the Edmonton Welfare Association and provides residential accommodation of varying quality for old people who are no longer able to live at home. (b) Laundry Service This is carried out by the Borough Council as a disinfection Service. It is a Laundry Service for incontinent persons, and the majority of these patients are elderly. Collection and delivery are weekly or twice-weekly as required by the patient, and during 1961 6,284 articles were laundered. Twenty-four people were catered for at one time or another during 1961. (c) Edmonton Welfare Association As indicated this is the Association in which the Borough Council and the County Council and voluntary bodies combine to assist the welfare for the old people of Edmonton. The Welfare Organiser, Mr. Sherwood, and the Honorary Officers are provided by the Council, part of the finance is provided by the County Council for representatives of the Health Welfare Departments of the County Council and of voluntary organisations who are members of the Executive of the Association. Those who co-operated in one way or another with the Edmonton Welfare Association during 1961 included the British Red Cross Society, Women's Voluntary Service, Toe H, Edmonton Citizens' Advice Bureau, St. John Ambulance Brigade, and most of the Edmonton Churches. Useful help was also given from time to time by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and the National Assistance Board, and the Almoners of the North Middlesex Hospital. Mr. Sherwood reports on the services of the Association between 1961 and 1962 as follows:- (i) Meals-on-Wheels Service During the year 1961 the Meals Service delivered not less than 13,052 meals. Whilst the maximum capacity is 1,000 meals per month, we have never refused any emergency calls, and a recent survey undertaken by Miss S J, Briggs, Superintendent Health Visitor and her staff, has confirmed that every case is in genuine need of our service. The Association offer a very sincere tribute to all the ladies of Women's Voluntary Service for their constant and cheerful duty, which is of inestimable -47- value to the people they serve, and to Mrs. E. Everitt, Meals Organiser of the Women's Voluntary Service, we offer a special tribute for her untiring efforts in this admirable work. We also offer our thanks to Mrs. Smith, an old friend and her staff, and also the Council's transport staff for their willing help and co-operation. (ii) Entertainment and Recreation The Edmonton Borough Council, through the Municipal Entertainments Department, have continued to maintain a very comprehensive and most enjoyable programme of concerts to the Old People's Clubs. In addition, there have been the Special Old Tyme Dances, a great favourite, Special Concerts at the Summer Theatre in Pymmes Park, and the 'high-light' of the year - the "All-Star Variety Concert" at the Regal. Free admission to Quiz Shows etc., and reduced prices at Special Celebrity Concerts etc. The Edmonton Borough Council and the staff of the Entertainments Department, in particular, can be assured that the Old People very greatly appreciate these facilities, and we offer the Council our sincere thanks. (iii) Visiting Service A great deal of valuable work is being done by the Old People's Clubs in Edmonton by not only visiting their sick members, but also sick visiting in their locality of sick old people referred to the Welfare Organiser by the National Assistance Board, Citizens' Advice Bureau and other agencies This is one of the means by which lonely old people ultimately take up membership in the Clubs. It is hoped that the Churches will increase its interest in this work and if we can help them, we are always willing to do so. The Association is anxious that its services should be widely known so that house-bound old people in particular, should avail themselves of the services in operation for their benefit. It is hoped that all affiliated organisations will constantly give the utmost publicity to the work that is being done by the Association. (iv) Holidays Information has been circulated to all the Old People's Clubs and affiliated organisations of the 'off-season' holidays at reduced prices for old people. There have been a greater number of personal inquiries from old people anxious to take advantage of these facilities, and several Old People's Clubs have arranged for parties of their members to go away to the seaside, and they return greatly benefited from the holiday with their friends. (v) Information and Assistance During the year under review, the number of people seeking information and assistance has grown. The inquiries have covered a wide variety of problems, but for the old people generally, housing continues to be a major problem. The National Assistance Board, Citizens' Advice Bureau, Hospitals -48- Doctors and Police refer many cases to us, and it is essential that every case be treated with courtesy, sympathy and understanding. Information of a general character is sent by the "News-Letter" quickly and briefly through its distribution to the Old People's Clubs and affiliated organisations. (vi) Library Delivery Service To-day there are 50 physically handicapped and house-bound old people enjoying this excellent service, and the Borough Librarian and his staff are to be congratulated on the efficiency of this bi-weekly delivery of books to those unable to visit the Public Libraries. We know how greatly this willing and courteous service is appreciated, and the Borough Librarian is willing to extend it to all house-bound people of any age. (vii) Welfare Food Service Once again this excellent service has broken all previous records by the sale of Bovril-2,056: Ovaltine-2,651 tins, and Marmite-690 jars, of a total sale value of over £750. The Association is deeply appreciative of the excellent work of Mrs. D.M. Dixon, Divisional Director, British Red Cross Society, Edmonton, and her staff, for operating this service on behalf of the Association. There is no doubt that the Welfare Food Service make a definite contribution to the health and well-being of the old people, and the extension of this service by delivery of supplies to the Old People's Clubs on the day they meet, especially in the winter months, is greatly appreciated, and Mrs„ Dixon and her staff can be assured that the extra work involved is very worth-while. (viii) Hairdressing Service The concessions offered by the Members of the Edmonton Branch of the London and Provincial Hairdressers' Association are greatly appreciated by the old people who took full advantage of the reduced prices. (ix) Handicrafts Exhibition In co-operation with the Middlesex Old People's Welfare Committee, the Association played a full part in the organisation and staging of the 3rd Old People's Handicraft Exhibition held at Wembley Town Hall in October 1961. The Old People's Clubs and Homes submitted 50 articles for the Exhibition and won seven prizes. (x) All-Day Clubs The William Preye Club: The constant success of the William Preye Club as a centre for elderly people is a proud tribute to the work of the Officers and Voluntary Wardens, all members of the Club, which is acknowledged to be one of the best of its kind in the country. During the year under review, the Club voted for an Annual Outing, and -49- they also enjoyed a happy 'end of the year' tea party. The Sale of Work and Open Day was a great success and this, with the magnificent work of the Sewing Corner and the weekly Whist Drive, helped to increase the funds of the Club. The Club made a donation of £100 towards the cost of the Club, and the Annual Meeting have decided to invest £500 in Edmonton Corporation Stock. There is no doubt that the Club has had a very happy and successful year, especially in the Games Section. The Association would like to record its thanks and sincere appreciation of the valuable work of the Management Committee, Officers and Voluntary Wardens. Pymmes Park Club for Old People: During the year this Club has continued to provide an important social centre in the southern part of the Borough, and whilst its membership is predominantly male, it nevertheless enjoys the company of a few ladies, who assist in tea-making. The Club organised an excellent outing for its members, and with the help of Miss D.M. Oswald and a band of lady helpers, a magnificent Christmas meal was enjoyed by all the members, followed by a first class concert. The Club has been one of the strong supporters of the Inter-Club matches with William Preye Club and Lord Morrison Hall Club, and they have provided great pleasure to the members of the three Clubs, and it is generally acknowledged that "Pymmes Park" have had a very happy and successful year. There is great satisfaction at the Club that the Edmonton Borough Council have offered them new premises in the Park, and it is expected that the Club will move in September. It is anticipated that this new Centre in the Park will ultimately have a Work/Handicraft Section and a Medical Retirement Clinic and once again Edmonton will have another Club and Centre worthy of its elder citizens. During the year, Her Worship the Mayor (Councillor Mrs. R. Smythe, J.P.), launched an Appeal for Gifts and Donations towards furnishing the new Club and this is being strongly supported by His Worship the Mayor (Councillor J.E. Cooke, J.P.), the present Chairman of the Association and Chairman of the Special Sub-Committee which is piloting the scheme. It is with great pleasure that the Association record its thanks and appreciation to the Management Committee, Officers and Voluntary Wardens of the Club for their excellent services. (xi) Foot Service The Foot Service Clinics operated by the British Red Cross Society, Edmonton, on alternate Mondays at William Preye Club and the Red Cross Headquarters, continue to provide an essential and efficient service to the old people who need urgent chiropody treatment. During the year under review, the Foot Clinic gave no less than 2,998 treatments and a number of these cases were brought to the Clinics by the Red Cross Ambulance. It is imperative that old people with foot ailments should have early treatment, and it is the courtesy and efficiency of this service which has -50- earned the British Red Cross, Edmonton, the gratitude of its patients. As a token of appreciation for the special services given by the Red Cross to old people, the Edmonton Welfare Association has made a grant of £100 to the British Red Cross Society, Edmonton. (xii) Public Baths-Red Cross Service to the Elderly and Infirm The British Red Cross have continued to provide both a Male and Female Nurse each week at the Public Baths, Knights Lane, Edmonton, N.9, to assist elderly people and infirm old people attending the Slipper Baths. The Edmonton Borough Council have provided special safety rails in two baths, which are greatly appreciated. Further publicity of these facilities which are available would be appreciated at Old People's Clubs, whose members have difficulty owing to age or infirmity in having a bath. (xiii) Other Services and Activities Radio Repair Service: This excellent work is now operated by Martin's Radio Limited, Edmonton, and we are grateful to Mr. Jolly and his staff for their unfailing help and kindness in the repair of radio sets for old people. Easter Gifts and Harvest Festival Gifts: The Association are grateful to the school children and their parents, for the wonderful array of eggs, fruit, flowers, vegetables, groceries etc., which they send us for distribution to the old people. The many letters of thanks received at the schools show how much the old people appreciate the kindly thoughts of the young people. 'Budgies' for Lonely Old People: This is a new scheme that has already brought happiness to a number of lonely old people through the kindness of the members of the Edmonton Cage Birds' Society. In thanking the Society for their generous gifts, we also thank the kind people who sent us cages. Gas Cookers for Handicapped Persons: In co-operation with the Eastern Gas Board, The Broadway, Edmonton, we have dealt with a number of applications for a special type of gas cooker for handicapped old people. This is a first class scheme with little or no cost to many of the old people, and its importance should be more widely known. Despite the activities of the Association there are still many old people who live alone and many more who are lonely in one way or another. However, the Council and the Association hope to provide further services in the coming years which may reduce their burdens. -51- CONCLUSION Dr. C.A. Goggin, Deputy Medical Officer of Health, ended her service with Edmonton Borough Council in January 1962. She had by then served the Council as Assistant Medical Officer and then as Deputy Medical Officer of Health for 2lJ years. On behalf of my predecessor, Dr. Regan, and the Council, and also wholeheartedly for my own part, I would like to thank her for her loyal cooperation and hard work during that time. Her presence in the Town Hall has, I know, been missed by many, and I am sure I am not the only one who wishes her a long and happy retirement. I would like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, and the Mayor and all Members of the Council, for their advice and help during the year. I should like to thank my fellow Chief Officers and the members of their departments for the co-operation given to the Public Health Department even when we may have seemed a little trying. My thanks are due to all members of the staff of the Public Health Department for a hard and enthusiastic year's work, particularly the Senior Public Health Inspector, Mr. Rawlinson. Mr. Rawlinson really has worked like a beaver during 1961, particularly on Slum Clearance and Smoke Control. Every member of the department deserves thanks for a good year's work. Much has been done towards improving Edmonton's health, but much remains to be done. So far as money, time and effort will allow, we will try to do more in 1962, and still more in 1963. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, D. A. SMYTH, Medical Officer of Health -52- Printed and Published by the Edmonton Borough Council, Town Hall, Edmonton, N.9.
