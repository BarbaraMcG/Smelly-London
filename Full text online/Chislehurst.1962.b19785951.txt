NEWMAN (Rodent operative) 7 To the Chairman and Members of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentleman, So often now has the association between smoking and lung cancer been stressed in these reports, that one can well imagine the regular smoker saying "Why pick on me?" Perhaps the reason will become more evident than ever when it is pointed out that the number of deaths from lung cancer in the district has now risen to its highest ever level and has indeed, shot up from 33 in the previous year to the alarming figure of 52 in 1962. It is also significant that the total number of deaths from cancer of all sites in the body has not risen. When the Royal College of Physicians report on Smoking and Health was published, the Public Health Committee took such a serious view of the position, that they decided they would not smoke at their meetings in future, thus publicly acclaiming their strong feelings in the matter. One feels that any and every example of this nature makes its small but very valuable contribution to the overall campaign, and although progress must be admitted to be very slow, one does see rays of hope, such as the public request to the Southern Region of British Railways to increase the non-smoking accommodation on their trains—a request which will, of course, have its effect on the local trains. In addition to the wastage of life brought about by cancer of the lung, there has also been an increase in the number of deaths from respiratory diseases in general. The fact that these deaths have increased from 95 to 126 during the past year is also an indication of the seriousness of the cigarette problem, for there can be little doubt that smoking made a major contribution to many of these deaths. While on the subject of respiratory diseases in general, the opportunity should not be lost of mentioning the fact that atmospheric pollution is also an important factor in the development of these diseases, and one is therefore glad to know that the Public Health Committee is very interested in this problem and very mindful of the need to make the whole district one in which smoke control operates as soon as possible. Although the incidence of death by heart diseases fell a little by comparison with 1961, it was still the second highest number ever recorded and once again grave suspicion must be aroused that the tobacco habit is at least to some extent responsible. Another especially distressing cause of death is violence and the total loss of 35 from this cause is both disturbing and wasteful, but on the other hand a record low number of deaths from tuberculosis, namely three, was recorded, and when one realises that this figure 8 was as high as 20 as recently as in 1953, it is obvious that some real progress has been made here. Infectious diseases were not a prominent feature of the year, but reference must be made to the outbreak of Smallpox which affected the country in the early months of 1962. No cases occurred in this area, but one was confirmed in an adjoining local authority's district, and a great deal of work fell upon this department. Perhaps some idea of the magnitude of the increase involved can be judged by quoting the increase in the number of doctors' signatures authenticated on Vaccination Certificates—the figures rising from 482 to 3,699 in one year. Not only were we free from Smallpox but no cases of diphtheria, anterior poliomyelitis or typhoid fever occurred, but this should not be used as an excuse to avoid routine protection against the three first named diseases. It would also seem prudent to be protected against typhoid fever prior to foreign travel. Also worthy of comment is the extremely small number of cases of whooping cough notified; these number 5 only and compare very favourably with the figure for the previous year which was 48. The estimated population has risen by over a thousand, and the birth rate has also risen. There were no maternal deaths and the infant mortality rate has fallen slightly but significantly, and was below the figure for England and Wales as a whole. These figures all show a trend in the right direction and must therefore be considered satisfactory. It was during the year under review that the final decision of the Government on the alignment of local authorities to make up the new London Boroughs 18 and 19 was made. As a result of this, Chislehurst and Sidcup will be split, part of the area to be merged with Borough 18, and the other half with Borough 19. This, of course, raises many problems which will not be the lot of Local Authorities which are not to be split, but it does mean that in effect the present geographical area of this local authority will eventually be covered by two Health Committees, both of which will be entirely responsible for all the present local health authority services with the exception of ambulances, which will be the responsibility of the Greater London Council. The effect of this change in the administration is bound to make for added local interest, and this at least will, I believe, be welcome, but there must be many who would have preferred smaller units of administration with the maintenance of the present local authority. Once again, I have to thank many people for their help so generously given me during the year. They include hospital staffs, General Practitioners, and all those who work in the Public Health 9 Department. Special mention must be made of my deputy, Dr. Kelynack who yet again has been of such great assistance to me, and of Mr. Kermode, the Chief Public Health Inspector who works so hard and conscientiously in the interest of the department, and to whom I am especially indebted. This leaves the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee who, by their enthusiasm and encouragement have earned my most grateful thanks. I am, Your obedient Servant, H. B. C.

The Registrar-General's estimate of the total population of the Urban District, mid-year 1962, was 88,560, which is an increase of 1,080 over the figure for the previous year. 14 This population figure gives a density of 9.9 persons to the acre. The natural increase in population, measured by excess of births over deaths was 520. Ward population figures for the area, based on the 1961 census figures are as under:— Chislehurst 11,525 Lamorbey East 8,260 Lamorbey North 7,358 Lamorbey South 5,005 Mottingham North 4,625 Mottingham South 7,542 North Cray 6,379 St. Paul's Cray East 2,793 St. Paul's Cray North 8,386 St. Paul's Cray South 8,057 Sidcup East 9,190 Sidcup West 7,772 86,892 BIRTHS. 1,357 live births appertaining to the area were registered during 1962, of which 696 were males and 661 females. 1,307 of these births were legitimate and 50 illegitimate. The crude birth rate for the Urban District was 15.3 per 1,000 total population, which is an increase of 0.6 over the rate for the previous year. The adjusted rate for use when comparing one area with another was 15.0. The rate for England and Wales as a whole was 18.0. The illegitimate birth rate was 37.7 per 1,000 live and still births, or 3.7% of the total live births. Of the 50 illegitimate live births, 27 were males and 23 females. There were three more illegitimate live births in 1962 than in 1961. 21 stillbirths were registered, giving a rate of 15.2 per 1,000 live and still births, and 0.2 per 1,000 total population. 10 of the stillbirths were males and 11 females. The stillbirth rate for England and Wales as a whole was 18.1 per 1,000 total births. 15 POPULATION, BIRTH, DEATH, INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES, 1934-1962 Year Estimated Population Birth rate per 1,000 Death rate population Infant Mortality rate per live births Maternal Mortality 1,000 total births 1934 44,200 16.7 8.6 46 2.8 1935 47,690 16.9 8.7 63 1.2 1936 54,300 15.8 8.3 53 4.49 1937 58,670 16.9 8.7 47 6.84 1938 61,750 16.8 8.5 36 1.88 1939 63,160 18.0 9.5 42 2.82 1940 63,650 15.9 10.3 44 0.94 1941 60,610 14.6 11.4 52 3.48 1942 60,400 18.1 9.7 38 4.3 1943 60,130 17.8 10.0 36 Nil 1944 57,470 20.0 10.7 26 0.8 1945 59,170 17.5 10.1 32 1.8 1946 67,870 20.8 9.4 24 0.6 1947 70,580 20.9 8.9 29 0.6 1948 72,750 16.4 9.1 16.7 2.5 1949 73,850 15.8 7.9 19 2.6 1950 80,040 15.0 8.5 23.3 Nil 1951 85,150 16.1 8.9 23.3 2.8 1952 85,130 15.1 8.7 19.5 1.5 1953 85,290 15.1 8.6 24 Nil 1954 85,830 15.3 7.9 18.2 Nil 1955 86,870 15.8 8.6 24.8 0.72 1956 87,300 14.2 7.7 24.12 Nil 1957 87,790 14.0 8.3 16.3 Nil 1958 88,540 15.2 8.5 20.9 Nil 1959 89,020 14.3 8.6 19.7 Nil 1960 89,750 14.8 7.8 17.3 0.7 1961 87,480 14.7 9.1 21.8 Nil 1962 88,560 15.3 9.5 20.6 Nil INFANT MORTALITY There were 28 deaths of infants under one year of age in 1962, which was the same as in the previous year. The infant mortality rate for the year was 20.6 per 1.000 total live births, which is slightly lower than the rate of 21.4 for the country as a whole. The table which follows gives the Chislehurst and Sidcup mortality rate for legitimate and illegitimate infants, as well as for all infants, and also shows the comparison between the infant mortality rate in the Urban District and that of England and Wales during the past 10 years. 16 Year Legitimate Infants Rate per 1,000 live legitimate births Illegitimate Infants Rate per 1,000 live illegitimate births All Infants Rate per 1.000 live births Chislehurst & Sidcup England & Wales 1953 23.4 38.5 24.0 26.8 1954 18.8 Nil 18.2 25.5 1955 24.2 44.4 24.8 24.9 1956 22.5 68.18 24.12 23.8 1957 16.8 Nil 16.3 23.0 1958 19.4 55.6 20.9 22.5 1959 19.67 19.6 19.7 22.0 1960 18.0 Nil 17.3 21.7 1961 21.8 21.3 21.8 21.4 1962 19.9 40.0 20.6 21.4 Causes of Infant Deaths, 1962: Causes of Death Under 1 week 1 and Under 2 weeks 2 and under 3 weeks 3 and under 4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 1 month and under 3 months 3 months and under 6 months 6 months and under 9 months 9 months and under 12 months Total deaths under 1 year Atelectasis 3 – – – 3 – 1 – – 4 Congenital Heart Disease 1 – 1 1 3 1 1 — — 5 Prematurity 7 – – – 7 – – – – 7 Respiratory Diseases — — — — — 2 2 1 — 5 Other Causes 6 — — — 6 — 1 – – 7 TOTALS 17 – 1 1 19 3 5 1 – 28 MATERNAL MORTALITY There were no maternal deaths in the Urban District during 1962. The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales for the year was 0.35 per 1,000 live and still births. Two maternal deaths have occurred in the area during the ten year period 1953-1962, one in 1955 and the other in 1960. DEATHS. 837 deaths appertaining to the Urban District were registered during the year, giving a death rate of 9.5 per 1,000 total population. The adjusted rate for use when comparing one area with another is 12.1. The rate for England and Wales as a whole was 11.9. Of the Chislehurst and Sidcup deaths registered, 439 were males and 398 females. 17 The following is an analysis of the ages at death for the year 1962:— Male Female 28 were under one year of age 10 18 4 were one and under 5 years of age 3 1 2 were 5 and under 15 years of age — 2 11 were 15 and under 25 years of age 8 3 25 were 25 and under 45 years of age 16 9 204 were 45 and under 65 years of age 140 64 180 were 65 and under 75 years of age 111 69 383 were 75 years of age and over 151 232 837 439 398 Full details of the causes of death will be found in Table II in the appendix to this report, but the following table, giving details of certain causes of death in the Urban District during the past ten years, may prove of interest:— 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Cancer of the lung, bronchus 38 36 44 31 34 41 42 34 33 52 Cancer (all sites) 154 149 157 127 151 156 179 140 154 154 Respiratory Diseases non T.B.) 80 73 87 88 99 96 103 70 95 126 Tuberculosis 20 14 7 11 8 10 6 4 6 3 Heart and Circulatory diseases 325 320 353 329 348 356 367 372 415 402 Infectious Diseases 3 2 2 2 — 1 3 — 2 4 Road Traffic accidents 9 5 5 8 8 8 12 9 11 11 Other violent causes 7 9 10 11 13 13 16 17 20 24 MORBIDITY STATISTICS The following is a summary of the weekly details received from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance during 1962:— Four weeks ending Number of First Certificates of incapacity received 23rd January 1,749 20th February 1,219 20th March 1,167 17th April 1,072 15th May 784 12th June 685 10th July 587 7th August 490 4th September 492 2nd October 597 2nd November 890 27th November 865 31st December 1,160 (5 weeks) The sickness rate followed the usual trend, namely, the highest incidence of illness occurred during the early and late part of the year with the lowest figures being recorded in August. 18 STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS 83 members or potential members of the staff were given a medical examination during the year. 76 were examined in the previous year UNEMPLOYMENT. The Manager of the Local Employment Exchange informs me that during 1962, there was a small increase in the numbers of unemployed men, mainly during the winter. Prospects of employment have been, and are, reasonably good. OPEN AIR RECREATIONAL AMENITIES. Location. Acreage. Description. Abbeyhill Park 8.58 Open space. Belmont Lane 5.59 Open space.

These stretch along the eastern edge of the district and are included within the Meropolitan Green Belt, which the Council has striven to maintain intact. On the southern boundary of the district, lie the large well wooded commons of St. Paul's Cray and Chislehurst, where again the illusion of unspoilt countryside can be obtained. On the London boundary, are open areas of playing fields. These are great assets to the district and to the health of its inhabitants. These open spaces are augmented by over 500 acres of allotments, parks and gardens, directly maintained by the Council. Many of these parks contain sports grounds for football, cricket, tennis and other organised sports, together with children's playgrounds. The latest addition to the last mentioned is at Belmont Lane open space, whilst renewals of equipment have been made at others. In this connection, Games Wardens are installed at three parks during the schools summer holidays and their worth and popularity has again been proved. The Council are seeking always to improve their open spaces. The Sports Pavilion and Flat at Hoblingwell Wood were completed during the year and further paving works and footpaths are to be laid. Access to the delightful "Riverside Walk" along the Cray at North Cray has been made easier by the construction of a path. SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. 22 SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. DISINFECTION Very little current or terminal disinfection in connection with infectious diseases, is now carried out by the Department, and less importance is attached to the spraying of rooms or treatment of library books with formalin. The same can be said of the stoving of bedding in the Council's steam disinfector at the Main Road Depot. Indeed, the modern interior sprung mattress does not lend itself to heat treatment and except for the more serious form of infection, such as smallpox, the damage caused to the article would be out of all proportion to the preventive value achieved. Nevertheless, the Chief Disinfector and his assistant do carry out disinfection in appropriate cases and on request. During 1962, the following treatments were effected. DISINFECTIONS. Premises visited 186 Rooms disinfected 6 Articles disinfected 197 Sprayed Steam Disinfected Destroyed Rooms 6 — — Mattresses — 29 — Pillows — 198 — Bedclothes, batches of — 10 — Library books 9 — — PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. There are now no fewer than 20 public conveniences provided by the Council. Of these, two are in the Cemeteries at Sidcup and Chislehurst, and 12 are in the parks, as follow:— Willersley Park, Blackfen. Penhill Park, Blackfen. The Glade, Lamorbey. Waring Park, Sidcup (2) King George's Field, Sidcup. Longlands Recreation Ground, Sidcup. Recreation Ground, St. Paul's Cray. West Chislehurst Sports Ground, Chislehurst. Recreation Ground, Mottingham. Mottingham Sports Ground. Sidcup Place, Sidcup. 23 The third group are situated adjacent to the public highway in shopping centres and the like. They are:— Westwood Lane, Blackfen. St. Johns Road, Sidcup. Queens Head P.H., Chislehurst. Adj. Tigers Head P.H., Chislehurst. Cotmandene Crescent, St. Paul's Cray. Dorset Road, Mottingham. The Department is responsible for repairs and maintenance of all these premises. The staff of cleaners attend to the ladies' section of conveniences in Parks and to both sections of those contained in the third group. In three of these, attendants are stationed for varying periods of the day, but in all other instances, cleansing is undertaken by itinerant employees. The total staff working at public conveniences now amount to 15 including part-time personnel and reliefs. They are helped as necessary by the Chief Disinfector and his assistant. In August the old convenience in the Car Park at St. John's Road, Sidcup, was demolished, and the new building, a few yards away was made available. This structure is fully equipped and well appointed. It is constructed of materials easy to keep in a clean and hygienic condition, and there is reason to believe that it is appreciated by the public. As at Cotmandene Crescent and Westwood Lane, hot water washing facilities are provided. These are extensively used and are particularly important to food roundsmen and to persons who might be intending to partake of a meal. Paper towels are provided at each of these three buildings free of charge and linen towels are available at a small charge. The latter are not greatly in demand, only 191 being supplied during the year. Paper towels on the other hand, were issued to the extent of 61,500, most of them at St. John's Road during the five months in which it was open. It is certain that the conveniences provided are valued by the majority of the public. Nevertheless, a small minority continue to cause malicious damage to the buildings and their equipment. Almost all of this is of a minor nature and, whilst not interrupting the use of the convenience, is a source of considerable trouble to the Department. Ninety instances of damage were reported during the year necessitating an expenditure of £219 for re-instatement. In this respect the Mottingham area suffers worst, there being 15 instances of damage at the convenience at Dorset Road, and, a further 13 at the Recreation Ground, Court Farm Road. 24 Provision was made in the estimates for 1963-1964 for works to be carried out to prevent, as far as possible, damage to pipes and apparatus by frost. Although severe weather occurs only occasionally, some of the conveniences were put out of use in the early part of 1963. Consideration has been given to the provision of a new convenience on the L.C.C. estate at Mottingham, and a site has been "earmarked" for a building. The possibility of including a lavatory available to the public, in connection with the new swimming bath near Sidcup Station, is being borne in mind. LABORATORY SERVICE. Generally speaking, pathological specimens for examination in connection with infectious diseases are sent to the Public Health Laboratory at Maidstone, although in certain instances the laboratory at Queen Mary's Hospital is used. In this latter connection, I am greatly indebted to Dr. Herman, Consultant Pathologist. The number of items of suspected food and specimens from patients for examination vary from year to year. It is dependent on the level of such diseases as dysentery, typhoid and food poisoning, all of which have been infrequent in 1963. The following table indicates the specimens examined:— Food Faeces Vomit No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive Maidstone Public Health Laboratory 5 — 81 25 — — Queen Mary's Hospital 1 1 6 1 — — Totals 6 1 87 26 — — NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Section 47 Removal of Persons living in Insanitary Conditions. The plight of elderly persons, who due to illness or simply old age, are unable to fend for themselves, is tragic. Those who come to the notice of the Department usually do so from complaints by neighbours, and arise from the squalid conditions into which the person's dwelling may lapse. The Council's responsibility in the matter is confined to making arrangements for the compulsory 25 removal of such persons who are in need of care and attention, and are unable to look after themselves. A Court Order must be obtained before such action can be taken and this procedure would be used only as a last resort. These cases call for co-operation with the Welfare Officer of the Kent County Council, who may be able to provide appropriate services. The Old People's organisations assist where possible, and I am pleased to note that a Young Pioneers organisation has been formed at a local school, where scholars have undertaken to assist in suitable tasks. The Staff of the Department also helps where possible and always bears the aim of rehabilitation in mind. It was not necessary to arrange any compulsory removal in 1962, but at least four cases were investigated. Section 50 Burial of the Dead. The National Assistance Act, 1948, also places upon Local Authorities the duty of providing for the interment or cremation of bodies when no other arrangements are being made. There is now only a small percentage of the population not covered by " Death Grants " which enable funeral expenses to be met. From time to time, however, enquiries are made by relatives or others and the circumstances have to be investigated. In no instances during 1962, was it necessary to instruct an undertaker to carry out interment. NURSING HOMES. There was no change in the number of registered Nursing Homes during 1962. The Homes were inspected at frequent intervals during the year, but at no time were any contraventions found which called for action on the part of the local authority. Inspections are also carried out of premises which it is proposed to open as Nursing Homes, so that the proprietors may be acquainted of works necessary before registration can be granted. In the main, the beds are occupied by aged sick or aged infirm patients. Details of the Homes on the register at 31st December, 1962, are as under:— Address Number of Beds. " Fallowfield," Ashfield Lane, Chislehurst 40 " Glenthorne," 24, Lower Camden, Chislehurst 12 " Hatherley," 12, Hatherley Road, Sidcup 9 " Redhill House, "Redhill, Chislehurst 7 " The Retreat," Lower Camden, Chislehurst 4 Total 72 26 PUBLIC MORTUARY. The Public Mortuary at Beaverwood Road Depot has been improved during the year. A new "hoist" for lifting bodies from the post mortem slab to the refrigerator has been installed, and heating, lighting and ventilation improved. There is no staff stationed at the Mortuary, and considerable difficulty is met in arranging for the Chief Disinfector or his assistant to be there at times when bodies have to be received or when undertakers remove them. These calls are frequently outside the normal working hours, and are often at very short notice. The work of the disinfectors consists of receiving the bodies, cleaning where necessary and arranging for post mortem examinations by the pathologist. The premises must then be cleaned and eventually the bodies handed over for burial. The number of bodies dealt with continues to increase and reached 243 during the year, compared with 215 in 1961, 182 in 1960, and 138 in 1959. Formal inquests are held in the "Coroner's Room" at Beaverwood, there being 18 during the year. HOSPITAL SERVICES. The following hospitals are within the area of the Sidcup Hospital Management Committee of the South-East Metropolitan Region, and I am indebted to the Secretary of the Committee for the information given below. Queen Mary's Hospital. Provides a general hospital service with the following beds:— Male. Female. Children. General Medicine 37 20 — Paediatrics — — 16 Pleural Effusion 10 5 — Geriatrics 24 24 — General Surgery 28 20 6 Tonsils and Adenoids — — 12 Traumatic and Orthopaedic 16 15 — Ophthalmology — — 2 Gynaecology — 20 — Private 2 1 1 Amenity 1 1 — Unclassified 5 9 — 123 115 37 27 Regular Clinics for out-patients are held as follow:— General Medicine, Diabetic, Diseases of the Chest, Dermatology, Physical Medicine, Ear, Nose and Throat, Neurology, General Surgery, Infertility and Birth Control, Paediatric, Ophthalmic Surgery, Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery, Psychiatry, Gynaecology, Orthodontic and Dental Surgery. The Control of Infection Committee, on which I am represented, continued to function. It was necessary on one occasion during the latter part of the year, to close a ward due to the inadvertent admission of a child, later found to be suffering from an infection. The year was noteworthy for the commencement of work in connection with the new hospital building. The first part of the roadworks for the residential accommodation was commenced on 20th August, 1962, and was completed on 21st December. The commencement of building of the resident accommodation will be on 11th February, 1963, with completion date 10th November, 1964. The building of the maternity department has been brought forward. This should commence immediately following the completion of the resident accommodation and is to be completed by 31st March, 1966. The building of the main hospital should commence in April, 1966. Cray Valley Hospital. Provides a general hospital service with the following beds:— Maternity 10 Medical 10 Surgical 11 "Section 5" 1 Unclassified 3 Sidcup Cottage Hospital. A general practitioner hospital with:— Medical 11 "Section 4" 1 "Section 5" 1 A Physical Medicine clinic is held once each week in the evening. 28 Grove Park Hospital. This hospital comes within the purview of the Lewisham Group Hospital Management Committee, and has only five blocks comprising 278 beds which are situated within the Urban District boundaries. These are used as follow:— Thoracic Surgery Female Surgical 18 Male Surgical 25 Diseases of the Chest Female Medical 82 Male Medical 153 Venereal Diseases. Patients are referred to the various hospitals with specialist clinics for dealing with these diseases. None of these clinics is situate within the Urban District. From time to time the Department issues posters pointing out the dangers of these diseases and indicating where treatment may be obtained. COUNTY COUNCIL SERVICES. Ambulance Service. The main depot for the area is at 12 Hayes Lane, Bromley. At the present time there are 25 ambulances and 24 sitting case cars available for use at this depot and the majority of these vehicles are radio controlled. There is also a sub-depot at Main Road, Sidcup. Chiropody Service This is provided for Old Age Pensioners, Handicapped Persons and Expectant Mothers. The clinic is held at the Health Centre, Mickleham Road, St. Paul's Cray, and domiciliary visits are also arranged for housebound patients. 29 Domestic Help Service. Applications for this service should be made to the District Organiser, 69 Sidcup Hill, Sidcup, Kent. (Footscray 5521/2.) The following is a summary of the cases in which assistance was given during 1962:— Maternity (Expectant Mothers) 122 Tuberculosis 3 Aged 587 Others 181 893 Family Care Service Twenty-two cases received assistance during the year. Family Welfare Service Twelve cases were assisted in 1962. Evening and Night Attendant Service. Twelve cases received help during the year. Domiciliary Midwifery. Nine full-time midwives are engaged in the district. Patients may obtain their services on direct application, or through their own private doctor. Health Visiting.

SERVICES RENDERED BY VOLUNTARY AGENCIES. British Red Cross Society. The local (Chislehurst and Sidcup) Divisions under their Director, Mrs. P. Hibbs, and with Mrs. E. M. Watling as Divisional Secretary, has Headquarters at Hornbrook House, High Street, Chislehurst, and it is there that the Medical Loan Scheme and most of the other services are located. The Good Samaritan Club, for disabled men and women, meets on the second and fourth Friday in each month from 2.30-4.30 p.m. Handicraft classes for the disabled take place from 10 a.m.12 noon on Tuesday, and there is a Foot Clinic for old age pensioners on Thursday from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Additionally, there is a Handicraft Class for disabled at the Clinic, Mickleham Road, St. Paul's Cray, on Wednesday 10 a.m.12 noon. Escorts and long distance drivers were provided for the hospitals and assistance was given to the Old People's Welfare Committee, the British Legion and the Tuberculosis After-Care Committee. Holidays were provided for the disabled and training given in first aid, mothercraft, nursing and resuscitation. Also included in local services is help in hospitals, Cheshire Homes and Old People's Homes, together with provision of first aid at public gatherings. Presentations were made during the year to the President, Lady Baker, for 25 years service, and to Mr. George Parker, Commandant of the men's division, for 20 years service. 33 The St. John Ambulance Brigade. The 97th Sidcup Nursing Division functions within the Urban District under the Divisional Superintendent, Mrs. O. Barton, of 23 Arlington Close, Sidcup, Rent, and the Divisional Secretary is Miss H. R. Haley. Personnel with First Aid qualifications, attend the local cinema and many other public gatherings, including meetings and outings of The Old Age Pensioners Association and Rest-A-While Club. The Division helps in the wards at Queen Mary's Hospital and Sidcup Cottage Hospital, when required. It also assists the District Nurse with some of the long term patients, and at the Cheshire Foundation Home in Bromley. Through the Division's Medical Comforts Fund, invalid chairs, rubber sheeting, etc., may be hired for a nominal fee. Applications for these may be made at the Drill Hall. Halfway Street, Sidcup, on Tuesday, at 8-10 p.m. and at other times, by telephoning Mrs Bartholomew at FOOtscray 2106. It is interesting to note that Mrs. Barton recently became the first member of the local Division to be invested as a Serving Sister of the Order of St. John in recognition of many years loyal and devoted service to the Brigade. Women's Voluntary Service. This report has been furnished by the Metropolitan Kent County Organiser. Meals on Wheels. Unfortunately we have no Meals on Wheels scheme at present in Chislehurst and Sidcup, but we are hoping to commence one in the near future. Darby and Joan Clubs have a membership of 110. Outings and parties are arranged for the members. Welfare Work for Old People. The members attached to the Centre frequently escort old people to and from hospital, and make regular visits to sick elderly people. CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE The following is a brief summary of the work carried out by the Committee:— There are 12 clubs for old people in the Chislehurst and Sidcup area and some 800 elderly people attend them on various days of the week. Each club is financially self-supporting and is no liability on the funds of the Central Committee. 383 old people enjoyed 34 holidays in England arranged for them during 1962, and a further 37 had a continental holiday. Members visit the lonely and housebound. This visiting scheme is supplemented by visitors connected with the Churches and the Hospital League of Friends. During the year, 4 persons from Chislehurst have been boarded out in the area, and 7 from Chislehurst went to other boroughs. Housing. "Redlac": Flatlets House. The important development this year has been the installation of oil-fired central heating. SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 36 SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1956. There are only some 28 premises in the district, which come under the classification of agricultural holdings. The duties of the Council under the above Act are minimal and confined to securing the provision of suitable sanitary accommodation. Twenty-one visits were paid to these holdings and no action was found to be necessary. CESSPOOLS. In 1954 the Council laid down the policy that premises with cesspool drainage, which could readily be connected to main sewers should be given facilities to do so. This programme came to an end in 1961 and during seven years some 261 cesspools are known to have been abolished. A further 13 were discontinued in 1962. Most of the remaining properties not connected to the public sewers are in relatively rural parts of the district, whilst a few cannot be dealt with, due to difficulties of levels. For these reasons a very small number of new cesspools are brought into use each year, and in 1962, two were constructed. In a number of instances a single cesspool receives effluent from two or more premises, whilst in a few cases individual houses are drained to more than one cesspool. The present position is:— Premises. Cesspools. Lamorbey and Blackfen 3 3 Sidcup and Footscray 5 4 North Cray 118 77 St. Paul's Cray 70 39 Chislehurst and Mottingham 16 13 212 136 37 Cesspool Emptying Concurrent with its policy of abolishing cesspools when possible, the Council instituted an emptying service. In the first complete year of its operation, 1,098,400 gallons were removed from a total of 239 cesspools. In 1962 the comparative figures were 1,086,400 gallons from 134 cesspools. From its inauguration in 1954, the use of the service increased until a maximum amount of 1,549,200 gallons was disposed of in 1960. The figure dropped to 1,220,000 in 1961, which year coincided with the abolition of a large number of cesspools. Details of the operation of the service in 1962 are as follow:— Quarters Whole Year Mar. June Sept. Dec. 1962 1961 Individual cesspools emptied 43 65 50 42 93 134 No. of "jobs" including repeats 126 163 170 150 609 695 No. of loads removed 271 389 343 355 1,358 1,525 DISEASES OF ANIMALS (WASTE FOODS) ORDER, 1957. The work of licencing and controlling plants for boiling waste food has been delegated by the Kent County Council. It is principally designed to prevent disease in animals fed on swill. Plants at five premises are licensed and 33 visits were paid to ensure that operation was satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that new lengths of sewer have been completed, or adopted in private estate development as follow :— New length of Sewer Foul sewers of 6" and 9" diameters, totalling 2,792 yds. Storm water sewers of 6", 9", 12", 15", 18" and 24" diameters totalling 3,737 yds. Repairs to existing Sewers Foul Sewers of 12" diameter 17 yds. Storm water Sewers of 12" diameter 23 yds. FACTORIES ACT, 1961 Public Health Inspectors have made 243 visits of inspection to factories with or without mechanical power and building sites, etc. which are controlled by this Act. 28 nuisances or defects were dealt with, some in conjunction with H.M. Inspector of Factories. 38 The following tables give details of factories and the work carried out thereat:— 1. Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health.

During the year, four licences to deal in Game were issued to local firms. 39 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. This Act lays down standards and safety precautions which have to be applied by manufacturers of gas, electricity and oil heaters. During the year, regulations were issued under the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, with respect to the "drip feed" and other types of paraffin stove. These largely followed the voluntary code adopted by manufacturers following a number of fires involving this type of heater. In practice, it is found that all new goods supplied to retailers do comply with requirements, and only four visits of inspection were necessary in 1962. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. Licences to sell pet animals were issued to proprietors of seven premises, a decrease of two compared with the previous year. Visits totalling eight were paid to all these shops, and it was found that the sale of pets was on a small scale. No contraventions were detected. Allegations of cruelty are sometimes made against licensed premises, but these are not dealt with under the Act, and are referred to the R.S.P.C.A. PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS, 1928 AND 1936. Mr. J. C. Kermode, Chief Public Health Inspector, is the Inspector appointed under the above Acts. Petroleum spirit and/or petroleum mixtures are stored at 66 premises, under licence. The total capacity is as follows:— Petroleum spirit in tanks 206,390 gallons. Petroleum Mixture in tanks 6,000 gallons. Petroleum spirit in canned and approved stores 120 gallons. Petroleum mixture in canned and approved stores 7,315 gallons. 219,825 gallons. Carbide of calcium 100 lbs. A small quantity of petroleum spirit is also kept without a licence, at three premises, under the terms of the Petroleum Spirit (Motor Vehicles, etc.) Regulations, 1929. To meet the ever increasing demand for petroleum spirit, new installations are licensed and additional capacity is provided at existing filling stations. This has led to an increase of six in the number of licences issued for 1962, and the volume kept has risen by some 30%. Visits have been paid to ensure that the stringent safety precautions are observed and to test new apparatus as it is installed. 40 Three fires occurred in 1962, all, fortunately of a minor character. One was in a factory using petroleum mixtures, but the storage area was not involved, the second was probably due to an electrical fault in a pump which was in any case about to be replaced, and the third involved a petroil dispenser whilst it was being moved. PUBLIC CLEANSING, REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. I am indebted to the Cleansing, Salvage and Transport Officer for the following information. The volume of refuse is still increasing and this is in line with the general trend throughout the country, due in a large measure to the increased use of electricity and oil for heating. This trend demands changes in our transport requirements which means vehicles of larger capacity, with a high degree of packing in order to maintain schedules. Compression of refuse within the vehicle is now an important factor to avoid the uneconomic use of transport. The number of premises cleared was in the region of 29,500 and as some of these buildings, particularly the large ones, use more than one bin, the number of journeys made by the collectors is substantial. It is estimated that one and three quarter million calls were made last year. In addition to dealing with special accumulations from trade premises, arrangements are in force for this service to be provided to individual householders. A charge is made, based on the actual cost of the job plus the usual oncosts. Whilst the volume of work involved is not great, it does provide a useful outlet to people who have extra debris or refuse for disposal, and is appreciated. All night burning stoves are obviously used to a large extent and these bring added dangers from fire, owing to hot ashes being placed in the bin. The volume of refuse collected was in the region of 180,000 cubic yards. A further 12,000 cubic yards was received at the tip in the form of trade refuse, gully contents, street sweepings, trimmings from verges, etc. Kitchen waste amounted to 200 tons, and was cleared chiefly from individual containers in Mottingham and Lamorbey areas and a number of schools. This service ended in March, 1962. Disposal of the refuse was carried out at St. Paul's Cray Hill Park, where low lying ground is being reclaimed. 41 Further vehicles and trailers of improved design, fitted with diesel engines have been purchased. The output of salvage, including waste paper, has been maintained at a high level in spite of market difficulties. Textiles are still in fair demand but prices are low. Trade Refuse. As there appears to be some misunderstanding regarding the clearance of this material, it is perhaps desirable to make the position clear. The removal of Trade Refuse can only be undertaken by the department, providing payment is made in accordance with the scale of charges laid down by the Council in order to comply with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936. Charges for Removal of Trade Refuse: — Small quantities—6d. per bin or skep. Large quantities—Charge based on cost involved. Bulk container—£16 per annum for one collection per week. The frequency of collection can be increased provided the extra cost is met by the trader concerned. Bulk Containers used in flats and other premises for storage of domestic refuse are emptied free of charge. The Bulk Storage Container System has many advantages where the volume of refuse to be dealt with is equal to 8 to 14 normal size bins. Storage is improved by this method and the containers are emptied hydraulically and without dissemination of dust. Bulk Container System. The Bulk container system was introduced to deal with refuse from flats, hospitals, hotels and other similar places in the district. Some of the main advantages are as follow:— 1. Improved storage. 2. The containers are emptied hydraulically, and the operation is dustless. 3. The containers cannot be interfered with by dogs or cats. 4. Where the volume of refuse is substantial it does away with the need for a large number of bins, which can look untidy and, take up a lot of room. Description of Containers. Containers of up to 1¼ cubic yards capacity are emptied on site into an SD Refuse Collection vehicle by an extremely simple method which does not involve any additional hydraulic gear or controls. 42 Containers arc removed from chambers or other loading positions (where they stand on side sills) by a simple form of Jack Truck, by which they are lifted about 2" and transported to the rear of the vehicle adjacent to the lifting hooks. The safety catches are lifted and the container pushed against the lifting cradle when the catches are dropped over the container handle, after which no further action by the operator is necessary. The containers are lifted automatically from the truck by the forward tipping action of the body of the vehicle, and as the body lifts the container is tipped through a dustless sealed aperture in the rear door of the body. The refuse from each container has the full available depth of the body into which it can fall, this provides a substantial degree of consolidation of refuse in the body. When the body is again lowered, the container returns to the waiting Jack Truck and is automatically disconnected from the vehicle and can be immediately returned to the loading site. The total time for discharging each container into the vehicle is less than one minute from the arrival of the container on the truck to departure for repositioning on the loading site. Bulk Loading Vehicle. This consists of a modified SD Fore and Aft Tipping Refuse Collector of 16/18 cubic yards capacity, which is fitted with a special rear door carrying the necessary hooks for container attachment and automatic safety locking gear. The upper part of the door carries an aperture through which the mouth of the container enters as the body lifts, this being dust proofed by the use of simple double doors and a ring of rubber flaps. This arrangement forms a fully effective dust screen and seals the entry of the container before refuse commences to fall. The upper portion of the door is hinged and spring loaded, which can be lifted without effort and locked in an open position to present a standard loading rave and a fall opening for use when discharging ordinary household bins at normal team loading rate from ground level. Discharge of the load is by rear tipping, the rear door opening automatically as in the standard Fore and Aft Tipping vehicle. Containers. The containers are of 1¼ cubic yards capacity of 16 s.w.g. steel construction stiffened with angle and flat section bands, and carry the lifting bar for attachment to the vehicle. The whole being galvanised after welding. 43 Dimensions, 4' 3" high X 3' diameter. Circular type, or alternatively with flat sides 2' 6" wide to suit narrow dust chambers, and are adapted to stand on concrete sills 24½" to 25" apart X 8½" to 9" high. These containers are now provided on caster wheels, this being a great advantage in many ways besides increasing their mobility. There are 122 in the district some of which are emptied daily. Prevention of Noise. A new type of bin is now on the market fitted with rubber lid and rubber base. This type of bin is an attempt to reduce noise and it is hoped these will find favour with the public. Plastic bins are also coming to the fore, unfortunately they are easily damaged, particularly by hot ashes. Labour. The shortage of labour and the continual movement of personnel has made it extremely difficult to maintain a weekly service; a heavy sickness toll has added to the difficulties of the department. In the past few years students have filled the gaps at certain periods, particularly during the Christmas and Easier holidays. Paper Bag System. This system which has many advantages over the metal sanitary bin system, is receiving substantial and continual publicity in the press, and whilst every one is interested in the hygienic storage and collection of refuse, it might be as well to mention one big factor to be taken into consideration and that is the extra cost the system would entail. The bags purchased in bulk cost between fourpence and fivepence each, and this must be added to the present cost of service. There is also the capital cost of the holders. There would however, be some saving in other directions but as yet there is no evidence to show its introduction would not entail an additional charge on the rates. Over 100 local authorities are now operating the system in parts of their districts, and a number of improvements have been made to the holders. Refuse Disposal. The disposal of all house and trade refuse is carried on at St. Paul's Cray Hill Park, where low-lying land is being reclaimed and when completed will be handed over as an agricultural unit. It is hoped to continue tipping at this site for a further two or three years and, to enable the department to achieve this object, further 44 tion work will be carried out on the site. The collection of waste paper will also make a valuable contribution towards extending the life of the tip. Whilst we are able to dispose of the refuse within the confines of the urban district, it avoids heavy transport costs; the time will however eventually arrive, when the question of going outside the district will become an urgent matter and, as the nearest site which might be considered suitable is as least 10 or 12 miles distant, the cost of disposal will be bound to increase. Waste Paper. In order to provide better and improved facilities for handling waste paper a new baling shed was erected at Beaverwood Road Depot in 1961, and this enabled the department to deal more effectively with the volume of waste paper handled and allow for a progressive increase in output; in addition a new Powel baling machine, together with elevators and screens, has been installed and this method will provide for better sorting and grading and quicker through-put of the waste paper, thereby allowing for a bigger tonnage to be handled at a reduced cost. The old shed has been converted into additional workshop accommodation which was sorely needed for the maintenance of all Council vehicles and plant. Unfortunately the Board Mills were compelled to restrict deliveries to the works due to market difficulties and overstocking. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. There are no premises in the district licensed under the Rag Flock Act. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939. There are now five stables from which horses are hired, for the purpose of riding. Animals, consisting of 57 horses, 60 ponies and 2 foals, were inspected by the Veterinary Surgeon appointed for the purpose. Five visits were made and the animals were reported to be in good health. The Inspectors paid a further 26 visits. RIVERS AND STREAMS. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that apart from the normal maintenance of streams and rivers for which he is responsible, only the normal patrolling has been found necessary. 45 The Inspectorial staff also keep observation on rivers and streams principally to detect pollution, and 60 visits were made for this purpose. A watch is also kept for rodent infestation in the banks where rubbish is liable to accumulate and any infested lengths are treated. Rainfall and Flooding. 1962 may be remembered for the unseasonableness of its summer. Nevertheless, statistics show it to have been exceptionally dry, a total 17.76 inches being recorded. The seven months from February to August yield only 8.52. This compares with a yearly total of 23.7 inches in 1961 and 32.86 in 1960. Monthly figures for 1962 are as follow:— January 2.64 ins. July 1.92 ins. February 0.42 ins. August 1.32 ins. March 1.12 ins. September 2.44 ins. April 1.66 ins. October 1.18 ins. May 1.76 ins. November 1.12 ins. June 0.32 ins. December 1.86 ins. Total 17.76 ins. Total rainfall 1961 23.7 ins. There were no storms of any note during the year, the heaviest rainfall occurring on 26th July, when 0.70 in. fell in four hours, giving the maximum intensity of approximately 1 in. per hour for ten minutes. The total rainfall on that day was 0.86 in. RODENT CONTROL. One rodent operative is attached to the department. A further increase in infestation is recorded. This would appear to be due to some natural cycle, although it is noted that dry weather is favourable to the multiplication of rodents. Complaints rose to 420 (414 in 1961 and 320 in 1960) and it was found necessary to treat 879 premises compared with 601 in the previous year. Extermination of rats in the vicinity of dwelling houses is carried out by the rodent operative at no charge to the occupier. A small charge, based on the cost of time and materials used, is levied on occupiers of business premises for the services of the operative. 46 The following table gives details of the work:— TYPE OF PROPERTY NON AGRICULTURAL (1) Local Authority (2) Dwellings (including Council Houses) (3) Others (incl.

During an adjournment of the case, the proprietor carried out the necessary works. SEWER INFESTATION. In addition to the work above ground, the routine task of treating the Council's sewers is a considerable undertaking. Sewers, especially old lengths, form an ideal breeding place for rats and serve as a means of disseminating infestation. In the early part of each year a test is made at one manhole in ten throughout the district. On the results of this test, lengths found to give signs of infestation are baited and poisoned in the spring and again in the autumn. The degree of infestation is judged by the quantity of bait taken from the points in the manholes. The results for 1962 are as follow:— Number of Manholes treated No. of manholes in which "Complete " takes'" Partial takes" "No takes" Test Bait (March) 151 26 64 61 1st Maintenance Treatment (May) 148 32 61 55 2nd Maintenance Treatment (Oct.) 151 25 42 84 Compared with 1961 the position shows some small improvement.

The number of shops in the district shows a slight decline and is probably accounted for by the closure of some small businesses and by the enlargement of others to take in two or more premises. Lamorbey and Blackfen 250 Sidcup and Footscray 290 North Cray and St. Paul's Cray 109 Chislehurst and Mottingham 200 849 The Shops Act deals with such matters as the number of hours per week during which certain assistants can be employed, hours of opening of shops and the restriction of sales of certain articles during the early closing day and on Sunday. Although evasion of these restrictions is not widespread, they are very difficult to enforce. It has been necessary to warn some small traders who contravene, and one particularly persistent offender was reported to the Committee. No Closing Orders (citing the early closing day) are in operation in the district. Thus, subject to certain conditions, the half day is that selected by the proprietor. In fact the great majority of shops by custom close as follow :— Wednesday—St. Paul's Cray L.C.C. Estate (except Leith Hill), Chislehurst, The Oval, Lamorbey. Thursday—Sidcup (other than above), North Cray, Mottingham. The Council again decided to suspend the general closing hours for the period immediately preceding Christmas, but little advantage appears to have been taken of this concession. The Shops Act, 1950, also calls for suitable and sufficient lighting, heating, ventilation, sanitary accommodation and washing facilities; provisions for shop assistants who take meals on the premises, and seats for female employees. Considerable changes in requirements are likely to be forthcoming under the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Bill, now before Parliament, although the major part of the work which it will entail will be in connection with offices. Visits and observations in connection with the Act totalled 444, and the following infringements have been dealt with. Offences remedied Notices and records 11 Sanitary accommodation (defective and insufficient) 14 Washing facilities (defective and insufficient) 2 Closing 3 Sunday trading 4 Seats 2 49 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. Recording of Atmospheric Pollution The following apparatus for measuring atmospheric pollution is used by this department:— Volumetric Apparatus This is installed in the Public Health Department at the Manor House. A sample of air is being constantly drawn from outside. It is passed through a filter paper, on which the tarry or sooty matter (largely emanating from the chimneys of dwelling houses) is deposited. The density of the resultant stain is read daily and assessed with the aid of a reflectometer. The sample of air is then passed through a chemical solution which removes sulphur dioxide from it. This gas is the irritant but invisible factor in aerial pollution and originates in combustion from domestic chimneys, factories and motor vehicles. Tests are carried out each day to calculate the amount of sulphur dioxide extracted from a known quantity of air. Both these constituents of pollution are well nigh absent in the summer months, when domestic fires are not alight and the warmth of the sun is sufficient to remove pollution by convection. In the autumn and winter months conditions change and the level of pollution, especially that from tarry matter, increases to a very much higher level. The presence of fog is then indicated by peaks in the graph. December 1962 saw the most severe fog since the disastrous occurrence of 1952 and the density of smoke reached was 1,720// grammes per cubic meter on 5th December. Sulphur dioxide mounted to 1,815// grammes and remained well above the 1,000 reading for the next two days. The only other severe fog recorded during the period was in the first days of 1962. Sulphur Dioxide Gauges Two of these were installed, one on the roof of the County Primary School, Riverside Road, Sidcup, and the other at the County Primary Roman Catholic School, Holbeach Gardens, Lamorbey. However, that at the former place was subjected to malicious damage during the month of March and it was decided not to replace the instrument. The value of these somewhat outdated sulphur dioxide candles is marginal, as they can only be read monthly. The highest recording in 1962 was 3.58 milligrams S03 per day, collected by 100 sq. cms, PbO., during December 1962 at the Lamorbey Station, whilst the lowest reading of 0.55 milligrams was in August at the same site. 50 Deposit Gauges Two deposit gauges were installed at the same sites as the sulphur dioxide gauges. These consist of large glass bowls which collect all solid matter falling from the air, together with any rain. By a process of analysis the constituents of the solid matter can be assessed quantatively. These results are particularly useful in giving an indication of the fall-out of cement flue dust. Their use is limited in that they can only be operated on a monthly basis. The effect is that information regarding a particular incident cannot be made available for a period of from one to two months afterwards. The gauge at Riverside Road was damaged at the same time as the S02 candle there, and it was not possible to restore it to use until August. Figures for the gauge at Lamorbey for the month of November had to be disregarded due to suspected contamination of the contents. Recordings for 1962 reveal the maximum deposit of "total solids" was 20.84 tons per square mile for the month of October, at Lamorbey, whilst the lowest reading for the year was at Riverside Road in the month of September, when 6.62 tons per square mile was deposited. These results are sent to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, where they are studied along with similar data from other areas throughout the country. It was found that the figures at the Lamorbey Station were consistently higher than at Riverside Road, the average monthly product for the former being 14.01 tons per sq. mile (12.37 in 1961) and for the latter 12.85 tons (12.89 in 1961). It will be noted that the figures for October are high. During the early part of that month many complaints were received concerning the excessive deposition of cement flue dust. The matter was taken up with the Chief Inspector of Alkali, etc., Works, and it appears to have been due to a combination of failure of a precipitator at one of the cement factories, the use of unsatisfactory raw materials and the prevailing weather. The question of cement flue dust deposit in North West Kent continues to be a vexed one. This Council, along with those from other affected areas, belong to the Thames-side Joint Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution, whose purpose it is to substantially reduce or abolish this nuisance. The Committee, on which the Council was represented by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Mr. F. Ambrose) and Mr. A. V. Hatley, has been active and following the failure to secure Government action, the possibility of instituting legal proceedings is being investigated. 51 The Council was also represented on the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council by Mr. F. Ambrose, and the Chief Public Health Inspector; on the National Society for Clean Air and South East Divisional Council by Miss B. H. James and Mr. J. A. G. L. Smith, and on the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution by Miss B. H. James and Mr. F. Ambrose. Smoke Control Areas. The main pre-occupation of the department in 1962 was the detailed survey in connection with the making of a Smoke Control Area in the Mottingham South Ward, together with all houses in Oakdene Avenue, Chislehurst. This caused considerable disruption of other duties and entailed a total of 3,185 visits during the year in addition to some made in the latter part of 1961, and the completion of the survey in the early part of 1963. These visits are not a routine matter. Enquiries have to be made as to the amount of fuel used, a detailed examination made of the appliances installed and the purpose of Smoke Control Areas explained to the occupiers. The Order will be made in 1963 and it is hoped confirmation by the Minister will be forthcoming so that the majority of adaptations necessary may be carried out in the latter part of that year. The survey revealed that the following works would be necessary :— Total number of premises 2,416 1.

One pool, attached to an institution is indoors and during the year, eleven samples were taken by the authority which controls it, all proving satisfactory. Of the outdoor pools, one is attached to a factory, and two sets of water samples taken by the department proved to be satisfactory bacteriologically. The second is attached to a club and here again a similar sample showed the water to be in good condition. The third outdoor pool is of considerable interest. It was installed in the playground of a school during the year, and although of small dimensions, is constructed of prefabricated material, lined with a waterproof plastic sheeting. The water is subject to filtration and it is chlorinated. The important aspect of such a pool is that constant control be kept of the quality of the water, and school teachers have undertaken this task. Two sets of bacteriological samples, together with a chemical sample were taken from this pool during the short time it was in use, and it was found necessary to adjust the rate of chlorination. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS AND INSECT PESTS. The need for the department to carry out disinfestation for bed bugs, fleas, and the like continues only at a very low level. The rising standard of cleanliness in the home and the availability of efficacious "do-it-yourself insecticides, has greatly lightened this side of the Inspectors' work. Twenty-four complaints were received concerning insect infestation and these necessitated 21 visits of inspection. The majority of these incidents referred to the less serious pests such as ants. However, four council houses and one other dwelling were found to be in need of treatment and this was carried out by the Department in respect of four of them. The cold season of 1962 made it a year in which wasps were something of a rarity. Seventeen enquiries were received regarding the destruction of wasps nests and the persons concerned were referred to a local man who undertakes the work. WATER SUPPLY. All dwelling houses in the district receive a piped supply from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. I am informed by the Director of Water Examination to the Board, that the sources of supply to the area are River Thames- 61 derived filtered water together with well water from Eynsford, Horton Kirby, North Orpington, Shortlands, Wilmington, Darenth and Bexley Wells. A summary of the results of the bacteriological and chemical examination of these various sources is given. These waters are not plumbo-solvent. No new sources of supply were instituted by the Board in this area during 1962 and there were no new important extensions of trunk mains, but a total length of 1,838 yards of service mains were laid during the year. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being brought into service and samples of water collected from them are analysed to ensure that the water is up to the level of quality normally supplied. As well as being of the satisfactory quality indicated in the tables, so far as is known the quantity has been adequate and the pressure maintained in the mains. It was not necessary to take action in respect of any form of contamination. One house in the district is supplied from a stand pipe in the garden and so far as is known, all other houses have the water piped into the dwelling.

During the year the remaining five houses on the Clearance Area, Nos. 1-12 School Cottages, Church Road, Footscray, were demolished, and all remaining tenants rehoused. Demolition of Nos. 3-18 Garden Place and 19-23 Garden Cottages, Cray Road, Footscray, was also completed by the removal of the final nine properties, and the remaining tenants rehoused by the Council. The seven tenants from the four Individually Unfit houses, 13-16 (inclusive) Albert Road, Mottingham, were rehoused, but demolition had not commenced. No new areas were instituted in 1962, but preparations are in hand, in connection with two small groups comprising 11 properties. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS 79 applications for Improvement Grants were received during the year as compared with 86 in 1961. 52 grants were made. Details are as follow :— Discretionary Standard Grants Grants 1. Total applications received 43 36 2. Schemes approved: (a) improvements 33 34 (b) conversions 4 Amount involved in item 2 (a) £8,375 £4,165 (b) £2,488 3. Grants made 30 22 4. Houses involved: (a) owner occupied 27 19 (b) rentedthe provision of bathroom and internal W.C.s and the installation of hot water systems. The Improvement Grant Scheme is designed to provide modern amenities in the many houses which, although structurally sound, lack facilities such as bathrooms and food stores. The Government is concerned with the slow progress being made. This is borne out by the fact that although there are over 2,000 houses of this type in the area, applications have been received in respect of about 600 and grants made for less than 350. Applications in respect of rented properties are particularly few. Generally speaking, these houses lie in half a dozen pockets throughout the district. The Government called for more vigorous action to secure improvement of this significant part of the nation's houses, and it was decided that a survey be made of these groups of dwellings to 68 ascertain the difficulties facing possible applicants. The availability of grants will be brought more positively to their notice. A pilot survey of some 200 houses in the Sidcup Hill area is to be instituted in the early part of 1963. RENT ACT, 1957. Very little use is now being taken of the provision of the Rent Act, 1957. Certificates of Disrepair and other documents specified in the Act have been issued as follow :— Number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 4 Number of decisions not to issue Certificates Nil Number of decisions to issue Certificates: (a) in respect of some but not all defects 1 (b) in respect of all defects 3 Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 2 Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule Nil Number of Certificates of Disrepair issued 2 Number of applications for cancellation of Certificates 2 Number of objections by tenants to cancellation of Certificates Nil Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants objections Nil Number of Certificates cancelled 2 Number of applications by landlords or tenants for Certificates as to the remedying of works which the landlord had undertaken to remedy 4 Number of such Certificates issued 4 New Houses. The following table shows the number of new houses and flats erected during the year :— Houses. Flats.

MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. The stationing of caravans is now dealt with under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960. Sites are licensed for a given period and conditions are attached which ensure that the caravans are supplied with amenities necessary to allow them to be used as satisfactory houses. to be used as satisfactory houses. The operation of the Act has resulted in a reduction in the number of caravans stationed in the district from approximately 50 to 40: Site Number of Vans Number of Families Appro*.

Smith Memorial Hall Footscray 1 1 3 1 In spite of some difficulties, principally due to site drainage, the alterations at the Chalk Pit, Ruxley, carried out in 1962 have been a great success, and the families there appear to be settling down to a more stable life. At Twysdens Meadow, Footscray, the next largest site in the area, the ablution block with hot water, 70 bath and laundry, has been brought into use. Conditions are greatly improved and appreciated by the caravan dwellers. The remaining sites are very small and generally are occupied by persons engaged in agriculture or living in caravans principally with a view to acting as caretakers. During the year, the first camping site licence under the Public Health Act, 1936, to be issued in the district was granted to the Sun Club at Hockenden. Here again, conditions were attached to the licence, including the provision of water closets on the site, which will ensure that hygiene is maintained. The licence is valid only for the summer period of each year. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered Common Lodging Houses in the area. SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. 72 SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. INSPECTIONS. Although the number of shops in the district shows a slight decline, the number of premises from which food is sold or at which it is prepared or stored, continue to increase. This is at least partly due to the modern tendency to sell some foodstuff from shops at which it was not customary to do so in the past. There has been a further improvement in the structural hygiene of many food shops due either to entire reconstruction of premises to enable them to be used as supermarkets or comparatively minor improvements to enable the foodstuffs to be displayed in accordance with modern commercial practice. It is often possible to suggest improvements when plans are submitted for such work. As well as laying down requirements for the buildings themselves, the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, stipulate that staff should be clean in person and that practices should be in accordance with modern thought in order to prevent, as far as possible, outbreaks of food borne infection. Frequent changes in staff, even at the managerial level, make this educative side of the Inspector's work unending. During the year, 2,411 visits have been paid to food premises, 181 defects have been discovered and remedied, necessitating the issue of 54 notices of which 29 were served in writing. FOOD COMPLAINTS. Complaints continued to be received concerning foreign objects or other abnormalities in food, or of food being sold when it is out of condition. Some of these cases arise in the food factory and may be due to failure to comply fully with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Others arise from unsatisfactory transport or prolonged storage in the retailer's premises. All these complaints were fully investigated and a small number were found to be unjustified or had probably arisen due to the handling of the food whilst in the complainant's possession. Some 40 complaints were made, a decrease of six, compared with the previous year. They may be classified as follow :— Infestations 4 Milk and cream 4 Decomposition of pies and other perishables 6 Bread and confectionery (foreign matter) 10 „ „ mouldy or stale 7 Foreign articles 4 Miscellaneous 5 73 It will be seen from the table that bread and confectionery, especially the former, continued to be the main source of trouble, accounting for nearly half of the complaints received. In spite of the highly mechanised procedures adopted in the modern bakehouse, where the loaves are virtually untouched by hand, lubricating oil from many parts or accumulations of dirty matter dislodged from moving parts, continue to give trouble. These matters are, of course, the responsibility of the bakers, but the latter point out that the number of complaints received are infinitesimal when compared with the huge production of the factory bakehouse. Many complaints are traceable to a failure of the human element, which might well be lessened if supervision was more efficient. The cool conditions prevailing during the summer, may well account for the reduction in the number of mouldy pies and stale sausages received. The Committee continued to be of the opinion that the use of a date-mark, legible to the purchasers of these highly perishable articles, should be made compulsory. The opinion, however, of the Ministry on the subject is that date stamping of this nature would be misleading, having regard to the different type of storage provided in the various shops. This view is also held by the pie manufacturers, some of whom urge shop keepers themselves to code such goods by label or otherwise, when they are delivered. The great majority of such cases do arise from carelessness on the part of the retailer or his staff. Of the more unusual types of complaint received during the year, was one concerning a very unpleasant odour in some bottles of milk. The source of this was never traced, but it might have been due to some abnormality in the milk when produced by the cows. Another related to a nail found in dates, when, in spite of widespread investigations it was not possible to ascertain whether the nail gained access, whilst the produce was in this country or during packing in Africa. All these cases were fully investigated at the complainant's home, at the retailer's premises, and at depots and factories, the last mentioned usually being outside the Urban District. The facts are considered by the Committee which then recommends the appropriate action. During 1962 it was found necessary to institute prosecutions in 13 instances as follow:— Maggot in chocolate biscuits—manufacturer fined £20 with £1 costs Decomposed chickens—retailer fined £20 with £5 5s. costs. Metal in sugar confectionery—manufacturer fined £5 with £4 4s. costs. Mould in flour confectionery—manufacturers fined £10 with £8 8s. costs. Mouldy pork pie—manager of retailer's shop fined £5. Mouldy sausage—case adjourned sine die. 74 Mouldy loaf—manufacturers fined £10 with £5 5s. costs. Black particles in bread rolls—manufacturers fined £10 with £8 8s. costs. Glass in bottled milk—bottlers fined £15 with £10 10s. costs. Oil, etc., in bread—manufacturers fined £30 with £13 13s. costs. Meat pie containing fly—manufacturers fined £10 with £3 3s. costs. Mouldy pork pie—retailer fined £20 with £5 5s. costs. Metal washer in loaf—manufacturers fined £30 with £10 10s. costs. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955.

FOOD PREMISES. There are some 504 food premises in the area, made up as under:— Bakers 16 Bakers and Bakehouses 13 Butchers 56 Dairies or Milk Depots 3 Fishmongers (wet and dried) 13 Fishmongers (wet, dried and fried) 8 Fishmongers (fried) 4 Greengrocers' shops and stalls 58 Grocers 120 Sugar confectioners 78 Public Houses and Hotels with catering facilities 13 Public Houses without catering facilities 19 Restaurants, Cafes 30 Works Canteens 18 School Canteens, etc. 43 Private Canteens 12 504 Sale of Milk. Number of premises registered as Dairies 1 Number of persons registered as Distributors of Milk 17 Under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960, licences to deal in specially designated milk are now issued for a period ending in December, 1965. The following were currently held on 31st December, 1962:— Pasteurised 23 Sterilised 27 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 21 79 No processing of milk takes place within the district. The number of automatic milk vending machines in the district is four. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. Eighteen samples of designated milk were taken with the following results :— Number passing phosphatase test 15 Number failing phosphatase test — Number passing methylene blue test 17 Number giving unsatisfactory methylene blue result — Number passing the turbidity test (sterilised) 1 Number failing turbidity test (sterilised) — Eighteen samples of milk were submitted for chemical examination, all of which proved satisfactory. ICE CREAM. Twelve samples were taken during the year. Ten were placed in Grade I, one in Grade II, and none in Grade III, and one in Grade IV. Investigations were made into the circumstances surrounding the unsatisfactory sample, but sale of ice cream from this source has ceased. During the year, registration was granted for the manufacture of "soft" ice cream in a local shop, and a large depot for vans on which soft ice cream is manufactured and sold was opened. PIGGERIES. There are 12 piggeries in the district, indicating no change from the previous year. The number of pigs kept is approximately 1,825. One large piggery houses 1,000 animals, and two others 470 and 100 respectively. At all others relatively small numbers are kept. 102 visits have been paid to these sties. In one case it was necessary to require fairly extensive repairs and improvements. These were not carried out until a Statutory Notice had been served. SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 82 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. General. It has been pointed out that the epidemic of measles which inflicts itself upon the child population every other year, has a misleading influence on the total number of all notifiable infectious diseases. 1962 was no exception in this respect. Year Measles Other Diseases Total 1960 26 365 391 1961 1,863 153 2,016 1962 69 73 142 The total number of notifications received was noteworthy in that it was less than half of that for any other year in the history of the Urban District. Even so, measles still accounted for almost one half of these notifications. The picture for 1962 is perhaps even better than appears on the surface, because the bulk of notifications for other diseases were in respect of the minor infections. There was for instance, no case of typhoid fever, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, or any of the other infections which were more prevalent a few years ago. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis and Vaccination. There was a complete absence of this disease in the Urban District during 1962. The County Medical Officer has kindly supplied the following information with regard to Poliomyelitis Vaccination, based on the return submitted to the Ministry of Health. Year of Birth 2 injections (Salk) 3rd Dose (Salk & Oral) 4th Dose (Salk & Oral) 3 Orals (Complete Course) 1962 2 — — 113 1961 140 480 — 572 1957-1960 85 661 — 103 1943-1956 59 456 912 79 1933-1942 53 321 — 59 Others 131 1,256 — 224 Diphtheria and Diphtheria Immunisation. Once again I am pleased to report that no cases of this disease occurred in the area during 1962. The following table, which has been supplied by the County Medical Officer, shows the diphtheria immunisation figures for 83 1962, based on the return submitted to the Ministry of Health :— Diphtheria Immunisation (Singly or in combination) Year of Birth Primary Reinforcing 1962 481 — 1961 607 17 1960 31 211 1959 15 63 1958 13 11 1953-1957 29 409 1948-1952 4 25 Totals 1,180 802 Dysentery. Here, again, the number of notifications received was very low. Of the total of 14, six were in respect of children who moved into the district after having been in contact with cases. Although secreting the organism, they were not in fact showing clinical symptoms. Food Poisoning. With a total of seven cases, the incidence of food poisoning remains low. Four of these were mild cases, occurring in the same family and the cause of the outbreak was not ascertained. Another case occurred in an Italian, temporarily resident in this country, who was found to be affected with the unusual Salmonella Bredeney. All notified cases of food poisoning, together with other similar conditions which might not be notified, were the subject of detailed investigation to ascertain the cause of the disease and to prevent spread of infection. One sufferer, who came to notice, failed to respond to continued treatment and had to be kept under supervision for ten months before she could be declared free from infection. The following is a copy of the annual return rendered to the Ministry of Health:— 1. Name of Local Authority: Chislehurst & Sidcup Urban District Council. Year: 1962.

In spite of that the disease accounted for more than twice as many notifications as any other, 69 being received. There was, in fact, a minor outbreak in the late spring and during the last two or three months the expected epidemic which occurred in the first half of 1963 was building up. Two cases were treated in hospital. No deaths from this disease were recorded. Meningococcal Infections. No cases were notified during 1962. Pneumonia. 10 cases were notified as against 21 in the previous year. There were 49 deaths attributed to pneumonia, but this figure includes 85 people who are normally resident in the Urban District and who died outside the area. Scarlet Fever. 26 notifications of this disease were received during the year, this figure being one less than in 1961. Four of these cases were treated in hospital, largely because of unsuitable home conditions. No deaths from this disease were recorded. Smallpox and Vaccination. As mentioned in last year's report, cases of this virulent disease were imported into the country in late 1961 and early 1962. This district was fortunate to escape without any case occurring, although it was necessary to keep under surveillance one contact of a known case. A great deal of work devolved on the department following the outbreak. A few suspected cases were examined in conjunction with local General Practitioners. Very many questions regarding vaccination had to be dealt with and for persons travelling abroad no fewer that 3,699 International Vaccination Certificates were countersigned compared with 482 in 1961. Members of the staff are vaccinated against smallpox at regular intervals. In addition to the cases imported from Pakistan, six other ships with suspected cases on board arrived in this country during the year with passengers or members of the crew who proceeded to this district. It was necessary to investigate the health of these persons and in some cases to keep them under surveillance for a period of time. The following table, which has been furnished by the County Medical Ofiicer, shows the smallpox vaccination figures for 1962, based on the return submitted to the Ministry of Health. Age at date of vaccination Number vaccinated Number re-vaccinated Under 1 952 — 1 181 6 2 to 4 361 160 5 to 14 1,640 1,671 15 or over 2,112 4.083 Total 5,246 5,920 Tuberculosis. The following table shows the position with regard to tuberculosis, with comparative figures for the past 10 years (as corrected by inward and outward transfers). Deaths from this disease were well down during the year, only three being recorded. 86 TUBERCULOSIS 1962 Year Population Notifications Number of Cases on Register Pulm. Non-Pulm. Pulm. Non-Pulm.

I am indebted to the Liaison Officer of the above Committee for the following information:— "The work of the Committee continued more or less in the way it has operated for some years past, by assisting many families with fuel, hire purchase debts, fares to visit patients, clothing, footwear, etc., and for several families holidays were provided. The closest liaison is maintained with all statutory bodies, and the W.V.S. are more than helpful. The office at the United Services Club, 108 Main Road, Sidcup, is open every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., and regular home visits are also paid to many patients and their families." Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever. No cases were notified during 1962. Whooping Cough. Only five cases were reported as compared with 48 in the previous year. None of these were removed to hospital and no deaths were recorded. The following table, which has been supplied by the County Medical Officer, shows the Whooping Cough Immunisation figures for 1962, based on the return submitted to the Ministry of Health.
