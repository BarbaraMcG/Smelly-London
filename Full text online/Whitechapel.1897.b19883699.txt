(consisting of 52 WEEKS), being the FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT, BY JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; diplomate in public health, university of cambridge; fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health ; associate of the college of state medicine j member of the sanitary institute ; public vaccinator to the whitechapel union ; examiner in, and instructor of, vaccination, by order of the local government board; &c. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE STEVENS & CO., Ltd., 19 & 25a, Commercial Road, E. 1898. Officers of -t'he Board of Works for the Whitechapel District. Sanitary Department: No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., January 27th, 1898. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present for your consideration my Fourteenth Annual Report upon the sanitary condition of the Whitechapel District. It is impossible to review the changes which have taken place during the past few years without feeling thankful that so much has been achieved, and I congratulate you upon the success which has attended your endeavours to keep pace with the work which has, at times, threatened to overwhelm your officers. This success has been brought about by the readiness with which you have always fallen in with my request for more help when I have from time to time asked for it. A dozen years since, the sanitary duties of your Board were performed by a staff of two Inspectors, assisted by two labourers. All clothing, and articles which had been exposed to infectious diseases, were stoved in an oven where they would have been charred if sufficient heat had been employed to properly disinfect them, and the dustbins in most yards were large enough to contain a month's refuse of every description. They were frequently placed in close proximity to windows of living rooms, and even bedrooms. Dustbins have now practically disappeared, and a daily collection of house refuse removes the annoyance and danger to which the occupants of houses throughout the District were often exposed. The work in connection with infectious diseases is now under the control of a competent Inspector who supervises the collection, disinfection and subsequent return of all goods which have been exposed to infection. The Routine Work which is performed by this Officer, in every case where a notification of an infectious disease has been received, will be found set out in the Appendix to this Eeport. After reading the instructions, it will be understood that not every man is suitable for this special duty, requiring, as it does, great judgment as well as delicacy in its performance. The Engineer who is responsible for the care and management of the disinfecting machine, was employed by the manufacturer in its construction. With the tools which he now possesses, he is able to keep the apparatus in repair, as well as properly to work it : his colleagues are employed in bringing in and returning all goods which require treatment in the apparatus. When these men have the time to do so, they collect and disinfect such bedding and articles of wearing apparel as may require such treatment, even apart from the presence of notifiable diseases. The five General Inspectors, aided by the Clerk in my Department, have now the fullest occupation in attending to duties which have been continuously increasing for years past. One has only to contemplate the Acts of Parliament which have been added to the Statute Book since I took charge of the Sanitary Department, to be sure, that even the present staff often have their resources taxed to the utmost. They are enthusiastic workers—men whose work I highly appreciateand I would earnestly ask all Members of the Board to help in every way to encourage and assist Officers who so loyally perform duties which are onerous always,.and very often difficult to perform. 4 What is the net result to the District of this great increase in the Sanitary Staff of the Board ? It is impossible to set out in Tabular Form all the present benefit—but it is evident from a glance at the work carried out during past years as set out each year in Table P of the Appendix, that in the aggregate the District has become vastly improved. Consider the total amount spent on new and improved house drainage, where ventilation of drains has been provided, and the means of inspecting and cleansing them has been arranged for ; reflect that all the Schools within the District have been or are being treated in this manner, and it will not surprise you to be told that the general death rate has diminished, and that the mortality of infants under the age of one year to 1,000 registered births, is for our District lower than it is for any other East End District. During the year 1897 about £5,000 has been spent in this way by the owners of house property in the District. This estimate does not include new houses. I am of opinion that these improvements would have been still more pronounced but for the unfortunate circumstance that overcrowding through newly erected buildings is permitted by Act of Parliament. When there was no available vacant building land in the Whitechapel District, and when almost every house within it was a dwelling-house, the population was less than it is now. At the present time large areas are covered with Warehouses, Stores, Schools, &c, so that the increased population are housed to an enormous extent in huge barrack buildings which sometimes are constructed so as to allow light and air to permeate the rooms, and sometimes not. The effect of this modern invention is to increase the density of population to a damaging degree. I am aware that some gentlemen (more particularly architects) argue that the movement of air, constantly taking place, naturally provides all the fresh air which is required to prevent anything like injury resulting from aggregating large numbers of people upon a limited space, but I would ask such gentlemen to compare sickness and death rates in two districts occupied by the similar classes of comparable ages. It could be easily proved that where the greatest density was present, there would be found scrofula, consumption, and allied diseases, out of all proportion to the number of cases which would appear in the neighbourhood where the density of population was restrained within reasonable limits. This matter was brought to my notice more especially in the summer when I collected some statistics for a special Committee appointed by the Jewish Board of Guardians to enquire whether consumption had increased of late amongst the Jews in East London. As probably the result of the deliberations of that Committee will eventually be published, I refrain now from giving details of my own evidence—but I would simply state that I formed the opinion that the answer to the Inquiry would probably be an affirmative one. That the direct influence of these barrack dwellings upon the health of their occupants—more especially of the children—is adverse I have not the slightest doubt. I have reason, moreover, to believe that the spread of zymotic diseases is aided by the general plan of construction adopted in dwellings of this class. A staircase leading to a corridor which affords access to many rooms more easily facilitates the spread of disease than in the case of tenements which are more separated. It may also be said that as the staircases and passages frequently have to constitute the playground of the children, another factor is imported to account for the spread of disease. I have collected evidence which supports my opinion that both scarlet fever and diphtheria evince a marked tendency to appear in families who occupy rooms which are adjacent to other rooms where the disease has already appeared. Small houses, with rooms which can be entered from independent staircases commend themselves to my mind as far preferable from many points of view, as dwellings for the working classes; it is 5 certain, however, that owing to the increasing value of land in the Metropolis this desideratum is not yet to be attained. The height too of these modern model dwellings stands in the way of furnishing them with a constant supply of drinking water, The water must, therefore, be stored in cisterns of sufficient capacity to supply all but the lower floors, and this arrangement certainly is not in the direction of improved sanitation. In times of drought other and more serious inconveniences occur. Small children are not given the chance to breathe as much fresh air as they require, and they do not reap those advantages obtainable from sunshine, which are absolutely necessary to ensure them becoming healthy men and women. I feel that my contention will be eventually demonstrated, and that the time will come when many so called model dwellings will be condemned. These evils are certainly counteracted to some extent by greatly improved systems of drainage, and'by the facilities which have been introduced for the immediate removal of all offensive garbage from the vicinity of the rooms. It is much to be regretted that the recent Building Act did not impose conditions which would have rendered it impossible in the future to continue some evils which now exist in the most modern of this class of dwelling. It sometimes happens that new houses are let differently from the manner stated when the plans were submitted. I can illustrate this proposition by a case which recently came before the Law Courts. A builder who desired to erect houses of a certain height applied to the London County Council for permission, and exhibited his plans. He stated that the buildings were to consist of shops with dwelling houses over ohern. They were not to be built to let for occupation by persons of the working class. Without this undertaking sanction would have been withheld, but under the circumstances permission was granted. The houses when finished were let each to one tenant who paid a weekly rental. Tnis tenant sub-let each floor, and occasionally each room. A prosecution undertaken by the London County Council, under the London Building Act, resulted in a defeat before a Magistrate. Upon appeal the Magistrate's decision was upheld. Before leaving these preliminary remarks I must state that I do not thick very much overcrowding of rooms takes place within the District. Some night visits made by your Inspectors upon specific information have not resulted in proving definite overcrowding to be present to such an extent as to warrant legal proceedings. In several instances where two or three rooms were occupied by one family any overcrowding which existed could be remedied by readjusting the sleeping arrangements of the family. And now to deal with some of the statistics belonging to the year 1897. The marriages which took place within the District numbered 504. Last year they amounted to 434, and in the two previous years they were respectively 409 and 373. The total births which were registered in the four Sub-Registration Districts during the 52 weeks amounted to 3,150. In the Whitechapel Union Infirmary 110 births took place, of which number 21 were the children of women who had not previously resided in the District. Distributing the remaining births among the Sub-Registration Districts to which the mothers belonged, the correct distribution of births was as under:- Mile End New Whitechapel Goodman's Spitalnelda. Town. Church. Fields. Total. 1087 665 943 434 3129 So that the number of births as corrected amounted to 3,129, viz.:—1,608 boys, and 1,521 girls. The District birth-rate was equal to 39.11 per 1000. See Table A* of the Appendix. * Page 24. 6 For the purpose of this and other calculations I have assumed that our population amounts to 80,000. For reasons which I need not enter into, I believe this estimation to be below the correct number. The Metropolitan birth-rate equalled 29.5 per 1,000. The total deaths which were registered during the year numbered 2,365, viz.:—1,396 males, and 969 females. Table B* of the Appendix indicates the deaths which were registered in the several Sub-Registration Districts. A deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 994, which occurred among Non-Residents (mostly in the London Hospital); and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those Residents who died in Outlying Public Institutions, and in other places outside the District. These deaths numbered 210. The places where the deaths were registered are tabulated in the Appendix as usual—Table Df. Thus the corrected number of District deaths for the year 1897 was 1,581. 890 males died as compared with 691 females. A death-rate for the year of 19.7 per 1,000 is to be recorded, as compared with a Metropolitan death-rate of 18 per 1,000. Note the important fact that Whitechapel has year by year lowered its death-rate. I append a Table showing the correct number of District deaths for each Sub-Registration District during the past ten years:- CORRECT DISTRICT MORTALITY TABLE FOR TEN YEARS ENDING 1897.

In the four preceding years it was for each year respectively, 1,554, 1,308, 1,568, and 1,194. The ages at death of the Residents who died during the year are recorded in Table Ft of the Appendix. The percentage of deaths for each Age period was as follows 29.2% of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 14.9 „ ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.3 ,, ,, ,, 5 and 20. 12.0 ,, ,, ,, 20 and 40. 18.7 „ „ „ 40 and 60, 17.7 „ „ „ 60 and 80. 2.3 ,, „ Over the age of 80. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths, including Whitechapel, the Infant deaths were as follows:- The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 26 2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 15.9 per cent. of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District those Infants who died under the age of one year equalled 28.4 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.6 per cent. of the registered births. * Page 24. †Page 25. ‡ Page 20. 7 The deaths of children under live years of age, including the above, were lor London equal to 39 8 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.1 percent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 44.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 22.1 per cent. of the registered births. For comparison purposes I have extracted a small table from the Registrar-General's Returns. It will be seen that in a matter which indicates generally the health of a District, the Whitechapel District occupies a good position.

The figures in this Table are very similar (so far as indifferences between the columns) to last year's figures. Again the Zymotic percentage for the Metropolis has diminished, being 2.54 less than for 1896, and again the Whitechapel District Zymotic percentage has diminished by 1.39. As usual, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria and Diarrhoea, account for the vast majority of deaths in the Zymotic class of diseases : 149 deaths were registered from the five diseases named, out of a total of 188 belonging to the Zymotic class. Small-pox has been altogether absent from the Whitechapel District during the year. In the whole of London 17 deaths were registered from the disease, of which number 5 were known to have been vaccinated. In all the hospitals 90 cases of Small-pox received treatment. During the year, the Report of the Royal Commission upon Vaccination was completed. The evidence which accompanies the Report affords overwhelming testimony to the value of vaccination as affording protection against Small-pox. Without having regard to the many silly objections raised by members of the Anti-Vaccination League against the operation, it appears generally that the opposition is either on account of the compulsory law, or because in Public Vaccination humanized lymph is most frequently used. Probably, early in the Session, some legislation will take place to exehange for some of the present regulations, others of a less drastic kind. In the meantime I would warn persons who wish to be protected from so awful a disease as Small-pox, to inquire into the advantages of vaccination for themselves, and not to believe persons who, for other reasons than those of public policy, make statements which are often altogether at variance with truth. * Page 28. 8 I am somewhat handicapped in this matter, because I am officially conconcerned with vaccination—and I have been accused of supporting it for interested purposes. It does not appear to occur to these people that the Medical Profession lose vastly by anything which tends towards the entire removal of any disease. I am looking at two large posters which have been largely circulated throughout the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town and the Whitechapel District. The latter states that "the Guardians of the White"chapel Union will not prosecute vaccination defaulters. On Tuesday, "December 14th, 1897, the Guardians decided to suspend prosecutions. "Therefore ignore all notices that threaten prosecution in 14 days." I am informed by the Clerk to the Board of Guardians for Whitechapel that this statement is absolutely untrue. The Guardians passed uo such resolution. During the year there was issued a document signed by nearly 900 Medical Officers of Health in Great Britain, India, and the Colonies, which had for its object the desire to agree with three of the more important conclusions of the Royal Commission Firstly, that "sanitation "cannot safely be relied upon as a substitute for vaccination; secondly, that vaccination, especially when performed with calf lymph, is free from any serious danger ; and, thirdly, that, in order to perpetuate the protection against Small-pox which is afforded by vacciuation in infancy, it is necessary to repeat the operation at a later age. From the Times of November 2nd, 1897, I here reproduce a few paragraphs bearing upon this matter. They are practically the words of Lord Herschell who presided over the Royal Commission on vaccination. Lord Herschell "declared that he had entered upon the Inquiry with an absolutely open "mind and with a determination to follow wherever the evidence might "lead; and the result of this process, which was the more completely "carried out by reason of the presence on the Commission of Members "actively opposed to vaccination, was to leave him ' surprised' at the force "of the evidence in favour of the proceeding." Notwithstanding this declaration, the "protection which the Commission declared to be at once "safe and efficacious is still being withheld from a large number of "children, who are not only themselves exposed to risks from which they "might be protected, but are also liable to become sources of danger to the "neighbourhoods in which they live. The report of the Medical Officer to "the Local Government Board, just published, carries down the statistics "of the Vaccination Department to the end of the year 1893, and shows "that 16.4 per cent. of the children whose births were registered during the "year had not been accounted for to the Vaccination Officers at its con"elusion." What is urgently required at the present time appears to be, first and foremost, some enactment which will at once consolidate and amend upon the lines of the Royal Commission Report the law of vaccination, and, secondly, that such law shall be strictly enforced. During the year there were several deaths in the District attributable to vaccination. They were enquired into by the Coroner. Erysipelas had in each case attacked the wounds in the arm—but at such an interval after the operation as to preclude any suggestion of contamination at the time of vaccination. A Local Government Inspector made a very exhaustive investigation into the cases and a statement by him to the above effect was read to the Guardians. In the whole of London during the year 8 deaths were registered as due to " Cow-pox and the effects of vaccination." I append a Table containing some details of cases of Infectious Disease which were received into Hospitals during the year. Owing to the opening of a New Hospital at Hither Green our own cases were able to be removed with far less delay than has been the case during recent years. 9 CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS IN RETUENS OF METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS' BOARD FEVER HOSPITALS, AND HIGHGATE SMALL-POX HOSPITAL. 1897.

The Metropolitan Asylums' Board have for some time issued the Serum to Medical Gentlemen who had to treat at home cases which the Board could not receive into their Hospitals. In a letter dated December 21st, 1897, the Clerk to the Board states "The "Managers have reason to believe that in some cases (from causes beyond "their control) delay has occurred before Antitoxin is in the hands of the "Medical Practitioner, and they think that its distribution may, in many "cases, be accelerated by placing a supply in the hands of the several "Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health, as well as in the hands of the "Board's Medical Superintendents. With this object I am directed to "enquire whether, in the event of pressure upon the Board's accommodation "again necessitating the temporary refusal of Diphtheria cases, you will "be willing to receive and distribute the Serum in the manner proposed ? " I at once wrote and expressed my readiness to co-operate in the useful suggestion, but fortunately up to this time no difficulty has arisen in the removal of our cases to the Hospitals. As a matter of fact very few of our cases of Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Scarlet Fever and Enteric Fever have been treated at their own homes. It is probably due partly to this reason that we have had fewer notifications during the year. It is also certain that the type of each disease has been less severe, for only 6.5 per cent, of persons attacked by these diseases died. It has always been the practice for drains in a house to be inspected after the occurrence therein of a notifiable infectious disease unless an inspection has recently been made. No exception now is made in any case. During the year an immense amount of drain work has been supervised by your Inspectors, and I regard this work as of the highest importance. Some difficulty has occasionally arisen when combined drainage has been met with. At a Conference called together at Holborn to consider the question, after several meetings the representatives of the Metropolitan Vestries and Boards agreed upon the wording of a Bill which was drafted to meet the difficulty, and it was resolved to request the London County Council to introduce it during the next Session of Parliament. I am often spoken to by members of the Board on the subject of " The Bell Lane area, Whitechapel," as it has been called for over 20 years. You are aware that Middlesex Street and Sandy's Row have been widened. This has caused the demolition of some of the insanitary property which was included in the original representation. All the members of the Board may not have seen a Report of the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council, which was agreed to by the Council during the first quarter of the year. I here reproduce it for your information. It is dated 17th February, 1897. "The attention of the Council has been directed from time to time to an insani"tary area in Whitechapel, known as the Bell Lane area. This area formed the "subject of a representation under the Artizans' Dwellings Acts in 1877, but no "scheme was framed by the Metropolitan Board of Works for dealing with it, and "after careful consideration of the matter in 1890 wo informed the Council thatwe "were unable to see our way to recommend the adoption of so large a scheme as "would be involved in the widening of Bell Lane and Sandy's Row, combined with "clearance of the central area. The Council subsequently resolved to widen "Sandy's Row, which partly bounded the represented area on the west side as a "street improvement—and this has to a small extent improved the condition of the "area. We are now glad to be able to report that an opportunity presents itself "of making a clearance of all the courts and alleys on that part of the area which "lies between Bell Lane and Sandy's Row. We have be en in communication with Sir " Algernon Osborn, the freeholder of the Osborn estate, which includes the area "above-mentioned, and he is prepared to co-operate with the Council in improving 11 "and developing his estate, subject to the Council agreeing to sell for a reasonable "sum the frontages abutting on Sandy Row, and assisting to expedite the "formation of the new roads and the closing of the several courts and alleys. It "is proposed to close all existing courts and alleys, and to form a 40-feet street "from Wentworth Street, parallel to Sandy's Row and Bell Lane, continuing the "street round Tripe Yard into Sandy's Row, and to widen Cobb's Yard into a "40-feet street. Upon the formation of the roads, the land remaining will be "utilized for shops and domestic dwellings. The clearance of most of the proper"ties can be effected at once, but a small portion is held on leases which expire in "1922 and 1930. Sir A. Osborn's agents hope to be able to come to terms with "the tenants of these properties for a surrender of their interests before the expiry "of their leases. In the event, however, of an arrangement not being come to on "this point, we propose that the Council should ce-operate with Sir A. Osborn by "putting in force the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, "with a view to acquiring compulsorily suoh of the leasehold interests as he may "be unable to obtain possession of within a reasonable time, the Council being "reimbursed the cost of such acquisition." Then follows some details as to the prices agreed upon, and the proposed recommendation to the Council. I quite expected to have seen some evidence before now that the " Bell Lane area " scheme was at last likely to be an accomplished fact—but whatever the cause of the delay may be at present, the area remains in a worse state than ever. I am afraid it will be necessary for me to ask the Board to intervene with regard to some parts of the area. I do not propose to say much about the water supply in the District as a Royal Commission is now enquiring into the whole matter of the Metropolitan Water Supply. In the summer, some excitement was created by the report that short allowance was given in some parts of the District, and I gave up a week out of my holiday to enquire into the complaints and to report upon them. The subject also was brought before Parliament. An accident to one of the mains appeared to be the cause, and when this was rectified, no more than the customary occasional inconveniences were met with. No fault has been found with the quality of water supplied to the District by the two Companies who have the monopoly of supply in their hands. OLD AGE DEATHS. Age Distribution of the Deaths.

Three deaths were not legally certified during the year. In the case of a female child, aged 10 months, of 11, Booth Street Buildings, the Coroner did not deem it necessary to hold an Inquest, and the cause of death was therefore "unknown." 12 In the second case, a gentleman not now 011 the Medical Register, certified to death from "Bronchitis"; and, lastly, a midwife recorded a death from "Premature birth."

During the year 1897 a total of 171 bodies were deposited in the Public Mortuary, being 15 more than were received during the preceding year. For the purpose of interment only, 20 bodies were admitted, and upon the remainder inquests were held. There were 27 post-mortem examinations. 412 inquests altogether were held in the District—217 of which referred to District Residents. Those not held in the Coroner's Court belonging to the Public Mortuary, took place at the London Hospital or at the Whitechapel Union Infirmary. The Fees paid by the Coroner on behalf of the London County Council for the use of the Court amounted to the sum of £28 14s. 0d. Shrouds had to be provided to the number of 51. Of the total number of bodies admitted into the Mortuary 91 were males, and 80 were females. An inquest was held upon "Treasure Trove" on May 20th. The "Treasure" consisted of coins which were discovered in a small house in the Spitalfields Sub-District, during some excavatious which were taking place to comply with a Sanitary Notice. The coins were found to be the property of the Queen.
