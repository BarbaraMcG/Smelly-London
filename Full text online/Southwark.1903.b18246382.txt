50428 Borough of Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health, for the YEAR 1908. G. Millson. Medical Officer of Health. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Seventeenth Annual Report on the vital statistics and general sanitary state of the Borough for the year 1903. The most prominent feature of the statistics is the unprecedented lowness of the death-rate. This singularly happy state is the result of a combination of favourable circumstances, the whole of which were not under the control of the Council. The season was decidedly a wet one, and the temperature more than usually equable. There was as a consequence much less diarrhaea among infants, and infectious disease generally. Still the fact remains that for some years past the deaths have been diminishing in the Borough at the rate of 1 per 1000 of the inhabitants for each year. I believe this has been due to the increased care and attention given by the Council and the Public Health staff to the sanitary needs of the district. The year 1903 has been a period of continued activity in health matters. I have to thank the Council for their kindness and support, and the officers under me for their ready and energetic co-operation. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillor of the Borough of Southwark. Medical Officer of Health. TABLE OF CONTENTS. Page.

The deaths of Infants under one year of age to 1,000 births were 148 during the year 1903. The deaths under one year of age to 1,000 births for the last ten years were as follows: 1893 178 1898 190 1894 163 1899 199 1895 201 1900 192 1896 192 1901 168 1897 187 1902 166 1903 148 6 The Borough extends from the River Thames, its most northern limit, southward as far as Kennington Park (Lambeth), aud from the Old Kent Road on the east (Bermondsey) to Bethlem Hospital and Kennington Road (Lambeth) on the west. Its area is 1131.5 acres. As a whole it is one of the most densely populated districts, having 182 persons to the acre, whilst in particular parts of it, such as the sub-districts of the Old Kent Road and the Borough Road, the numbers are 281 and 266 respectively. The number of persons to the acre in portions of the Parish of St. George the Martyr exceeds that of any other part of the Metropolis. With the exception of a few patches of clay on the south-western border, the sub-soil of the Borough is a light yellow sand many feet in thickness. The whole of the district may be said to be low-lying. The highest point is that near St. George's Church at the head of Great Dover Street, which is about 16.6 feet above the mean sea level, whilst in Rockingham Street the height is only 4.7 feet. The average level of the Borough is 11.0 feet. Bankside is from 14 to 15 feet, and the level of high water in the Thames usually stands at an average of 14 feet. Southwark Street is 12 feet, New Kent Road from 9 to 10 feet, and, Albany Road from 8 to 9 feet above sea level. It will be seen, therefore, that much of the Borough is usually many feet below the level of the water in the Thames, and should the "Barrage" scheme of locking up the water to a height of 14 feet above the mean sea level be carried out, our district will suffer from being more or less waterlogged. Whatever advantages London may derive from such a scheme, in relation to its port, Southwark must necessarily return to its pristine marshy condition. It would indeed be a calamity from which we pray we may be saved. One of the chief features of the year's change has been the large number of houses closed in the Borough preparatory to carrying out new building schemes. The small house property in the Borough is found by the owners to be unremunerative, owing to the comparatively large sums of money spent on repairs. In many cases leases have been surrendered on that account, with the prospect of warehouses being built upon the sites. It would seem the change from dwelling houses to warehouses and factories, which has been so conspicuous of late years, is likely to proceed at a quicker pace than formerly in the northern part of the district. Should such a condition of things continue the connection of our Borough with the City will be more intimate than at any previous 7 period. I believe, at the same time, the change will be advantageous to both bodies. Representation of the Park Street Area as an insanitary one, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, was made to the London County Council, and is now receiving the consideration of that Authority. The ordinary sanitary work of the district has received throughout the year, the same zealous attention as has been accorded to it since the inception of the Borough. POPULATION.

The number of deaths registered in the Borough for the year under consideration, was 3.240, of which 1,686 were males and 1,554 females. This shows a reduction of more than 20 per cent. on the average deathrate for the last ten years. Of the 3,240 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 913 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 329 belonging to Southwark, and 584 to other boroughs of the Metropolis. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,086. Of this very large number as many as 640 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 290. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

The deaths from Scarlet Fever were 18 in the Borough during 1903, as against 42 for the year 1902. The total number of cases notified was 512 this year, as against 1,098 for last year. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 35. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .09. Deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last ten years :— 1894 42 1899 21 1895 36 1900 22 1896 51 1901 54 1897 54 1902 42 1898 45 1903 18 Of the 512 cases notified as many 493 were removed to hospital The deaths in the hospital were 18, a mortality of 3.6 per cent. The cases treated at home numbered 19, of which none died. DISCHARGE OF PATIENTS FROM HOSPITAL. Year by year mention has been made in my annual report of the great length of time patients were retained in hospital, until really they became, when discharged, a source of extreme danger to children with whom they were afterwards in contact. This was most noticeable in cases of Scarlet Fever. I am pleased to say that during the past year the length of stay in hospital of these patients has been much curtailed to the advantage of every one concerned. The practice of the hospital authorities of informing the Medical Officer of Health of patients about to be discharged, and of sending a short history of those who have suffered from nasal or aural trouble, which practice has been in vogue now for more than a year, has been attended by the very best results. In no single case in Southwark has there been on the part of the parents a suspicion of a complaint that the patient was released too soon from the hospital. It is also pleasant to see that the Medical Officer of the hospital has been courageous enough to at once discharge patients he believed, shortly after admission, not to be suffering from any notifiable disease. Old prejudices cannot be broken down in a day, and we have many practitioners still amongst us who consider a Scarlet Fever case which has been discharged home, and which was seen to have a little roughening of the skin, to be in an infectious state. When such cases occur, and when the Medical Officer 36 of Health is undecided in his opinion, unjust blame is likely to attach to the hospital Medical Officer, whereas not blame but praise should be accorded to him for the evident care he has taken with the case. I hope, however, the Medical Officer of the hospital will not be deterred from doing what is best for the patient and others simply because some irrational parent has antiquated ideas of disease. DIPHTHERIA. The deaths from this disease have been singularly few in number during the year 1903. In the year under consideration only 23 deaths occurred as against 63 for 1902. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 354 as against 539 in 1902. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 4.2. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .311. Deaths from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup during the last ten years:— 1894 130 1899 184 1895 82 1900 108 1896 129 1901 53 1897 105 1902 63 1898 123 1903 23 Of the 354 cases notified, 333 were removed to hospital with 19 deaths, a mortality of 5.7 per cent. 21 cases were treated at home with four deaths, a mortality of 19.0 per cent. The heavy mortality amongst those treated at home must be in some measure attributable to the severity of the disease, but more especially to the absence of the "serum" treatment. The table in which a comparison is made of the cases treated at home and of those at the hospitals during the past eleven years, shows that in the cases treated at the hospitals, there has been a diminution in the deaths to the number of cases treated of more than 20 per cent., while in those treated at home the percentage of the deaths to the cases treated has remained about the same. Much of this benefit which has accrued to the patients treated at the hospitals must be put down to the administration of the Antitoxin at the very early stage of the disease. Enteric Fever. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year numbered 23 as against a similar number for the preceding year. 37 The total number of cases notified was 122 for the present year as against 193 for 1902. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 18.8. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .11. Deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years— 1894 21 1899 32 1895 23 1900 39 1896 26 1901 18 1897 21 1902 23 1898 20 1903 23 Of the 122 cases notified as many as 105 were removed to hospital, with 19 deaths, a mortality of 18 per cent. 17 cases were treated at home, with 3 deaths, a mortality of 17.6 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 86.0. Every case was carefully inquired into. In quite a fourth of the cases the evidence was so strong in favour of shellfish being the cause that it could not be reasonably discarded. In one group of cases the shellfish was purchased from a particular stall. One of the group, a woman, who had not eaten oysters for many months, having a craving for some, ate half a dozen, and in ten days fell with Enteric and died. DIARRHÆA. The deaths during the year from this disease were 197, as against 169 for 1902, and 222 for 1901. This decrease in the mortality, when the average for the last ten years is considered, is due to a continuance of the cold summers we have experienced for the last three years. The deaths from Diarrhæa have been excessive in St. Michael's, St. John's, and St. George's Wards. The abjectly dirty condition of much of the population of these districts, and the utter disregard of the most elementary rules of health, personal or otherwise, account for much of this excess of the disease. There is also operating in the Borough the miserably unsatisfactory way many of the children are fed. Fortunately, a large number of children are breast fed, otherwise the mortality would be enormous among infants. The cheapest brands of condensed milk, and even skimmed milk, are widely used as the only food for babies. The Council 38 of the Borough have gone to considerable expense in issuing instructions "How to feed infants," but the gross carelessness exhibited by many mothers makes one almost disbelieve in the existence of much "maternal instinct" among the lowest of the people. The annual rate per 1,000 living was .95.

SMALL POX. During the year 1903, 40 cases of Small-Pox were notified. There was no death from the disease in the Borough throughout the year. Deaths from Small Pox during the last 10 years:— 1894 2 1899 — 1895 4 1900 — 1896 1 1901 14 1897 1 1902 78 1898 — 1903 — Of the 40 cases notified, all, with the exception of one, were removed at once to hospital. There was no particular interest attaching to the isolated cases, which occasionally occurred in the first three quarters of the year. The number was only 15, and as far as I could learn the complaint was limited to the tenement affected. On the 8th October, a draper's canvasser, whose duty took him principally into the Borough of Lambeth, was certified to be suffering from Small Pox at No. 8, Great Charlotte Street. On visiting the patient I found him in the pustular stage of the complaint, and learned that he had been for the past three days, with the rash well out upon him, mixing freely with the rest of the lodgers of this common lodging-house. Prom this case at least 15 other cases could be traced. The Public Health Committee agreed to my proposition of paying each inmate of this lodging-house, who consented to be vaccinated, the sum of 2s. 6d. as compensation for probable loss of work. Sixty persons consented to be 39 vaccinated with the result that the further spread of the disease was quickly stayed. So effectual has this practice been in stopping the spread of Small Pox in common lodging houses, and further in that of the private houses of the Borough which become infected from the lodginghouses, that the disease from a public health point of view gives us now but little concern. In the epidemic of 1901-2, the infection of the district by hawkers and tramps from common lodging houses was distinctly apparent, and it was found when these undesirable persons had been vaccinated the disease in the rest of the Borough quickly subsided. I am satisfied that on the approach of any future epidemic, it will be to the interest of the ratepayers of Southwark to expend money as soon as possible on the vaccination of the occupants of the common lodginghouses within its borders. So far, the vaccination of these persons has fallen upon the Medical Officer of Health, and with the present arrangements for public vaccination I am unable to see how that can be avoided. In any future Vaccination Act provision will most likely be made for the compulsory vaccination of these hawkers and tramps with the other common lodginghouse residents. The waste of public money by the present system of simply treating Small Pox without adopting the known means of preventing it, exemplifies once more one of our chief national characteristics. 40 41 TABLE 17.

The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 2.39. Deaths from Phthisis during the last ten years:— 1894 473 1899 621 1895 533 1900 571 1896 490 1901 516 1897 520 1902 550 1898 565 1903 496 During the last eight years it has been our practice to visit and examine, as to its sanitary state, every house in which a person has died from Phthisis. Disinfection of rooms occupied by Phthisical patients is carried out at death, and when any change of residence occurs. During the ordinary course of the disease the room of the patient is sprayed with formalin once a week, and the bedding from time to time removed and disinfected by steam. This room disinfection in Phthisis always occupies the whole services of one man, and sometimes an additional man is employed in this work. The weekly disinfection apart from purifying the room, keeps the patient and the friends up to the importance of carrying out the printed requirements which are posted up in the room. It was thought when this voluntary notification of Phthisis was first introduced, that grave objection would be taken to the patient being made aware of the disease from which he was suffering. We find, however, in practice, that in no single case has a patient objected to receive the printed information, nor refused to allow the disinfector to attend to his room. On the contrary, the patient has been deeply grateful for the care and the attention of the officer. With regard to the medical man in attendance, I have not received any complaint during the year that we have done anything that he disapproved of, or that we were in any way unmindful of his dignity and interests with the case. We have a right, therefore, to say, that this notification of Phthisis has so far been a success, especially upon the points which at first it was thought we should fail. The necessity for spreading the knowledge that Phthisis under certain conditions is infectious, and the proper care and treatment of the cases must be evident to everyone. All the cases have been visited by the Medical Officer of Health, and every care has been taken to trace the cause of the disease. In one-third of the cases there was found to be present a history of the disease in the 43 family. Either the father or mother, or brother or sister, had succumbed to Phthisis. The large number of cases in which no history could be obtained was due to the inclusion in the total cases of many admitted into the workhouse, which could not be followed up. In a district like Southwark where hard work is almost the sole feature of life, there must be many, who from ill-health or other causes become reduced to poverty. This as the table shows is an important factor in the causation of the disease among our inhabitants. This poverty naturally leads to low vitality, often to drink, and to a state of despair, rendering persons an easy prey to Phthisis. Another phase in the struggle for existence is seen in the tendency to overcrowd which is too evident throughout the Borough. The fetid atmosphere and the unwholesome condition of many of the tenements undoubtedly tend to depravity, and the craving for drink one sees so prevalent around us. It is, however, comforting to know that life in Southwark is improving, the death rate is 5 per 1,000 lower than it was ten years ago, and much of the worst kind of house property has been either cleared away or improved. 44 Occupations of persons notified as suffering from Phthisis during the year ending December 31st, 1903.

The Sanitary Authority at the present time holds pretty much the same position in relation to Infantile Mortality as it did to infectious disease before the Notification Act came into force. The supervision of infant life cannot be exercised officially unless information is given to the Authority of the locality of the births. At least it cannot be satisfactorily done except by the expenditure of more force than is likely to be allotted to it. Application has been made to the Registrar General, and to various other officials to allow the Local Registrars to furnish to the Medical Officer of Health this information, but unfortunately without any good result. I believe the answer of the Registrar General to the request is, that in giving this information he would find it difficult to obtain the registration of many of the illegitimate births. This is similar to the stock argument before the notification of infectious disease was adopted. It has since been abundantly falsified as no one has ever objected to notificatiou of infectious disease, and I feel satisfied no objection would be made to the locality of the births being supplied to the Medical Officer of Health. The Registrar General has advised the petitioning of the Local Government Board in regard to this matter. WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 68 during the year, as against 114 for the year 1902. This is an important decrease in the mortality from Whooping Cough when compared with of the average for the last ten years. The annual rate per 1,000 living was .33. The Wards chiefly affected were St. John's, All Saints', and St. Michael's. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years— 1894 1ll 1899 146 1895 122 1900 120 1896 140 1901 98 1897 126 1902 114 1898 93 1903 68 TYPHUS FEVER. No death from this disease occurred in the Borough during the year, and no case was notified. 49 MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 83, as against 164 for the preceding year (1902). The Wards most affected were the densely populated ones—St. John's, All Saints, and St. Michael's. In the serious outbreaks of Measles which have occurred in the Borough area during the last twenty years these wards have always been most affected, both in regard to the number of cases per 1,000 inhabitants, and to the case mortality. This has been due to the birth-rate being larger, and the density of the population being greater in those districts. Much attention has been paid during the last three years to the education of our inhabitants in the care and treatment of their children in an attack of Measles. Printed instructions have been distributed throughout the district which we hope have drawn the attention of parents to the necessity of early and proper treatment of those affected. Whilst this Annual Report was being prepared a serious outbreak of both Measles and Whooping Cough was present in the Borough. The plan of treatment adopted by the Authority has been— (1) The confining as far as possible of the susceptible members of the attacked family to the house. (2) The giving of advice personally, and by literature, as to the care to be taken of the patient. (3) The disinfection of the premises. (4) The closing of the Infant Department of Schools when sary. The following Poster and Handbill have been widely distributed :— BOROUGH OP SOUTHWARK. Public Health Department. MEASLES. Practical Hints on the Complaint, and the Precautions to be taken to prevent it spreading. Parents and others having the care of children must not regard Measles as a trifling complaint in which very little attention is required. Ignorance and carelessness in the treatment of the disease are responsible 50 for the greater number of the fatal cases. Children troubled with a cough, more or less constant, suffer when attacked by the complaint more severely than others not so affected. The number of children certified as dying from Measles is far greater than is popularly supposed. In Southwark, with a population of 207,000, more than 200 deaths occur from this disease annually, which number is far larger than that from all the notifiable infectious diseases put together. When Measles breaks out in a family, the patient must be put to bed in the largest room procurable, and as far away from the rest of the family as possible. It is highly infectious, even in its very early stages, before the rash appears. The disease is spread from person to person, and by infected bedding, clothes, books, and toys. Symptoms.—Measles generally commences abruptly with lassitude and chilliness. The patient is sleepy and peevish with loss of appetite and thirst. From the very commencement of the disease there is a loud brazen cough and sneezing, with a watery discharge from the inflamed eyes, nose and mouth. The voice is hoarse, and the breathing quick. Usually on the fourth day from the beginning of the illness, a deep red rash appears on the face, which afterwards spreads over the body. The face is swollen and blotchy in appearance. The patient is restless and irritable. At the end of the second day, the rash begins to fade from the face, and at the end of the fourth day the whole of the rash from the body has disappeared, leaving only a mottling of the skin. The fever at the onset of the disease, and until the rash has come out, is usually high. The hatching period of the complaint is about ten days, and the most infective period is the catarrhal stage, before the rash appears. Treatment.—The patient must be isolated in a warm room. The mildness of the complaint will be in proportion to the good ventilation and size of the room. If the room be small and the windows closed, a fatal result may be expected, whereas if the room be large, and there be good ventilation, by the windows being partly open, assisted by a five in cold weather, the patient is almost certain to make a good recovery without any other disease being left behind. The patient should be kept in bed for one week after the rash has disappeared, and should not be allowed to mix with 51 other children or attend school until a further period of two weeks has passed. Care should be taken in small rooms not to expose the patient to a draught. The most serious complication in Measles is inflammation of the lungs, so that when shortness of the breath arises the attention of the Medical man should be called to it. Prevention.—All plates, cups, glasses, spoons, &c., used in the room, should be kept entirely for the sick room until the illness is over. Any article of food or drink, and especially milk that has once been in the sick room, should never be consumed by other persons, but should be thrown away if not wanted by the patient. All articles of linen taken from the bed or patient, should be put into disinfectant in the room, and should remain there for three or four hours before being washed. Boiling the clothes is the most effectual way of destroying any infection. Blankets and woollen articles which cannot be boiled, when taken out of the disinfectant, should be washed and exposed for some time in the open air. Infected clothing on no account should be washed with any that has not been exposed to disinfection. The floor of the room should be washed at frequent intervals with a weak solution of chloride of lime, or other equally effective disinfectant, which will be supplied on application at the Public Health Office. Every room of the house should be well ventilated, the windows of bedrooms being left slightly open during the night. Every part of the house should be kept in a scrupulously clean condition. During the illness, the children living in the house should not be allowed to attend either Sunday or day schools. As soon as the disease has terminated, information of the fact must be given to the Medical Officer of Health, at the Town Hall, in order that the necessary steps may be taken to have the house disinfected. GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. 52 INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS. In the following infectious diseases the number of cases returned from the hospital and certified by the Medical Superintendent as not suffering from any notifiable infectious disease was:— In Small-pox 6, out of a total of 40 cases notified—an error of 15.0 per cent. In Diphtheria 70, out of a total of 354 cases notified—an error of 19.7 per cent. In Scarlet Fever 46, out of a total of 512 cases notified—an error of 8.9 per cent. In Enteric Fever 19, out of a total of 122 cases notified—an error of 15.5 per cent. This statement does not take into account the large number of cases seen by the Medical Officer of Health at the request of the medical man in attendance and found not to be suffering from any notifiable disease. This consultation work is of daily occurrence, and takes up a considerable amount of time, but the value of such work so far exceeds the trouble it entails that no restriction is placed upon it. RECEPTION HOUSE. During the past year the Reception House, which affords accommodation for at least twenty persons at one time, has been of the greatest service to us. This has been particularly so in regard to Small-pox. It often occurs in the very early stage of this disease that a definite opinion cannot be formed, and it is in such cases that a reception house into which they can be taken and kept, until the diagnosis is made, becomes of so much value. The present Superintendent and his wife have done admirable service since their appointment in the early part of the year. In non-epidemic times the accommodation is principally used for persons dislodged whilst their rooms are being disinfected. In the case of contacts and in those likely to develop infectious disease, food is provided during their stay in the Reception House. The amount expended in the year in this way will be seen to have been a small sum, viz.: £9 7s. 3½d., or about 6d. a day per person maintained. 53 TABLE 20.

It was found impossible to examine two specimens owing to the improper manner in which they had been collected. 59 SMOKE NUISANCES. During the year 1903 97 complaints were received at the Public Health Office from persons other than the Council's inspectors. No less than 19 of these complaints had reference to the shaft of the laundry belonging to Guy's hospital, and it became necessary to take out summonses respect to four of the nuisances at this institution reported by the Ward Inspector. The Governors of Guy's hospital were fined £10 and 4s. costs, £1 and 2s. costs, and ordered to pay costs in respect to a third summons. A Prohibition order was made in regard to the fourth nuisance complained of to the magistrate. Three summonses were taken out against the City of London Electric Lighting Company Limited, in respect to nuisances from the shafts of their works in Bankside. The defendants were fined £5 and 2s. costs on each of two summonses, and £10 and 12s. 6d. costs in respect to a third, (making £20 16s. 6d. in all). Mr. G. Schlotze, of 111, Portland Street, was fined £3 and 2s. costs, for allowing black smoke to be emitted from his bakehouse chimney. The Tandem Smelting Syndicate were fined £3 and 2s. costs for allowing the emission of black smoke from the shaft of their factory in Green Street. TABLE 23.

Much attention has been given during the past year to improving the structural conditions of the kitchens and cooking rooms of places where food is prepared for sale. In many instances hoods with ventilation shafts have been fixed over the gas cooking ranges, the floors have been covered with concrete, lead or some other impervious material, additional means of ventilation have been provided, and the walls have been rendered in cement. In some instances where the waterclosets were approached directly from the cooking room or kitchen a proper lobby has been provided in accordance with the By-laws, or the closets removed to proper sites. As a result of the year's work the Eating Houses of the Borough are in a very satisfactory condition. TABLE 32. Showing the Number of Inspections made of the Eating Houses, &c., during 1903. WARDS.

Representation of the Park Street Area under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, made by the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough to the London County Council. ith June, 1903. PARK STREET AREA. Dear Sir, I beg to report that the houses, courts, and alleys marked on the plan previously submitted are unfit for human habitation owing to the narrowness, closeness, and bad arrangement of the houses, courts, and alleys within such area, whereby there is a want of proper light, air, and ventilation for the said houses. These defects which are set out in a detailed report which you have received, are dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the buildings of the said area. The facts in support of this representation may be summarised as follows :— (a) Defective light in nearly all the ground floor rooms owing to the narrowness of the Courts and the high walls of the adjacent factories. (b) Defective air and ventilation owing to the closeness and bad arrangement of the houses, and the narrowness of the Courts. (c) The dampness of the site. (d) The high mortality from all diseases among the residents of the area. (e) The high mortality from infectious diseases, especially from Phthisis, in the area. I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, G. L. Gomme, Esq., (Signed) G. B. MILLSON. Clerk, London County Council. 102 Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Park Street Area. The Area is bounded on the north by Bankside and the River Thames, on the south by Park Street, on the west by the City of London Electric Lighting Station, and on the oast by various wharves and warehouses abutting on Skin Market Place and Bankside. The length of the area is 378½ feet, and the average width is 125 feet. The extent of the area is 42,350 superficial feet, or nearly one acre. By a census taken on March 23rd, last, the population was found to be 545. The number of persons resident in the various Courts and Alleys was, 53 in White Hind Alley, 50 in Noah's Ark Alley, 44 in Taylor's Yard, 97 in Park Street, 13 in Skin Market Place. 11 in Winnery's Rents, 167 in Moss Alley, 100 in Ladd's Court and 10 in Prince's Buildings or Court. The total number of houses in the Area is 91. The structural and sanitary state of the houses and the number of floors and rooms are set out in Table A. It will bo seen on reference to Table A that all the ground floors are dry, well ventilated, and with the exception of 70 to 80, Park Street, are either level with, or above the height of the adjoining pavement. The watercloset, which in every case is situated in the yard, is well constructed and efficient; the yard paving in every case is in fair condition. The rooms have an average size of 11 feet square and, with few exceptions, are clean and in fair repair. There are no back to back houses in the Area. The worst feature of the houses is their condition as regards light and ventilation. In the Alleys and Courts the lower rooms of the houses are more or less dark, and many of them are below the ordinary standard in regard to these two important health requisites. With the exception of No. 9, White Hind Alley, which is of wood, the whole of the houses are of brick construction, and in a fair state of preservation. The site is 12.4 above datum, which is higher than many other parts of the Borough, yet the proximity of the site to the river must render the subsoil liable to constant dampness. The dryness of the ground floor is due to the ample space beneath the floors for ventilation purposes. Each house has an open space or back yard although this open space in many cases is very small as can be seen by reference to the map accompanying this report. 103 The Alleys and Courts, with the exception of Ladd's Court, are very narrow, ranging from 3 feet to 8 feet in width. The drainage of the houses in many oases has been recently reconstructed, and the traps and appliances in all the houses are modern and in good order. The arrangement of the sewers is marked on the map. Tables B, C, I) and E, show that both as regards ordinary mortality, and that from infectious disease, the death-rate in this area, during the two years 1901-2 was exceedingly high, nearly double that of the whole of the Borough The Phthisis death-rate was 5.5 per 1,000 in each of the two years, 1901-2, whilst that for the whole of the Borough in 1901 was 2.5 and in 1902 2.6. In the face of these facts the area may be said to be an unhealthy one, and to be suitable for being dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 104 105 TABLE A.

FLOODING OF BASEMENTS. The flooding of basements during storms owing to the inadequacy of the sewers to carry off the surface water and sewage, has been a grave menace to the health of the Borough during the year. The following reports give the history of this flooding. The Public Health Committee also convened a conference of the Metropolitan Boroughs, at which complaints were made of this serious pollution of the subsoil of their districts. This was followed by the appearance of a deputation from this conference at the London County Council's offices, Spring Gardens. 113 Report read at a meeting of the Council on 22nd July, 1903— FLOODING OF DISTRICT BY SEWAGE. I have again to report to the Council the grave flooding of basements and subsoil of the Borough by sewage during the storm of last Saturday morning (July 18th). The houses most affected were in Munton Road, Walworth Road, Dante Road, Rodney Place, London Road, St. George's Road, Skipton Street, Manor Place, Camberwell Road and Southwark Street, the "Dover Castle" and "Elephant and Castle" Taverns. In some of the basements the sewage was two feet deep, and during the storm there was a six foot head of sewage in the drains which is equal to a pressure of 3 lbs. per square inch on the lowest part of the drain. This flooding of basements and subsoil of the district is now of frequent occurrence, a serious one having taken place in many streets only two months ago. I hope that the Council fully realizes what this extensive flooding means in relation to the general health. It means apart from grave discomfort, distinct increase of Diphtheria and Consumption as well as general ill-health of the inhabitants of the Borough. The sickening smell that arises in connection with this flooding is very great. The first serious flooding I remember was in 1884 in Rockingham Street, so that it is a matter of long standing. Its almost yearly occurrence since then has been the subject of many reports that I have made to the Council until I am almost tired of referring to it. The London County Council has informed me that it has a scheme to remedy this flooding, which, owing to its gravity, ought not to be delayed on the grounds of expense. It has been said that basements ought not to have been allowed to be built, but those who use this argument forget that apart from the basements the whole of the subsoil of the Borough where drains are unsound, as they must be at times, is liable to be contaminated with sewage. This flooding is the greatest danger I know of to the health of the Borough. (Signed), G. B. M1LLSON, Medical Officer of Health. 22nd July, 1903. 114 Report read at a meeting of the Public Health Committee on 7th September, 1903— FLOODING OF BASEMENTS. Gentlemen, I have to report that since your last meeting at the end of July, serious floodings have occurred on three occasions ; the last and most extensive one was on Friday evening September 4th, when the lower rooms of hundreds of houses in the Borough were flooded with storm water and sewage to depths varying from one to three feet. Such is now the grave state of affairs in this district owing to these floodings, that many of the houses in the Borough are quite unfit for habitation. In addition to the danger to health arising from this fouling of houses there has been great injury to property generally. The flooding has been universal with us and complaints have been received from all quarters of the Borough. As I have so frequently reported before, this condition of flooding has been growing for the last ten years. This year it has reached such proportions as to become not only a grave menace, but a serious injury to the health of all our residents. The London County Council has had timely warning for years past of this recurring condition. It can be no satisfaction to our suffering inhabitants to hear that from time to time the London County Council is adding to its pumping station plant when matters are year by year worse. It must be evident to anyone who has given the subject the least consideration that something more than an increase in the pumping station plant is necessary. I have thought for years past that this flooding which in a more or less degree visits us so regularly, is an important agent in the propagation of Diphtheria and Phthisis apart from the general ill-health of the people which must arise from such a foul and disgusting state of our houses. This serious injury to good sanitation in our Borough must be very disheartening, or exasperating to us all according to our individual temperaments. Our inhabitants are much upset by this flooding, and look upon the continuance of it as a scandal. I am, Your obedient servant, (Signed), G. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. 7th September, 1903. 115 Report read at a meeting of the Council on 16th September, 1903— FLOODING OF BASEMENTS. Gentlemen, I have to report that in accordance with the request of the Public Health Committee 1 have had a house to house inspection made throughout the lJorough in order to find out to what extent actual flooding of basements during during the recent storms has taken place. Broadly speaking, we have 20.000 houses in the Borough, and of these 1,683 were flooded with sewage and storm water to depths ranging from 3 inches to 3 feet. In addition to this definite flooding many hundreds of houses have had their basements made damp from the same cause. The total number of persons contained in these flooded houses is 13,464. Beyond the special flooding of houses there is to be taken into consideration the general flooding of the subsoil arising from defective drains and other causes. I am, Your obedient servant. (Signed), G. MILLSON, 16th September, 1903. Medical Officer of Health. PONSONBY BUILDINGS APPEAL CASE. KING'S BENCH DIVISION. (Before the Lord Chief Justice of England, Mr. Justice Lawrance, and Mr. Justice Kennedy.) Metropolitan Industrial Deellings Company v. Long. This was a case stated on the application of the defendant company by Mr. Chapman. Metropolitan Police Magistrate, sitting at the Southwark Police Court, in the matter of 33 summonses taken out on behalf of the Southwark Borough Council against the appellants, the owners of Ponsonby-buildings. The essential facts of the case were contained in the judgment of the magistrate, which was as follows:—The magistrate said the question in this case was one of considerable practical importance, and and had been deliberately raised by the defendants as a matter of principle. They were the owners of certain industrial dwellings, known as Ponsonbybuildings, erected before the confirmation of the drainage by-laws of 1901, made under section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855; and in 116 December, 1902, owing to the substitution of an iron pipe or drain for one of ordinary Doulton ware, they found it necessary to put new traps and pans connected with 33 water-closets in their buildings as the old traps and pans were broken during the progress of the work, but there was no change in the upright soil pipe. They were then informed by the local authority that these new traps must be fitted with anti-syphonage pipes, in accordance with by-law 17 of the London County Council drainage by-laws, because, by by-law 21. the by-laws were made applicable to new work in old buildings as far as practicable. The defendants refused to comply, on the ground that these by-laws were not applicable and were unreasonable; and it was now further contended that they were ultra vires. The local authority thereupon took out 33 summonses for non-compliance in the case of each of the 33 closets, in order that these questions might be settled in a Court of law. There did not appear to be any material dispute as to facts ; but the defendants, in order to support their contention as to the unreasonableness of the by-laws, called evidence that the soil pipes were of such dimension, namely, five inches in diameter, that the evils of syphonage, to prevent which these by-laws had been made, could not possibly occur, and that the expense which be entailed by compliance with the by-law was so great as to make the application impracticable. Mr. Dodd, for the local authority, contended that he had no right to consider any questions except the application of the by-law and its practicability. He had with some hesitation come to the conclusion that the contention was right. The by-laws admitted of no exception for the case of new buildings which contained a system of drainage where there was no probability of syphonage, and he did not think he was at liberty to create such an exception in the case of old buildings, to which the by-laws applied. If this were possible a dispute might be raised on each case, and the by-laws rendered practically valueless. He set aside, therefore, the question of whether the by-law was neccssary or even useful in this particular case. Then, as to its practicability, he did not think there was any evidence that compliance with the by-law was not practicable. The figures given for the probable expenses went far beyond this case, and he did not consider they ought to affect his judgment. The words "so far as practicable," in his opinion, were intended for cases where large structural alterations or demolition of buildings would be necessitated by the application of the by-law, which was not the case here. He thought, therefore, that thp application was practicable. He also considered that the work done involved the application of the by-laws to these traps. Mr. Danckwerts, K.C., contended that the work must involve a re-construction of the rooms in which the water-closets were 117 placed, or, at any rate, of the system of water-closets; but he thought the words used in by-law 21 were intentionally wider than that, and specifically applied to every trap or apparatus connected with a pipe or drain. Two other questions remained—Were these by-laws under section 202 ultra vires, and were they unreasonable? On the first, he was distinctly of opinion that they were not ultra vires. As to the second question, if he felt justified in pronouncing an opinion as to the reasonableness of the by-law as applied to this building, he should have great hesitation in deciding the case. He did not, however, feel so justified; but generally, ho could not doubt that it had been made by the London County Council and approved by the Local Government Board for good cause. In these circumstances, he could not hold that they were unreasonable, though he regretted there was no proviso for the case where it was proved that there was practically no danger of syphonage. There were other dangers, no doubt, connected with pipes of too large a diameter, and it might be that the authorities felt that the only safe way of dealing with so difficult and dangerous a matter was bv such a hardand-fast rule, and so long as it existed the local authority was bound to enforce it. He had no alternative but to convict the defendants; and there would be a fine of 40s. and £10 10s. costs on the first summons and 2s. costs on each of the others. In reply to an application on behalf of the defendants, Mr. Cecil Chapman agreed to state a case. By-law 17 provides:— "Any person who shall construct any water-closet, the soil pipe of which shall communicate with any sewer and shall be in connection with any other water-closet, shall cause the trap of every such water-closet to be ventilated into the open air at a point as high as the top of the soil pipe, or into the soil pipe at a point above the highest water-closet connected with such soil pipe, and so that the ventilating pipe shall have in all parts an internal diameter of not less than 2 in., and shall be connected with the arm of the soil pipe or the trap at a point not less than 3 in and not more that 12 in. from the highest part of the trap and on that side of the water seal which is nearest to the soil pipe. He shall cause the joint between the ventilating pipe and the arm of the soil pipe or the trap to be made in the direction of the flow. By-law 21 is as follows:— "These by-laws shall, so far as practicable, apply to any person who shall construct or reconstruct any pipe or drain or other means of communicating with sewers, or any trap or apparatus connected therewith, so far as he shall effect any such works in any building erected before the 118 confirmation of these by-laws, as if the same were being erected in a building newly erected." Mr. Danckwerts, K.C., and Mr. Courthope-Munroe were for the appellants; Mr. Avory, K.C., and Mr. F. Dodd for the respondent. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said that these by-laws ought to be supported except in a very clear case of their being unreasonable or of their not covering what was complained of, particularly when they were sanitary by-laws, for it was important that the local authority should be supported. For that reason he rejected the implied argument that, because there was an existing system of ventilation, the magistrate should have taken that into consideration The magistrate found in favour of the appellants that there was very little chance of syphonage or regurgitation, but that was nil ad rem. The only thing he had to consider was whether there was a breach of the bye-laws as properly construed. His Lordship considered that there was power to make these by-laws under section 202 or the Act of 1855, and these general powers ought to be construed liberally. These by-laws were in no sense ultra vires, and that issue tended to divert the mind from the judicial consideration of their proper construction. It was only in strong circumstances that a by-law ought to be held to be unreasonable, and these by-laws were neither unreasonable nor ultra vires. All they had to do with was their construction, and it must be remembered that when they were dealing with penalties the proceeding was quasi-legislative, and there should be at least as much clearness and certainty as in statutes and provisional orders imposing penalties. A person who had to make up his mind what his duties and liabilities would be was entitled to be told in reasonably plain language what he was to do, particularly in the case of existing buildings. When by-laws were applied to old buildings, it was not putting too much a burden on the local authority to say that they must state in reasonably plain language what were the burdens put on owners. In this case, in the course of altering the drains some of the pans and traps were injured. There was no change of the upward soil pipe. There was nothing done in the way of reconstruction except where the traps and pans were broken. The respondent contended that the by-law was to apply in a case where really there was nothing but repair of the pans and traps, and there was no reconstruction or intention to reconstruct. If a local authority desired to say that when one repaired any part of an existing closet or repaired the closet itself one was bound to remodel the ventilation, they were bound to say so in plain terms. The question was whether they had said so here. He doubted whether the magistrate had not gone a little too 119 far in the construction he had put on by-law 21, but his Lordship did not need to criticize that particular view. If by-law 17 had in terms said that in the case of old houses when a broken trap was repaired a certain system of ventilation must be put in, that might be a perfectly good by-law. He saw no reason why it should not. By-law 21 applied these by-laws to old buildings, and must be read most strongly against the person who was doing the work. Was it right to say that the work contemplated by that by-law must be the construction of a water-closet under by-law 17? That was going too far. But if the local authority meant to say that putting in a new trap was the construction of a water-closet, or that the doing of repairs which had been rendered necessary by some part of the closet being broken when some other work was being done, brought by-law 17 into operation, they ought to have said so in plain words. By-law 21 did not inform a person that if he required a trap or pan he was constructing a water-closet. Notwithstanding the difficulties arising in this case, he had come to the conclusion that the by-law was not sufficient to make that which was done the constructing of a water-closet within by-law 17, and these penalties ought not to be enforced. He did not agree that by-law 21 was ultra vires, but the local authority had not brought within it what was done in this case. The other learned Judges delivered judgment to the same effect, and the appeal was accordingly allowed. CLANDON STREET AREA. The following article appeared in The Times of February '29th, 1904. The Ecclesiastical Commission and the Housing of the Poor. The annual report of the Ecclesiastical Commission, which has been presented to the two Houses of Parliament, and of which the main financial portions were described in The Times of Saturday, contains an appendix dealing with a question of high concern to the community and involving great credit to the Commissioners, who, from the Primate downwards, have thown the greatest interest in the proposals it involves. Such credit conies to them at a time when they seem to stand in need of it. Nobody with equally enormous territorial and financial responsibilities can expect to escape criticism; but certainly the management of Church estates has recently come in for quite its share of denunciation. The falling in of some leases of old houses behind the Abbey led to a rising of the antiquaries and to a reply from the Commission that it was bound to dispose of its property to the best advantage. At the recent sittings of 120 Convocation a suggestion that all the parsonage-houses of England and Wales should be vested in the Commissioners with a view to solving the problem of dilapidations, led a learned Bishop, who never made a hasty statement in his life, to say that the legal business of the Commission was not carried out with any excessive regard to economy. In the present case there will be 110 room for any criticism, except that the Church has not exacted the uttermost farthing of profit. It seems that a large estate in Walworth of some 22 acres has lately fallen into the hands of the Commissioners, owing to the expiration of a lease granted in 1804 by the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, who are represented on the Commission by the Dean, sitting ex-officio. The property stands in one of the most crowded of those South London slums which have engaged the attention and taxed the studied moderation of Mr. Charles Booth. It is entirely occupied by narrow streets of small houses and small shops, which are yet quite large enough for indefinite subdivision. The covenants of a lease drawn in 1804 have not served to keep the houses in a condition in the least approaching what the Commissioners would desire, and it does not need an examination of the photographs they have had before them to prove that the site must be swept clean of its present buildings. This settled, the Commissioners had several courses open to them. They could throw the land upon the market and take any other steps that would lead to its early conversion into the largest possible amount of cash or securities. They are trustees, they might say, for the Church, and the Church in these hard times has a right to all the help she can get at the Commissioners' hands. This they put aside at once. The state of the property has already brought no little odium upon the Church, though in actual fact nothing could be done by the Commission to improve it till the lease was out. Nothing, however, could have been more fatal to the prestige of the Church than that the present opportunity of illustrating the responsibilities of property, especially when it is vested in Christian men, should be omitted in favour of whatever will ''pay " best. Besides, the Commission is after all a public body under Parliamentary supervision, and it cannot divest itself of the duty of considering the needs of the people as well as the extension of the Church; nor could anything be worse than that the Church should be extended in one diocese at the cost of the demoralization of the people in another. Therefore, it was resolved to use this Walworth estate in such a way as to place it at the disposal of the working classes already inhabiting it. The neighbourhood is full of factories, whose chimneys strike the stars with electric advertisements of somebody's soap, or biscuits, or jam, or 121 whisky; and the proper housing of the local operatives is a constant problem in the district, not to speak of the fact that its nearness to the tram-routes and the Thames bridges makes it popular with the working clssses generally. To this need the Commissioners could contribute in various ways. They could let large portions of the property as sites for monster workmen's dwellings, taking, say two-thirds of the market price, in order that the lessee might bring the rents within the possibilities of the workers, and even, if necessary, lending the lessee mo6t of the necessary building funds at a small interest. This is the history of Stanhope and Mowbray buildings, the two tenement blocks in Redcross Street, Southwark. the leases of which belong respectively to the Victoria Dwellings Association and the Metropolitan Industrial Dwellings Company. Undoubtedly, if this had been done, most of the people out of the small horses could have been accommodated in new tenement blocks, and the Commissioners would still have had a large portion of the site to dispose of to the best commercial advantage. But they have long seen that the giant tenement-block has great disadvantages, quite apart from the outrage that results to the landscape. Whatever the financial arrangements under which they are built, these blocks generally become the homes of people in rather better circumstances than those displaced by the demolition of the slum houses, while the time occupied in erecting them means that in any case the displacement of the original inhabitants is attended with the maximum of discomfort. Therefore, the Commissioners, of course at a further sacrifice of return on every acre of their land, have for some time leant to the plan of building smaller tenement houses, and even cottages, on their London estates. Thus ten years ago, in Garden Street, and Dorset Street, Westminster, and Orange Street, and Pepper Street, Southwark, they took to building cottages of four, five or six rooms each, and tenement houses let out in two-room suites. In the New Cut, Lambeth, they are now completing a large rebuilding scheme, the figures of which are worth giving, as the same plan is to bo followed in the case of the Walworth property. In the New Cut there are 6 five-room and. 23 four-room cottages; while there are also tenement houses affording 177 three-room suites and 50 two-room suites. Thus on the New Cut site, once a byword for filth and congestion, there are 257 separate holdings, making a tatal of 754 rooms. The Commissioners have, therefore, already entered into contracts for erecting on a portion of the Walworth property, at a cost of £26,850, 51 cottages, eight cottage flats, containing 16 suites of three rooms and a washhouse each, and two three-storeyed tenement houses. On the rest of the 122 property they will go on to build 34 five-room and 87 four-room cottages, 96 cottage flats, 489 three-room and 87 two-room tenements—or accommodation for 793 families in 2,447 rooms. The total cost, including the portion mentioned already, will be about £200,000, and the annual yield of this really philanthropic investment will be, perhaps a little under, perhaps a little over, 4 per cent. One cannot build cottages on land of this value to yield a clear 4 per cent.; the three-storeyed tenements serve to restore the balance of return. It is easy to see the advantages that result from this gigantic and patriotic scheme. Of the 22 acres, seven will be devoted to roads, a much larger proportion than heretofore; every cottage and tenement has its own open space on a small scale; and the Commissioners, both in Walworth, where they offer over an acre of recreation ground, and in the New Cut, where they have given half an acre, have been more ready with their gifts than the local authorities have at first been to make use of them for the good of the people. We therefore start with an immense advantage in the shape of light and air. We pass to the question of building, where almost anything would be an improvement on the tumble-down houses now on the site. Their places will be taken by rows of neat, unpretentious cottages, each with a well-sheltered porch, and tenement houses of no great height, where each suite has a half share in a good copper and washhouse. One cannot run a scheme like this and have plans from fashionable architects on a 5 per cent. basis, but "Mitre Street, New Cut," will be sufficient evidence of the care that has been taken in the matter of construction. But the crux of a business like this is the management. The Commissioners may build the best of houses and yet find the whole scheme fail when it comes to the admission of tenants, the payment of rents, the insistence on proper repairs, and the question of sub-letting. The slum landlord is generally a mysterious person, but his agent or middleman is mostly only too familiar to the tenants. The comic papers portray him as a rotund person with a wealth of watchchain; the poor know him more exactly. In the place of the middleman, who has only himself to thank for any injustice that has been done to him, the Commissioners use the generous services of the middlewoman, in the wholly benevolent person of Miss Octavia Hill. She has under her a carefully-selected army of women rent collectors, whose activities do not stop with the mere collecting. They keep an eye on cleanliness and sanitation, as well as on actual breakages; they do their best to promote such arrangements as make for morality, and, though they come for the rent, they are soon regarded as 123 friends through whom the tenants can directly approach the responsible owners. The supervisory system is as advantageous from the moral as it is from the financial standpoint. Nor is the liquor question at all blinked. Two public houses were surpressed on the New-cut estate; and in Walworth the Commissioners will now do away with one fully-licensed house and three beer houses. Indeed, it is a fact that here and elsewhere on their property they have wiped out one hundred licensed houses and over one hundred beerhouses in the last 20 years, without paying any compensation, because full notice had been given. Finally, it is not, perhaps, altogether inappropriate that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, eagerly supported in this particular by their colleague the Bishop of Rochester, should in this way facilitate the pastoral work of the Church on the property of the Church. Latifundia perdidere Italiam applies with equal truth to the effect of mammoth dwelling houses on the religious and social life of their neighbourhood. The smaller buildings which the Commissioners are adopting at least give some chance to the instincts at once of family independence and social cohesion. For his courage in presenting so large a scheme to his board Sir A. de Bock Porter deserves every commendation. Years ago Dr. Thorold said that the Commissioners should manage these slum estates themselves; but that was quite easy to say. The secretary of the Commission, whose knowledge of finance has more than once conferred great advantage on those clergy who have funds in the Commissioners' hands, has here extended the benefits of his judgment to a wider and even poorer community. Other public bodies will be bound to watch the experiment with the closest attention. 124 The following Work of Supervision has been carried out during the year by Mr. Weatheritt— MILKSELLERS. During the year 1903, 112 applications to be registered as Milksellers in the Borough were received at this office. The number of Milksellers actually on the Register at the end of the year was 413. 597 inspections of the various Milkshops were made during the year, and with the exception of the following instances the whole of the premises were found to be in a clean and satisfactory sanitary condition. Insanitary Conditions Discovered:— Defective floors or paving 3 Without proper water supply 2 Opening to a drain in milk store 1 Foul milk stores 5 Foul milk vessels 2 Total 13 All these nuisances have been remedied. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. The number of Licensed Slaughterhouses in the Borough is seven. 110 inspections of these Slaughterhouses were made during the year, and with few exceptions the several premises were found to be in a good sanitary condition and no nuisance to exist. The periodical lime-washing was found to have been duly carried out. List of Licensed Slaughterhouses:— Situation of Premises.

The structural alterations carried out during the year in both underground bakehouses, and in "level" or above ground ones have been so extensive, that in order to appreciate readily the extent of our work, I have had tables made showing the present condition of all bakehouses, together with lists of the works carried out in the year 1903. It will be seen that all the "level" bakehouses, as well as those underground, have been much improved and large sums of money have been spent upon them. Certificates are to be given in respect to all bakehouses, whether above or underground, when all the requirements of the Council have been complied with. Six underground bakehouses in the Borough have been closed as unfit for use, of which three could not be made fit, and in the remaining three, the owners were indisposed to incur the expense of the prescribed alterations. 143 TABLE 37.
