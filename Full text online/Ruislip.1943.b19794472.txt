The immunisation clinics continued throughout 1943 at Northwood, Eastcote, Ruislip and South Ruislip. During the year 112+3 persons received treatment under the Council's scheme. Repeated reminders have been issued in the form of advertisements in the local press, through the Principals of Schools, Health Visitors and the Women's Voluntary Services, which have had good effect in bringing the matter to the notice of the population. Diphtheria Antitoxin. The arrangement made for the supply of Diphtheria Antitoxin "by the chemists is as follows Northwood - Mr. H.B.Sharman, 31 Green Lane, Eastcote - Mr. T.T.Johnson, 172 Field End Road. Ruislip - Mr. I.A.P.Vychan Jones, 64 High Street. Ruislip Manor - Mr. A.C.Dungworth, 54 Victoria Road. Antitoxin will be supplied by the above chemists, free, to medical practitioners, for patients who are unable to pay for the supply, provided that their doctor gives a certificate to the chemist to that effect. Insulin. In accordance with the Ministry's Circular No:2734 dated January 4th, 1943, the Council have commenced the supply of insulin either free of cost or at a reduced price to persons of slender means, suffering from diabetis. During the year 12 persons applied for insulin. Two persons received supplies free of cost, and three at half cost. Application should be made to the Medical Officer of Health, when the necessary application forms will be supplied to the applicant. The case will then be considered by the appropriate Committee of the Council, and the applicant notified in due course. Milk Supply The Middlesex County Council ure responsible for the taking of samples for analysis as to quality of milk. Samples for cleanliness are taken monthly, and with three exceptions the samples were found to be satisfactory. The farms and dairies were regularly inspected, and investigation as to the cause of the unsatisfactory reports undertaken. In one case this was probably due to fruity pasteurisation, but as the farmer in question is not the holder of a licence to pasteurise milk, the milk is not sold as pasteurised. The position is thus extremely unsatisfactory. - 5 - GENERAL STATISTICS. Acreage of the District. Northwood Ward 1,979 Acres.

I raised the question of the decrease in the population for the year 1943 with the Registrar General, and received the following explanation. "The estimates of civilian population at Midsummer 1943 are based on the National Register enumeration of 1939, together with movements derived from the operation of the register since that date. A further check was provided from the special issue of the new ration book and identity cards, which took place about the middle of last year. - 6 - INFECTIOUS DISEASES Disease Total Cases notified 1943 Adm: to Hosp.

Of the other eight cases, three were sporadic cases of Sonne Dysentery, and the remainder were bacillary of various types. The increase in the number of cases of Pneumonia is probably accounted for by living under the present war conditions. It will be noted that the decrease in cases of Diphtheria was very considerable, and out of the seven cases notified there were no deaths. Pour cases occurred in Service patients aged between 20 and 35 yrs. It is not known whether these patients had been immunised. Of the remainder, two occurred in children aged 2 and 4, and one in a man aged 35. The two children had not been immunised. Scabies. Arrangements have been made with Mount Vernon Hospital for the diagnosis and treatment of Scabies. Patients may attend at 10 a.m. every Tuesday.
