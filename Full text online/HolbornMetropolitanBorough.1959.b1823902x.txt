The numbers of both males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have declined during these last ten years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table shows the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last eight years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 19 SECTION 3.

Notifications During the year 245 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 72 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 22). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1930-1959 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 24 and 25). Diphtheria Two cases, both of a 'mitis' strain, were notified and removed to hospital. In one case the patient was the only member of a family of four children not to have been immunised. Dysentery Twenty-eight cases were notified and nine were removed to hospital. Eighteen cases were the result of an outbreak of Shigella sonnei infection in the Kingsway Creche. Numerous swabs were taken and examined by the Public Health Laboratory, County Hall, the positive cases being excluded from the Creche under care of their own doctors until three consecutive negative specimens had been produced. Enteric Fever No cases were notified during the year. Erysipelas Two cases were notified and were treated at home. Food Poisoning Nineteen cases were notified and seventeen of them were removed to hospital. In ten of these cases the patient was not resident in Holborn. Information was received from various local authorities of sixteen other cases alleged to have been due to the consumption of a meal in a restaurant in Holborn. The restaurant was inspected and the staff interviewed. The kitchen equipment was excellent. One waitress admitted that she had suffered from diarrhoea and vomiting on the day in question. Faecal specimens from the staff were submitted for examination at the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene. All specimens produced a negative result except that from the person who had been ill, which gave a growth of Salmonella Typhimurium. This employee was advised to visit her doctor who was informed of the facts of the case. She and the restaurant proprietor were advised that she should not return to work until three consecutive negative specimens had been received. 21 Although it was not possible to find out where the lady herself became infected it is reasonably certain that she caused the illness of sixteen people. This case illustrates that while clean kitchens are important, the safety of food depends on the conduct of food handlers and their knowledge of the rules of hygiene. Malaria No cases were notified during the year. Measles One hundred and thirty-nine cases were notified and nine were removed to hospital. Meningococcal Infection Four cases were notified during the year and were removed to hospital. Ophthalmia Neonatorum One case was notified during the year, and was removed to hospital. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal) Three cases of acute primary pneumonia were notified, and were removed to hospital. There were also three notifications of acute influenzal pneumonia, two of which were removed to hospital. Poliomyelitis Two cases were notified, both of which were removed to hospital. One of these cases was not a Holborn resident. Puerperal Pyrexia No cases were notified during the year. Scabies Two cases were notified, and were treated at home. Scarlet Fever Seven cases were notified, and four of them were removed to hospital. Smallpox No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year. Tuberculosis See page 51.

This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.I, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 515 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease Positive Negative Total Diphtheria 3 48 51 (Nasal and throat swabs) Dysentery (Faeces) 7 169 176 (Faecal swabs) 32 173 205 Food Poisoning (Faeces) 1 3 4 (Faecal swabs) 5 34 39 (Other specimens) — 10 10 Streptococcus haemolyticus 4 6 10 Vincents organisms 2 13 15 Other pathogenic organisms 3 2 5 Infectious Disease Contacts Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificate during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 526 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 390 were in respect of smallpox, 82 for cholera, 44 for typhoid, and 10 for yellow fever. Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 291 Holborn children completed the primary course of immunisation against diphtheria, and 273 received boosting doses. 24 25 TABLE No. 7 Comparative Figures of Infectious Disease for the last 30 years Disease 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 ###] (Population) 38,380 34,470 36,440 36,050 36,000 35,400 34,850 34,600 34,350 30,660 23,470 17,160 16,580 7,240 18,020 18,680 21,190 23,460 24,960 25,490 25,930 24,540 23,950 23,710 23,340 23,060 22,640 22,230 21,870 21,370 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 80 69 76 75 74 93 60 76 49 19 7 14 17 17 5 11 12 3 2 1 2 - - - - - - - 1 2 Dysentery — 2 1 — 2 6 6 10 10 — — — — 2 13 2 6 — 4 — 2 34 9 8 34 4 7 16 30 28 Encephalitis Lethargica 1 — 1 1 1 1 — — — 2 — — — — — 1 — — — — — — — 1 — - - - - - Enteric Fever 4 4 4 1 3 2 2 — — 1 1 3 1 6 1 — 1 1 1 — 1 — 2 1 2 — — 4 — — Erysipelas 29 17 17 19 12 18 19 10 15 13 12 3 7 3 8 3 4 8 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 — — 1 2 Food Poisoning Notifiable as from 12th July, 11 1932. 5 — — 3 5 2 - - - - - - 1 — 1 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 12 1 2 11 19 Malaria — — 1 1 1 3 2 3 — 1 — — — 1 — — — — — — 1 1 — 1 1 - - - 1 Measles Notifiable as from 9th September, 1938. — 8 39 34 58 219 33 103 107 157 87 170 137 254 133 195 37 172 71 99 56 139 Meningococcal Infection — 4 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 7 7 1 1 — 1 2 2 - - - - - 2 1 2 2 1 — 4 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 5 7 4 6 6 4 3 3 5 4 4 1 5 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 2 — 2 3 — 1 — — — 1 Pneumonia (Acute primary & Acute-influenzal) 49 40 28 37 38 21 30 34 21 28 14 18 20 22 14 6 17 15 9 9 5 8 4 4 4 — 3 4 2 6 Polio-encephalitis Acute - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - Poliomyelitis Acute 1 1 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 — 5 1 2 2 — 6 17 3 12 6 11 4 2 * Puerperal Fever 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 4 — — — 1 2 2 2 2 — 1 1 * * * * * * * * * * * Puerperal Pyrexia 6 4 6 5 2 4 3 2 2 3 3 2 7 3 1 4 5 5 2 4 2 3 1 — - - - - - - Scabies Notifiable as from 1st August, 1943. 54 99 125 106 43 16 4 3 4 3 6 1 5 5 1 3 2 Scarlet Fever 90 57 57 96 115 50 67 38 59 56 20 16 23 30 20 14 24 29 13 15 16 21 18 10 5 4 4 8 9 7 Smallpox 14 3 1 1 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Tuberculosis Pulmonary 76 80 73 50 83 68 77 66 71 64 44 47 45 51 41 59 55 47 39 42 39 45 46 48 32 40 33 32 25 27 Tuberculosis, Non-Pulmonary 10 8 16 9 6 5 13 10 8 5 3 6 8 3 9 9 5 4 8 6 5 — 2 3 4 4 3 — 2 — Whooping Cough 33 44 108 23 65 99 76 60 53 71 7 42 48 38 30 11 43 23 74 5 90 33 32 62 6 1 22 6 3 4 401 342 408 335 412 379 365 322 296 278 161 194 242 456 280 364 392 348 268 269 311 406 261 366 133 258 157 184 148 243 * Ceased to be notifiable as from 30th July, 1948. 26 SECTION 4.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. Two complaints of impure water supply were received. Upon investigation it was found that, in one case, sand had entered the supply pipes, probably due to disturbance on opening the mains after having been shut down the previous day. In the second case a mains supply was substituted for an improperly covered storage tank. Drainage During the year 3,688 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 125 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 121 Combined Drainage Orders were made. In 2 cases, consent was given to the carrying out of work on the single stack system of drainage. L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1953—Part II Discharge of trade effluent into sewers. Empowers the London County Council and Borough Councils to control the volume and content of new or modified effluents proposed to be discharged from trade premises into sewers. 30 During 1959, 2 notifications were received concerning the proposed discharge of trade effluents. In both cases notices of proposed conditions were issued by this Council and no counter proposals were received. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year 38 complaints were received regarding smoke emissions and 386 observations were made. In most cases, it was found out the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Public Health Inspectors. The routine of making special observations from the roofs of four tall buildings was continued, and as in previous years these observations were helpful in checking the behaviour of boiler plant, especially in correction with plant installed in the many new buildings which have been erected. Most of the new installations however, are oil fired and consequently little trouble from s is experienced. Measurement of Deposited Matter and Sulphur Dioxide These forms of pollution are recorded each month by means of apparatus installed on the roof of the British Museum. The apparatus consists of a deposit gauge for collecting rainwater and deposited matter, and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere.

The apparatus consists mainly of an air pump which draws a known volume of air from outside and passes it through a white filter paper. The amount of smoke collected is estimated by comparing the stain on the paper with a calibrated scale of shades. The following recordings were obtained during 1959:— Concentration of smoke—milligrammes per cubic metre.

There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. 37 During the year six cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £94 12s. 6d. The total amount recovered during the year in respect of burials was £95 4s. 9d.

Arsenic in Food Regulations, 1959 These Regulations came into operation on the 10th August, 1959, and, subject to certain exceptions, make it an offence to sell food containing more than 1.0 part per million of arsenic. Fluorine in Food Regulations These Regulations, which came into operation on the 14th March, 1960, replace Fluorine in Food Order, 1947. They prescribe reduced maximum limits for the fluorine content of acidic phosphates used for food purposes and of foods containing acidic phosphates. Food Standards (Ice-Cream) Regulations, 1959 These Regulations came into operation on the 27th April, 1959, and replace the Food Standards (Ice-Cream) Order, 1953. They prescribe standards of composition for icecream, dairy ice-cream, milk ice and ice-cream containing fruit. The Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 These Regulations came into operation on the 27th April, 1959. They consolidate the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947 to 1952, and amend the provisions of those regulations relating to the pasteurisation, sterilisation, and low temperature storage of ice-cream and its ingredients. Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1959 As from 27th April, 1959, these Regulations amend the Labelling of Food Order, 1953, by the inclusion of new provisions relating to the labelling, marking and advertising of ice-cream. The Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 These Regulations, which came into operation on the 8th March, 1959, re-enact with amendments the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 to 1954. 38 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937-1959, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1959 are as follows:— Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 169 Factories without mechanical power 20 Outworkers registers 3 Outworkers' rooms 11 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 141 Factories Acts, 1937—1959 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with Section 128 (3) of the principal Act, with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII :— Part I of the Act 1.

"Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies.

Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 171 licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— Dealer's Licences Dealer's Supplementary Licences To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 28 23 To sell Pasteurised milk 41 23 To sell Sterilised milk 31 25 Milk—Bacteriological Examination During the year, 110 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. 42 of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and four to a Day Nursery. 45 Registration of Premises used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1959, two sets of premises were registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 120 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year 9 applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale of ice cream. One set of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and was removed from the register. At the end of the year, there were two registrations for manufacture, storage and sale, and 128 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.)
