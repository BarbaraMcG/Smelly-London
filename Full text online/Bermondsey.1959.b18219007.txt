Borough of Bermondsey ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Bermondsey. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Having taken over duties as your Acting Medical Officer of Health on Dr. Moss's appointment in April as Deputy Medical Officer of Health to the City of Leicester, it is my pleasure and privilege to present you with the Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1959. For easy reference, and comparative purposes, the report follows the pattern of those for previous years. Each section gives in some detail the vital statistics of the Borough and outlines the work carried out by your Health Department. I will, therefore, content myself by drawing your attention to some of the important features of the report and also to some of the difficulties which have caused us some concern during the year. Generally speaking, the health of the Borough was very satisfactory, and we experienced an exceptionally fine Summer from which everyone benefited. The death rate remained steady at around 11 per 1,000 persons. It is of interest to note that, of the 619 deaths recorded, 408 occurred in persons over 65 years of age. The principal causes of these 408 deaths were:— (1) Heart disease and diseases of the blood vessels 188 (2) Pneumonia and Bronchitis 87 (3) Malignant disease 65 (3) The infant mortality rate of 19 per 1,000 births was very good, being well below the average, and one of the lowest recorded rates for the Borough. There were no maternal deaths due to child-birth. The marriage rate, at 13.7, was again below the average for the past 10 years. This figure is somewhat similar to that for last year and may indicate the end of the post-war rise in the number of marriages. This may be of interest to the Council as a housing authority, but I hope the young people are not being deterred from marriage on account of housing shortage. The question of housing for young married couples is one that has caused me some concern during the year. Several of these people have been to see me and I found that, in one or two cases, the husband and wife had returned to live each with their own parents and this, of course, is a most abnormal mode of married life. Others, I found, were given a room in the home of in-laws but trouble began when children arrived as, in the cases I had to deal with, the in-laws were unwilling or unable to provide more accommodation and the crying or noise created by the children became a nuisance to the older people. These conditions led to constant friction and inter-family rows and squabbles, causing utter frustration and unhappiness for the young family. My chief concern is the likely psychological effect of these constant rows and unhappiness of the young father and mother on the children. To me these cases, which often affect three or more persons, are more urgent than many of the medical cases with which we have to deal. Apart from measles and dysentery, there were no epidemics of any serious infectious diseases. However, despite the vigilance of your Inspectors in the enforcement of food hygiene, there were 47 cases of food poisoning, a slight increase on the previous year. It must not be thought that food poisoning is always due to bad personal hygiene on the part of the preparers or handlers of food. In recent years it has been proved that it is the food itself which is infected and is frequently the cause of serious outbreaks of food poisoning. One has only to refer in this report to the results of sampling of certain foods by your Inspectors to find that a variety of imported foods contain harmful bacteria. It is only by constant sampling of imported foods and vigilance by the Food Inspectors that prevention and control of food poisoning is possible; hence the importance I attach to their duties at the many wharves in the Borough. One of the highlights of preventive medicine is the gradual decline in cases of tuberculosis and, owing to new methods of treatment, a great reduction in deaths from this cause has been effected. In the Borough there has been a reduction from 115 new cases in 1950 to 48 in 1959. The deaths have been reduced from 28 in 1950 to 4 in 1959. In my opinion, there are three basic principles for good public health, namely, pure, wholesome food to eat and drink; clean air to breathe; and good housing. The Council are very active in all three directions. Insofar as pure air is concerned, one smoke control area became operative in October 1958, and another area will become operative on 1st July 1960. It is planned to prepare areas so that a new one becomes operative each year until, eventually, the whole Borough will be smoke controlled. Last, but not least, I should like to comment briefly on services for the elderly. Embodied in this report will be found a full description of the survey of old people in the Borough, and the annual report of the Municipal Club and the Meals on Wheels Service. Respecting the survey, 2,721 old people have been visited and full particulars of their condition and needs have been obtained and filed. As the report shows, the work is an ever increasing one; some of the old people require two or three weekly visits; others are living in such satisfactory conditions that a six monthly or annual visit is all that is required. Judging from the reports by the three visitors now employed, it would appear that each can probably cope with a visiting list of 1,200 and, assuming that the total elderly population of the Borough is about 6,000, it is probable that more assistance will be necessary in the future. The Municipal Club and the occupational workshop are full to capacity and I feel there is need for another club, with its own kitchens, to be established in the Rotherhithe district. At some future date the Council will, no doubt, consider the practicability of this course. There is no doubt in my mind that there is still much to be done for the elderly. Much useful preventive work can be done to make their lives more pleasant, to keep them active and more self-reliant, and to prevent many of them becoming chronic bed cases. This can be accomplished by the co-operative action of preventive and curative medicine. As things are at present, the preventive side is within the province of the London County Council and I feel that the care and after care of the aged could well be delegated by the L.C.C. to the Borough Councils. The Borough Councils could then enlist the co-operation of the general prac-titioners in their districts and, together, establish a most useful and a much needed service. I would like to thank the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their tolerance and encouragement; I have been most happy and honoured to serve. I am also most grateful for all the help and advice I have received from the Chief Officers. To the Inspectorial and Administrative staffs my best thanks are due for their very willing co-operation, advice and loyal help without which my position would have been impossible. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. STOTT VITAL STATISTICS. AREA The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres.

There is also provision under the National Assistance (Amend-ment) Act, 1951. for a magistrate to order the emergency removal of such persons to a hospital or institution for a period not exceeding twenty-one days, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and a general medical practitioner that such action is necessary. During the year under report, it was necessary for the Council to make application for Committal Orders in respect of two old ladies, aged 96 and 82, both of whom resisted all efforts to persuade them to enter a Home for the Elderly voluntarily. It had become increasingly evident during the course of regular visits by the department's Welfare Assistants that these two old people were unable to care for themselves adequately. The former, who lived alone, was housebound and almost blind and, although the old lady, aged 82, resided with her son and was also regularly visited by her daughter who lived nearby, her condition, which was complicated by a confused mental state, deteriorated to such an extent that her son felt quite unable to cope. At the expiry of the statutory period of three weeks, both these old people agreed voluntarily to remain in the Homes to which they had been admitted. Fortunately, it is only in exceptional cases that application for compulsory removal is found to be necessary. During the course of the year, arrangements were also made for ten old people to be admitted to Homes for the Elderly which they had agreed to enter voluntarily. Section 50 Under the provisions of this section of the Act, it is the duty of the Borough Council to make arrangements for the burial or cremation of a person dying in the Borough where it is impossible to find relatives, or others, who would be prepared to accept responsibility for the funeral arrangements. The costs incurred by the Council in such cases, inclusive of administrative expenses, are, where appropriate, recoverable from the estate of the deceased At the request of the Coroner's Officer, arrangements were made for the burial of Mr. S. S., who died in furnished lodgings on 17th August, 1959. The request was made as a result of unsuccessful efforts by the police to trace his wife, from whom he had been living apart and who, it was believed, lived at Southend-on-Sea. The wife, who subsequently heard of her husband's death,afterwards contacted this department and, after the Council's expenses had been met, a small amount of cash and certain effects, the property of her late husband, were passed to her. During the year, one female and three male bodies were removed to the mortuary after recovery from the River Thames, all of them being identified by relatives or friends who made the funeral arrangements. The Council's removal charges were written off in one case to prevent financial hardship to the widowed sister of the deceased, and in another to avoid additional expense to the deceased's friends who, in the absence of known relatives, undertook the funeral arrangements. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT 1936, SECTION 122 Under the provisions of this section, the department removes and cleanses effects of persons where the Medical Officer considers that such action is necessary to prevent the spread of infection. During the year, visits were made to the homes of 31 old people who were senile, seriously ill or incontinent. There were quantities of soiled personal clothing and bedding in each case and it was necessary for these articles to be regularly collected for cleansing in the Disinfecting Station and returned to the owners. REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF THE SURVEY OF OLD PEOPLE During the past year 1,014 new cases have been found, which brings the total number of cases registered during the three years of the survey to 2,721. The figure for 1959 shows a marked increase over those for 1957 and 1958, which is, of course, due to the fact that the Committee have appointed temporary additional Welfare Assistants. It must be realised that the work entailed after finding these new cases is very often considerable and requires numerous revisits, and as the number of old people under surveillance grows, the amount of work and revisiting increases correspondingly.

The figures given by the Registrar General at the 1951 Census showed 2,245 males and 4,702 females, totalling 6,947, over twice as many women as men. The number of cases found to date shows three times as many women as men. Table II —Mobility One of the chief problems confronting old people is the question of getting about, doing housework, shopping, and various other social activities. With this in mind, each case has been put in one of three categories. It must be appreciated, however, that although a patient may commence the year as being fully mobile, he may, through various circumstances throughout the period of the survey, deteriorate and pass into the housebound, and eventually, bedbound category. Male Female Housebound Bedbound Housebound Bedbound Age Mobile Mobile 50—59 10 3 3 - 14 11 2 60—64 25 3 104 11 1 65—69 104 6 1 289 27 1 70—74 154 17 1 389 57 3 75—79 163 16 5 343 67 5 80—89 110 28 3 255 100 10 90+ 8 12 18 1 574 - 73 - 13 1,406 291 Total 23 Although the numbers in the housebound and bedbound categories may appear comparatively small, they are a very demanding group, needing more home-help, more nursing and more special services. Table III—Isolation The following table is of significance in that it refers to those old people living an isolated existence and, therefore, more open to the hazards that befall the elderly as they have to endeavour to fend for themselves whatever their disabilities and however inclement the weather, in order to exist. Some of these undoubtedly prefer an isolated existence; many, however, become lonely and depressed, and their standards of personal care deteriorate. A vicious circle then commences: they become afraid to expose themselves to public view and their self-respect is undermined. Frequent visiting of these is of the greatest importance, in order that, by establishing friendly relationships, it may be possible to build up the old personal confidence.

This, of course, can be expected; men who are living alone obviously require more attention than do women. The figures show clearly the increasing demands made by the old of both sexes as age advances. Further study of the comparative figures in each age group showing the extent to which the Home Help Service is utilised also substantiates the impression gained by field workers that those living alone are most in need of help.

Table VI —Housing It was felt to be worth while to discover the relative distribution of old people amongst different classes of property, and this is shown in the following table:— Male Female Age L.C.C. B.B.C. Private L.C.C. B.B.C. Private 50—59 2 7 7 3 13 11 60—64 2 9 17 10 31 75 65—69 4 30 77 24 102 191 70—74 10 55 107 30 120 299 75—79 10 61 113 26 133 256 80—89 13 48 80 25 127 213 90+ 2 1 5 3 4 24 211 406 121 43 530 1,069 At the outset of the survey, with the assistance of the Housing Director, a list was made of those old people living in Borough Council property and visiting of these was commenced. It is now felt that a good proportion of these have been located and, assuming the total number of old people living in the Borough to be around 7.000. it may be expected, as the survey continues, that the great majority of this number will be found to be occupying private accommodation. General During the past year alone, 5,781 visits have been made to elderly people by the Welfare Assistants, as follows:— Miss E. Collins (Jan.-Aug.) 1.531 Mr. W. White (Sept.-Dec.) 999 Mrs. P. Kirby 2,489 Mrs. M. V. Reynolds 423 Mrs. N. Witherden (Nov. & Dec.) 339 ; •::: 5,781 Already the Welfare Assistants are becoming known by the elderly people in their districts and this personal approach is doing a great deal to bring a feeling of confidence and security to them with the knowledge that there is still some person or persons waiting to help them, when required. This is further demonstrated by the fact that more than 120 specific requests for assistance were made on the prepaid postcards supplied to the old people for this purpose, apart from the number received by personal call at the department or via Home Helps, neighbours, etc. Municipal Club For a number of years, the Public Health Committee have been conscious of the ever increasing problem of the care of old people. Sufficient evidence was produced by the Welfare Assistants to show that, in addition to the Meals on Wheels service, there was need for a club which could provide hot mid-day meals to elderly persons who were not housebound and, therefore, did not come within the scope of the service. There were many individuals, living a solitary existence, who found that, apart from the expense in-volved, it had become too much of an effort to cook a daily meal for themselves and they had gradually adopted a regular diet of bread, margarine and tea. This is frequently the case when a man loses his wife and finds great difficulty in fending for himself. A diet of this kind rapidly causes deterioration in mind and body and, if not supplemented, often produces a condition from which there is little likelihood of recovery. Although the Borough is fortunate in that it has a number of voluntarily operated clubs which are an invaluable source of relaxation for old people it was obvious that, mainly because of the shortage of voluntary assistance, alternative methods would have to be adopted if a meals club were to be operated successfully, and the Council therefore considered the possibility of opening a Municipal Club under the provisions of Section 4 of the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937. Fortunately, at that time, certain accommodation in the Public Health Centre, Grange Road, was vacated by the Hospital Management Committee, which, from all points of view, was ideal for the purpose envisaged, and after the rooms had been decorated in varying pastel shades and suitable furniture and kitchen utensils purchased, a Club Leader was appointed and the Club officially opened by the Mayor on 15th May 1958 in the presence of Council members, welfare workers and club members. Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the subsequent reactions of members to the facilities provided at the Club were not anticipated. For instance, one large room was divided into fairly spacious cubicles and it was thought that these would be suitable for uninterrupted games of dominoes or cards, or even group gossip, but it soon became apparent that members preferred the community atmosphere of the main club room. This was also found to be true in the Workrooms where it was evident that employees preferred to work as one unit rather than in small groups. In view of this, the Public Health Committee gave authority for the cubicles to be dismantled and the accommodation used as an additional dining room as well as for social activities during the afternoon when the club is often full to capacity. Members are encouraged to assist as much as possible in running the Club. There is no shortage of volunteers to wash up, serve meals or prepare tea during the afternoon, and it is evident that they appreciate the fact that good quality plates, cruets, cutlery, etc., do much to enhance the enjoyment of a meal. In fact they are so anxious to help that some tact is needed when, at times, the number of willing helpers has, of necessity, to be reduced. Now that the Club has entered its second year, it is gratifying to note that enrolled membership has now risen to 350 and the average weekly attendance to 331. The number of meals provided daily has averaged 50 and the method of bulk supply, which was introduced as an experiment early in the year, has proved successful and enables individual tastes to be catered for to a greater degree than was previously possible. The Club's Anniversary on 15th May 1959 was celebrated with free refreshments and was also marked by the first Annual General Meeting, which was held during the afternoon, the Workrooms being closed early to afford everyone the opportunity to attend. Nearly 100 members were present; a committee was elected from amongst Club members and officers of the Council which has since proved a very successful step, for it is evident that the old people serving on the Committee do appreciate the fact that they have been given a certain amount of responsibility. A constitution was drawn up setting out the aims of the Club, which, in short, are "to promote and assist the general good of the members and to apply all monies received in furthering these objects", and it is worthy of note, as an indication of the extent to which these aims had already been achieved in the previous year, that not one complaint was received from a member in response to a request to them to make any complaints and put forward any recommendations for improvements. With regard to suggestions, however, many constructive ideas were put forward which, wherever possible have been acted upon. Further, the weekly programme of activities has been amended and supplemented in the light of the experience gained over the past year. It is worth noting a few of the suggestions which were received from members and which are now established and popular features of the Club's programme: Old Time Dancing Classes were commenced and have proved a source of great enjoyment to the old people. The numbers attending these classes reflect the enthusiasm with which they are received and, in fact, arrangements are in hand for an extension of the sessions at present allocated. Weekly whist drives were commenced, initially for a trial period until the reaction of members was ascertained, and have since grown in popularity to the extent that two further tables have been added to those originally operating. Several of the old people are quite expert players and they have coached the novices so that a uniformly high standard of play has been attained, and arrangements are to be made for matches with other Old People's Clubs. Other games which have been introduced and have proved very popular are Lotto and darts. A choir was formed and one of the Health Visitors, a qualified singer and pianist, offered her services in organising this and giving singing lessons. If this venture proves successful the choir will compete in the forthcoming season of the South East London Music Festival, which commenced in April 1960. Another way in which members were encouraged to help themselves was by the formation of a Savings Club. This has proved very welcome as it has enabled members to meet certain items of expenditure which occur from time to time and which are not always budgeted for. Members can pay what they like and withdraw their money whenever they wish. The old people are also encouraged to hold Bring and Buy sales and Raffles as a further means of raising money, either to swell the Club funds, or to be applied to meet the expense involved in a particular project. Several outings were arranged during the year, including the following. A trip to Hastings during May, in which 115 members participated. Girls from Fawcett House, Aylwin School, kindly contributed towards the cost of fruit and sweets, which were supplied free to members. In June a party from the Workrooms visited the Horley Women's Institute in Kent and had a very enjoyable day. An outing to Westrrham Women's Institute was arranged during July and the kindness and hospitality shown by the Institute's members made the day a very memorable one. Bognor was the resort chosen for the combined annual outing of the Club and Workrooms, which took place in August. The weather was perfect and contributed to a thoroughly enjoyable day. Through the generosity of various donors, it was possible to hand 8/- spending money to each member, and mineral refreshment on the journey was provided by another well-wisher. September was marked by a trip through the Kent Hopfields for 120 members, who were very interested at seeing some of the modern hop-stripping equipment in operation. The last coach outing was to Southend to view the illuminations and this proved a very enjoyable finale to the season. As part of the Winter programme of activities, trips to various West End theatres were organised, and in November a party attended Billy Smart's Circus at Clapham Common. In each case Club members were able to take advantage of considerably reduced seating prices. Arrangements have also been made with various companies supplying preserves and provisions for their products to be made available to the old people at specially reduced prices. A Harvest Festival was organised by the Headmistress of Laxon Secondary School and pupils were invited to bring gifts of tea and packed groceries which were kindly presented to the Club and which were greatly appreciated by everyone. Music for the Club is provided by relay wireless, the cost of installing which was generously donated by the girls of Fawcett House, Aylwin School, who have adopted the Club as part of their aim to assist local social activities. Three receivers are in operation and the service is much appreciated, particularly by employees in the Workrooms, who enjoy "Music While You Work" programmes. December 16th was the date chosen for the Club's Christmas Party, and approximately 170 sat down to tea. The Mayor very kindly accepted an invitation to the party and attended with the Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee and the Vice- Chairman of the Council for the Welfare of Old People. Carols were sung during tea by girls from the Aylwin School and entertainments during the evening included a concert party, Old Time Dancing, a sing-song and games, for which prizes were given. Each old person received a gift, and also a bag of fruit and sweets on leaving. The party was a great success and has prompted a request from Club members for a monthly social, to take the form of a whist drive followed by a tea and a social evening. The Club was open on Christmas Eve and. after the mid-day meal, there followed a sing-song and the distribution of sweets and groceries. The value of the Workrooms cannot, of course, be overemphasized. The benefits deriving from this project cannot be measured solely in terms of financial gain to the old people concerned (for, while, like nearly everyone else, they are not unappreciative of an increased income, shortage of money is not one of their main worries) but more from the feeling of well-being imparted by the knowledge that they are continuing to lead a purposeful and active life in the community. It is worthy of note that in certain cases members benefited to the extent that they were able to resume normal part-time work in a factory. Contracts undertaken for various organisations during the past year have provided work of a very varied nature, which has included the production of manilla folders and wallets, packing of confectionery, assembling of component parts for diving apparatus, production of braces, and packing goods for the Christmas Trade. It would not be practicable to record individually all the acts of generosity and donations of money and services made to the Club by various individuals and organisations during the past year, but for all these the gratitude and appreciation of Club members is recorded, and also for the continued interest in the activities of their Club, which means so much to them. The Council continued to act as agents for the Council for the Welfare of Old People in the operation of the Meals on Wheels Service and the Meals Service provided for the Municipal Club. The following table sets out the number of meals supplied monthly during the year. Meals on Municipal Wheels Club January 1,736 1,081 February 1,452 870 March 1,354 866 April 1,388 961 May 1,231 951 June 1,370 935 July 1,381 912 August 1,313 695 September 1,464 829 October 1,502 1,072 November 1,593 968 December 1,680 956 17,464 11,096 The Council also act as agents for the British Red Cross for the supply of sick room requisites. This appears to be a very satisfactory arrangement as immediate issues can be made from stock. Special aids and fireguards have also been obtained from the London County Council for the use of the physically handicapped. During the year wireless sets for the use of 29 homebound persons were obtained from the Society for the Provision of Wireless for the Homebound. Clothing, also, was provided for many old people throughout the year by the Women's Voluntary Service on the recommendation of the Department's Welfare Assistants.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH During the year one area was represented—the Barnham Street Dwellings Area —comprising 181 dwellings. The Borough Council completed 147 flats, 519 were in course of erection at the end of the year and plans for 629 were prepared or in course of preparation. 261 families from the waiting list, clearance areas etc. have been rehoused and 280 transfers and exchanges were arranged. This has resulted in 541 families being provided with improved accommodation by the Borough Council. 321 families were rehoused by the London County Council and 34 families were accommodated in new towns. 35 E.F.M. Bungalows were demolished during the year and 140 remain.

Arrangements were therefore made to sample all subsequent consignments of this commodity entering the borough and, to obviate the risk of contamination at the Port, it was agreed that all consignments be allowed to proceed direct to Cold Stores in Bermondsey before sampling. The following method of sampling was decided upon: One half per cent to be taken of consignments up to 200 packages. A proportionately lower percentage of consignments in excess of 200 packages. In the absence of a national bacteriological standard for imported prawns, it was decided at a meeting of the Food Investigation Committee in October that the following provisional standard could be applied: 1. Salmonella absent from 50 grams. 2. Plate count less than 250,000 in 80% of samples (2 days at 37°C) and less than 2,000,000 in all samples. 3. Faecal coli absent in 0.1 gram in 80% of samples and absent in 0.01 gram in all samples. In November a meeting was held at the Guildhall of all interested parties and it was agreed to adopt the following course of action consequent upon sampling:— Plate Count at 37°C: 250,000 Release 250,000-2,000,000 Further examination as to organisms present and importers to be warned. Staphylococcus aureus not to exceed 10,000 per gram. 2,000,000+ Condemn irrespective of organisms present. If further examination showed bad results, destruction agreed. Re-export not to be allowed, but destruction included release for animal feeding in this country. This standard was to apply to all imported prawns irrespective of origin. I consider this standard reasonable but thought that, in addition, Salmonella should be absent from 50 grams. I also felt that a slightly different standard should be made for cooked prawns, viz:— Salmonella should not be present in 50 grams and Staphylococcus aureus should be absent from 1 gram—I considered 10,000 per gram too high. By the end of the year a total of 49 samples had been taken in Bermondsey. No Salmonella organisms were isolated and, although coagulase positive staphylococci were found to be present in some samples, it could not be definitely stated that they would cause food poisoning. All consignments were accordingly released. Sampling of this commodity is continuing. SAMPLING OF EGG PRODUCTS 1959 Sampling of egg products to determine possible contamination by Salmonella organisms was continued during 1959. In order to obtain a punctual examination and rapid decision, the importers paid for a considerable number of samples to be examined. The method of sampling was by batch numbers (signifying packing dates and factories). Where a sample showed evidence of contamination the whole batch was placed under detention and later either re-exported or released for pasteurisation and high temperature baking. The main importations were of frozen whole egg of which the chief exporters were China, Australia and South Africa and laboratory results showed that 6.0% of the samples taken from these consignments contained Salmonellae. The total number of samples from all egg products found to be contaminated was 222 and the following table shows the type of contamination: — No. of samples Salmonella aberdeen 15 Salmonella anatum 11 Salmonella bareilly 1 Salmonella blockley 1 Salmonella bovis morbificans 7 Salmonella dublin 1 Salmonella enteritidis 1 Salmonella heidelberg 2 Salmonella heilbron 11 Salmonella hessarek 7 Salmonella infantis 3 Salmonella manhattan 1 Salmonella montevideo 1 Salmonella nachshonim 1 Salmonella newport 4 Salmonella poona 1 Salmonella potsdam 3 Salmonella senftenberg 1 Salmonella tennessee 2 Salmonella thompson 53 Salmonella typhi-murium 94 Unidentified Salmonella 1 222 IMPORTATION OF EGG PRODUCTS, 1959 Country of origin Type of Egg Product Quantity Imported (to nearest cwt.)

Legal proceedings were instituted in respect of two premises. In one case the summonses in respect of two infringements of the Regulations were adjourned "sine die" on payment of costs, the requirements of the Regulations having been met. In the other case a fine of £5 was imposed in respect of each of two infringements of the Regulations with £2 costs. "KILL THAT FLY" CAMPAIGN During the summer months an effort was made to publicise the necessity for keeping Hies away from food and of killing them by every means available. Posters were exhibited and leaflets distributed through the public libraries and the schools. Several schools were visited, particularly in areas affected by outbreaks of dysentery, films were shown and talks given to the pupils. (51) WORK OF THE WHARVES AND FOOD INSPECTORS, 1959.

GLUCOSE IN FOODSTUFFS. During the year a special investigation was made of foodstuffs which claimed the presence of glucose. The foods examined were soft drinks (5 samples), sugar confectionery (6 samples), and one sample of custard powder. There is a general misconception that glucose is a substance that is superior to any other form of sugar as a source of immediately available energy and manufacturers' advertising appears to encourage that view. In fact all types of sugar have approximately the same energy value i.e. 4 calories per gram. and all types of sugar are rapidly absorbed by the body. In this connection it is interesting to note the comments made by the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in their Report on Soft Drinks (1959): "Glucose beverages are at present widely advertised as a source of energy with the inference that they provide energy in a special form that is quickly and readily available to the body. If account is taken of the amounts likely to be consumed in a normal diet, no soft drink at present on the market can in our view be regarded as a sufficient source of carbohydrate to justify special claims relating to energy value. For this reason also it would be misleading to promote the sale of glucose beverages or any other soft drink by advertisements of a medical or pseudo-medical character based on recommendations from the medical and nursing professions or testimonials from individual purchasers." Pure glucose (dextrose monohydrate) is what its name impliesglucose and nothing else, but other substances added to foods under various names e.g. liquid glucose, corn syrup, hydrolised starch syrup, are the resultant products of the acid hydrolysis (i.e. splitting up) of starch and have a glucose content in the region of 20%-30% only. Common sugar—sucrose —occurs naturally in the sap of sugar cane and in sugar beet and on eating the stomach acid quickly converts the sugar into equal amounts of glucose and fructose (another sugar naturally present in fruit and honey) which is immediately available as a source of energy. This process is known as inversion and the resultant product as invert sugar. It will be seen therefore that glucose is either naturally present or can be added to food and drink by one of three main methods: (1) As pure glucose (2) As "liquid glucose" or "corn syrup" which contains a maximum of 30% glucose. (3) As invert sugar which contains equal amounts of glucose and fructose. Of the five samples of soft drinks examined 3 contained added "pure glucose" (25.4%, 8.8% and 2%) in a total glucose content of 32.3, 14.1 and 9.4 respectively, the remaining glucose being present as invert sugar. In the other two samples one contained 6.5% glucose obtained from invert sugar and "liquid glucose" and one contained 3.7% glucose obtained solely from "liquid glucose" or hydrolised starch syrup. (N.B. All figures weight in weight). In the case of the sugar confectionery, 5 samples were of the "boiled sweet" variety and contained glucose ranging from 4.1% to 8.7% derived from hydrolised starch syrup and invert sugar. In the other sample—one of toffee—the glucose content of 5.5% was derived solely from hydrolised starch syrup. Similar amounts of glucose would be expected in all boiled sugar sweets containing traces of acid (such as fruit drops). The one sample of custard claiming a glucose content contained 4.0%of glucose (dextrose monohydrate). The packet had the word "with added glucose" prominently displayed. This sample was sold in packets containing ¾ oz. custard powder and the label indicated that this was sufficient to make one pint of custard. The contents of one packet contained only 0.95 grams of glucose. A moderate size portion of custard made from this powder (one-sixth of a pint) would therefore contain only 0.14 gram of glucose. This quantity of glucose is insignificant as a source of energy or as a sweetener. The label may therefore be considered as misleading. The attention of the manufacturers was drawn to this misleading statement and a suitable alteration in labelling has been agreed. Generally the claims for glucose content were substantiated by analysis but the purchasing public should bear in mind two facts: (a) That "liquid glucose", "corn syrup" and hydrolised starch syrup normally have a glucose content of only 20%—30%. (b) That all sugars e.g. sucrose (common sugar) and glucose, are of equal calorific value and all are equally immediately available to the body as a source of energy.
