To: The Chairman and Members of the Feltham Urban District Council Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting for your consideration the Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your district for the year 1963. A scheme for free laundry service for incontinent persons was inaugurated with also loan of draw sheets in homes where insufficient sheets for a weekly laundry service were found. This is not a costly scheme, it was used at once and is a form of practical help to a household in this difficulty. The W.V.S. are to be thanked for undertaking the hemming of the sheets. The Council informed the Middlesex County Council that they would support proposals by the Middlesex County Council, that there should be addition of fluoride to water supplies in this district, after due consideration of the evidence. There have been no deaths from infectious diseases, if is now 13 years since a case of diphtheria was notified here. There were some unusual cases of interest concerning notifiable diseases—one concerned a suspected but unproven case of "malignant pustule"—a form of anthrax—in a man: he rapidly recovered with treatment. Another, a proven case of a pig's death from anthrax in an extensive piggery. Fortunately there were no secondary cases. The wellpublicised outbreak of typhoid fever in Zermatt, Switzerland, had a Feltham implication, as a shop owner, selling confectionery, contracted the disease there while on holiday. In spite of considerable delay in establishing the diagnosis, there were no secondary cases. This was certainly due to the high standard of hygiene conscientiously maintained in the toilet and hand washing facilities, and careful washing of utensils used for food and drink on these premises. This was all the more commendable in view of the very cramped quarters behind the shop. Later in the year school children and others travelling to the Continent on holiday were 3 advised to have prophylactic inoculation (T.A.B.). All school children in Middlesex schools going abroad were inoculated. There were eight cases of death due to suicide, the numbers of men and women being driven to this desperate end being equal. This is far more for 1963 than all the fatal road accidents, of which unhappily there were five. Every year there are more cases of death due to suicide and we need to ask ourselves whether, in this era of increased affluence and creature comforts, there is not more that the community could do to help these unfortunate people in our midst deprived of hope. Neighbourliness and genuine concern for their welfare can make all the difference. Detailed tables appear in this report concerning deaths from coronary disease and cancer of the lung, showing the age incidence and sex distribution. Also the causes of deaths of infants in the first year of life have been classified. Ten out of twenty such deaths occurred in the first 24 hours of life, and 16 before the end of the first week. The Mass X-ray service carried out a survey of the district in 1963 and during their time here visited factories and other sites where the general public could make use of their services. Whilst they were here 1,779 members of the general public and 5,848 members of organised groups were X-rayed. The results reported from the chest clinics were ten active tuberculous cases found, five further cases under observation and one case of cancer of the lung found. Once again. I have much pleasure in thanking the members of the Public Health Committee for their interest and enthusiasm. The staff of the department, particularly Mr. F. V. Bell, the Chief Public Health Inspector, have been most helpful. I have the honour to be. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, LOUISE A. MATHESON. Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS FOR THE AREA Area and Acreage (Bedfont, Feltham and Han worth) 4,925 acres Population 52,040 Number of inhabited dwellings 15,561 Number of new dwellings erected 331 The product of a penny rate £15,200 The rateable value £3,684,957 VITAL STATISTICS LIVE BIRTHS Total Male Female Legitimate 1,001 513 488 Illegitimate 44 27 17 Total 1,045 540 505 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated home population 20.08 Adjusted Live Birth Rate 18.27 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 4.21 STILL BIRTHS Total Male Female Legitimate 11 3 8 Illegitimate 1 1 — Total 12 4 8 INFANT DEATHS (under 1 year of age) Total Male Female Legitimate 21 12 9 Illegitimate — — — Total 21 12 9 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 11.35 Total Live and Still Births 1057 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 20.1 Legitimate Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 legitimate live births 20.97 Illegitimate Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 illegitimate live births nil NEO-NA TAL DEATHS (under fcur weeks of age) Total Male Female Legitimate 16 10 6 Illegitimate — — — Total ... 16 10 6 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 15.3 Early Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (under one week) per 1,000 live births 15.3 Perinatal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live and still births 26.5 Maternal Deaths (including abortion) nil Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 total live and still births nil 5 Infant Deaths Age Male Female Causes Total under 1 day 2 5 Prematurity 7 1 — Other Diseases 1 1 — Atelectasis 1 1 — Rhesus incompatibility 1 24 hours to under 1 week 1 1 Prematurity 2 Congenital malformation heart 2 2 — 1 — Other diseases 1 — 1 Mongol 1 1 week to 1 month — — — 1 month to 2 months 1 — Congenital malformation heart 1 2 months to 3 months — 1 Congenital malformation heart 1 3 months to 6 months — 1 Congenital malformation heart 1 — 1 Blood disease 1 6 months to 9 months _ _ 9 months to 1 year — — — 10 10 20 DEATHS Male 229 Female 210 Total 439 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population— Crude Death Rate 8.43 Comparability Factor 1.48 Adjusted Death Rate 12.47 Death Rate from pulmonary tuberculosis 0.1 Death Rate from cancer 1.79 Birth and Death Rates for England and Wales, 1963 Birth Rate 18.2 Still Birth Rate (per 1,000 live and still births) 17.3 Death Rate 12.2 Deaths under one year of age 20.9 Deaths under four weeks of age 14.2 Maternal causes, excluding abortion 0.22 Due to abortion 0.06 Total maternal mortality 0.28 6 Coronary Disease—1963 Age Male Female Total Under 30 — — — 30—35 — — — 36—40 1 1 2 41—45 2 — 2 46—50 — — — 51—55 1 — 1 56—60 12 — 12 61—65 11 3 14 66—70 9 5 14 71—75 5 6 11 76—80 4 6 10 81—85 3 5 8 86—90 2 1 3 50 27 77 Malignant Disease of the Lung, 1963 Age Male Female Total Under 30 — — — 30—40 —- — — 41—45 1 — 1 46—50 — 1 1 51—55 3 — 3 56—60 5 — 5 61—65 6 1 7 66—70 4 — 4 71—75 4 1 5 76—80 2 — 2 over 80 1 — 1 26 3 29 Table of Birth and Death Rates for previous 10 years Year ♦ Birth Rate * Death Rate + Still Birth Rate + Maternal Deaths + Infant Death Rate Under 1 yr.

There was one death from respiratory tuberculosis which was in the 45 to 64 age group. Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus and Poliomyelitis No cases of diphtheria occurred in the district during the year and it is now 13 years since a case was notified. There were no cases of paralytic poliomyelitis, and fifteen cases of whooping cough. Through the Health Authority, constant vigilance is kept upon school children upon entry and subsequently, to ensure that they receive "booster" protection of Diphtheria, Tetanus and Poliomyelitis. Maternal Mortality I am glad to say there were no maternal deaths this year. Maternity and Child Welfare and School Health Services The District forms part of Middlesex County Council Health Area 10. The health authority provide numerous sessions for ante-natal and post-natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services at the following clinics:— Cardinal Road, Feltham. Grove Crescent, Hanworth. Imperial Road, Bedfont. In addition a mobile clinic providing child welfare services visits on the Sparrow Farm Estate, the Wigley Road Estate and in Lower Feltham. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355-357 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. The Middlesex County Council provide chiropody sessions at their three clinics in the district. In the first instance priority is being given to the elderly people, the physically handicapped and nursing and expectant mothers. 10 Medical Examination of Council Employees The total number of medical interviews and examinations carried out during the year was seventy-eight. These consisted of thirty-seven for fitness for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, fifteen for Superannuation purposes and twenty-three for aged employees' fitness to continue working. Sewerage The vast majority of premises in the district are drained to public sewers which in turn discharge to the deep sewers of the West Middlesex Main Drainage Department, the sewage being dealt with at the Mogden Works by that Department. In connection with the High Street redevelopment now in progress provision has been made for an additional sewer and it is anticipated that this will be laid in 1964. This sewer will be capable of extension to meet the future requirements of the central area of Feltham. Water Analysis The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District were supplied by the South-West Suburban Water Company and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board and the water was derived from the River Thames. The SouthWest Suburban Water Company treated the water at their Staines works and 60 raw water and 832 treated water samples were taken for bacteriological examination. The latter number includes 12 check samples examined by the Counties Public Health Laboratories. A report on a typical sample is given in Table I. Fifty-one of the treated samples contained coliform bacteria but in the absence of E. coli, all were considered consistent with a wholesome supply. The Metropolitan Water Board stored the raw water in their Thames Valley reservoirs and filtered and chlorinated it at the Hampton, Ashford Common, Hanworth Road and Kempton Park Works. Samples of the treated water were taken at each of the works, 2,715 in all. Details of the average results obtained are given in Table II. The water supply was satisfactory both as regards to quantity and quality and it had no plumbo-solvent action. All houses in the area were supplied direct from the water mains. 11 I Typical Analysis of South-West Suburban Water Company's Supply (Parts per million) Appearance—Faint opalescence with a very slight deposit Turbidity—Microscopical examination—mineral matter less than 3 Colour 7 Odour nil pH 7.4 Free Carbon Dioxide 16 Electric Conductivity 560 Total Solids 390 Chlorine present as Chloride 34 Alkalinity as Calcium Carbonate 205 Hardness: Total 290 (Carbonate 205: Non-Carbonate 85) Nitrate Nitrogen 5.6 Nitrite Nitrogen absent Ammoniacal Nitrogen 0.005 Albuminoid Nitrogen 0.072 Oxygen Absorbed 0.80 Residual Chlorine 0.05 Metals—Iron, Zinc, Lead absent Copper 0.08 Anionic Synthetic Detergents as manoxol O.T. 0.4 Bacteriological No. of Colonies developing on Agar 1 day at 37°C 4 per ml.

A number however remained because their demolition would adversely affect still occupied houses. The activities of vandals and youths rendered these houses a source of further nuisance and potential danger to adjoining occupiers. A feature of the later stages of the programme has been the acquisition by the Council of a number of unfit properties, for the purpose of redeveloping the sites, without going through the formal condemnation procedure. Confirmation of the Railway Terrace Clearance Order (21 houses) was received at the beginning of the year. Progress during ihe year is summarised as follows: Houses reported to Public Health Committee as being unfit 8 Demolition Orders made 0 Closing Orders made 0 No. of houses in Clearance Areas declared ... 0 No. of houses in Clearance Orders or Compulsory Purchase Orders 0 Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 17(1) ... 35 Houses in clearance areas demolished 0 Houses closed under Sections 16(4), 17(1) and 35(1) 2 Houses closed under Sections 17(3) and 26 0 Parts of buildings closed under Section 18 0 Houses in respect of which agreements entered into with owners to repair or demolish 0 Total number of persons displaced 199 13 From 1946 until the end of 1963, 384 houses have been dealt with as follows:—- Demolition Orders made 254 Agreements entered into with owners to "close" or repair or Closing Orders made 39 Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal action including those in clearance areas 347 Houses in four Clearance Areas declared 91 Persons who have been displaced 1.170 Housing Repairs House-to-house inspections of the pre-1918 houses were continued as far as possible and action taken to remedy defects. It was found that increasing numbers of these • houses were becoming owner/occupied and that some had been renovated to a very good standard. Owner/occupation is probably the best solution to the problem of these structurally sound but outdated dwellings. There was still a shortage of builders and owners often had difficulty in finding one to enable them to comply with notices, as did owners or occupiers wishing to carry out improvements. Informal Action Number of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local Authority 85 Action under Statutory Powers Number of houses reported to Public Health Committee with a view to service of formal notices 25 Number of formal notices served 10 Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices (Sections 9 and 16):— (a) by owners 4 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 Housing Act, 1957 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Sections 9 and 16):— (a) by owners 3 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 14 Notices Served and Repairs or Improvements Effected Informal Statutory Public Health and Housing Acts 271 14 Food and Drugs Act 299 — Factories Act 42 — Shops Act ... 71 — Middlesex County Council Acts 18 — Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 11 — Clean Air Act 55 38 Others 2 — Dwellings and Elsewhere Food Premises Rooms or contents cleansed 150 40 Sanitary accommodation cleansed 3 17 Walls or ceilings repaired 32 61 Floors repaired or improved 12 33 Windows, doors or woodwork repaired 3 136 Stoves, grates, etc., repaired — 11 Ventilation improved 3 9 Lighting improved 3 3 Food Stores provided or improved — 14 Sanitary accommodation repaired or improved 46 108 Washing facilities provided or improved 65 26 Water Supply or Services improved or repaired 34 42 Dampness remedied 1 171 Damp-proof courses provided ... — 2 Roofs repaired or renewed — 32 Guttering and rain water pipes repaired or renewed 3 46 Paving repaired or renewed 1 3 Chimney stacks, sills, thresholds, brickwork, 95 etc., repaired or renewed ... — Drainage repaired or renewed ... 14 33 Drains cleansed ... 11 548 Dustbins provided or lenewed ... 10 8 62 Nuisances from accumulations abated 35 Nuisances from keeping of animals abated ... — 1 Nuisances from smoke, dust or odours abated 5 29 Nuisances from noise abated ... — 1 Defective equipment replaced ... 41 — Handling or display of foodstuffs improved ... 107 — (Adaptations and replacements in smoke-control areas are not included in this list) Standard Improvement Grants The House Purchase and Housing Act, 193?, as amended by the Housing Act, 1961, provides for the payment of grants of half the cost of installing the standard amenities, subject to prescribed maxima and depending upon the amenities already existing. The standard amenities are (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (b) a wash-hand basin; (c) a hot water supply; (d) an internal water closet and (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. During the year 67 applications 15 were received, 59 were approved and works of improvement were completed at 15 premises. Most of the improvements continued to be carried out by owner/occupiers but in one notable instance an owner had twelve of his houses improved. Following upon the pilot scheme, the circularising of details of the grants to owners and occupiers of the remaining older houses was authorised by the Council and commenced. Rent Act, 1957—Certificates of Disrepair Applications for Certificates of Disrepair and for the cancellation thereof were received and dealt with as set out below. No. of applications for certificates 4 No. of decisions not to issue certificates — No. of certificates issued 2 No. of undertakings given by landlords to remedy defects 1 No. of undertakings refused by local authority No. of applications for cancellation of certificates No. of certificates cancelled Overcrowding Three new cases of overcrowding came to the notice of the Department during the year and three were abated. Common Lodging Houses There are no common lodging houses in the district. Moveable Dwellings Since the operation of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, which is largely a planning measure and so far as the control of caravans is concerned supersedes the Public Health Act, the control of caravans has been exercised by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. There appeared to be but little trouble from itinerant caravan dwellers, compared with past years, apart from one colony which was eventually evicted by the owner of the land. Food Premises Inspections of all types of food premises were continued as regularly as possible, more frequent visits being made to premises where food was prepared. 16 There is a need for constant vigilance on the part of the inspector and of course of the management and everyone connected with the food trade. Often through carelessness or apathy undesirable methods creep in and food is exposed to unnecessary risk of contamination. Too often food handlers take the easy, slip-shod path; they are not alone in this, of course, but they have a special responsibility to the public and managements at all levels should be more alert to ensure the maintenance of the highest possible standards. Action by the inspector, other than admonition or advice, is often not possible because our legislation regarding food handling still largely relates malpractices to risk to health— something possibly suspected but impossible to prove. Shops The department administered the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, and all shops in the area were visited, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. Two licences, both renewals, were issued to keep pet shops. The occupiers of two shops were licensed to deal in game. The "late day" for the general closing hours of shops in the area was Friday, but usually shops were closed well before the permitted hours. Shopkeepers remained free to fix their own half-day closing, subject to the provisions of the Shops Act. Most shops close for the half-day on Wednesdays. A number of shops opened on Sundays and periodical inspections were made in connection with the limited range of articles permitted to be sold on those days with a view to ensuring so far as possible that the requirements of the Act were being observed. Food premises in the district consist of the following:— Catering establishments, including factory canteen and school kitchens 137 Grocery and provisions shops and "general stores" 70 Greengrocers' Shops 39 Butchers' Shops 26 Bakers' Shops 18 Milk Shops 13 Fishmongers' Shops 11 Sweet Confectionery Shops 51 17 Food Preparing Premises There were no new registrations during the year. The register contained the addresses of thirty-seven premises registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows:— Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc. 16 Premises used for the cooking of fish 12 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicles, etc., who are not the occupiers of open shops for the sale of foodstuffs are required to be registered with the local authority and any foodstores at which the foodstuff intended for sale are stored, are also required to be registered, but there is no requirement that a hawker shall have a food store. Broadly the local authority may only refuse registration if the public health is likely to be endangered or the proposed storage premises are considered unsuitable. Public Health control over hawkers' activities is not very effective but every endeavour is made to achieve and maintain a reasonable hygienic standard. A good deal of time is spent advising would-be new hawkers, who disappear from the scene within a month or two of registration. There is often a little crop of unregistered hawkers during the soft fruit and salad season. Eight new personal and one foodstore registrations were approved and four personal registrations were refused during the year. Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from fixed sites in any public street are required to hold licences under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. The licence of a street trader to sell fruit and vegetables in the district was renewed. Slaughter-houses There were no slaughter-houses or knackers yards in the district. In July 1960 the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food accepted the Council's slaughterhouse report and The Slaughter-houses (Hygiene) Regulations (Appointed Day No. 18 2) Order, 1960, and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations (Appointed Day No. 2) Order, 1960, came into operation in the district on 1st October, 1960. Inspection and Supervision of Food Carcase meat and offal was inspected at butchers' shop, catering establishments and elsewhere and 220 lbs. beef, 90 lbs. pork and 64 lbs. lamb was considered unfit for human consumption and surrendered. In addition, the following amounts of other foodstuffs were found to be unfit for human consumption: Bacon 172 lbs. Fish 197 lbs. Butter 83 lbs. Cheese 9 lbs. Ice Cream 367 packs Ice "lollies" 137 Tinned Foodstuffs Meat 433 lbs. Fruit 368 lbs. Fish 8 lbs. Vegetables 170 lbs. Milk 12 pt. tins Jam 31 lbs. Six complaints were made with regard to foreign matter in food and after investigation warnings were given in five cases. In the other proceedings under Section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, were taken against the bakers in respect of a piece of metal in a loaf. A fine of £10 with four guineas costs was imposed. Proceedings were also taken against another company under Food Hygiene (General) Regulations Nos. 6, 8, 16 and 23 in respect of the conditions found at one of their bakehouses. TTie company was fined a total of £74 with five guineas costs. Disposal of Condemned Food Where possible condemned foodstuffs were sent to a waste products factory, where they were processed for nonedible purposes. Foodstuffs which were not suitable for such disposal were buried at the Council's refuse tip. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the District and the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department has issued a report upon the action 19 taken by his Department in the County as a whole but has been unable, this year, to break down the figures so as to show the action actually taken in Feltham. The Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 One new distributor was registered and one ceased to trade. At the end of the year the register contained details of thirty-three distributors of milk and one dairy. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continued to receive regular attention. There were no registered manufacturers of ice cream in this area. There were no new registrations under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and at the end of the year the register contained details of thirty-six premises. Twenty-two samples of ice cream were taken and submitted to the Public Health Service Laboratory at Epsom. Fourteen were placed in provision grade 1, two in grade 2 and six in grade 3. The poor results in the last group, all from mobile vendors, were followed up and were mostly isolated cases. Proceedings were taken under Food Hygiene (General) Regulations Nos. 26 and 28 with respect to a mobile ice cream vendor and the operating company was fined a total of £60 and ten guineas costs. Clean Air The Feltham Urban District (No. 3) Smoke Control Order came into operation on 1st October, 1963. Under the three Orders, 2,305 acres are now smoke controlled and include 4,836 dwellings and 299 other premises. The Feltham Urban District (No. 4) Order was confirmed at the end of the year to come into operation on 1st October, 1964. The programme provides for a new smoke control order each year, embracing approximately 1,500 dwellings and for the whole district to have been included by 1969. Residents in the proposed Smoke Control Areas are kept fully informed by visits to each house, by letters and by the visits of the mobile exhibition of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, whose continued assistance I am glad to acknowledge. During the early part of the year, when solid fuel generally was difficult to obtain and there were delivery delays due to the severe weather conditions, there were many complaints of shortage of smokeless fuel. From investigations it appeared that some distributors were not offering 20 Gloco as an alternative to the almost unobtainable premium fuels, although customers were prepared to take any fuel and Gloco was available. In view of the fact that at that time the clean air programme for domestic premises basically depended upon Gloco and similar cokes for open tire fuel it is regrettable that some distributors were apparently so reluctant to handle these fuels. Since the cessation by the North Thames Gas Board of retail deliveries of Gloco more distributors took a little interest, but the position was not really satisfactory. Householders' difficulties, including higher expenditure on premium fuels, arising from the attitude of distributors towards Gloco, probably contributed in no small degree to the observable trend towards gas and electricity for heating. The Council was concerned about the position and were considering ways and means of helping residents in smoke control areas, including increased grants for alternative means of heating to the open tire when the Ministry of Housing and Local Government circular was received announcing the new grants designed to encourage just this. Pollution of the atmosphere by smoke from diesel engined vehicles continued and was a cause of increasing numbers of complaints from members of the public. Very few of these vehicles, it would seem, were able to operate, particularly in the lower gears, without emitting some smoke. The activities of the Ministry of Transport Inspectors were very welcome, as was the information that spot checks are to be increased, but this is still not sufficient. At any main road uphill section or at any urban traffic signal or obstruction, these vehicles could be seen emitting varying amounts of smoke. London Transport 'buses, too, were far from blameless. It is high time that engine and equipment manufacturers, servicing organisations and transport operators took effective steps to deal with this increasing nuisance. Noise Abatement The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, came into operation on 27th November, 1960. It provides that noise or vibration which is a nuisance shall be a statutory nuisance for the purposes of the Public Health Act. 1936, and restricts the operation on highways, etc., of loudspeakers. The use of loudspeakers by vendors of certain foodstuffs, for example, ice cream, is permitted, subject to conditions, between the hours of noon and seven o'clock in the evening. 21 A few noise complaints were investigated and dealt with informally, among these figured pumping equipment used by public works contractors to statutory undertakers, who are exempt from the operation of the Act, but cooperation in securing a reduction in the noise was usually forthcoming. Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was continued. The Council's refuse tip was kept under regular observation and any sign of rat activity dealt with immediately. It was not considered necessary to test bait the public sewers, in only one instance was there any suspicion of a sewer being involved and a section at a "dead end" was treated. Complaints received of infestations numbered 224 and these, together with cases discovered by members of the staff, involved the inspection of 709 premises. Rat infestations were found at 206 premises and mice infestations at 58 premises, 222 treatments were undertaken by the department, a further 49 being carried out by the occupiers. For treatments carried out by this Department on behalf of occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings was made in the case of private dwellings and the full cost of treatment was recovered in the case of business premises. In certain cases of hardship the standard charge was waived. Where the occupiers elected to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision was given to ensure that the treatment was effective. Rag, Flock and Other Filling Materials, Act, 1961 Two premises were registered under this Act at the beginning of the year and two inspections were made. Very little filling material was used at either of them. Disinfection and Disinfestation It was not found necessary to carry out disinfection after the occurrence of infectious disease. Two infestations of bed bugs came to the department's knowledge during the year at a private and Council house and both were dealt with by contact insecticide. Disinfestations for the eradication of other pests were carried out as follows:— Wasps 14 Cockroaches 1 Ants 1 22 Administration of the Factories Act, 1937 and 1959 Part 1 of the Act 1.

I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee and Dr. L. A. Matheson, the Medical Officer of Health, for the consideration shown to me and to express my thanks to the members of the staff for their able assistance in carrying out the work of the department.
