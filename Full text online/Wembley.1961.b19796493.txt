Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1961. This report has been compiled in the following five chapters, three with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services. Chapter I VITAL STATISTICS, Page 6, Statistical Appendix A, Pages 7—13. „ II GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES, Pages 14—17. „III INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Page 18, Statistical Appendix B, Pages 19—24. „ IV ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC., Pages 25—32, Statistical Appendix C, Pages 33—48. „ V ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Page 49. 5 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1961 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 124,980 and whilst this is considerably below 131,384 the census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. The census of April, 1961, reveals a provisional figure of 124,843. 2. In 1961 there were recorded 1,725 live births, giving a crude birth rate of 13.8 per thousand estimated population. The RegistrarGeneral has provided boroughs with a comparability factor for this calculation which takes into account the relative proportion of women of child bearing age in the total community. When this factor of 1.02 is applied the standardised birth rate bccomes 14.07, a more realistic figure, the origin of which, however, must be remembered when comparing it with past years. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 16.8 compares very favourably with the national rate of 21.4 per thousand and this is often used as a pointer to the adequacy of the services provided. This figure would have seemed quite unattainable a few years ago and indicates the advances in obstetrics and paediatrics which have become available in the district in recent years. 4. The number of deaths totalled 1,200, giving a crude death rate of 9.6 per thousand. The comparability factor when applied produces a standardised death rate of 11.04, again well below the national rate. 6 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital is administered by the Mount Vernon Group, and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the West Hendon Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included :— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 2381.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.)

Edgware Chest Clinic, Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 3406.) The provision of a new hospital at Northwick Park is still under discussion between the Ministry and the Regional Hospital Board. 2. AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (DRYden 0251) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES.

VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. No cases of infestation were discovered. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 5. MORTUARY. The Mortuary, situated at the rear of the Town Hall, received 242 bodies during the year. Reciprocal arrangements have been made with Harrow to cover absences of attendants due to holidays, sickness, etc. 17 CHAPTER III. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE. The Diseases of Animals Act of 1950, is administered by the County Council within the area of the Borough, and therefore when an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease occurred amongst cattle grazing on Hill Farm, Kingsbury, the notification of infection was given to that Authority. A Ministry of Agriculture officer, on visiting, confirmed the outbreak and ordered the slaughter of all cattle on the farm, followed by any necessary disinfection of the farm premises. The normal method of disposal of carcases in such circumstances is by burning or incineration, and permission to undertake this method of disposal was sought of the Health Department. On enquiry we were informed that 29 carcases were to be destroyed ; they would be soaked with some combustible oil and allowed to burn, and that the conflagration could be expected to continue for some seven to ten days. On learning the full circumstances, the Minister's Inspector at Hill Farm was advised that in an urban area this form of disposal could not be tolerated and must not occur. On account of the expense involved by other methods, this ruling was accepted with some reluctance, but ultimately a bulldozer was commissioned to excavate a large trench, wherein the carcases were deposited, treated with quick-lime and buried to a depth prescribed by the Inspector. This extra expenditure and difficulty was thought to be justified in view of the nuisance which undoubtedly would have been created had the carcases been incinerated on the site. 2. FOOD POISONING. The total of cases notified during the year was 4, but none of these was from outbreaks. It is certain that many sporadic cases occur which are not notified but equally probable that all major incidents are discovered and investigated. 3. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF IMMUNISATION. The Department continues to authenticate the International Certificates of Vaccination for travellers who have received inoculations from Wembley practitioners. During the year 1,084 certificates received attention in the Department. 18 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B. Monthly incidence of the Infectious Diseases. Disease. January February. March April. May. June.

When major events occur at the Stadium a substantial number of hawkers and street traders invariably attempt to pursue their calling in the neighbourhood of the Stadium, and the Department has felt for some time that those concerned with the vending of foodstuffs and ice cream should be subjected to strict control. During the year special visits were paid to the neighbourhood of the Stadium when important events were occurring, and a number of unsatisfactory traders were noted. On report to the Committee decisions were reached to prosecute, not only for failure to register as a hawker under the Middlesex County Council Act of 1950, but also under the Food Hygiene Regulations when appropriate. The effect of this is to secure a larger penalty in the event of a successful prosecution, and thereby to act as an increased deterrent to unsatisfactory hawkers of foodstuffs in the Borough. During the year three defendants were fined a total of £38 0s. Od. in respect of twenty-one convictions, and the Council, in addition, were awarded twenty guineas costs; eight cases presented to the Magistrates were dismissed. 2. SCHOOL SWIMMING POOLS. Increased interest in the year called for advice on standards requisite to the training pools which various schools in the Borough wish to provide for the tuition of pupils. It was felt that the time was long past for the fill/empty type of pool, and the advice given to the Borough Education Officer was that no pool could be approved unless proposals included an automatic mechanical pump for circulation of the water, and a reliable automatic chlorinator. Arrangements should include nominating some member of the staff, if possible trained in chemistry, to accept responsibility for the chlorination, purification and testing of the water. It would not be necessary for this staff member to undertake the work personally, but he could delegate the actual testing and chlorination to some individual on the domestic staff of the 25 school, or alternatively a senior pupil. Advice on siting, construction and management would be available from the Public Health Inspector, and arrangements made for a periodic testing of the quality of the water. 3. SAFE MILK. I am indebted to the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, for the following paragraph on milk. "Eight samples of raw milk were procured in your Borough and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. From the 1st January, 1961, the County Council became the licensing authority for the issue of licences to dealers with premises within its area and 46 licences were issued in respect of the sale of milk to which the special designations" pasteurised," "sterilised" and "tuberculin tested" could be applied. The period for which these licences were granted has been extended from one year to five years. Sixty-one samples of milk were obtained to test that heat treatment and subsequent storage were properly carried out. All were satisfactory. In addition, thirty-six samples of washed bottles were obtained from processing dairies in the Borough to check the efficiency of the cleansing plant used for milk bottles. The results were satisfactory. Fifty-six inspections of premises were made to ensure proper compliance with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960." 4. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 : Section 3. A dual obligation is imposed upon any person who installs a new furnace in industrial premises or a new furnace of an output greater than 55,000 British Thermal Units per hour in domestic premises, (a) to install only such a furnace which is, so far as practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of the type for which it was designed, and (b) to notify the local authority of his intention to install the furnace. 26 During the year the Health Department became aware, by notification or otherwise, of the installation of furnaces, which appear to meet the requirements of the section, in existing buildings as follows:— Oil fired. Gas fired. Solid fuel. Factories 9 1 1 Dwellings 43 31 1 Commercial premises 13 2 — In addition, three industrial incinerators of an approved type were installed and nine existing industrial furnaces converted to oil burning. Included in these conversions were six reverberatory furnaces which were previously fired by producer gas, a system which requires the utmost care in operation to minimise the emission of smoke and fumes. Prior to the changeover, early in the year, there had been a long history of complaint from the public and representations by this Department, to the Company, and it is pleasing to record that in the second half of the year there were no objectionable emissions. Section 10. When the deposited plans for the erection or extension of a building other than a dwelling, shop or office, include the provision of a chimney, the local authority must be satisfied that the height of the chimney will be sufficient to disperse adequately any smoke, grit, dust or gases emitted from it. During the year agreement was reached in respect of suitable heights for six new chimneys. Section 11. Wembley No. 1 (Barn Hill) Smoke Control Area. The year under review saw both the confirmation of the above Order by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and its coming into operation, and more than fourteen hundred buildings occupying nearly three hundred acres became subject to control. It is thought that as a result, more than seven hundred tons of raw 27 coal will no longer be inefficiently burnt in open domestic fireplaces, each year, and some eighteen tons less smoke will be emitted at comparatively low levels by house chimneys. In meeting claims for grant which were received for works of improvement to the heating arrangements at 341 houses in the area, the net cost to the Council was £813. Section 24 : Building Byelaw 115A. Appliances installed for heating and cooking in new buildings, must, in general, be capable of burning smokeless fuel. During the year, under the supervision of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Building Inspection Section, there were erected and equipped in accordance with this requirement:— Privately built dwellings 201 Council built dwellings 50 5. THE PETROLEUM REGULATION ACTS. Eight new underground petrol tanks of a total capacity of 22,000 gallons, were installed during the year, and all were approved after the twenty-four hour air pressure test at ten pounds per square inch had been applied to the satisfaction of the Inspectors. One tank of a capacity of 1,500 gallons was brought back into use for storing petrol after being used for diesel oil, and which, after cleansing, was subjected to an ullage test. It has long been a condition of licensing that upon the use of an underground tank being discontinued, the occupier of the premises must take steps to render the tank safe from the danger of fire or explosion. This requirement has also been reinforced by the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, Section 84, and latterly by the Public Health Act, 1961, Section 73. Where a disused tank is never likely to be brought back into use, by far the most satisfactory method of dealing with it is to remove it bodily from the ground, under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors, who will ensure that appropriate precautions against explosion will be observed during the process. 4 derelict tanks were treated in this way prior to redevelopment of the sites. 28 Alternatively, a tank may be made safe by being emptied completely and filled with weak concrete before being sealed over. As a temporary measure a disused tank can be emptied and filled with water and sealed. Two tanks were closed down in this way. Ten new pumps of approved pattern were installed during the year. Number of premises licensed to store petroleum spirit or mixtures 153 Aggregate amount of petroleum spirit and mixtures stored under licence (in gallons) 358,920 (Calcium carbide 20 £ tons) Number of visits of inspection made to premises 257 6. INFORMATION BOOKLET. Details of the community services and the social services provided locally, both by statutory and voluntary authorities, were collected and compiled into a booklet which was duplicated in the Department and distributed to those individuals and organisations within the area who may have need of the information. The booklet must have been found of value as it was most cordially accepted and we received in the Department numerous letters of congratulation and expressions of thanks for copies. 7. WATER SUPPLY. The piped water supply of the Borough is accepted largely from the mains of the Colne Valley Water Company and has remained satisfactory both in quantity and quality. A very small part of the southern end of the Borough is supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and this supply also has been of satisfactory quality and adequate quantity. In the last report comment was made on the success achieved by the Colne Valley Water Co. in reducing, over the years, the hardness of water supplied to the Borough. 29 I have included in this year's report a table showing the mean hardness figure for the past two years. Year January February March April May June July August September October November December 1960 174 178 196 204 195 189 171 179 166 182 219 218 1961 215 199 202 201 206 203 188 195 196 187 182 210 8. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. Two open-air public swimming baths are provided in the area and serve the general public during the summer period, usually from May to September. The Vale Farm Pool is 55 yards long and 25 yards wide with a maximum depth of 9 feet and has a capacity of 400,000 gallons of water which is obtained from the Colne Valley water supply. The Pool is constructed of mass concrete and lined with glazed bricks. The water is filtered through Candy Pressure Filters and has a complete change every 4½ hours, the circulation being effected by 20 h.p. pump with a stand-by 15 h.p. pump. "Breakpoint" chlorination is effected and an average consumption of approximately 3 lbs. per hour of chlorine. The water is then neutralised by the addition of soda which gives an approximate pH factor of 7.5 which indicates slight alkalinity. The bathing load is approximately 1,500 and the basket room system of changing is in operation with cubicles surrounding the Pool. A Cafe is provided for refreshments and the catering let out to a Caterer on an annual basis. The Kingsbury Pool is situated in Roe Green Park in the Kingsbury Road and has a length of 55 yards and a width of 25 yards with a maximum depth of 10 feet. The capacity is 464,000 gallons but in this case there is a foot trough surrounding the Pool and also a Children's paddling pool. The water is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and is circulated through Permutit Pressure Filters and pumped by means of two 15 h.p. pumps and a complete change of water is effected every five hours. Chlorination is again on the "breakpoint" system and the same dosage and neutralisation arrangements. The Pool at Kingsbury is constructed of reinforced concrete and again is lined with glazed bricks. The capacity of this Pool for bathing is approximately 2,000, but there is a greater spectator area here than at Vale Farm. The basket room system is 30 again in operation but in this case the changing accommodation cubicles are under the terraced seating. A Cafe is also provided at this Pool and catering is carried out by outside Caterers. Samples of the water taken from the Pools and subjected to bacteriological examination, revealed the absence of B. Coli in all samples and proved the quality of the water to be beyond reproach. 9. SEWERAGE. The growth of the population in Wembley and the increase in domestic and other premises, was very considerable during the years 1930/1960, and the intervention of a period when few works could be undertaken on account of wartime conditions resulted in the Borough being behind-hand in the provision of adequate drainage, both for the surface water and for soil sewage. The Council were very conscious of this difficulty and an extensive programme of sewerage construction received their approval. Details of the relief schemes are included and, at the completion of these, adequate drainage can be said to be provided throughout the Borough. Name. Type. Estimated Expenditure. Remarks. 1 North Kingsbury Scheme. Soil and Surface Water. £177,200 Commenced November, 1959. Completed June, 1961. 2. Weald stone Brook Improvement. (M.C.C.

The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three " Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 838 premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council and 4 premises were known to have been treated privately. 11. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Director of Public Cleansing has kindly supplied the following information :— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 29,465 tons. The separate collection of waste paper from business premises free of charge has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 755 tons. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant which has handled 30,952 tons. Salvage materials amounting to 3,656 tons were sold for £21,462. Street Cleansing. The system of street sweeping by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, each with an operator and four street orderlies, continues to give a frequency of sweeping of at least once every seven days. Public Conveniences. The increase in use of the free washing facilities at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough has been maintained during the year. 32 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

During the year your Medical Officers acted professionally for [he Council in performing 56 clinical examinations of actual or prospective staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This helps in securing a medically sound personnel for all the activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual incidence of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency difficult without such a service. The establishment of the Department during the year became complete for the first time in many years and our work consequently was facilitated by this full staffing. During the year Mr. G. A. Buckingham, Public Health Inspector, left the Department, and he was replaced by Mr. T. E. Parry in July. Mrs. Nixon, a Clerk in the Department, resigned her post, leaving in March, and she was replaced by Mrs. M. Mason in April. Mr. R. Marks secured an appointment with the Acton Borough Council in January, and he was replaced by Miss C. Merrison, Junior Clerk, in April. I regret to record the untimely death of Mr. C. P. Ryan, a Rodent Operative, who passed away in November, 1961 ; Mr. S. Evans transferred from the Department in December ; these two employees were replaced by Mr. R. Brown and Mr. G. Lean. The burden of work continues to be substantial and is increased by the inspections and administration involved in the application of the Clean Air legislation, and it affords me great satisfaction to record my appreciation of the loyal and enthusiastic endeavours of the whole of the staff during the year under review. I would finally express my thanks and gratitude to all members of the Council, particularly those members of the Health Committee who have taken an interest in the work of the Department and assisted our endeavours towards the health of the Borough. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health 49 Hendon Printing Works Limited 66, East Road, Burnt Oak Edgware, Middlesex Telephone: EDG. 6181
