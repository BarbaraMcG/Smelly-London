Fri 4 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH of FRIERN BARNET, FOR 1903. Printbd by G. J. Richardson, Alexandra Road, Colney Hatch Lane, Friern Barnet. 1904. to the CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of the FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1903. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Friern Barnet is situated in the London area, and is bounded on the north by East Barnet, on the east by Southgate, on the south by Hornsey, and on the west by Finchley. It comprises 1,303 acres 1 rood (including 149 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of the Colney Hatch Asylum), most of which is undulating ground, varying from 150 to 300 feet above sea level, the geological formation being London clay with here and there patches of gravel. The General Character of the District.—For the purposes of representation, statistics, &c., it is divided into three Wards —North, South and Central; and, in addition, Colney Hatch Asylum—situated between the Central and South Wards—is treated in my report as a separate Ward. The population is unevenly distributed: thus, in the North Ward a large partis pasture land, and the houses for the most part are of a higher rateable value, being detached and separated by a considerable distance from each other; and this obtains also in the West portion of the Central Ward. On the other hand, in the Eastern or Holly Park side 0f the Ward, the houses are in terraces and streets. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, the houses in the neighbourhood of New Southgate Station and the South-West part being of a superior character, whilst the remainder are the usual six-roomed houses, inhabited in many cases by more than one family. The population in 1881 was 4,405 ; in 1891, 6,716; and in 1901, 8,816; the average number of persons per house being respectively 6.o1 and 5.6, as estimated from figures supplied from the Census Office, by the Registrar General. 2 TABLE 1.—FOR THE WHOLE DISTRICT OF FRIERN BARNET.

FRANK A. SPREAT, D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. January 22nd, 1904. 6 The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was (294—103)= 191. Houses— Wards. North. South. Central. Occupied 336 721 629 = 1686 Unoccupied 14 70 60 = 144 Mortality (see Tables 1, 2 and 4.) There were 103 deaths registered in the District, giving a death-rate of 10.9. Eight deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it, and 1 death in the District of a person not belonging to it, giving a net total of no, equal to a death-rate of 11 6. The following is a table comparing the number of houses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth-rate, deaths and death-rate, since 1885. This gives a good idea of the growth and health of this District during that period. Year. Houses. Population. Births. Birth-rate. Deaths. Death.rate. Occupied.

Measles provided nearly half the deaths, Whooping Cough and Enteric Fever two each, while Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria are absent from the list. 7 Asylum Fire. The reason that the number of deaths in the Asylum is considerably above the average, although the population has decreased, is that si female inmates lost their lives in the disastrous fire on January 27, The building known as the Annexe was completely destroyed. The Middlesex Coroner held an inquest on January 30, February 5 and February 12, With regard to the above Building, no Plans were submitted to your Council, the premises being exempt under the Bye-Laws. The Zymotic Death-rate in previous years was— 1884 2.1 1890 1.6 1896 1.5 1885 1.2 1891 1.5 1897 2.5 1886 2.7 1892 1.0 1898 1.9 1887 o.8 1893 2.3 1899 2.5 1888 1.5 1894 1.6 1900 0.5 1889 0.7 1895 0.9 1901 1.8 Births (see Table 1). These numbered 294, giving a Birth-rate of 31.1, being an increase of i'6 per thousand. Measles. This disease was first added to the list of notifiable diseases in 1894, and the regulation was renewed in 1900. Although there were 150 cases during the year, and the deaths from this disease practically equalled those from all other zymotic diseases, yet it has been decided that notification shall no longer be in force. The average annual cost was £19, The following are the numbers for the last seven years. 1897 273 1900 ... 15 1898 142 1901 ... 292 1899 19 1902 ... 186 1903 ... 150 Whooping Cough Was less prevalent than it was last year, causing only two deaths—one in each of the North and South Wards. Chicken Pox. There were a few cases this year. I have, on two occasions, suggested that this disease should be made notifiable when Small Pox is at all prevalent and threatening our District. Diphtheria. There were 30 cases without a death. A decidedly larger number than usual were removed to Hospital for treatment. 8 Influenza Has occurred in a modified form. There has been only one death. Towards the end of December there were signs of an impending outbreak. Typhoid. There were 14 cases notified, viz., 8 in the Asylum and 6 in the District. In the former there were in, 1902, 2 cases and 1 death; in 1901, 20 cases and 4 deaths; and in 1900, 3 cases with no death. The water supply of the Asylum has been thoroughly investigated. Scarlet Fever. There were 37 cases, viz., North Ward, 4; South, 8; Central, 24 ; and Asylum, 1. Of these, 19 were removed to an Isolation Hospital. This is a much larger proportion than was the case last year. Diarrhcea The number of deaths from this disease is still small, viz., 5, as compared with 4, 3, 5 and 20 in the preceding four years. Collitis. There were 15 deaths—all in the Asylum, and all in women. The average for the last three years is 22. Tuberculosis. From this cause there were 56 deaths during the year, 43 of which were in the Asylum. In 1900, there were 32 deaths ; in 1901, 24; in 1902, 51, so that there is still an increase, Although it is true to say that the increase is in part only apparent, being due to more correct classification of the cause of death ; yet it is to be hoped that the Asylum Authorities will make increased provision for open-air treatment. Disinfection is carried out, when possible, in all cases of removal and death from this disease, The following are, as far as can be obtained, the number of deaths per year since 1892— 1892 . 16 1895 . 6 1898 . 13 1901 . 24 1893 . 16 1896 . 19 1899 . 14 1902 . 42 1894 . 12 1897 . 9 1900 . 32 1903 , 56 9 Small-pox No cases occurred. I was notified of a "contact," who was engaged in the Meat Market. I visited his house, put the household in quarantine as far as possible, and offered every facility for vaccination, disinfection, etc., with the result that there was no further trouble. The arrangements concluded in 1898 for the reception of cases of small pox at South Mimms Hospital are still in operation. Several conferences have been held by Local Authorities, with the view of providing accommodation by acquiring the South Mimms Hospital. Friern Barnet decided not to unite with the Joint Committee. Below is a Table of Infectious Diseases, arranged to show the number of cases of each occurring in each month Month. Total. Measles Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric. Erysipelas. Puerperal Fever.

The District not being provided with an Isolation Hospital, beds are procured when possible from the surrounding authorities, Enfield, Hornsey, Southgate and Hendon. I have again to point out that with the increase of the population, not only of Friern Barnet but of the surrounding districts, the want of definite accommodation will be felt more and more. At times there is delay and great difficulty in getting beds, A very much larger proportion of cases of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever have been removed this year at the request of the relatives. This shews an increasing desire on the part of the residents of the District to have their infectious sick treated at an Isolation Hospital. 10 Ambulance. The District does not yet possess an Ambulance, but satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Finchley District Council Authority for the hire of their conveyance. Mortuary. The Finchley District Council have an excellent Mortuary, & short distance from Friern Barnet West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Means Taken to Prevent the Spread of Infectious Disease. On the receipt of information respecting infectious cases, the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given, and disinfectants for immediate use are supplied at the expense of the Authority. Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and where accepted is carried out, an undertaking being obtained, where possible, for at least a portion ,of the maintenance of the patient while in the hospital. After the recovery or removal of an infectious case, disinfection is performed, and cleaning and stripping orders are served where necessary. Clothes, bedding, etc., are removed to Finchley, where they are put through the steam disinfector. Antitoxin is now supplied free to medical men for use in cases of Diphtheria occurring in the District. A circular letter was sent to those benefiting by this arrangement, requesting a statement as to the mode of administration, stage of the disease, quantity used, number of the Serum, age of patient, and results obtained, for the purpose of gaining useful statistical information, " Cleansing of Persons " Act, Under the Provisions of the above Act steps were taken in regard to two families, SEWAGE WORKS. Situation of the Works.—The Sewage Works are situated on the south side of the District (in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brook into which the effluent flows. The original Works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M. Inst. C.E., and were executed under his direction. The working of the tanks and original filters have been altered and improved and three new Bacteria Beds have been constructed, under the superintendence of Mr. E. J. II Reynolds, Assoc. M. Inst. C.E., the Surveyor to the Council, from plans made by him. The method of treatment is as follows:— The Sewage, which enters the Works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton Lime, equal to 4 grains per gallon, is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. It then receives aluminoferric to the extent of one grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing through a salmon ladder, and in this condition flows into settling tanks, of which there are three, each having a capacity of 70 000 gallons. A fourth tank has been added, and is practically complete. These tanks are divided by concrete walls, on which is an open channel, divided by sluice doors, so that either one, two, three or four tanks can be worked at a time and alternately as required. The overflow from the tanks first passes through coke screens into an open channel, then on to first contact Bacteria Beds and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. EARTH CLOSETS. Four in the District, on isolated premises. The earth closets at Hales's, Sydney Road, have been removed. PUBLIC URINALS. All these in the District have been reconstructed, SEWERAGE. The Roads in the District have separate drains for storm water, most of the houses having the dual system of drainage. Sewers have been laid in Myddleton Park, Balfour Grove, portions of Holly Park Road, and surface-water sewer in Pembroke Road, and an additional 18-inch outfall sewer from the Sewage Works to Cromwell Road. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. The system of shaft ventilators is being extended to the whole of the District. REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. This is undertaken by the Council, through the Surveyor's Department, the collections being regularly carried out by means of covered improved dust carts. Iron dustbins are required in place of the unsanitary brick and wooden receptacles, which in many cases were attached to the houses. The refuse is chiefly taken on to the Sewage Farm. 12 THE SUPERVISION OF HOUSES. All new houses should be certified before habitation, and are required to conform to the Bye-laws, with regard to site, open space, etc. The refuse from dust-bins is not allowed to be sifted and used for building purposes in place of sand. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. The Committee have not been able to recommend the erection of Workmen's Dwellings, owing to the high prices asked for suitable sites. LIGHT RAILWAYS. The Board of Trade have confirmed the order authorising the construction of a Light Railway through the District, which will be connected with the line from Wood Green and run from the Station Road to the " Orange Tree," and thence to Finchley. The electric cables are already laid. ELECTRIC-LIGHTING ORDER. A Provisional Order has been obtained, for which the Board of Trade have extended the time for carrying out the Order. PRIVATE ROADS. Various roads are under the consideration of the Council, for the purpose of making them up, under Section 150 of the Public Health Act. NEW ROADS. Plans for new roads have been approved by the District Council—Myddleton Park (from Oakleigh Road to Friern Lane) and Balfour Grove. WATER SUPPLY.—BARNET WATER CO. & INTERMITTENT SUPPLY. The question of a constant supply is still receiving the attention of the Council. The Company are introducing into Parliament a Bill to give them further powers and increase the capital of the Company, LIGHTING. The Colney Hatch Gas Company are applying to Parliament for further powers and to increase the capital of the Company. With regard to the above-mentioned Bills, I understand that the Council will petition against the same with the view of certain clauses being inserted for more effectually safeguarding the interests of the District. FIRE. The Council have under consideration the purchase of an Engine and formation of a Fire Brigade. Hydrants and the supply of water in case of fire have been under the consideration of the Council. Fire appliances have been ordered and the following hydrants have been provided and fixed, viz., 13 NO. ON PLAN Locality. ion. 1 Friern Barnet Road Opposite the Prion' •» Do.

I Friern Lane (Boys). 2, St. Peter's, Cromwell Road. 3, St. John's, Glenthorne Road. 4, All Saints'. 5, St. Paul's. All Saints'.—The ventilation of this School has been improved. I have drawn the attention of the Council and School Authorities to the want of paper in the water closets, as I consider this is highly necessary. The experiment, as I mentioned last year, of a supply being provided has been tried at All Saints' School and has proved satisfactory. The Schools have been inspected frequently and have been found in good order. In some instances I have pointed out to the teachers the desirability of making more use of the means of ventilation provided. ADULTERATION OF FOOD. Attention has been given to this subject, particularly with regard to the small general shops, which have been inspected frequently. I have inspected and reported upon the following :— Athenaeum Road, Friern Lane, High Road, Whetstone; Pembroke Road, Cromwell Road, Sydney Road, The Avenue.
