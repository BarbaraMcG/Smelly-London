POTTER. 6 To the Chairman and Members of the Orpington Urban District Council Ladies and Gentlemen, In submitting to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1952, I have followed very much on the lines of the previous years and in accordance with the direction of the Ministry of Health Circular 2/53o Delay in its issue is regrettable but unavoidable mainly because the Registrar General's statistics were not received until the end of May. It was not until then that the work on the report could really begin. It could not be produced at all without good team work of each member of the Department throughout each day of the year. This is the nineteenth report since Orpington became an Urban District, since which time it has become one of the important and progressive dormitory towns for London with a population of 63,670 mid-year 1952. But it is not upon population that a town can be judged. In considering its vital statistics one must have in the background a knowledge of its age distribution and this - in spite of the census of 1951 - we have not yet received in detail but we do know that 11% of Orpington population is of the age group of over 65 years and 25% is of the age group 0-15 years. The birth rate in 1952 was 14.7 per 1,000 population and the death rate 8.9 per 1,000 population. The infant death rate was 18.2 per 1,000 live births and, if still births are included, it shows the loss of 36 lives in every 1,000 births. These figures mean little to the general public but are made significant when compared with other areas with like population and like age groupingo It follows that with a high child population and the absence of killing diseases of childhood, and both of these conditions apply to Orpington, the death rate of the population will be low, i.e. 8.9 per 1, 000 population compared with 11.3 for England and Wales. It is from the (detailed knowledge of such vital statistics of a town that one can judge the direction in which Health is proceeding and to judge what services are needed to control illness in order to maintain or improve this Healtho We know that the killing diseases of childhood have today fortunately a low incidence, seven children between one year and 15 years dying in 1952. If 7 diphtheria and like diseases had not been controlled during recent years, these figures would have been doubled or trebled. The present high costs of the National Health Service demand that prevention of disease must once again have priority in our scheme of things. One of the factors that make for prevention of illness and chronic incapacity is early diagnosis. This cannot be more definitely demonstrated than in the case of tuberculous infection of the lungs. If diagnosis and treatment are early, cure is almost certain, and there will be saving of hospital costs and of much illness and distress. This is true economy. One of the easiest and earliest methods of early detection of tuberculosis, and of many other diseases of the lungs, such as cancer, is that of Mass X-ray. This service therefore should be extended so that the whole population may be examined at least once in two years. The last time the unit visited Orpington in 1951 the rate of unsuspected tuberculosis of the lungs was as high as seven per 1,000 population. The report shows the detailed work of the department and the efficiency with which each individual Sanitary Inspector carries out his important and varied duties. It shows also the comparative absence of notifiable infectious diseases, except measles and whooping cough which remain mild in type but wide in extent. The control of food hygiene is proving effective and with the aid of all food handlers we have avoided any outbreak of food poisoning. The housing problem is on the way to solution but there is still much to be done in the bringing of old houses to modern standards. There are 2,700 households without exclusive use of fixed bath. That we live in times of social change is obvious to any observer. The bureaucratic way of life is increasing! so are the luxury and beautifying trades as a means of employment of the young female. Any observer at a railway station at the time of home arrival will note the stress and strain apparent as part of this social change. We know these facts. we know of the increase in the psychosomatic diseases, or rather should I say in the practices dealing with these diseases, but there appears to be little we can do about it. Health and social habits are so closely related one to the other that I believe if Public Health policy is moulded to avoid bureaucracy and to encourage independent family life we shall be doing something to maintain the greatness of our country. What are some of the successes in 1952: one was the continued reduction of the tuberculosis death rate another 8 the absence of infectious diseases as a cause of death, the continued absence of diphtheria and mildness of scarlet fever: another the improvement in the housing problem and the progressive abolition of cesspool drainage - the latter figure reached a record number of 81 conversions in one year. At this rate of progress, in four years all cesspools in sewered areas will have been abolished,, That will be the first completed step in the destruction of a potential danger to water supply. The next step should be the extension of sewers into built up areas as and when financial restrictions are lifted. Finally,, in this short letter of introduction to the report, I would express to the members of the Council and especially the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee. my appreciation of their support in making the Public Health Services worthy of Orpington: to my local government colleagues inside and outside the department, and to Mr, Crowe in particular, my deep acknowledgment of help and co-operation. I am, Your obedient Servant June. 1953. K.E. TAPPER. Medical Officer of Health. SECTION A VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OP THE AREA. 10 SECTION A.

The average rate for the past ten years is 25.1. The 1952 rate for England and Wales was 27.6 per 1,000 related live births, and 23.8 per 1,000 live births for London Administrative County. Not included in the above statistics are 17 cases which were stillborn. 15 Unemp1oyment I am indebted to the Manager of the Local Employment Exchange for the following information in respect of the year 1952:- "The year opened with the unemployment position being very similar to the previous year and a steady rise in the figures was noted during the first quarter due mainly to a falling off in demand for the Building Industry and on the Women's side the increase was in the over 40 age groups, mainly persons who had been employed in sedentary occupations. The second quarter saw a general resumption in labour requirements in Building and local factories and the Distributive Trades although the unemployment figures remained slightly above the previous year's corresponding period. After June, the labour position began to settle down again and the Building Industry and local factories demands fell off and there was some redundancy in certain Light Engineering work, but this was partly offset by the needs of new factories for young women and the unemployment register mainly consisted of the higher age groups and persons limited in their scope by physical disability or age. The final quarter began with a continuation of this steadying in local requirements but a welcome increase in the Building Industry demands and the gradual building up of new factory staffs improved the position whilst the approach of the Christmas season called for more workers at the Post Office and the retail distributive trades. Over the past few months, however, unemployment figures have followed the national trend of increasing due partly to the steadying effect of growing competition for overseas markets and the decrease in imports of the Commonwealth Countries, but there is sound reason for hoping that the New Year will show a gradual but definite improvement," Open Air Recreational Amenities I have again inserted in the schedule at the end of the report a list of parks and open spaces, I have done this because the excellent provision by the Local Authority is important factor in the promotion of health of body and mind of the inhabitants, provided full use is made of the facilities. SECTION B GENERAL PROVISION OP HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. 17 SECTION B GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. These services are rendered by four distinct and separate bodies:- (1) The Council through its Public Health Department. (2) The two Hospital Management Committees. (3) The Kent County Council under Part III of the National Health Service Act 1946. (4) Voluntary Agencies. An outline of these services is given in the following pages and a further distinction may be noted in the fact that whereas the services rendered by the three last named bodies are almost wholly of a personal nature, the Local Authority" s Health Department is concerned chiefly with the elimination of those factors which influence the health and general well- being of the individual such as bad housing or working conditions and the condemnation of unwholesome food and drink. It will be seen, therefore, by applying the adage that prevention is better than cure" the size of the burden placed on the personal health services is dependent to some extent on the success of the Local Authority's work in environmental sanitation and food hygiene. 1. Public Health Services Rends red By the Council The major services of the Public Health Department, to which detailed reference is made under Sections C. D. E. P. G. and J of this report are as follow:- Enquiries into Complaints and the abatement of Nuisances. Infectious Diseases (Prevention and Notification) Inspection of Pood and Pood Premises,, Inspection and Examination of Water and Milk Supplies. 18 Inspection of Factories and Shops. Refuse Collection and Disposal. Housing. Rodent Control. Atmospheric Pollution. Health Education and all matters covered by the general heading of Sanitary and Environmental Services. The number of complaints received from residents during the year was three hundred and two, a little higher than in 1951. but once again the persuasive ability and tact of the Inspectors is reflected in the fact that it was necessary only in four cases to have recourse to formal action to secure an abatement of the nuisance. In the Appendices is a summary of the work of the Health Department, 2. Services Rendered By Hospital Boards. (a) Farnborough Hospital. Provides; a general hospital service and has 812 beds. This hospital is controlled by the Bromley Group Hospital Management Committee. (b) Orpington Hospitalo Provides a general hospital service and has 983 beds, and comes within the Orpington and Sevenoaks Group. (c) Chest Clinic. There is no chest clinic within the area, all patients being referred to the Bromley Chest Clinic, which is controlled by the Bromley Group Hospital Management Committee. Public Mortuary.

Women's Welfare Clinics These Clinics are held in various parts of the district and full details are given above. Patients attending these clinics are referred on medical grounds and are seen by appointment Day Nurseries There is one Day Nursery in the area, at Scad's Hill House, Orpington, and has provision for 70 children. Applications for admission of children to this Nursery are made direct to the matron Domestic Help Service Demands for this service are still heavy, especially for cases of illness in the home and for old people. The following is a summary of the cases assisted in Orpington during the year 1952:- Type Of Case No. of Cases receiving Serice at 1.1.52 No. Of Cases commenced during 1952 Total Cases having received service during 1952 Maternity 5 75 80 Tuberculosis 23 13 36 Aged 50 86 136 Others 22 155 177 100 329 429 22 Number of part-time Domestic Helpers employed throughout the year 74 Average number employed each week 45 Venereal Diseases No centre is provided within the Urban District for the treatment of these diseases.

This is now a Regional Hospital Board Service, Laboratory Service There has been no change in this service during the year. Routine medical and Food and Drugs samples are forwarded to the County Laboratory at Maidstone, and details appear later in this report. Diseases of Animals ActSo The County Council have an Officer stationed in Orpington who carries out the functions of this service. 4 Services Rendered By Voluntary Agencies Medical Loan Depots There is one loan depot in this district where a full range of nursing requisites is held® Except in cases of hardship a charge is made of threepence per week per art^ icle. Applications should be made to:- Mrs. M. M„ Jones, 39 Willett Way, Petts Wood. (Orpington 2083) Prom the number of applications received during 1952 (between 80 and 100) it is evident that good use is made of this very useful service* Meals on Wheels Service These meals are available to all old and infirm people whose circumstances justify a weekly visit by the W,V.S. The meals are cooked at the W. V„ S. headquarters (The Rookery, St0 Mary Cray) and delivered, every Thursday, to 23 approximately eighty old people, nearly four times the weekly number visited in the Autumn of 1950, when the service was first organised. The meal costs l/« and consists of meat, 2 vegetables and a pudding, Orpington and District Tuberculosis Care Committeeo The Sto John Ambulance Brigadeo Orpington Old People's Welfare Committeeo Old People's Clubso These have been reported upon fully in previous reports, and they are continuing to do very valuable work in the care of the sick and aged„ SECTION C SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES 25 SECTION C SAN0TARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CDRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply I am indebted to the Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, for the following statement and also for the details of analysis of water supplies, which are set out in Table XII of the Appendix, The supply to the district of Orpington has been adequate at all times during 1952 and is derived from seven wells, namely, Orpington, North Orpington, Jewels Wood, Sundridge, Eynsford, Shortlands and Bexley. Bacteriological analyses of these wells are made five times a week and consistently satisfactory results have been obtained* Chemical analyses of well supplies are also made at regular intervals0 All supplies are treated with chlorine on the works, but any excess remaining after a period of contact is re° moved completely or reduced to an amount that will not be perceptible to the consumers. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlor° ine before being restored to supply and samples of water from them are analysed to establish that the water in them is up to the normal standard of water in the distribution system. Norfeof the supplies is plumbo-solvent. We have no information with regard to the proportion of the total number of dwelling houses and population in Orpington which are supplied from the above mentioned sources, AH the houses are supplied directly and not by means of stand pipes,/' The following information has been supplied by the Clerk to the Metropolitan Water Board*- "The supply to the Orpington district during 1952 was satisfactory as regards quantity,, There have been no extensions of trunk mains in the Council's area during the year and no new sources of public water supply have been instituted* 26 Lengths of service mains have been laid in various areas of the Orpington district." There are 50 premises within the district where a main piped water supply is not available,, In addition, 93 premises at Biggin Hill have not been connected to the main although a piped water supply is in the road. These 143 premises are dependent upon underground tank or well supply as follows: - N 0„ of Premises with Stored Rainwater,, Wells BIGGIN HILL WARD 106 2 CUDHAM WARD 19 KN0CKH0LT WARD 1 CHELSFIELD WARD 8 - GREEN ST GREEN WARD 2 DOWNEWARD 3 FARNB0R0UGH WARD - 2 139 4 During the year twenty houses, previously devoid of main supply, were connected to the water mainsu Drainage and Sewerage Main drainage is under the control of the West Kent Main sewerage Board., 88 feet of 9 inch Foul Water Sewer was laid. Cesspools Number of cesspools at 31,12.52:- (1) On line of sewer 306 (355 premises) (2) Not on line of sewer 2,243 2549 27 o Number of cesspools abolished and main drainage provided during the year 81 Number of houses with pail closets converted to cesspool drainage 9 Number of new houses erected with cesspool drainage 000 22 Number of loads removed from cesspools on private requisitioned and council properties (from 786 premises In all) 4,156 The above table is worthy of attention. The good feature is that during the year 81 cesspools on the line of sewer were converted to main drainage0 This is the highest figure reached for any of the five years beginning 1948. If this rate of progress can. be maintained1 we shall have abolished all cesspools on the line of present sewers by 1957o A ray of hope in a dark picture. The bad' features of the table are:- (1) That there are no less than 2,243 cesspools not on line of any sewer and0 owing to financial restrictions, there has been no extension of sewer carried out during the year. (2) That of the 2,549 cesspools only 786 premises called for the service of cesspool emptying, the average number of loads per cesspool being only five throughout the yeac This means that percolation into the chalk sub-strata is practically universal. (3) That 22 new houses were erected during the year with cesspool as the means of household drainage - none of these were on line of sewer0 It is hoped that these 22 cesspools have remained watertight. In the five years 1948/52, 274 cesspools have been abolished while at the same time 97 new houses have been erected with cesspools. 28 Statement of the Number of Properties with Cesspool Drainage in Roads (or parts of Roads) where the West Kent Main Sewer only is available ROAD NO OF NO OF PREMISES PROXIMITY TO WATER BORE CESSPOOLS INVOLVED HOLES Wi thi n 2 More Than Miles 2 Mi les ARTHUR ROAD BIGGIN HI LL 12 12 Yes OAKLANDS LANE B !

These were of a minor character only and were dealt with before the end of the year. Table VIII in the Appendix gives details of the inspections made and of the cases where defects were found Outworkers Twenty-five lists of Outworkers were received during the year and from these I have extracted a list of the trades involved together with the number of persons employed, TRADE Number Of Outworkers EmpIoy ed CLOTH I NG 34 CARDBOARD BOX AND CARTON MAKING 2 SURGICAL APPLIANCES 1 LEATHER GOODS 2 39 As stated in my previous reports, when a case of infectious disease is notified at an outworkers home steps are taken to ensure that there is no risk of infection being-conveyed by the articles made thereat. 32 Smoke Abate me n t Owing to the small number of factories of any size in the district the question of smcke emission does not present a very great problem0 Boiler chimneys are kept under surveillance, however, and immediate contact is made with the management if the law is infringedo At one factory where a nuisance has been created by the emission of black smoke and grit0 an order has been placed for three Lancashire Boilers, at present fired by sprinklers, to be converted to chain grate stokers - a very expensive item,, In this case, the co-operation of the Ministry of Fuel and Power was obtained to good effecto The Council is still represented on the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Advisory Council and the Standing Conference of Local Authorities which co°oper° ates with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

This was to be expected as the special survey was completed only about eighteen months previously. If the co-operative attitude of the shop keeper is any guide there is good reason to hope that this excellent standard will be maintained. A summary of the work in 1952 shows:- INSPECTIONS13* NEGLECT IN DISPLAYING STATUTORY FORMS 19 INADEQUATE SANITARY ACCOMMODATION 1 33 INADEQUATE WASHING FACILITIES1 INSUFFICIENT SEATING FOR FEMALE ASSISTANTS1 CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION DEALING WITH SUNDAY EMPLOYMENT2 INADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR TAKING MEALS 1 Verminous Conditions and Uncieanliness There was an increase in the number of verminous properties dealt with compared with the figures of the last few years, but the incidence is still gratifyingly low. The twenty-two cases were evenly distributed between the occupiers of Council houses, requisitioned property and privately owned houses. Very few cases of filthy premises came to light. Rodent Control As mentioned in my last report, the introduction of a free service to occupiers of private premises in April 1951 resulted in a very big increase in the number of notifications of infestation received. The following statistics show that the number of treatments of this type of property was even greater in 1952 and this is probably due to the fact that more and more people are becoming aware of the facilities offered.

Housing Acts 1936-1949* In 1938, seventeen clearance areas (involving ninetytwo properties) were scheduled for demolition0 These areas were confirmed by the Ministry of Health in the same year and had it not been for the intervention of World War II and the consequent acute short age of housing accommodation they undoubtedly would have been cleared and other areas dealt with in the same way. However, by the end of tte year under review, there remained only nine of these areas, embracing forty-three premiseso Five areas, involving twenty-seven premises have become the property o f the Council by Compulsory Purchase Orders and the remaining four, still in private ownership, embrace the comparatively small number of sixteen premises. It is hoped that the day is not far distant when the immediate housing needs of the Urban district population as a whole are satisfied, and the department can once more devote its energies to the condemnation of properties which are by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects unfit for human habitation® Re-Hous I ng I am indebted to the Housing Manager for the following statistics of re°housing carried out by the Lpcal Authority: - Prior to During Total as at 1952 1952 DeCo. 1952 1.(a) No, of permanent dwellings built by Local Authority 1152 290 1442 (b) Noo of prefabricated dwellings built by Local Authority 319 - 319 (c) No, of dwellings requisitioned by Local Authority 227 - 195 2.(a) No. of families occupying 1 ( a) - 1442* (b) No. of families occupying 1 (b) - 319 38 Prior to During Total as at 1952 1952 ' Dec, 1952 (c) NOe of families occupying 1 (c) 276 (Plus lodgers *) 3o Total Number of families rehoused during 1952:° (a) 290 (b) Nil (c) Fluctuating 4© Number of families with a residential claim on this authority on waiting list at 31©12©52 in various categories (a) Families in urgent need of other accommodation 228 (b) Families whose applications require early consideration 193 (c) Families whose applications are less urgent 693 (d) Families with varying degrees of housing need but with no residential claim on this Authority 676 It is not possible to give any accurate idea of the number of families on the waiting list living in ory overcrowded conditions,, but the families included in Groups 4(a) 4 (b) and approximately 228 of Group 4 (d) above may all be said to be living in crowded conditions© Moveable Dwellings During the year four licences were renewed embracing a total of seventy two caravans and seventy tents For the winter months two licences0 covering a total of thirteen caravans were also, issued. Five licences were issued to persons authorising the use of a caravan on individual sites. In all, one hundred and twenty visits of inspection to the various sites were made by the Sanitary Inspectors SECTION P INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OP POOD 40 SECT II ON F (INSPECTION AND SUPERVfiS50N OF FOOD All the work undertaken by the Health Department in connection with the inspection of food and drink and the supervision of food premises has for its object the prevention of food poisoning .or other illnesses caused by the ingestion of unsound or diseased food. The system of meat inspection in the siaughterhouses, the supervision of the supplies of milk and main water to the public and the co-operation of traders in notifying the suspected unsound condition of food in their premises has reached such a high standard that very little danger need be expected from these sources. Almost invariably,, the illness associated with food today is not due to the food itself but to contamination of the food at some stage during preparation, with bac terial or chemical agentsc harmful to man when ingested. The chief culprit is the bacterial agent,, which can be detected only by laboratory examination* Preventing food poisoning essentially depends on preventing contamination and for this reason the work of the Inspectors is concerned mainly giving advice to occupiers of food premises on matters relating to food hygiene As the absence of strict personal hygiene among food handlers is considered to be one of the chief causes of food poisoning,, some attempt was made during the year (see Section J - Health Education) to effect a further improvement in this direction. It will be seen from the next section of the report,, dealing with Infectious Diseases,, that only three cases of suspected food poisoning were notified during the year and in no case were we able to trace the cause positively to food. Food and Drugs Act., 1938° One hundred and eighty samples of food and drugs were taken for analysis under the above Act eighty-six samples being formal. A further one hundred and forty-three samples were taken for bacteriological and pathological examination and other special tests. Table XI in the Appendix gives details of these samples submitted for examine tion. 41 It is the practice of the department to concentrate as much as possible on the sampling of articles which are manufactured within the Urban district and for which there is a prescribed food standard, the principle being that if this is done in all areas, a comprehensive check is made and the duplication of sampling on a national scale is reduced to a minimum. Other samples are taken to detect infringements of the Labelling of Pood Orders, which among other things,, require that the label shall contain the name of the packer or labeller of the food, the common or usual name of the article and the appropriate designation of each ingredient with its quality, or listed in order of its proportion by weight. More samples are taken of milk than any other food owing to the fact that it is so easily capable of being adulterated by the addition of water and/or the extrac° tion of butter fat (cream)0 It must be said, however „ that very much less adulteration has been met with in recent years since the numerous small retailers have been replaced by the large dairy companies who themselves exercise a laboratory control. Nineteen samples (11 formal and 8 informal) were found to be inferior or adulterated and the following table gives a precis of the analyst5s reports and a brief des° cription of the action taken.

Seventeen slaughtermen's licences were issued under the Slaughter of Animals Act. 1933. Under present Pood Control Regulations, very little slaughtering of animals is carried out locally and the following table is self-explanatory: - CARCASES INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED CALVES PIGS Number killed 5 126 Number Inspected 5 126 ALL D1SEASES EXCEPT T.

Bakehouses Generally speaking, the standard of the twenty-one premises was good. Sixty-five complete inspections were made and notices issued for cleansing and repairs in three premises. Milk As stated in my last report, the sale of un-designated milk in this area is now illegal. Licences were issued in respect of the sale of milk having a special designation as follows: = Tuberculin Tested - Dealers licences 12 Supplementary licences 1 45 Pasteurised - Dealers' licences 12 Supplementary 1 iicenceSoo. 1 Pasteuriser's -Dealers' licences 1 Sterilised -Dealers' licences 24 Supplementary licences 1 One hundred and ten visits were made to the twelve registered dairies in the district and forty-eight samples were sent to the Public Analyst for the prescribed tests. All but three were satisfactory and in these cases subsequent samples satisfied the tests. See Cream At the end of the year, there were one hundred and twenty premises registered for the sale of Ice Cream but none for the manufacture of this commodity, Eighty-three inspections were made and conditions were found to be quite satisfactory. Forty-one samples were sent to the Public Analyst for bacteriological and pathological examination. No pathogenic organisms were isolated and the grading of the samples under the Methylene Blue test for cleanliness showed a further dinstinct improvement on the results obtained in previous years:- 1950 (35 samples taken) 1951 (47 samples, taken) GRADE I 8 GRADE I 36 GRADE II 12 GRADE II 6 GRADE III 12 GRADE III 5 GRADE IV 3 GRADE IV 0 1952 (41 samples taken) GRADE I 33 GRADE II 8 GRADE III 0 GRADE IV 0 In general, Grades I and II are satisfactory while Grades III and IV may indicate some defect in manufacture, storing or handling. Should a Grade III or IV result be received investigations would be made and follow up samples taken. 46 Restaurants. Hotels and Canteens. The increased number of inspections of these premises made last year was maintained in 1952 and although many of them are unsuitable to be used for this purpose due to insufficient space. a reasonable standard of cleanliness was maintainedo In fourteen cases defects requiring the attention of the proprietors were dealt with by informal action. Unsound Food During 1952 a total of one thousand six hundred and seven Condemnation Certificates were issued affecting in quantity approximately four tons of varied articles of food. Almost one quarter of this amount was dealt with in one grocer0 s shop following a fire which destroyed most of his stock. No prosecutions were necessary and the condemned food was utilised for animal food or, where this was impracticable. destroyed. Food Complaints Twenty-five complaints of unsound condition and/or contamination of food stuff were received from the public during the year as follow:- Apple Pie 1 Bread 7 Butter Cake 1 Canned Fruit 3 Canned Meat l Dates 1 Fresh Meat l Meat Paste 1 Milk 5 Self Raising Flour l Soft Drinks l Where doubt existed as to the nature of the condition. the specimens were sent to the Analyst for his observations and in every case the complaints were dealt with to the ultimate satisfaction of the department and the complainants. The co-operation between the public and the department continues to be excellent. SECTION G PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 48 SECTION G PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Statistical details of notifiable infectious diseases are shown in Tables IV. V and VI in the Appendix. There were no epidemics of a serious nature during the year 1952, 1,577 cases of infectious diseases were notified. Smal1 pox No cases were reported during the year. Vaccination The following figures,, which have been furnished by the County Medical Officer, show the number of persons who were vaccinated against smallpox during the year 1952- YEAR OF BIRTH PRIMARY VACCINATION VACCINATION 1952 333 — 1951 223 2 1950 15 2 1949 14 4 1948 19 4 1947 l6 4 1946 4 9 1945 8 8 1944 4 13 1943 2 10 1942 3 9 1941 5 11 1940 6 3 1939 2 7 1938 1 3 Before 1938 42 171 697 260 49 The staff of the Health Department were re-vaccinated as is the practice each year. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis Pour cases were notified, three of which were paralytic and one non-paralytic. Three of these cases were removed to hospital and the other was home nursed. Scarlet Fever One hundred and sixty-eight cases were notified sixty four of these being removed to hospital. The incidence of this disease during the year 1952 was considerably higher than the figure for 1951 (94 cases). The cases were fairly evenly distributed throughout the area; the disease continued to show itself in a mild form, and none of the cases showed the acute illness which used to be so common years ago. While the infection remains mild in character,, the removal of so many cases to hospital seems a little excessive. Diphtheria No cases were notified during 1952. This bald statement is made more impressive when one remembers that there have been no cases of Diphtheria for three years and when one remembers what a dangerous disease this was to young children in years not so very long ago. Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 1952. a total of 911 children received Primary Inoculations and 975 Reinforcing Inoculations (Figures for 1951 were 960 Primary and 9 93 Reinforcing Inoculations). A total of 11,110 children under the age of 15 years had completed a course of immunisation (since 1st January 1938) at the 31st December, 1952. Typhoid Fever No cases were notified during 1952. 50 Puerperal Pyrexia Seven cases were notified. Five were admitted to hospital and two home nursed. There were no deaths. Ophthalmia Neonatorum One case was notified. This was treated at home and made a satisfactory recovery. There was no impairment of vision. Pemphigus Neonatorum No cases were notified during the year . Measles Seven hundred and eighty-six cases were notified, as against one thousand six hundred and sixty-three during 1951. Twelve of these cases were removed to hospital and the remainder home nursed. Whooping Cough Three hundred and eighty-six notifications of this disease were received during 1952. Pour cases were admitted to hospital and the remainder home nursed. This figure showed a decrease compared with that for 1951 (550 cases). Tuberculosis Recordings in the Register for the year ended 31st December, 1952, are as under:- Respiratory Other Forms Tota1 No, of cases.

The number of new cases notified during the year showed an increase of 2 over the corresponding figure for 1951. There were 25 deletions from the Register as against 23 for the year 1951. Food Poisoning The following is a copy of the annual return of food poisoning notifications (corrected) furnished to the Ministry of Health;- (1) Pood poisoning notifications (corrected) returned to Registrar General:- First Quarter 1 Second Quarter — Third Quarter 2 Fourth Quarter — 3 (2) Outbreaks due to identified agents:- Total outbreaks - Nil Total cases - Nil Outbreaks due to:- (a) chemical poisons Nil 52 (b) Salmonella organisms - Nil (c) Staphylococci (including Toxin) - Nil (d) CL. Botulinum - Nil (e) Other bacteria - Nil (3) Outbreaks of undiscovered cause: ~ Total outbreaks - Nil Total cases - Nil (4) Single cases:- Agent identified - Nil Unknown - 3 Total - 3 Other Infectious Diseases In addition to the infectious diseases enumerated above, notifications were received as under:- Dysentery 2.2 Erysipelas 14 Pneumonia (all forms) 122 Meningococcal Infection 3 Malaria 3 The twenty-two cases of Dysentery notified were mostly confirmed as of Sonne type - a form of Dysentery easily spread within the family many of whom, although infected and infectious, have only a passing illness. SECTION H REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL 54 SECTION H REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL Mr. Crowe reports:- During the year regular weekly collection of refuse (fortnightly in the rural parts of the district) has been maintained with only slight disturbances at Bank Holiday periods. Two new side loading refuse collecting vehicles were purchased during the year and one outworn vehicle was soldo The Council now have a fleet of twelve vehicles engaged on refuse collection. The total number of men (including the foreman) engaged on the work is forty-one. The approximate weight of the refuse collected is 55 tons daily and this is disposed of by means of controlled tipping. Pig Pood is collected three times each week from communal street bins and daily from a few shops and canteens. During the year a total of 442 tons of pig food was sold to pig-keepers for £l, 730. A pilot scheme for the collection of waste paper was operated for the first five mouths ended 31st May, but. once again the price paid,for the waste fell below an economic figure and the Council were forced to discontinue the scheme and to abandon consideration of a scheme for the collection from the whole built up area. SECTION J HEALTH EDUCATION 56. SECTION J HEALTH EDUCATION Food Hygiene In order to keep the important question of good hygienic practices continually in the minds of all food workers and thereby to achieve a permanent high standard in the food premises situated in this Urban district, Managers and Proprietors of food premises with more than six employees were asked to send two members of their staffs to attend a "One Lecture Training Course" on the subject of "The Prevention of Pood Poisoning". It was felt that if in each establishment there was at least one trained,, tactful person who could be made responsible, under the management, for calling attention to bad practices, unclean methods etc. we should go a long way to remove the risk of pood Poisoning. A talk by the Deputy Chief sanitary Inspector followed by a discussion took place on Tuesday, 4th March, 1952. It was well attended and a great deal of interest was shown. A further meeting was arranged tentatively to take place in the Autumn when it was thought the scheme could be reviewed in the light of experience and so that suggestions for improvement could be received. This second meeting was held in the Council Chamber on the 25th November, and, though poorly attended was representative of most of the large trading concerns. It appeared that the scheme had been working quite satisfactorily and it is to be hoped that it will be a means of sustaining interest in this important subject As a ''refresher" to the talk given in March, three filmstrips were shown namely:- (1) What Pood Infections are (2) The Pood Handlers Part, and (3) Hygiene in the Kitchen. Early in the year, a message was directed to all persons employed in food premises in the Urban district. It explained how food can become infected and cause food poisoning and how this can be prevented by observing a few simple rules.
