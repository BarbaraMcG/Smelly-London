Public Health Department Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting ray Annual Report for the year 1925, the period has again come round in which the report is a review of the conditions of the Borough, and of progress made during the preceding five years. Though in some districts there may in that period be considerable room for expansion and improvement, there is in Southwark no scope for the former, but there is evidence in the report to show that general improvement has taken place in existing conditions, and the health of the inhabitants. Educational propaganda in the form of leaflets on Cancer, Tuberculosis and Measles have been made use of, and the instruction in general health subjects at the Welfare Centres, and Tuberculosis Dispensary, have all done their share towards the spreading of knowledge and the instruction of the people. Our difficulties in housing have been met in a small measure by the provision of London County Council houses, but in spite of that overcrowding is still the greatest difficulty in the Borough. The staffs of all branches of the Department have worked well and loyally. We have lost an excellent Officer on the retirement of Mr. Weatheritt, and his going has meant a considerable reorganisation of departmental detail. The members of the Council, the Public Health Committee and Maternity and Child Welfare Committee, have extended every consideration, and have rendered the work easier by their interest and co-operation. The various matters dealt with in the report will be found under their respective headings, together with the statistics and tables dealing with them. Yours faithfully, HORACE WILSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Southwark. 2 NATURAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OP THE AREA Estimated population (1925) 189,000 Population (Census, 1921) 184,404 Area (acres) 1,131 PHYSICAL FEATURES AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE AREA The Borough of Southwark is built on reclaimed low-lying marsh land, much of which is below high water mark of the Thames, which bounds it on the North and is kept from overflowing at high water spring tides by the walls and embankments restraining it The sub-soil is chiefly clay with patches of gravel, and the whole Borough lies at the bottom of a basin some miles in circumference These conditions lead to a damp and foggy atmosphere with high ground water, and predispose to such diseases as Bronchitis and Rheumatism which are very prevalent in the district Number of inhabited houses (1925) 20,474 Number of families or separate occupiers (Census) 40,727 Rateable value £1,262,652 Sum represented by penny rate £5,160 SOCIAL CONDITIONS The population is chiefly working class, the predominating occupations being printing, manufacturing of various kinds, waterside labouring and casual workers There is no occupation specially prejudicial to the public health, and the factories in the Borough are clean, up-to-date and sanitary The residential districts vary largely from small modern villas and up-to-date tenements to decayed and worn Georgian houses, let out in lodgings, and some narrow courts into which the sun rarely penetrates A few back to back houses exists and much of the property is ripe for demolishment and rebuilding, but for the difficulty of rehousing the tenants 3 VITAL STATISTICS Births—Legitimate 3,886 Illegitimate 131 Total 4,017 Birth Bate, 2122 Deaths 2,468 Death Bate, 13.1 Number of women dying in, or in consequence of childbirth — From sepsis 0 Other causes 5 Deaths of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 births, 77 Legitimate 297 Illegitimate 12 Total 309 Deaths from Measles (all ages) 28 Do Whooping Cough (all ages) 51 Do Diarrhaea under 2 years of age 44 No special causes of sickness or invalidity or occupational causes of diseases GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES Hospitals—No hospitals are provided by the Local Authority for Tuberculosis, Fevers, or general ailments, as these matters are amply provided for by the London County Council, the Metropolitan Asylums Board or the general Hospitals The following general Hospitals are within the area:— Guy's Hospital Evelina Hospital for Children St George's Hospital for diseases of the Eye 4 The Hospitals available but beyond the borders are:— St. Thomas's Hospital. King's College Hospital. Royal Waterloo Hospital. General Lying-in Hospital, York Road. The Belgrave Hospital for Children. Ambulance Sekvicks are provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for Infectious and Poor Law oases, and the London County Council provides Ambulances for accidents, also for the transit of parturient women to Hospitals. CLINICS AND TREATMENT CENTRES. (1) Maternity and Child Welfare.—There are in all fourteen Centres -which may be classified as follows:— Municipal Centres (Eight)— St. Mary's Hall, Kennington Park Road. St. Paul's Parochial Hall, Lorrimore Street. Boy's Club, Villa Street. All Saints Parish Room. Surrey Square. Lady Margaret Parish Room, Chatham Street. Lansdowne Place Mission Hall.

Professional home nursing is not undertaken by the Borough Council, hut the Benson Home for Nurses provides nursing in the Newiugton district, and the sum of £400 per annum is granted towards their funds. In other districts the Ranyard Nurses cover a large area, while several parishes have their own private uurse. No special Nurses are employed for infectious diseases, nor are midwives subsidised or employed by the Borough Council. The General Lying-in Hospital, York Road, the Obstetric Wards at Guy's, and King's College Hospitals, and the wards of Southwark Hospital, are sufficient to meet the requirements of the district without the necessity of a local Maternity Home. CHEMICAL WORK. The Analytical work and Chemical work under the Food and Drugs Act and various Milk Regulations, the Bacteriological work for Infectious Diseases and Tuberculosis, are carried out by the Borough Analyst, whose report is incorporated with the Public Health report. ACTS AND BYE LAWS. There are no local Acts, but the London County Council Bye-laws are enforced (as also are local Bye-laws concerning Underground rooms, Houses Let in Lodgings and others). No midwives are employed by, or subsidised by the Borough Council. 7 POPULATION During the year 1925 the estimated population as supplied by the Registrar-General has increased by 1,286, being 189,000 as against 187,714 in the previous year. All the rates in my report are calculated on the former figure. It will be seen from the subjoined table that the greater increase in population has taken place in the Newington District, wiih a lesser increase in St. George's, Christchurcli and St. Saviour's Wards. The total increase of 1,286 persons in this already congested Borough does not tend to abate the overcrowding which is one of its outstanding features. The Bye-laws in legard to Houses Let in Lodgings foreshadowed in last year's report have not yet materialised, and these matters are still in abeyauce. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1922, 1923, 1924 and 1925 are as follows:— Newington. St. George's. St. Saviour's and Christchurch. 1841 54,693 — — 1851 64,816 51,824 35,731 1861 82,157 55,510 36,169 1871 88,691 56,083 31,294 1881 107,831 58,652 31,628 1891 115,663 59,740 27,116 1901 121,863 60,998 23,319 1911 116,819 55,782 19,316 1921 114,987 52,114 17,303 1922 116,683 52,996 17,541 1923 117,200 52,690 17,574 1924 117,500 52,610 17,604 1925 118,300 52,980 17,720 8 The Ward distribution was as follows :— TABLE 1.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1925 was 3,399, of which 1,694 were males, and 1,705 females. This represents a birth-rate of 17'8 per 1,000 inhabitants The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 2,040; St. George the Martyr, 977; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 382. Of the 3,399 births registered in the Borough 85 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough. 703 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the Borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 85 "outward" transfers are deducted 9 and the 703 "inward" transfers are added to the 3399, births actually registered in the Borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwai k for the year is found to be 4,017. This gives a corrected birth-rate of 21-2. Birth-rate for the last Thirty Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George's St. Saviour's and Christchurch.

These deaths in iustitutions comprised 342 belonging to Southwark and 493 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,228. When the 524 deaths of those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,228" outlying" deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 2,468 of which number 1,363 were males and 1,105 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 131 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1925, as against a rate of 14'2 -for 1924. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 45.7. The principal localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are as follows :— Southwark Hospital 713 Mental Hospitals 103 Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 69 St. Thomas's Hospital 69 Lambeth Hospital 23 Belgrave Hospital 9 King's College Hospital 28 Boyal Waterloo Hospital 17 In the Street and other Institutions 197 Total 1228 12 TABLE 3.

The water carriage system is universal in Southwark, and neither earth closets nor cesspools are used. The scavenging is carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department, who remove the refuse twice a week or oftener if necessary. As a rule covered inetal movable bins are in use, but in some blocks of dwellings dust shoots with fixed bins at the bottom are used. This is especially the case in high buildings where the carrying of the bins would be difficult. The refuse is either railed straight to a country depot, or ground in a machine to a powder which is used for manurial purposes. SANITARY WORK. ST. MARY'S WARD.

The number of observations made during the year are eet out below. The chief cause of smoke in Southwark is due to the small houses, each •of which has several tenants who have a small coal fire for heating purposes or occasional cooking. This means a multiplication of coal fires with a large volume of carbon pouring from them, which in the damp vaporous atmosphere overlying the marshy subsoil causes the preponderance of fog which causes so great a mortality from bronchial troubles in the district. If tenants are encouraged to burn their waste matter the production of smoke, with resulting pollution of the atmosphere will be largely increased, and the incidence and mortality from bronchial troubles will rise proportionately. It is useless to talk of smoke abatement on one hand and to advise burning of rubbish in grates and under coppers on the other BLACK SMOKE. During the year 1925 two complaints were received at the Public Health Office from persons other than the Council's Inspectors.

HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. Local Bye-laws were made in 1911, but these have since the commencement of the War been obsolete owing to the fact that a rental basis was taken as a standard, and owing the variations in rental taking the houses out of the purview of the Bye-laws, they became unworkable except in a few instances. These houses will need entire revision when the new Bye-laws of the London County Council come into force. 39 TABLE 22.

VERMINOUS PERSONS CLEANSED DURING 1925. During the year 4,690 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street. Under our agreement with the London County Council, 3,624 children were cleansed. One cleansing was found to be sufficient in verminous cases, except when the cases were associated with impetigo, when two or three cleansings had to be given. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 1,066 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 842 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1924. 49 MORTUARIES. table 30.

(1) I. General Housing Conditions.—The housing question is the most important one in the Borough at the present time. The population is too large for the Borough to accommodate, and it still increases. The houses are getting worn out in many parts of the area and are almost without exception let out to members of more than one family. In other parts of the district the houses are of newer and better type, but still sub-letting is the rule and very few families occupy a whole house. (2) The shortage of houses mentioned above cannot be adequately met by local building as there is practically no land left available for the purpose. There are a few commercial sites available which might be used, but even if built on these would go only a small way to relieve the congestion. In the northern end of the Borough, particularly, it is necessary for the workers to be near their work, which is chiefly on the water side, and housing efforts too far away would be of no benefit to them whatever. For these casual workers at low wage who cannot afford travelling expenses and who practically live from hand to mouth (of whom Sonthwark contains many), suburban schemes are absolutely useless and houses are required on the neighbouring sites even if those sites have an enchanced value commercially. Unfortunately those who most need rehousing are the least able to pay increased rental. (3) The population is practically stationary. There has been an increase of 572 persons during the last five years. II. Overcrowding is universal and the position is acute. Not only are the houses so packed together that no building sites are available, but the houses themselves are so overcrowded that it is almost an impossibility for tenants to get possession of even one room within the district. The geographical position, the convenient facilities and the nearness both to the city and west end combine to make Southwark a very popular working class district. The proximity to Billingsgate, the presence of wharves, warehouses, the Borough Market and the various factories all attract the worker who wishes to live near his work. 61 Many have lived for years in the same small houses or tenements with ever increasing families, but stationary incomes. These people cannot afford the extra rooms necessary to live in comfort, health, or even decency. There is at present nowhere for these people to move to that is compatible with their scheme of life. To displace present residential areas with industrial concerns is of no use unless alternative accommodation is provided for them within easy distance of their work, and this policy can only tend to increase overcrowding in the vicinity of their old neighbourhood. 11T. Fitness of Houses. - (a) The general standard of house varies in Southwark within certain limits, but there are practically no better class houses in single occupation. Roughly they fall into two groups— old houses now occupied by more than one family, many of these originally three storey houses with basement kitchen, and a large area of more modern roads of small villa houses, which are also in most instances occupied by more than one family. There are in addition streets of two storey artisans cottages, many of which are falling into decay, and large blocks of tenement dwellings which are with a few exceptions well kept and in good condition. (b) The chief defects are due to the age of the property, and in the poorer districts the lack of light and air space, and the crowding together of the houses. (c) The owners, generally speaking, spend a considerable amount in endeavouring to keep their property in good condition, but the tenants in the poorer parts are careless and destructive. They make little endeavour to keep their homes clean and tidy, and allow their children to do damage without restraint. They tear the wall paper, chip the plaster, and scribble on the paint, after which the landlord is expected to make good the damage at his expense. When visiting houses for the purpose of dealing with nuisances under the Public Health Act it has often been found that defects exist which are not within the scope of the Public Health Act, and yet requiring attention. To meet the question of these minor repairs necessary to make the house "reasonably fit for habitation," and yet of scarcely such importance as to necessitate putting the machinery of Section 3 of the 1925 Housing Act in motion, an informal notice was 52 drawn up bringing these repairs to the notice of the owner and serving this together with the notice under the Public Health Act. This procedure separates the Public Health from the Housing items and avoids putting on Public Health Notices things which cannot be enforced under that Act and leaves open another course under Section 3, 1925, Housing Town Planning Act to be followed up if necessary. IV. Unhealthy Areas.—For several years representations have "been before the London County Council concerning Areas in Hatfield Street, Park Street, Rockingham Street, and Draper Street. During this year the Hatfield Street Area was re-represented and an Enquiry held by the Ministry of Health. The matter is still under consideration. The other Areas mentioned above have not yet been dealt with. V. Byk-laws concerning Houses let in Lodgings were made by the Borough Council in 1911, and enforced until the period of the War, when owing to the facts that the question of what constituted a tenement house was governed by the rental paid, and that the all round increase of rent took most of the houses off the Register, the Bye-laws, as existed became obsolete. Pending the issue of the new Bye-laws in preparation by the London County Council, the supervision of these houses has for the last few years been restricted to the few obvious ones still on onr list. VI. No special work beyond that already mentioned has been carried on, but the routine work has involved continuous assiduity to cope with existing conditions. 53 TABLE 31. 9.—Housing.

The milk supply of the district is good, the milk premises clean and under constant supervision, and the retailing is largely in the hands of leading firms of good reputation. There are no cowsheds in the Borough and all milk is imported from country districts. Meat inspection in the district includes a very large quantity of imported frozen and chilled meats, which are dealt with at the wharves and storages. Very little slaughtering is done in the district, and then only for sale on the premises of the slaughterer, so it has not been necessary to institute any system of meat marking. Arrangements have been made by which notice is given when animals are to be slaughtered, in those cases where the slaughtering is not done on an appointed day. Condemned meat is treated with carbolic or other chemicals in such a way as to make it unsaleable for food, and is either destroyed under supervision at the refuse depot or released after similar treatment under strict guarantee for soap making or other manufacturing purposes. An additional Inspector was appointed in 1925 to assist the Food Inspector whose work at the wharves and storages had outgrown the capacity of one man, and also to carry out the necessary duties under the Public Health Meat .Regulations 1924, in regard to shops, stores, stalls and vehicles. Notices were issued to all butchers and stall holders intimating the minimum requirements that they would be expected to fulfil, together with a copy of the Regulations. The following were considered the necessary precautions and they have been universally carried out. The Meat Regulations are devised with the object of protecting food from contamination from dust aud dirt and keeping the shop, stalls and utensils in a clean and wholesome condition. The following points are suggested as being necessary to attain that end as far as exposure on the highway is concerned with as little 56 ference with trade as possible. The other points are clearly dealt with iu the Regulations themselves. Meat should be kept behind the building line of the shop front and not project over the pavement unless the projecting portion is covered in by a sunblind aud has curtains at the sides which effectually prevent dust blowing on to the meat, in the same manner as stalls are to be protected. No carcases or other meat should be hung outside the shop unless adequately protected from dust by the above mentioned means, and if so hung should in addition be covered with muslin or similar material. Meat hung in dooiways or exposed therein on tables or blocks should be covered to prevent contamination from clothes. Glass fronts are advised as most efficient. In dusty weather free use should be made of muslin, &c., and as little meat exposed at a time as possible. Notices for display as to the handling of meat have been distributed to each butcher aud stallholder selling meat. The shops, &c., are constantly visited, and strict precautions as to cleanliness are enforced, many have put in glass fronts, and there is an all-round improvement in the conditions since a special Inspector was appointed. There are 110 public slaughter-houses in the Borough, a few butchcrs slaughter privately for their customers consumption, and these slaughterhouses are frequently visited. The street markets are under constant supervision, including Saturdays and Sundays, and the numerous factories for preparing food products in the district are under inspection and kept in a clean and wholesome condition. The Eating Houses and places where food is prepared for sale are inspected every three months. Premises where ice cream is made and sold are under conjtant supervision during the summer months. No action was necessary under the Dried Milk Regulations, nor was it necessary to take any action under the Condensed Milk Regulations. 57 TABLE 32.

One sample has been purchased under the above Regulations during 1925, but others will be purchased before the end of the financial year (which is also the end of our sampling year, viz., March 31st). PUBLIC HEALTH (DRIED MILK) REGULATIONS. 1923. There have been no samples of Dried Milk purchased for analysis. Endeavours have been made from time to time to purchase samples, but apparently it is not on sale. The reason given is that on account of the number of Welfare Centres where this article can be obtained at a low cost, it does not pay the shopkeeper to stock it. 83 INFORMAL SAMPLES.

General.—All homes are visited by a Sanitary Inspector and an Enquiry Officer, who arranges for isolation for Hospital treatment, and investigates the possible source of infection, and deals with the schools and contacts. SMALL POX. There has been no case, of Small Pox since 1925, nor in the preceding five years. During the present year there were a few suspected cases reported which were chiefly found to be chicken pox, one was secondary syphilis and one a case of general blood poisoning. SCARLET FEVER. There has been a considerable increase in the number of cases over the two preceding years, but the number of deaths has been low in proportion, and the cases have been of a mild type. The Dick test has not been adopted in this district, nor has any scheme of immunisation been put into action. Of the 741 cases notified in the present year 733 were removed to Hospital. The number of deaths was 8 and the annual rate of mortality 004. The number of cases notified and the number of deaths during the last five years were as follows :— Notified.

This disease was very prevalent in 1925 and the number of cases notified have been increasing steadily during the last five years. This is largely due to the greater number of throats swabbed and the finding of bacilli in many cases which a few years ago would have gone unsuspected. The cases have not been of a serious type and the proportion of deaths have not been high. 86 The Schick Test has not been utilsed. The above facts are home out by the case mortality for 1915 and the last five years which have been as follows:— 1915 9.5 1923 6.2 1921 5.5 1924 6.2 1922 8.1 1925 3.4 This shows the milder type of disease notified. Antitoxin is supplied free of charge to medical men applying at the Town Hall or Reception House and a sterilised syringe is also lent on request. Most of the cases however, are at once removed to the isolation hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Of the 905 cases notified in the present year 897 were removed to the hospital. The number of deaths was 31 and the annual rate of mortality 0.16. The number of cases notified and the number of deaths during the last five years were as follows:— Notified. Deaths. 1921 537 30 1922 749 61 1923 770 49 1924 791 49 1925 905 31 ENTERIC FEVER. No deaths occurred from this disease during 1925 and only 6 cases were notified All the cases were removed to hospital for treatment. The number of cases notified and the number of deaths during the last five years were as follows:— Notified. Deaths. 1921 7 1 1922 3 3 1923 18 2 1924 12 1 1925 6 - MEASLES. This is by special order a notifiable disease in Southwark. During the last five years it has been very prevalent and in 1922 there was a serious epidemic with 145 deaths. 87 In 1925 there were 2,068 cases notified with 28 deaths. 26 of these deaths occurred in infants under the age of 5 years, and although the disease was of a mild type, the epidemic continued until the end of the year. German Measles also occurred in a considerable number of cases. Each case was visited by a Health Visitor. No special measles nurse was employed. In all cases where death has occurred the room, clothing and bedding were disinfected. Deaths from Measles during the last 5 years. 1921 6 1924 77 1922 145 1925 28 1923 13 DIARRHŒA. There was, as in the other notifiable diseases an increase in Diarrhoea and enteritis, but the number of deaths was the same as in 1924. The disease was not so severe in type, which was probably due to the cool summer. Deaths from Diarrhoea during the last 5 years. 1921 149 1924 49 1922 29 1925 58 1923 61 44 of these deaths occurred in infants under 2 years of age. WHOOPING COUGH. The death rate of this disease has varied considerably during the five years, being always highest in years when Measles has been prevalent. The number of fatal cases during the last 5 years were as follows:— 1921 28 1924 17 1922 62 1925 51 1923 27 INFLUENZA. The mortality for 1925 was low, being only 25 cases, which was considerably below the usual average. Deaths during the last 5 years. 1921 49 1924 62 1922 92 1925 25 1923 25 88 OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. 14 cases of this disease occurred, as against 21 in 1924.

I. The Municipal Tuberculosis Dispensary is situated near the Elephant and Castle Underground Railway and convenient for all buses and trams. This central position renders one Dispensary adequate for the district as it can be reached from all parts without difficulty to the patients. II. Arrangements for residential treatment are in the hands of the London County Council as regards insured and non-insured patients. Advanced and emergency cases are treated in the Southwark Guardians Hospital at East Dulwich Grove. III. There is an arrangement with Guy's Hospital whereby patients may be sent for X-Ray examination, also with Brompton Hospital for Finsen Light treatment and Artificial Pneumothorax. There is an interchange of records between the Tuberculosis Dispensary and the School Medical Officers IV. When cases are notified by a practitioner and it is ascertained that the patient is an insured person, the practitioner is communicated with and a Form 17 is sent to him to be filled up and returned to the Tuberculosis Officer. It is then a matter of arrangement between them after considering the case, whether it should be treated as a domiciliary case or what would be the most suitable treatment for it. If treated as a domiciliary case periodic reports are obtained from the medical attendant, and the treatment revised if necessary. V. Where the diagnosis is doubtful the patient is either sent to Brompton Hospital for observation or kept for a limited time under observation at the Dispensary until the doubt is cleared up. VI. Contacts are encouraged to visit the Dispensary for examination and the Nurses attached to the Dispensary visit the homes and arrange for their attendance. VII. The special methods of diagnosis used were sputum examination and X-Ray examination. By arrangement with Guy's Hospital 23 patients were so examined. The methods of treatment were Sanatorium treatment and Hospital treatment under the London County Council. 156 patients were recommended for Sanatorium. 34 do. do. Hospital. 12 do. do. Home for Advanced Cases. 22 do. do. observation for diagnosis. VIII. On the whole the Sanatorium treatment has proved of value as a fairly large proportion of the patients were able to return to work on discharge. IX. Dental treatment is arranged for at Guy's Hospital where extractions are done free, a small fee only being charged for the anaesthetic, which fee is paid by the Borough Council. X. Arrangements for nursing of patients in their homes is made 96 through the Benson Nursing and Ranyard Nursing Associations. Extra nourishment was granted through the Dispensary direct to 31 patients while waiting admission for institutional treatment or immediately aiter discharge from an institution. A certain number of patients were recommended to the Southwark Invalid Kitchen for dinners, and a number were granted extra nourishment by the Southwark Board of Guardians. XI. The residential arrangements for treating non-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially tuberculosis of bones and joints in adults and in children, and for the provision of surgical apparatus, &c., are dealt with by the London County Council. XII. The Care Committee is composed of members of the Borough Council, and representatives from all the leading philanthropic organizations in the Borough, the local medical profession, and the Tuberculosis Dispensary. The Committee has a voluntary secretary and meets weekly at the Town Hall. XIII. Cases are referred to the Superintendent of the Local Labour Exchange who is also a member of the Tuberculosis Care Committee, for special consideration, as to provision of occupation after leaving an institution. XIV. There are 4 shelters which are lent to patients and kept in repair by the Council. They are generally in constant use and are greatly appreciated. The district is not suitable for many to be used being very congested, and with few gardens, but they serve very useful purposes in procuring more open air for the patient and in removing a source of infection from the congested home. XV. The disease is fairly wide-spread in the district and not confined to any particular section of the community. XVI. All the usual methods are adopted for the prevention of Tuberculosis and are exercised to the best advantage, with the result that there is a steady diminution both in the incidence and mortality for the last 10 years. XVII. The greatest difficulty in a crowded borough like Southwark is want of space both indoors and out of doors. The houses are for the most part overcrowded and congested, and whereas in the country a patient can walk about without coming into contadt with others, in a city like this he comes in close touch with people in the streets, tubes, trams and buses. The question of infection is also more serious for whereas a small amount of expectoration in a country lane is not a serious matter, it becomes of considerably more importance on a town pavement where children play, and it may be carried on the boots into houses, or by flies in the summer on to the food stuffs on adjacent stalls and shops or in the houses. More open spaces are required in a district of this description to give the cramped population more fresh air and sunlight. 97 TABLE 48. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912.

There are in the Borough 10 Municipal Centres, Voluntary and partly Voluntary and partly Municipal for the attendance of mothers and children under 5 years of age. Sessions are also held for ante-natal work amongst expectant mothers. There is an assistant doctor to the Medical Officer of Health for maternity work and three part time doctors attached to other centres. There is also a Superintendent Health Visitor and 10 Health Visitors. The district is so well supplied with Maternity Wards in general Hospitals and childrens' Hospitals, and also having the York Road Lying-in Hospital extending its excellent work into the district, there is no need for the Borough to undertake a Maternity Home or Hospital for babies on its own account. Ante-natal sessions are held every week at the Municipal Centres and the same is also done at the Maternity Centre of Guy's Hospital. Orthopdæic Treatment.—This is undertaken by the London County Council and the General Hospitals in the Borough. The voluntary societies co-ordinating are the Invalid Childrens Aid Society, the Southwark Invalid Kitchens Society, which both do good work. As all the children attending the centres are under 5 years of age there is no connection with the school medical service until they are transferred to school. 102 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE CENTRES.

Southwark Tuhkkculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newinqton Causkway, S.E To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1925. The work of the Dispensary has been carried on on simiiiar lines to which it has been in the past, and with the help of the very efficient Secretary Dispenser, and the three Nurses, I think some good is resulting from our endeavours in the Borough. A very large number of patients have been sent away under the London County Council scheme, both for treatment at Sanatoria for definite Tubercular cases, and for observation in doubtful cases. With regard to advanced cases a good number of male patients have been sent to Collindale Hospital, and male and female cases to other Institutions for this class of case, and with the opening of the new hospital at Grove Park, S.E., for advanced cases, both males and females under the London County Council scheme early in February, 1926, we hope to be able to deal with a large number of this class of case in the future. The Invalid Children's Aid Association has been of great service to us, both in sending delicate children away and also dealing with the new scheme brought out by the London County Council for boarding out the children of tuberculous patients, so as to get them away from the source of the infection. A number of children who have been in Sanatoria for Tuberculosis have been recommended on their return for Open Air Schools under the London County Council management, and delicate children, who have not definitely got tuberculosis have also gone to Stowey House School under the London County Council management. The Nurses have paid a large number of visits to the homes of the patients, and have done most excellent propaganda work in instructing the patients how to live a healthy life and keep their homes sanitary and healthy. The Care Committee, which meets weekly at the Town Hall, has also been most active in their work of helping the patients themselves 111 and also their wives, husbands and children while they are away in Institutions. We still have three shelters in constant use; we have also lent out eight beds for the use of patients in their own homes. By arrangement with Guy's Hospital the X-Ray has been used in the diagnosis of a number of doubtful cases, Dental treatment has also been given to a number of cases, also operations for Tonsils and Adenoids in children. Light treatment for Tuberculous disease of the Skin has also been carried out by arrangement with St. Thomas's Hospital and the London Hospital. 790 specimeus of sputum have been examined by the Borough Analyst. The Charity Organisation Society has rendered us considerable help in the way of getting pre-tubercular patients away to convalescent homes aud also in supplying the necessary clothing to patients going away to institutions. A good supervision and record of old cases is kept both by ourselves and by the London County Council After-History Reports, and a large number of Contacts of Tuberculous patients has been examined. Extra nourishment has been given to 31 patients while either waiting for admission to or discharge from Institutions. Ex-service patients have been looked after by us in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions, and 250 certificates recommending and receiving treatment allowances to ex-service patients to the Ministry of Pensions have been granted. The Red Cross Society and the United Services Fund have also been of great help to us. I append tables of statistics of the work done during the year 1925.
