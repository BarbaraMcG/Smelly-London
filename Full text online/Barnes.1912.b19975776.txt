One cannot do better than quote from and verify certain paragraphs in the official guide to the district of Bar nes, Mortlake and East Sheen. This district fortunately retains its many charms in the way of river, park, commons, and open fields, and it is at the same time an up-to-date suburban district, while from a public health point of view it would be difficult if not impossible to find any district more progressive or more abreast of the times, times in which public health legislature has been increasing and advancing by leaps and bounds. In the course of this report it will be shown that in certain important works in preventive medicine, this district is actually a pioneer. The real charms of the district are its river, Richmond Park, Barnes, Sheen and Palewell Commons, and also its close proximity to Kew Gardens and Wimbledon Common. The river runs along the whole northern side of the district. The towing path running from Hammersmith to Kew forms a stretch of four miles. 600 acres of Richmond Park are in the parish of Mortlake. 126 acres of Barnes Common extend on the east of the district. 52 acres of East Sheen Common „ south ,, 15 acres of Palewell Common ,, south-east „ 14 Physical Features. In addition to this fine and permanent stretch of open spaces, there are many large recreation grounds for polo, golf, football, cricket, tennis, hockey, etc. There is also a large number of country houses with extensive grounds attached. The soil is gravelly over the London Clay, which latter outcrops in the vicinity of Palewell Park. There is a gentle slope up from the river to Richmond Park and Roehampton; surface water gets away very quickly and the ground soon dries. The district is growing rapidly and many new houses are being erected, but at the same time the rural charms of the place are not disappearing and probably never will. It would be difficult to find any district so near London with more town facilities and more country advantages. The population has increased from 17,900 in 1901 to 32,000 in 1912, or nearly doubled itself. There are no occupations in the district which could adversely influence the public health. The majority of the male inhabitants are business and city men; a large brewery employs many men, and several large laundries employ many young women. A large number of men also are employed by the London General Omnibus Company and by the London & South Western Railway, also by contractors and builders. The Hospitals supplying this district are the West London at Hammersmith and the Richmond Hospital. The Workhouse Hospital is the Richmond Infirmary, while for infectious diseases, the Council's Isolation Hospital, containing over 40 beds, provides for infectious cases in the district. POOR LAW RELIEF DURING 1912. 240 orders were issued for Medical Attendance. 139 ,, „ „ Admission to Workhouse. 37 deaths occurred among Barnes and Mortlake cases in the Workhouse. Poor Law Relief. 15 The average number per week in receipt of out-door relief was 150. The Barnes, Mortlake and East Sheen Philanthropic Society was established with the charitable object of seeking out and relieving cases of distress, and rendering pecuniary assistance where such assistance may promote the future welfare of the recipient. The following table shows how the poor were relieved:— Expenditure. £ s. d.

Vital Statistics. 17 POPULATION. The population at the census of 1901 was 17,900, and had increased at the census of 1911 to 30,377. The population of the district is now estimated at 32,000. The number of inhabited houses at the 1901 census was 3,403, and gave an inhabited house rate of 5.2. The number of inhabited houses now is 7,547, giving an inhabited house rate of 4.24. The natural increase of population or the excess of the number of births over deaths for 1912 is 409. The area of the district is 2,517 acres, exclusive of that area covered by water. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year is 700, being a decrease of 31 compared with last year, and an increase of 27 on the average for the last 5 years. The birth rate is 21.8 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Last year it was 23.7 per 1,000 of the population. Illegitimacy. Of the 700 births registered, 30 were illegitimate, or 4.2 per cent. The death rate amongst illegitimate children amounts to 133 for every 1,000 born. The birth rate for England and Wales for 1912 - 23.8 ,, ,, London ,, ,, - 24.7 18 Vital Statistics. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered in the district is 220, but for comparative purposes, certain corrections have to be made. Eleven deaths of non-residents have to be deducted, and 82 deaths of residents who have died in other districts have to be added. The nett deaths therefore are 291. There were 60 deaths in Public Institutions serving this district: The death rate of residents registered in the district is equal to 6.9 per 1,000 of the population. The corrected death rate, including residents who have died outside the district is equal to 9 per 1,000 of the population. The death rate for England and Wales for 1912 - 13.3 „ „ London ,, ,, - 14.3 (corrected for age and sex) The number of deaths in children is given below, viz. 41. This gives a death rate of 58.5 per 1,000 births. Owing to a wet summer there was very little diarrhoea amongst infants. The Notification of Births Act is not yet adopted, but this, will probably come about in the near future.

The water supply is that of the Metropolitan Water Board— the supply is constant and sufficient and of good quality. The best proof of the quality is the fact that Enteric Fever, which is largely a water-borne disease, is practically non-existent in the district. The raw Thames water has to be stored so as to allow of sedimentation and filtration. Dr. Houston, the director of water examination to the Metropolitan Water Board, draws the following conclusions with regard to raw waters, which are— "1. About 80 per cent. of the London Water Supply is derived "from sewage-polluted rivers. "2. As judged by the usual chemical and bacteriological "standards the raw waters above the " intakes" for waterworks "purposes, are undoubtedly unsatisfactory in quality, particularly "during the winter months. "3. The judicious selection of raw water for waterworks "purposes becomes an increasingly difficult operation as the Sanitary Circumstances. 2l "sumption of water progressively increases, the volume of river "water meanwhile remaining constant. "4. Within recent years a marked improvement has taken "place in the methods of purifying sewage, so as to render the "resulting effluents non-putrescible and chemically unobjectionable. "Apart from sterilization, however, no known practical process has "yet been found which turns out a "safe" effluent; bacteriologi"cally, and the great majority even of chemically-satisfactory "effluents are swarming with excremental bacteria. It is possible "that improved methods of purification will, in a chemical sense, "keep pace with increasing pollutions of the rivers Thames and "Lea, but the outlook bacteriologically is less hopeful. "5. Prospective legislation as regards sewage purification "would seem likely to run on the common sense lines of protecting "the general interests of the community at large, leaving to "individual authorities, who venture to utilise polluted rivers for "waterworks purposes, the full responsibility of employing such "superadded processes of purification as the particular necessities "of their own case demand. "6. Belief in the future "safety" of London, as regards "Water Supply, ought not to depend on the chimerical hope that "the Thames and Lea are destined to become progressively less "impure, but on the increased knowledge as to the best means of " purifying the water before it is sent into consumption. "7. Whilst it is true that the raw Thames and Lea contain "B. coli in undesirable numbers, it is a point in their favour that "faecal streptococci are seldom discoverable in one cubic centi"metre amounts of the water. "8. Further, the results of a most elaborate search for the "typhoid bacillus and Gartner's bacillus have yielded practically 22 Sanitary Circumstances. "negative results under conditions of experiment which have been "shown to be successful in the case of artificially infected "samples." The water supply of the Metropolis was in the hands of eight companies, whose powers and rights were regulated by their local Acts, and by the Metropolis Water Acts of 1852 and 1871. In June 1904, they were superseded by the Metropolitan Water Board, which consists of 66 members representing the County Councils of London, Herts, Essex, Middlesex, Kent, the cities of London and Westminster, the Thames Conservancy, the Lea Conservancy Board and the Metropolitan Boroughs. The Board controls the water supply not only in London, but also over a large extra-metropolitan area, and neither the County Council nor any other Local Authority of the Metropolis has any direct power. Besides the special Act or Acts, the supply is governed by certain sections of the Public Health (London) Act, the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 and the Metropolis Water Acts 1852 and 1871. There are statutory obligations laid upon the Board so as to ensure the delivery of wholesome water, and also provisions against pollution by consumers and others. The Controlling Authority is the Local Government Board, which causes the water supply by the companies to be examined periodically, approves or disapproves of new sources of supply, and enquires into complaints made to it as to the quality or quantity of the water supplied for domestic use. A river wall is now in course of construction in order to prevent the Thames overflowing its banks between the White Hart Hotel and the Lonsdale Road, affecting chiefly the Terrace, Barnes. Sanitary Circumstances. 23 The Beverley Brook, which by the Metropolis Management Act of 1855 is deemed to be a sewer, is therefore vested in the London County Council. NEW ROADS. The new roads laid out include Percival Road, Observatory Road and Lynton Road, all in East Sheen. WORKING CLASS HOUSES. No workmen's cottages or flats proper have been erected during the year, although a considerable number of flats and smal villas at rents from 11/6 to 12/6 per week have been erected. With regard to the number of workmen's dwellings generally, very few, with the exception of those erected by the Council, have been erected during the last few years, and as several workmen's cottages have been closed during the year, there is a demand for workmen's dwellings at the present time. NEW BUILDINGS. All new buildings are inspected throughout construction from start to finish, and a record kept of the various points in connection therewith. Until all the requirements have been complied with, the habitation certificate is not issued. Particular attention is paid to the drainage and sanitary appliances generally. Plans approved for Dwelling Houses, Flats and Shops 100 Alterations or Additions to Dwellings 42 Number of Dwellings Certified 225 Seeing that so many dirty and squalid houses are due to the neglect of the tenant and not to the landlord, the following section 24 Sanitary Circumstances. (46) of the Public Health Act 1875 might be applied more often than it is. It states that "If the Medical Officer of Health or two medical practitioners certify that any house, or part of a house, is so filthy as to endanger health, or that the whitewashing, cleansing or purifying thereof would tend to prevent infectious disease, the sanitary authority may require the owner or occupier to cleanse, etc., and in his default may do what is necessary and recover expenses." FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT. The Factory and Workshops Act of 1901 has been one cause of great social reform and a general boon to mankind. Arising out of the fundamental principles of this Act, great industrial concerns like Rowatree's Cocoa Works at York provide meals, recreation, games, teach trades, have cadet corps, bands, swimming baths, gymnasium classes of all sorts, Swedish drill, and even a fire brigade. The workplaces are light and airy and made artistic with flowers, and the services of a whole time doctor and dentist are always available. It is hoped that the recent Tuberculosis regulations will in their way bring about another great social reform not only in private but in industrial life generally. A Table is appended, showing the number of inspections made, notices served, defects remedied, also the number of outworkers and registered workshops.

COMMON LODGING HOUSES. There are no Common Lodging Houses in the District. DEFINITION OF COMMON LODGING HOUSE. That class of lodging house in which persons of the poorer class are received for short periods, and, though strangers to each other, are allowed to inhabit one common room. The term does not include inns, public houses, or lodgings let to the upper and middle classes. The Barnes Urban District Council have in force byelaws with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family in the Urban District of Barnes. For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. For separation of sexes. For the registration of houses so let or occupied. For the inspection of such houses. For enforcing the provisions of privy accommodation for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. For the cleansing and limewashing, at stated times, of the premises, and for the paving of the courts and courtyards thereof. For the giving of notices, and for the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease. The special point to be noted is that under these byelaws, the landlord is made liable for structural repairs, drainage, ventilation, and general cleansing, whilst the tenant is responsible for the management and cleansing of his own rooms. Sanitary Circumstances, 27 For work done under this heading reference should be made to Table on page 55. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. This is an adoptive Act, and permits Local Authorities to provide for cleansing and disinfection of persons infected with vermin. Any person requiring cleansing from vermin may apply to have free use of any bath or apparatus provided for the use of cleansing the person and the clothing of the applicant. The use of such apparatus, etc., is not to be considered parochial relief—Local Authorities may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants. The need for the adoption of this Act has become very apparent since School Medical Inspection was started. It should, however, be remembered that cleansing a verminous child, and then sending him home to sleep in a verminous bed is of no use. There must be a thorough house cleansing at the same time. Under this heading it is interesting to refer to Section 122 of the Children Act, which states that "if the School Medical Officer is of opinion that the person and clothing of any child is verminous or in a foul and filthy condition, notice shall be given to the parent or guardian to cleanse the person and clothing of the child in 24 hours. If this is not done, the child may be removed from the school and properly cleansed in su itable premises. It also states that should the child get filthy and verminous again the parent or guardian on conviction will be fined not exceeding 10s." The probabilities are that the child will become verminous again because the home conditions have not been dealt with. 28 Sanitary Circumstances. NOTIFICATIONS OF DIRTY HOMES BY SCHOOL NURSES. Number of Notifications received in 1912 11 Number of Homes visited by stuff of Public Health Department 11 Number of Homes disinfected 7 Number of Notices served upon owners in consequence of these visits 5 Any other points of interest (e.g.) efficiency of methods of dealing with rooms infested with vermin:— After notification of a verminous condition by School Nurses, an Inspector visits the home, when, if necessary, cleansing and disinfection are done, but in many cases the actual and only clothing is infested and the boy or girl is probably absent from the home. This is where a cleansing station would be of great value. DRAINAGE. For Urban Districts which have adopted the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1890, the interpretation of "drain" is different. Whereas under Public Health Act, 1875, if one or more houses drain into a common pipe such common pipe or combined drain is a sewer; under Section 19 of the Amendment Act, the common pipe is deemed to be a sewer only if all the houses belong to one owner; if they belong to more than one owner, then the common pipe is a drain repairable at the owner's expense. This amendment is confusing and difficult in its working. REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF REFUSE. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 10,164 loads, and up to within the last few months, the refuse has been disposed of by barging away, but is now disposed of by being burnt in a Heenan and Froude Refuse Destructor having three of the Sanitary Circumstances. 29 firm's trough grates. The new system has not been long enough in vogue to obtain definite figures, but it is hoped to effect a saving of at least £50') per annum over the barging away system. There are only 4(i known fixed brick receptacles for rubbish, all the other houses are provided with moveable dustbins. As the fixed receptacles become delapidated, they arc replaced by sanitary moveable bins. The water-carriage system prevails throughout the district or the removal of human excreta. DRAINAGE AND SEWERS. The district is drained on the separate system, all rain water from roads and footpaths and the greater part of the roofs and areas of houses, is taken into the surface water drains, discharging directly into the Thames. The sewage is drained by separate sewers and delivered into the trunk sewers of the Richmond Main Sewerage Board; by these sewers it is carried down to the Board's works at the extreme western end of the district, where it is treated chemically and bacteriologically', the effluent discharging into the Thames. In 1903 the Barnes Urban District Council drew up regulations with respect to Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops on the model Byelaw scheme of the Local Government Board. 1. For prescribing and regulating the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, drainage and water supply of Cowsheds and Dairies in the occupation of persons following the trade of Cowkeeper or Dairyman. 2. For securing the cleanliness of milk stores, miikshops and of milk vessels used for containing milk for sale by persons following the trade of Cowkeepers or Dairymen. 30 Sanitary Circumstances. 3. For prescribing precautions to be taken by purveyors of milk and persons selling milk by retail against infection or contamination. The "New Milk" and Dairies Bill for 1912 will shortly become law. Its main objects are:— (a) To provide for the more efficient registration of dairies and dairymen. (b) For the inspection of dairies and the examination of dairy cows. (c) For the prohibition of milk supplies suspecting or likely to cause infectious disease including tuberculosis. (d) For the prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk. (e) For the regulation of imported milk. (f) For the issue of regulations having for their object the securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. (g) For the establishment in populous places of milk dep&ts for the sale by local authorities of milk specially prepared for infants. (h) A sanitary authority may refuse to register or may remove a dairy from the register if the premises are unsuitable. In many districts it is highly desirable that the Medical Officer of Health should have security of tenure of office, as some of his work may be disagreeable to farmers and dairymen who may constitute his council. MILK. This year regulations have come into force with regard to preservatives in milk and cream. As regards milk, whether as it comes from the cow or separated, skimmed, condensed or dried, no preservative shall be School Work. 31 added if it is intended for human consumption. Preservative substances mean only those which would retard the onset of sourness or decomposition or would neutralise sourness in milk or cream. As regards cream, if there is less than 35 per cent. of milk fat in it, no preservatives may be added. If there is more than 35 per cent. of milk fat in the cream, boric acid, borax or hydrogen peroxide may be added. In no case may any thickening substance be added to cream such as sucrate of lime, gelatine or starch paste. Any receptacle containing preserved cream must be plainly labelled as such and the amount of preservative used stated. There are no cowsheds in the district and all the milk is imported. Small general dealers are being discouraged to continue the sale of milk. The following table gives the number of shops and the number of visits made during 1912. No. No. of Visits. Dairies and Milk Shops 35 121 SCHOOL WORK. A good deal of school work is done by the Medical Officer of Health, especially in the investigation and inspection of the nonnotifiable diseases, such as Whooping Cough, Measles, Ringworm, etc. The schools are visited and further particulars got from the teachers, after which the homes are visited, and general advice given. It is astounding, however, how many people do without medical aid to what often means the detriment of their children. Sick school children should be compulsorily treated by the Education Authority, if their parents are not in a position to pay for medical treatment. Such compulsory medical treatment should be at a central school or clinic, or in a central dispensary, and in other 32 School Work. cases by home visiting. It is fairly frequent when visiting a school child to find infectious disease such as Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, which has had no medical attention and has therefore not been notified, and this leads to a further spread of infection. The schools have also been visited with a view to ascertaining their suitability for the congregating and teaching of children, and in a few instances defects have been noticed and the attention of the School Board called to the matter. Taken as a whole, however, the schools in the district are in a quite satisfactory condition. The only fault is with the architect in some cases, and this is not often remediable. During the year two schools were closed for periods of two weeks owing to the prevalence in the vicinity and among its scholars of Scarlet Fever. In both cases the disease was quickly followed by a subsidence of the outbreaks. With regard to the exclusion of children suffering from Ringworm of the scalp, a lamentably unnecessary loss of school attendance is often incurred. If the patches are shaved and washed with ether soap and the head painted with strong iodine, and a linen cap continually worn, no harm can possibly be done to other children in the class. The following table shows cases of non-notifiable disease based on information received from the Head Teachers of the schools. DISEASE. Number.

There are many good dust allayers on the market, and the writer is convinced that their use in class-rooms is conducive to the health of both teachers and scholars. The application is simple and inexpensive, and saves both time and labour on the part of the caretakers. These preparations weight down the dust, and so keep it from mingling with the school air. Dust means disease, and the writer has proved both by chemical and bacteriological experiments in schools, that the air of those class-rooms treated with a dust-laying preparation is five times more wholesome than that in class-rooms not so treated. 34 Sanitary Administration.

The Hospital is situated upon four acres of land, adjoining South Worple Way, Mortlake. The buildings consist of an administrative block, three ward blocks, discharge block, mortuary, laundry and disinfecting station, porter's lodge and several shelters for open air treatment. There is also a small building of galvanized iron and wood for the sleeping accommodation of nurses on night duty. The Hospital contains 42 beds for cases of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Pulmonary Tuberculosis. When the new building is erected for the treatment of acute cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, the beds will number 50. The Resident Staff consists of The Matron, 2 Sisters, 1 Staff Nurse, 4 Probationers, 3 Ward Maids, 1 Laundry Maid, 1 Cook, 1 Kitchen Maid, 1 House Maid, 1 Lodge Keeper (Porter and Wife). Outdoor Staff: 1 Gardener, 1 Assistant Porter (occasionally). During 1912, the total number of cases admitted into Hospital was 149. There have been two deaths: one from Diphtheria and one from Scarlet Fever. 36 Hospital Administration. DISEASE. No. Deaths. Percentage. Diphtheria 46 1 2.17 Scarlet Fever 102 1 0.98 SCARLET FEVER.

Attention is called to the 10 cases found peeling on admission, thus increasing the difficulty of eradicating the disease, for much infection is spread during the early stage of the illness, before it has been recognised. 38 Hospital Administration. DIPHTHERIA. There were 46 cases admitted during the year. The average duration of stay was 25 days.

"CARRIER CASES." Many fresh cases have been detected in the course of tracing the origin of the infection. There are scores of such cases going about, and consequently it seems too much to hope that diphtheria will be eradicated. ENTERIC FEVER. One case only during the year was removed to the Hospital. There were only two cases notified. The Small Pox Hospital is situated at Clandon and contains 21 beds. It is under the jurisdiction of the Surrey Small Pox Hospital Committee. The Barnes Urban District Council provides the ambulance for its own cases. "RETURN CASES."* "When a person is brought into Hospital with scarlatina from a house to which a convalescent patient has been recently discharged, he is known as a 'return case.' In the present state of our knowledge of scarlatinal infection, such accidents are quite unavoidable, as it seems certain that apparently clean cases can harbour the causative organism in the nose and throat for a long time and, jf the circumstances are favourable, transmit it to others. There *Quoted from Dr. Ker's Manual of Infectious Diseases, 40 Hospital Administration. seems little doubt, however, that an ordinary attack of nasal catarrh can greatly increase the potential infectivity of such cases, and the frequency with which a cold in the head follows a warm disinfecting bath on the morning of the discharge of a patient from hospital has led to a modification of this disinfecting procedure. In many fever hospitals the bath is given the night before dismissal, and the patient is quarantined till morning in a clean ward. It is interesting to note that this alteration in method has led to a prolongation of the average interval which elapses before the 'return case' occurs, and at the same time the likelihood of infection is diminished. Other precautions to be taken are the scrupulous isolation of any septic cases in convalescent wards, the separation of convalescent from acute cases in hospital, and care to avoid what may be called intimate contact with susceptible persons after the patient has returned home. For instance, a discharged patient should not occupy the same bed as a susceptible person, should not be indiscriminately kissed by other children, and should, if possible, have cups, spoons, and forks reserved for his exclusive use for a fortnight or more after leaving hospital. Return cases occur in connection with about 3 per cent. of all scarlatina patients discharged from our hospitals. In many instances, doubtless, the occurrence of the second case is a pure coincidence, but in the majority the discharged patient is responsible. Length of detention in hospital cannot be said to affect the number of such cases. Often, indeed, return cases occur after very long detention." No one who has had diphtheria is discharged from the hospital until a bacteriological examination has shown that the throat or nose is clear of diphtheria germs. With regard to Scarlet Fever, patients who have made an" uneventful recovery may be discharged at the end of five weeks Patients with discharge from the nose or ears are kept until well, 41 SCARLET FEVER.

No attention is paid nowadays to desquamation in the latter stages, as the flakes of skin are not capable of giving people Scarlet Fever. It is safer at present, however, to treat the early desquamating cases as infectious. Children who return home with large tonsils are to be considered a possible source of infection, as the Scarlet Fever germs may lurk in the crypts of the tonsils. This is a difficulty which has not yet been solved, for it would be highly undesirable to perform an operation such as removing the tonsils in an infectious hospital. All that can be done is to apply paints and disinfectants. BACTERIOLOGY. The following Table shows the results of Bacteriological Examinations carried out at the hospital during 1912. Result.

Progressive as this Council is in all matters relating to preventive medicine, in no one branch has it done better work than in connection with the control over Tuberculosis. Legislation in regard to this subject has recently advanced rapidly with the notification of Poor Law cases in 1908, and the notification of all cases of lung tuberculosis in 1912, and now in 1913 to the notification of all cases of tuberculosis. In 1912, 106 cases were notified under the order of the Local Government Board making Pulmonary Tuberculosis compulsorily notifiable. Tuberculosis Administration. 43 Compared with 1910, when only 17 cases of this disease were notified, it proves the absolute futility of voluntary notification. In September 1911, the Barnes Urban District Council opened a Tuberculosis Dispensary in the grounds of their Isolation Hospital, and up to the end of that year 22 cases attended for diagnosis and treatment. This year (1912) 58 additional cases have attended and have been given diagnostic or therapeutic doses of tuberculin. This Dispensary was probably the first of its kind to be started in an urban district, and has been of great benefit to the residents. In addition to this work, literature has been distributed to all cases, disinfections made, sputum cups supplied, the expectoration examined in the council's laboratory, and contacts have been either visited at home or asked to attend at the Dispensary. A detailed record has been kept of every person attending the Dispensary. From this small beginning the Council's work has gradually extended, and at the present time there exists what does not exist in any other urban district, nor in many counties. (a) A hospital containing nine beds for all acute and established cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, under the care of a Sister trained in tuberculosis. (b) A dispensary opened two days a week for two hours each day for treatment, and to act as a clearing house for a future course of treatment. (c) A sanatorium containing three beds with two additional shelters for the use of patients requiring open-air treatment chiefly, and for early cases. (d) A laboratory where bacteriological work can be done without the loss of time involved by sending specimens away by post. Under the Sanatorium Benefit part of the Insurance Act, the 44 Tuberculosis Administration. Council is in a position to treat insured and approved persons as well as non-insured, and as our arrangements are complete, and approved by the Surrey County Insurance Committee, patients are being admitted from other County districts for treatment by this Authority. The Medical Officer of Health, who is Superintendent of the Isolation Hospital, is also Tuberculosis Officer to the District Council, and is a whole time official. Further and permanent arrangements will it is hoped take place soon, and they will comprise the building of a new ward for six or eight beds for established cases of consumption, the building of a larger and more commodious dispensary, and the appointment of a woman Inspector to visit the homes and give homely advice. This 'atter in its turn should lead to the adoption of the Notification of Births Act. "As the administrative control increases in subtlety of method, the disease, it is hoped, will decrease in deadliness, and the vast army of those now marching to the grave will slacken in its stride." The following table shows briefly the number of cases of Tuberculosis notified during 1912 and the results, etc. Notified 106 Dead 28 Attending Dispensary 58 Children of 15 or under 21 Males over 15 42 Females over 15 43 Of the 58 cases attending the Dispensary, 28 are improving, three have died, 13 were subsequently found to be not tubercular, and 14 have left the district or are untraced.

Sanitary Administration. 47 CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The number of cases of Infectious Disease notified during the year is shown in Table on page 59. Of the total number of cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria notified, 87 per cent. were removed to the Isolation Hospital. This fact seems to indicate that the Isolation Hospital is appreciated by the inhabitants of the district. The method employed to remove cases of Infectious Disease to a Hospital should be such, that prompt removal is effected. It is thought that the procedure in operation here is all that can be desired. Particulars of cases of Infectious Disease to be removed to the Hospital are either telephoned to the Public Health Department by the Doctor, or the notification sent by hand to the Public Health Department. These particulars are immediately transmitted to the Hospital and a request made to the Depot for a horse to be sent to the Hospital for the Ambulance. The Porter who accompanies the Ambulance seals up the room till the arrival of the Inspector. After office hours and on Sundays, particulars of cases are sent direct to the Hospital. The Assistant Inspector visits the premises, carries out the disinfection and obtains the following particulars:—Date of attack, School attended, Date of last attendance, Number in family, Number of rooms occupied by family, Occupation of parent, Schools attended by contacts, Milk supply, Existence of library books, Occupations of contacts, if any. Where the occupations of contacts are such that there is a possibility of the infection being carried further, their employers 48 Sanitary Administration. are notified as to the occurrence of infectious disease in the homes. Before returning to work, if they have been excluded by the employer, they are given a certificate signed by the Medical Officer of Health stating that the premises have been disinfected. Contacts of Diphtheria are advised to go to their doctor and have swabs taken from their throats. It would here be appropriate to lay stress on the necessity for swabbing contacts' throats, because, during the past year, such swabbing has revealed the presence of the Diphtheria bacillus in the throats of apparently healthy persons. Clinically there was nothing in the appearance of the throats to indicate Diphtheria, but the result of swabbing proved that the contacts were a danger to others. Where cases are kept at home, the Medical Officer of Health has to be satisfied that such persons are effectually isolated so as to prevent the spread of the disease. In such cases, the purveyor of milk is notified of the existence of their being treated at home, and a separate can or bottle is left at the premises for the occupier's sole use. The can or bottle being destroyed after the illness. The Laundry used is also notified of the existence of the case. After the termination of the case, and the premises have been disinfected, the laundry and purveyor of milk are both notified that the premises have been disinfected. In those cases where library books have been used or have been in contact with the patient either directly or indirectly, they are destroyed at the Disinfecting Station and compensation for them paid to the Library by the Council. All bedding and other articles used by a patient are removed in a special van to the Disinfecting Station at the Hospital. The premises are thoroughly inspected by the Assistant Inspector, and, where necessary, notice is served by the Medical Officer of Health to secure the abatement of any nuisances discovered. Sanitary Administration. 49 When the work is in progress, frequent visits are made to see that the work necessary is properly carried out. By this system of proper inspection and supervision, should further cases occur, one is assured that everything reasonably asked for has been done to improve the hygienic condition of the premises. The occurrence of infectious disease in Schools is dealt with in that part of the Report dealing with School Inspection, page 31, and the method of dealing with Pulmonary Tuberculosis is described on page 42. The notifiable diseases are:—Small-pox, Cholera, Diphtheria (Membranous Croup), Erysipelas, Scarlet Fever, and the Fevers known as Typhus, Typhoid, Relapsing, Continued and Puerperal; also Tuberculosis—pulmonary and non-pulmonary, Epidemic Poliomyelitis, and Cerebro-spinal Fever. With regard to the last two diseases, these were made notifiable by this Council before the Compulsory Order of the L.G.B. came into force.

Much useful work has been done under this Act during the year, and 2,138 houses have been inspected and indexed on cards. As a result of this inspection 641 defects have been found, 347 repairs have been executed, 15 closing orders have been made, and five demolition orders have been made. In future it will be found more convenient to keep in a separate register a record of these properties which are old or delapidated, or on the border line of houses unfit for human habitation. Additional help has been obtained by appointing the Assistant Sanitary Inspector an Inspector under the Act; he will deal with one class of property, while the Senior Sanitary Inspector will do the ordinary routine inspection. The Council fully appreciate the necessity for building new houses for the working classes to replace those closed or demolished, and plans are in hand for the erection of such new houses. Several shops have been converted into private houses in one of the chief thoroughfares, and a street widening scheme is practically matured. The problem of housing the working classes is a difficult one owing to the increasing value of land and building materials, Sanitary Administration. 51 and consequently the difficulty of letting houses at a rental which suits the working man's pocket. The result is the building of flats, which on all points are inferior to the self-contained houses. Report of the Inspector appointed under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. BARNES. MORTLAKE.

Under the scheme it was proposed to acquire all the above premises together with Warings Cottage, land and outbuildings, 6 The Terrace, Burree's Cottages, and land at rear of No. 52 Sanitary Administration. 1 Cleveland Gardens, and a strip of land owned by Mr. Wood, fronting the High Street, Barnes. Warings Cottage and outbuildings, Vine Cottages, Quick's Cottages, Morwenha Cottages, Wentworth Row and Parker's Row, Thorne Cottages, St. John's Row, Burree's Cottage, and 1 Cleveland Gardens, were to be demolished. A road 40 feet wide to be constructed on the lines of the present Malthouse Passage, with an entrance from the High Street for a distance of 110 yards and continued for a further 25 yards to Cleveland Gardens, 35 feet wide. 1 to 7 Malthouse Cottages were to be repaired and proper air space provided at the rear. Six new cottages were to be erected. The estimated cost of the Scheme was £12,800. The Local Government Board on the 27th November, 1912, approved the Scheme, and made an Order requiring the Council to make provision under a re-housing scheme for 120 persons as against 80 originally allowed for. The District Council at their meeting in December, 1912, directed the Surveyor to prepare the plans of the buildings to be erected on the site when cleared. These plans were submitted to the District Council at their meeting in January, 1913, when they were approved. As regards the purchase of the property required, a contract has been entered into with Mr. Burree for the purchase of his cottage and land, otherwise no steps have been taken to acquire other properties.
