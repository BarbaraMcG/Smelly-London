TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1923. The total number of vessels medically inspected during the year was 983, and the total number of cases of illness reported to your Medical Officers was 637, of which number 29 cases were removed to Denton Hospital. Aliens arriving in the Port have been found to be clean, healthy and louse-free. No plague, cholera or typhus infection was introduced. One case of smallpox was admitted to Denton Hospital. No infected rat has been found in the Port. Food and Sanitary Inspections have been carried out in a satisfactory manner. The Board of Trade issued new instructions as to the Survey of Master's and Crew Spaces, during the year ; these differ in a few particulars, some of them important, from those of 1913. Statutory Rules and Orders were issued by the Ministry of Health, under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920. Facilities were given to various representatives of the Health Organisation of the League of Nations, to view the work of the Port Sanitary Authority, during the year. The new motor launch, christened the " James Howell," was taken delivery of on the 8th February, and has proved very satisfactory in working. The Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended to this Report. TABLE I.—MEDICAL INSPECTION. From 1st January to 31st December, 1923. (a) Gravesend. Jan. Feb.

This man was seen by a native doctor from the shore at Bimlipatam ; the man died on the 22nd April and was buried at sea the same day. A third native was sent to hospital with diarrhoea, but was discharged well on the third day. Native crew's quarters were fumigated with sulphur and washed down with carbolic acid. Crew joined the ship at Calcutta, and the first case developed the day after leaving port. The Calcutta water in tanks was all pumped out, tanks cleaned and cement washed and only condensed water used on board until ship arrived at Madras, when a fresh supply of water was taken in. ss. " Inventor " arrived from Calcutta on the 24th September, 1923. Ports touched at during voyage Colombo, 25-8-23; Port Sudan, 7-9-23; Suez and Port Said, 10-12-9-23. Water taken in Calcutta, 16-8-23 ; Suez, 10-9-23 (after disinfection and cleansing of tanks). On the night of September 7th, the 5th engineer complained of pain in the belly and vomited up oranges and monkey nuts. There was no diarrhoea. On the 10th he was worse and temperature rose to 100 degrees. He was moribund when vessel arrived at Suez, 10th ; died at 6 p.m. Body landed at Suez. All rooms and crew's clothing were fumigated. Water tanks emptied and cleansed, and fresh water supplied at Suez. Crew all inspected at Gravesend and found well. Vessel proceeded to Liverpool later on landing 18 or 19 stewards for ss. "Intaba" in London. No fresh cases occurred. A telegram was received from Suez to the effect that result of bacteriological examination was negative to cholera. 9 SUSPECTED CASES OF PLAGUE AND CHOLERA. Circular No. 437 of the Ministry of Health, dated 31st August, 1923, is a reminder to Port and Riparian Sanitary Authorities that all suspected cases of Plague must be reported promptly to the Ministry of Health, and material forwarded from such cases, for bacteriological examination ; under the International Sanitary Convention of Paris, 1911—12, the Ministry is under an obligation to notify the Governments of all countries participating in the Convention immediately on the occurrence of any cases of Plague or Cholera in this country.

On the 20th February, a native cook was landed at Port Sudan with a swelling in the groin of 4 days' duration. Information received that bacteriological examination proved negative as regards plague. The crew's quarters were disinfected, and effects landed with patient. ss. " Natia " arrived from Buenos Aires on the 19th April. A seaman was ill on board with a septic bubo in the groin. Patient was removed to Denton Hospital for observation on the 19th April, and discharged on the 30th April. Diagnosis, groin abscess. ss. " Narkunda " arrived from Sydney on the 12th May. A lascar was taken ill on board on May 23rd with tender glands in left inguinal and femoral region. Patient was removed to Denton Hospital for observation on the 25th May, and discharged on the 7th June. Diagnosis, groin adenitis. PLAGUE (Suspected). ss. " Macedonia " arrived from Bombay on May 18th. Ports of Call—Aden 3rd May. Suez 6th „ Port Said 7th „ Marseilles 12th „ Gibraltar 14th „ Plymouth 18th „ Illness reported by the Master—1 death, heart failure ; 1 bubo. On May 7th, a first-class passenger died suddenly at Port Said, the Surgeon's report on this death being as follows :— " I was called in on May 7th, at 7-45 a.m., and found this passenger lying dead on his back in the cabin. No signs of injury, foul play or suicide. Small bruises on head (trivial). I had not seen him before. He looked a strong man. History from fellow passenger :— He got up as usual about 6-30 a.m. Never complained of being ill. At 7-30 he came down to cabin, saying it was dirty on deck (coaling). At 7-35 (about) the fellow passenger went for his bath and returning in 7 or 8 minutes, found Mr. W. —— dead on the floor. I reported case to Commander and Consul. The latter held an inquest and returned death from natural causes. Body buried in Port Said." B 2 10 There were no buboes or any indications of plague on body. No post mortem examination appears to have been held, and the body appears to have been buried in two or three hours. The P.M.O. certified death from heart failure. On arrival at Marseilles, on May 11th, the following telegram was received : " First-class passenger died suddenly aboard " Macedonia " and buried here. Heart failure certified. Quarantine now declare W —— died plague." At Gibraltar, Health Authorities stated that " bacillus resembling plague " had been found. At Port Said, the doctor informed ship's surgeon that he had no intention of doing a P.M., and there is no information as to when this was done, if at all. The history seems somewhat incompatible with plague. No dead rats were found during the voyage, but 40 or 50 live ones were caught in traps. One dead rat was found after vessel had docked in London ; this was examined and found free of plague infection. Poison was laid down. The vessel was kept under strict observation while in the Port with a view to determining whether a rat infection existed on the ship. The difference between the treatment of this vessel under suspicion, and that of vessels on which there is known or inferred infection, consists in suitable precautions as to prevention of rat transference carried out during discharge of cargo in dock. No morbidity or mortality among the rats was found on discharge of cargo. A complete disinfestation resulted in the killing of 40 rats which were distributed as follows :— 1st Saloon Galley 7 2nd-Class Saloon 16 Engine room casing 1 Native quarters aft 9 Bathroom aft 1 Electrician store 1 lst-Class Pantry 3 Native store room in No. 1 Hold 2 Total 40 These, with the rats which were trapped, were examined for plague, the results being negative. The case of bubo reported, was -venereal. The names and addresses of all passengers and crew were taken and notified to the various Medical Officers of Health—Passengers, 259 ; Crew, 119. ss. " Clan Macvicar " arrived from Calcutta on the 4th August. Ports touched at :—Colombo, 5th July ; Malta, 26th July. On the day of arrival at Malta, a coal trimmer developed swollen testicle and small gland in the left groin ; Temp. 101. On examination by the Port Doctor, venereal disease could not be found and the man was landed as a suspected plague case. The forecastle was "fumigated. Bedding in firemen's quarters taken ashore and disinfected. No dead or sick rats were seen. ss. " Baron Inchcape " arrived from Sourabaya on the 3rd September. On the 22nd August a native fireman reported sick with bubo under left arm, fever temp. 101. Bubo slowly enlarged. Temp. 100—102. Very sore to the touch, and on the 24th looked as if it were ripe for opening. No wounds or sores on hand or arm. Patient was isolated and landed as a suspected plague case at Algiers on the 24th August. Patient had not been ashore since the 24th June, 1923. Effects were landed with patient. No disinfection of ship done. No rats seen. Information from Algiers showed the case to be not plague. 11 TABLE VI.—Remittent and Relapsing Fever. Date. 1923.

The recent statement by Mr. Justice McCardie on Tubercle infection will go a long way towards that instruction of the public in matters of " infection " which is the necessary precedent to any very large amelioration of the conditions under which they live and die. It will be more generally received, as being the judgment of one of the laity whose words were well weighed and in accordance with the medically known facts. The bacillus of consumption—the tubercle bacillus is difficult to kill because of an envelope of fatty material which prevents to a certain extent the entry of disinfectants into its body. This protective coat on the other hand, prevents the drying out of the tubercle bacillus so that it can persist outside the body for many months in the living and infective state. The difficulty of killing the tubercle bacillus inside and outside the body by agencies natural or artificial is largely dominated by the protective coat. This difficulty outside the body is intermediate between that for the germ of erysipelas and that for the heavily-coated anthrax spore, being much greater than for the one and much less than for the other. The variable period of incubation of tubercle within the human body is prolonged to such an extent that the original source and time of infection become often only matters of speculation. The immunity to attack of individuals placed under the same conditions varies widely and in general increases with age. Immunity also varies for the individual according to his state of resistance, a complicated state summed up in the term " health," at the times of exposure to attack. These variations in and prolonged incubation after infection have clouded the eye of the public as to the infectious nature of the disease. Attention is now justly directed to one of the sources of infection in tubercle, i.e., infected premises. The procedure of the Port of London Sanitary Authority for upwards of ten years has been to notify cases of tuberculosis introduced into this country through the Port to the Medical Officers of Health of the district in which the addresses of destination of the cases are situated, and to disinfect the cabin or quarters occupied and infected on ships. The notifications have included cases of pneumokoniosis (silicosis, miners' phthisis, knife grinders' disease), because in times past these cases have been recognised to be frequently complicated by tuberculosis. Certain recent experiments have shown that a state of silicosis renders animal tissues receptive of the tubercle bacillus and is conducive to the growth of the bacillus in otherwise immune subjects ; thus such notification is justified in order that the tuberculous element in a case of pneumokoniosis might be decided to be present or absent and precaution taken accordingly ; as the name miners' phthisis implies, this discrimination is not easy on the signs and symptoms of the disease, but can be made by miscroscopy. The Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908 and 1911, are addressed to Councils—County, City, Borough and Urban—to medical practitioners and to all others whom it may concern, but not to Port Sanitary Authorities. The Regulations are not adapted to Port Sanitary work. The Port Sanitary Authorities (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1920, define "infectious disease" as "any epidemic or acute infectious disease." The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908 and 1911, give pulmonary tuberculosis as " an Endemic " and " infectious disease " in the preambles. Thus tubercle is an endemic and chronic infectious disease and the position of Port Sanitary Authorities in regard to this disease is not met by the 1920 Infectious Diseases Regulations. Any work done by the Port Sanitary Authority in tuberculosis is therefore without legal basis though the recent dictum from the Courts suggests its importance to shipping companies and to Public Health. In general, Shipping Companies are well advised by their Medical Officers in this matter of tubercle infection and the work of disinfection proceeds smoothly without authorisation. 20 The application to Port Sanitary Authorities of some such short regulations as follows would suffice to regularise procedure :— " Upon the receipt of any notification or information that a case of pulmonary or otherwise infectious tuberculosis exists on board any vessel, the Medical Officer of Health shall make such enquiries and take such steps as may appear to him to be necessary or desirable for preventing the spread of infection and removing conditions favourable to infection. " The Medical Officer of Health may require the master to take or assist in taking such steps as, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, are reasonably necessary to prevent the spread of infection by any such person, and for the removal of conditions on the ship likely to convey infection. " The Master of any ship shall (a) Notify forthwith the Medical Officer of Health of any case of tuberculous disease on the ship, and of any circumstances on board the ship likely to lead to infection or spread of consumption. (b) Furnish the Sanitary Authority and the Medical Officer of Health with all such information as may be reasonably required by them for the purposes of these Regulations. (c) Comply with any directions or requirements of the Sanitary Authority or the Medical Officer of Health given or made in pursuance of these Regulations. (d) Give all such assistance to the Sanitary Authority or the Medical Officer of Health as may be required by them in the execution of their duties in pursuance of these Regulations." I recommended the submission of the latter half of this Report to the Ministry of Health with a view to determining whether such Regulation is as feasible, all circumstances considered, as it is desirable in the interests of Public Health.

A rather severe visitation of malignant malaria occurred on board ss. " Garth Castle," which arrived on the 20th April. This was extensively noted in the newspapers. A feature of the epidemic was that in 20 cases there were 8 deaths. The ship was coasting from Cape Town via Durban, Delagoa Bay and Beira. About ten days after leaving Beira, illness began to appear amongst the crew and passengers. Delagoa Bay and Beira at this season of the year, the end of the rainy period, were insufferably moist and hot and the clouds of mosquitoes a marked feature of this particular voyage, particularly at Beira. The cases were characterised by the usual variety found in malignant malaria ; excessive vomiting, coma, deep jaundice and the customary fever were the features of different cases. There was no question as to the diagnosis of the illness, and your Medical Officer immediately gave all the facts to the Ministry of Health, in continuation of a procedure which has in the past, and will more in the future, lead to practical result in the regulating of ships visiting very definite malaria centres. The disease, malaria, is usually not very fatal owing to the remedy, quinine, which usually acts as a charm in allaying all symptoms, but the virus and organism which lives in the blood cells is not easily eradicated from the human body and like that of syphilis tends to cripple the capacity of the sufferer rather than to kill outright. 23 It is well recognised at the Ministry of Health, in all centres of Tropical Medicine, in the Royal Navy and Army, and amongst Port Sanitarians that the disease is one of the greatest problems of a colonising nation. It is, therefore, a matter which is constantly before your Worshipful Committee. A policy with regard to shipping and this disease will eventually emanate from the Government. In the meantime your Medical Officer wrote to the Union-Castle Mail S.S. Co., Ltd., in the terms added hereunder, as these contain the pith of that knowledge which should be gradually diffused throughout the whole of the shipping community in order to the prevention of such states as occurred on the " Hunstanworth " and now the " Garth Castle " amongst ships recently arriving :— 23rd April, 1923. The Union-Castle Mail Steamship Co., Ltd., 3 & 4, Fenchurch Street, E.C. 3. Dear Sirs, I would ask you to make the following facts known to all your masters and surgeons of ships using malarious ports. (1) Quinine is the only effective drug known in cases of malaria. It is extremely effective. (2) Where malaria is suspected, quinine should be immediately resorted to. If the patient be vomiting excessively or be comatose, the dose of quinine can be inserted into the rectum or into a vein. In the average case the drug can be taken by mouth in the early stages and will prevent the appearance of the more dangerous manifestations noted above. (3) Quinine prophylaxis is quite useless unless practised in the presence of the mosquito and at biting time. The dangerous mosquito usually bites from dusk to dawn ; the time for a preventative dose, therefore, is just before dusk, but its preventative effect has usually worn off before cease-biting time. Morning and mid-day dose, or doses, taken while at sea, are useless as a preventative. (4). A preventative dose is five grains taken at dusk. As the infective mosquito is most prevalent ashore the man to whom the dose is most useful is the man spending the evening or the night ashore. (5) A dose in treatment is ten grains, or more in urgency, repeated every six hours until effect is produced, the treatment being then continued with lessened doses. (6) Quinine is rapidly voided from the body ; it is necessary for full effects to repeat the dose at regular intervals so as to have the drug always in circulation in the blood.

I had an interview with Dr. King of the American Consulate General with regard to the issuing of a certificate to those steamship companies which comply with the rat regulations, and whose steamers while in the Port can be certified to be free of rats. I attach a copy of Dr. King's letter to the steamship companies concerned which embodies his arrangements with this Authority. The certificate issued by this Authority, if produced at the American Consulate, exempts the vessels from the fumigation arrangements of the United States of America and is thus the complement of the fumigation certificate issued by this Authority. The arrangement is working smoothly and is in accordance with the obvious absence of necessity for routine fumigation. The charge made for certification is one guinea. American Consulate General, 18, Cavendish Square, W. 1. October loth, 1923. Gentlemen, With reference to the certificates which certain vessels should present to the quarantine officers at American ports, showing observance of precautions against rats while in this port, I have to inform you that an arrangement has been made whereby the Inspectors of the Port of London Sanitary Authority will hold such vessels under observation during their stay in port, and the certificates will be issued by the U.S. Public Health Service Officer at the American Consulate General upon information supplied by the Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. These certificates will be required at American Ports in case of a vessel desiring an extension of the six months' period after fumigation in accordance with the U.S. Quarantine Regulations. Vessels will not require such certificates until after the six months' period has elapsed. In case a certificate is desired, the agents of the vessel should so inform the Medical Officer of Health, Port of London, immediately upon, or in advance of, the arrival of the vessel, in order that steps may be taken to have the vessel under proper observation while in port. The notification to the Medical Officer of Health should be made by letter, a carbon copy of which should be sent to the U.S. Public Health Service Officer at the American Consulate General. The certificates will be issued by the U.S. Public Health Service Officer at the American Consulate General, or in his absence by a consular officer, upon the presentation of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health, Port of London, certifying that the vessel has observed the specified precautions against rats. The certificate from the Medical Officer of Health should be previously obtained and presented at the time of application for the American bill of health. A copy of the form of the certificate is herewith enclosed for your information as to the precautions to be observed against rats. Surgeon. U.S. Public Health Service. FUMIGATION BY HCN. GAS. During the year a new apparatus for the fumigation of vessels by means of Hydrocyancic Acid Gas has come into use, and is of such simplicity of type as to remove many of the dangers attendant on other methods in vogue and thus become a possible rival of Sulphur Dioxide in general fumigation. The dangers of the gas, however, will never be eliminated. It is essentially a rapidly lethal gas, but the production of the gas by means of liquid Hydrocyanic Acid sprayed into the chamber to be disinfested from a long handled nozzle represents a great advance as one of simplicity in cyanide fumigation. The evaporation of the sprayed liquid renders this a cold vapour and produces a primary sinking of the mass of vapour in the hold for diffusion later. The alteration in the relative specific gravities of the gas as compared with air at normal temperatures is a useful feature of the process allowing as it does of greater control of the vapour. The methods of cyanide fumigation in use have been fully analysed and described in a brochure produced by the Ministry of Health and written by Drs. Stock and Monier Williams. 37 TABLE XXIX.—Rat Precautions.—U.S.A. Requirements. In accordance with the order of your Worshipful Committee, certificates specifying the precautions taken to prevent the ingress of rats from shore to ship, while in the port, were issued in respect of the following vessels :— Date. 1923.

All vessels from foreign ports are visited by a Medical Officer. The questions put by the Customs Officer and the answers made by the Master are heard by him and all cases of reported sickness during the voyage examined or enquired into. Ships from ports in the Eastern Hemisphere, south of latitude 45° N. (except European ports west of longitude 20° E.), and ships from ports in the Western Hemisphere south of latitude 30° N., are considered as from " infected ports " and are boarded and examined whatever the report. Ports or rather coastlines containing ports are added or exempted according to reports of the movement of infection. Medical examination under this system, whether in spite of a negative or because of a positive report of illness, has from time to time led to the detection of serious conditions of infection. On proceeding, these ships come again under scrutiny by a Sanitary Inspector while in dock, special attention being given to those on which there has been suspicious circumstance during the voyage. The initiation of this form at a late date in the year implies its compilation from records which are incomplete. TABLE XXXII.—Form C. Methods of Rat Destruction Employed. Name of Vessel.

The existing plant for disinfecting and disinfesting at Denton lias stood the test of many years as to its sufficiency in dealing with shipping at Gravesend where major infectious disease is naturally chiefly met with. The approach by causeway from the river is somewhat difficult in the handling of infected articles in quantity, but the case of any ship seriously infected in which the present apparatus and approach though inconvenient have proved insufficient has not occurred. In the bathing of a number of persons—contacts—difficulty is met with; but the bathing is in general only a subsidiary point enabling that the persons' clothing be secured for disinfection. In the case of de-lousing, an effective lathering of the body with kerosene soap being an important side of the procedure, some more effective bathing arrangements would be desirable if large numbers of persons were to be dealt with. No case for de-lousing, however, has been dealt with. 71 TABLE XXXV. Quantity and Description of Unsound Food Seized and Destroyed for the Year ending 31st December, 1923. Original Packages.

The goods for the manufacture of confectionery were condensed milk, which had either undergone a yeast fermentation or had been returned to this country owing to " caramelisation " and discolouration. The deleterious qualities were removed in the process of remanufacture, and thus the use of a considerable quantity of valuable food material was retained. The goods for distillation consist usually of dried fruits, e.g., dates, prunes, raisins and sultanas, and the material disposed of for the purposes of refining comprised damaged sugar and loose sugar swept up from the floors of warehouses, etc. Disposal of the material was carried out as follows, only those goods which could not be used for some useful purpose being actually destroyed.

Your Medical Officer reported on the new Training Ship " Warspite " as follows :— Total number of boys on board 170. To accommodate 200. Ship's staff on board 18. Two shelter decks—messdeck also used for sleeping, lower deck for gymnasium, etc. Heads on upper deck forward—ample seating and water to lavatories by means of a gravity tank pumped up daily. Drinking water supplied by barge, kept in tanks on board—stated to be about 100 tons ; also used for galley purposes and washing lower mess deck. Sick Bay on board aft away from sleeping deck, 3 beds and night lavatory. Hospital ashore with steam disinfector and attendant. Heating arrangements by hot water pipes, circulating tanks, and feeding baths. General condition good. Food stores in lockers forward. Ventilation good. Cleanliness good. The whole ship compares very favourably with other training Ships in the River. The Training Ship " Worcester " was inspected on the 22nd October, and attention was drawn to the heads in use by 168 cadets on the vessel. The twelve seated trough closet was found to be satisfactory, but it was cased round with woodwork in such a manner as to render the arrangements insanitary. The wooden overhead covering was in such a condition as to cause the whole place to be saturated in wet weather. It was also found that the discharge pipe of the night urinal enters a scupper in board instead of over-side. The matter was brought to the notice of the owners of the Training Ship, and information was received from them in November that the alterations had been effected. TABLE XL.—Sanitary Works. Part I.

This implies a holding at Gravesend of ships carrying the worst class of immigrant and transmigrant pending such examination ; the medical examination under the Aliens Order is made at the same time and thus the Medical Officer is not carried away from the boarding station—the " stop " occurring under the 1920 Infectious Diseases Regulations. 2.—The present state of this class of immigrant and transmigrant is as eminently louse free as formerly it was lousy, owing to de-lousing and cleansing which takes place at stations on the Continent set up for the purpose and especially directed against the transference of typhus fever through its agent of dissemination, the louse. 3.—Intending immigrants settling in England require a permissive certificate from the Ministry of Labour. This holds back a large number of immigrants of that type whose examination was formerly stringent and occupied much time. 4.—The Medical Inspectors engaged in the work at present have acquired a usefully time-saving discrimination and a rapidity in method, by long connection with the Port and the work. It is realised by your Medical Officer that the inspection can only be thoroughly carried out by the Port Sanitary staff under the conditions of a dispersed and straggling port area, if powers of " stop " were given under which vessels carrying immigrants were held at Gravesend pending examination, or alternatively all immigrants were landed at a specified point. Whether this would entail a disability on shipping out of proportion with the object sought, under the circumstances enumerated above, is questionable. However, the point of these remarks is that the present examination must of necessity be hurried and informal and its sufficiency therefore in question. 83 PUBLIC HEALTH (SHELLFISH) REGULATIONS, 1915. The Shellfish layings in the River Thames and within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, range on the south from the Blythe Sands to just beyond King's Ferry Bridge up the River Swale, the whole of the coast line as far as Sheerness and up the River Medway and West Swale, affording feed and foothold for winkles and oysters. Oyster culture, however, is only undertaken in one place, namely Coalmouth Creek, opening into the River Medway. Here, there is one private laying for oysters. On the east bank of the River Medway, from Sheerness to Stangate Spit, there are two stretches of land, namely, the Lappell from Sheerness to Queenboro' Pier and the sand between Queenboro' Spit and Stangate Spit which afford oysters and oyster spat. The proximity of Sheerness and Queenboro' render these "public layings" unfit fishing grounds, especially the Lappell. Spat and oysters are taken from these grounds for culture and relaying in beds outside the jurisdiction. The northern coast line of the Island of Sheppey between Sheerness and Warden Point does not afford suitable foot-hold for shellfish, the nature of the cliff permitting of erosion and the foreshore being either of mud or shingle ; this is in contradistinction to the sands which occur along the Island of Grain and the Hundred of Hoo, as also the Leysdown district in the Isle of Sheppey, where the land behind the coast is flat and erosion does not take place. The East Swale from its proximity to Queenboro' and the flow of the tide over the Lappell is unfit as a ground for collection of shellfish for direct sale to the public. Collection of shellfish for relaying goes on in the West Swale. On the northern side of the estuary, the shore from Holehaven to Havengore Creek is suitable ground for the growth of shellfish, but is deemed polluted from the Chapman Lighthouse to well beyond Shoeburyness, owing to the large and increasing townships of Southend and Leigh and Shoeburyness. From west to east are included the Chapman Sands, the Bargander Sands, Benfleet Creek, Hadleigh Ray, Leigh Sands, Marshend Sands, Southend Flat, Shoebury Sands and the extreme eastern end of the Maplins. Two private shellfish grounds, one to the east of Southend and another in the large " public laying " at Shoeburyness, exist on the north ; both of these come under orders issued by the Port of London Sanitary Authority dated 16th November, 1916, and shellfish are not collected from them for direct sale, though oyster spat and oysters are collected for culture. Similar collection takes place from Southend flat. The whole district from the Chapman Lighthouse to Shoeburyness and further towards the Maplin Sands is under two prohibition orders or private undertakings. Cockles are collected from the whole of the said area and sterilized before distribution for sale, mostly at Leigh. Relaying grounds in use for the Southend and Shoebury district lie in the Rivers Roach and Crouch. I have not been informed of any case of Enteric Fever attributable to shellfish in the Southend district. In the Sheerness district I am informed that seven cases of Enteric Fever have occurred during the past year but in no case traceable to shellfish. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. In the matter of the undeclared typhoid on ss. " Mackinaw," and undeclared chickenpox, which afterwards proved to be smallpox, on ss. " Newlands " during 1922, the Magistrates at Gravesend Police Court, on the 22nd February, took a severe view in both cases. The then master of the " Mackinaw " was fined £10 and costs, while the then master of the " Newlands " was fined £50 and costs. This secures a satisfactory advertisement all around the coast that incoming ships must declare all cases of illness, irrespective of the opinion of the master as to whether the disease is of importance or is negligible. 84 BOARD OF TRADE INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE SURVEY OF MASTER'S AND CREW SPACES, 1923. The 1923 Board of Trade Instructions as to the Survey of Crew Spaces differ in a few particulars—some of them important—from those of 1913. 1.—-The height of spaces in new ships is raised from 5 ft. 6 ins. to 6 ft. clear of beams. 2.—The minimum height of bunks from the floor from 12 to 15 inches. 3.—The specified minimum of 2 ft. for a bunk has yielded to the expression " satisfactory width." 4.—Crew spaces abutting on galley, donkey boiler space or any part of the engine or boiler casing are to be fitted with a lining of " approved " insulating material. If possible, such spaces are to be avoided. 5.—Decks forming the floor of crew spaces may now be of " approved " composition in place of wood 2\ ins. thick as formerly laid down. 6.—The crown of oil fuel or oil carrying spaces are to be oil tight, floored non-inflammably, and without access to the tanks or oil spaces from the quarters which those spaces underlie. 7.—A wood substitute of 2 ins. thickness may now be used for sheathing of an iron deck over a crew space, in place of 2½ ins. wood planking formerly demanded. 8.—Wash places, drying rooms and bathrooms are to be suitably ventilated. 9.—In new ships, single seat properlv partitioned pans of enamelled iron or heavy glazed stone-ware, of hopper type, with a seal and separate and ample flush, are advised. Soil pipes to be 4 ins. in the clear with screwcap for cleansing. In the existing ships such improvements in the water closets as are practicable and reasonable are to be brought to the notice of owners and masters. A special type of closet accommodation to meet the habits of native crews is approved. In a " private suite " arrangement of a master's accommodation, a W.C., or combined bathroom and W.C., may open direct into the space appropriated. This was formerly an arrangement not open to deduction for tonnage, and is still deprecated and discouraged. In the 1913 Instructions, where messrooms are provided apart from the sleeping quarters, the heating arrangements might be fitted in the messrooms. This clause has been cut out leaving the instruction on heating, so that " Proper provision is to be made for heating the crew spaces of vessels in cold weather." In new foreign going ships suitable rooms fitted with baths and /or showers and washing places for the men should be provided. In ventilation, cowls or their equivalents must have a minimum 5 ins. diameter or six square inches for each person berthed in the space to be ventilated, i.e., 3 ins. inlet and 3 ins. outlet. Hospitals are to have 10 square inches ventilation for each person, and to be separately ventilated. A wash basin and separate W.C., if possible, are to be provided. Beds in the proportion of one to 50 of the crew. An entirely new provision is that where deckhands number over twelve and firemen over 18, separate sleeping places for each watch are recommended. For stewards no space should accommodate more than 16 men. All bare iron to be covered with cork cement. In lighting, electric light is to be accepted under approved conditions. Skylights are alluded to as particularly suitable for messrooms. In the directions as to protection from weather and sea it is newly stated that compliance with the regulations and instructions are more readily effected and better maintained when men are berthed in houses or poops above decks rather than in forecastles. Surveyors are to point this fact out to builders and owners. I have only indicated changes in the instructions. These, on the whole, are distinctly in the direction of comfort and hygiene of crews spaces though containing no very drastic points for comment. The recommendation of separate sleeping spaces for 12 to 18 men is a distinct advance, and the suggestion of poop or abovedeck accommodation where possible is one which, allowing of skylights, would solve many of the difficulties of the average forecastle, especially as to light and ventilation. May 29th, 1923. 85 The following is a copy of an Order issued by the Ministry of Health to enable this Authority to make bye-laws dealing with Houseboats. The bye-laws are in course of preparation :— STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1923, No. 812. London, Port of Port Sanitary Authority. The London Port Sanitary Authority (Additional Powers) Order, 1923, dated July 16, 1923, made by the Minister of Health. 68,539. Whereas by Orders dated respectively the 25th day of March, 1892, the 29th day of December, 1894, and the 30th day of June, 1898, the Local Government Board assigned to the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London as Port Sanitary Authority (hereinafter referred to as " the Port Sanitary Authority ") for the Port of London, the powers, rights, duties, capacities, liabilities or obligations of a Sanitary Authority under certain sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, (a) including Section 95 of the said Act relating to tents and vans ; And whereas it is expedient that further provision should be made as hereinafter mentioned with regard to the powers of the Port Sanitary Authority under the said section : Now therefore, the Minister of Health, in pursuance of his powers under Section 112 of the said Act and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf,hereby orders as follows:— 1.—(1) For the purposes of the Orders above-mentioned and of the powers, rights, duties, capacities, liabilities and obligations of the Port Sanitary Authority thereunder, Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, shall apply to a houseboat (as hereinafter defined) as if such houseboat were a tent, van, shed or similar structure. (2) In this Order " houseboat " includes any vessel or boat which is lying in any river ' or water, or on any foreshore within the district of the Port Sanitary Authority and is not afloat at all states of the tide, and which is used mainly or wholly for human habitation, whether such use be temporary or intermittent, or permanent. 2.—This Order may be cited as " The London Port Sanitary Authority (Additional Powers) Order, 1923," and shall come into operation on the date hereof. Given under the Official Seal of the Minister of Health this Sixteenth day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-three. (L.S.) A. B. MACLACHLAN. Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Health. DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT, 1920. (Circular 357). The following is a copy of the circular received from the Ministry of Health :— STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1923, No. 1095. DANGEROUS DRUGS. The Dangerous Drugs (No. 3) Regulations, 1923, dated September 10, 1923, made by the Secretary of State under section 7 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920 (10 & 11 Geo. 5, c. 46). In pursuance of Section 7 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920, I hereby make the following Regulation (which may be cited as the Dangerous Drugs (No. 3) Regulation, 1923) amending the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921. (a) Regulation 15 of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921, shall be amended and shall take effect as if at the end of the regulation were inserted the following words If a foreign ship in any port in Great Britain requires to obtain a supply of any of the drugs in order to complete the necessary equipment of the ship, the master of the ship is authorised to purchase and be in possession of such quantity of any of the drugs as may be certified by the Medical Officer of Health of the Port where the ship is (or in his absence by the Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port) to be necessary for the purpose, the quantity not to exceed what is required for the use of the ship until it next reaches its home port. The certificate given by the Medical Officer or Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port shall be marked by the supplier with the date of the supply and shall be retained by him and kept available for inspection." W. C. BRIDGEMAN, Home Office, Whitehall, One of His Majesty's Principal 10th September, 1923. Secretaries of State. 86 Regulation 15 of the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921, referred to above, is as follows :— 15.—" In the case of a ship not carrying as part of her complement a duly qualified medical practitioner, the master of the ship shall be deemed to be a person authorised to be in possession of the drugs so far as is necessary to comply with the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts, and it shall also be lawful for him, subject to any conditions prescribed by the Secretary of State, to administer and supply the drugs to any member of the crew in accordance with the instructions prepared or sanctioned by the Board of Trade. The keeping of a record of the use of the drugs in the official log in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts shall be deemed to be compliance with the requirements of these Regulations as to the keeping of records." I anticipate there will be very little work in connection with the supply of dangerous drugs, as the order relates to foreign ships, and only deals with the voyage of such ships between England and their home ports. The drugs to which these Regulations apply are morphine, cocaine, ecgonine and dimorphine (commonly known as heroin). HEALTH ORGANISATION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. On the 6th and 7th April, representatives from the following nations were taken to Denton Hospital and the London Docks. These were all doctors in the sanitary services of their respective countries, namely :—Denmark, United States of America, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Finland, Roumania, Austria, Serbia, France, Italy and Czecho-Slovakia. On the 6th, the Launch " Lady Truscott," left Old Swan Pier at 10-30 a.m., with a company of these gentlemen and ladies to the number of thirty-one. Captain C. G. Elliston, the Executive Secretary of the Society of Medical Officers of Health being in charge of the party. Your Chairman was host and your Medical Officer demonstrator. The object was the demonstration of the methods of the Port Sanitary Authority in prevention of entry of Infectious Disease in the Port, as a conclusion to the labours of some weeks during which the foreign representatives had been distributed in small groups in the principal towns of England for the purpose of studying English methods in sanitation. The boarding station and hospital were visited and the administration of the work explained. On the 7th, with the kind permission of the Port of London Authority, the London Dock was visited and in addition to the inspection of food, the cellars and ivory, spice and wool warehouses were visited. Your Medical Officer and Inspector Wetjen conducted the party, explaining details of interest to them. These occasions cannot fail to prove to be of importance in the repair of international health and amenities. On Friday, May 4th, your Medical Officer had a prolonged interview with Dr. L. Heyermans, The Director of Public Health Service, Holland, the subject of his visit being a detailed inquiry as to the procedure in dealing with infectious diseases and in fumigations in the Port of London. NEW MOTOR LAUNCH. The new motor launch was brought round from Wivenhoe on the 8th February. Trials at Gravesend proved the vessel to be handy, reliable, of quite sufficient pace for customary working, namely 8 knots, and to afford shelter and comfort to the crew beyond that of the former launches. This launch, named the " James Howell," has full}' shown the convenience of this tvpe for lower river work. LAUNCHES AND HULKS. " Lady Truscott."—Repairs to rudder and baffle plates were carried out during the year. Also repairs in connection with a fire which occurred in the ash trays under the boiler, on the 14th July. " George Briggs."—Repairs to woodwork and tail shaft were found necessary, and carried out. 87 " James Howell."—A stretcher was supplied for this launch. Hygeia."—Caulking, &c., of the hulk will be necessary in the coming year and has been provided for. Hospital.—A defective tube in the boiler of the Disinfector was made good. The door and its framework at the mortuary were found to be defective and in need of renewal. STAFF. No changes have taken place in the permanent staff of the Authority. Medical Officers.—Dr. Legge was taken ill on the 24th March. Temporary arrangements are in being, Dr. Watson, of Sheerness, carrying out the urgent duties, if any. Office.—Mr. Albrow, Chief Clerk, has been absent on sick leave since March 9th. Sanitary Inspectors.—On the 9th November, Inspector Hopkins met with an accident in St. Katherine's Dock, while boarding the ss. " Argo," and is still absent. CANAL BOATS ACTS. Statutory Rules and Orders, 1923, No. 451. The following order dated July 10th, 1922, has been received :— 1.—(1) Subject as hereinafter provided the Canal Boats Act, 1877 (a) and the Canal Boats Act, 1884, shall apply to every vessel which would be within the definition of canal boat contained in Section 14 of the above-mentioned Act, if such vessel were not registered under the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1921, although such vessel may be so registered. (2) Nothing in this Order shall apply to :— (a) any sea-going ship, or (b) any sailing barge of the class generally known as " Thames Sailing Barge," whether registered in the Port of London or elsewhere. 2.-—This Order may be cited as the Canal Boats Order, 1922. Many boats of the class to which the Canal Boats Acts were intended to apply have avoided compliance by being registered as ships under the Merchants Shipping Acts. This has become more general since the passing of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1921, which seems to permit of such evasion. The evasion affects certain towns in the North more particularly than the Port of London. The Order now issued is not intended to apply to any class of vessels which as a class was not in the scope of the Acts, but in effect brings or keeps within their scope all boats which do not differ in essential characteristics from the ordinary inland trading canal boat. An anomaly had hitherto existed under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1921, under which, of two identical boats, one might be subject to the Canal Boats Acts and the other free from all supervision under those Acts. CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, during the year ended 31st December, 1923. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a " canal " for the purposes of the Act " includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or is not within the ebb or flow of the tide. The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames :— On the right bank— On the left bank— From Teddington downwards :— From Teddington downwards :— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). The entrance to the River Brent. Hay's Dock. Hammersmith Creek. St. Saviour's Dock. Chelsea Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Grosvenor Dock. Surrey Commercial Docks. Limekiln Creek. Deadman's Dock. Bow Creek (River Lea). Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Barking Creek (River Roding). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). The entrance to the Gravesend Canal. Mucking Creek. Cliffe Creek. Thames Haven. Yanlet and Goalmouth Creeks. Hole Haven. Part of the River Medway, and of the Swale. Havengore Creek. River Roach as far as Rochford. 88 RIVER. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows :—- Upper District.— Teddington to Greenwich . Inspector Gray, £130 per annum. Middle District.— Greenwich to Erith Ditto. Lower District.— Erith to seaward limits of the Port of London (including Inspector Berry, £240 per annum. Dart of the River Medwav The docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend District. Central District.— West India Dock South-West India Dock 1 Inspector Elward, £260 per annum. Poplar Dock. 1 Millwall Dock 1 Eastern District.— Royal Victoria Dock East India Dock Inspector Burr, £260 per annum. Royal Albert Dock Inspector Lambe, £260 per annum. King George V. Dock Western District.— London Dock St. Katherine's Dock Inspector Hopkins, £260 per Regent's Dock annum. Surrey Commercial Dock Gravesend District.— Tilbury Dock Left Shore, from Purfleet down Inspector Massie, £250 per annum. Right Shore, from Erith down (2) The total number of inspections for the year was 199, representing a nett number of 121 boats. The remainder, 78, represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 38 (inspected on 59 occasions, or 29.64 per cent. of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous five years being 21.85 per cent). In addition to the above, 12 boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin doors locked, there being no persons on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of boats inspected. (3) With reference to the various infringements of theAct :— 1923. Unregistered Boats.
