ORP 11 ORPINGTON URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL REPORT For the Year 1947 on the Sanitary Conditions and Vital Statistics of the Urban District of Orpington by the Medical Officer of Health. Bromley: kentish times co., ltd., 22, north street. 1 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF ORPINGTON. Health Report for 1947. Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Health Report for the year 1947, this being the twenty-fifth one presented by me as your Medical Officer of Health. The population of the District, as estimated by the RegistrarGeneral for mid-year, was 58,080. The Birth Rate for the year was equal to 19.0 per thousand of population, as compared with 20.0 last year. A decrease took place again this year in the Death Rate, this being equal to 8.6 per thousand of population, as against 9.3 last year. The number of Deaths occurring in Infants under one year of age was 33, giving an Infantile Mortality Rate of 29 per thousand registered births. This compares favourably with the Rate for 1946, viz., 34. During the year, 776 Certificates of Notification of Infectious Disease were received, as against 1,227 last year. This decrease is mainly due to a large decrease in the number of cases of Measles notified. This will be the last Annual Report which I shall be presenting to you as your Medical Officer of Health. May I express my most hearty thanks to all members of the Council, past and present, and to all members of the Public Health Department, past and present. The continued and kindly help 1 have received from everyone has assisted me to spend 25 very happy years in the service of the Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. N. CAVE, Medical Officer of Health. 2 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF ORPINGTON. Public Health Committee. Chairman - H. C. Vickers, Esq. Vice-Chairman R.E. Clough, Esq. G. Allison-Beer, Esq. E. W. Lane, Esq.

Cases of Infectious Disease from this District are admitted to the West Kent Joint Isolation Hospital, and during the year the following number of patients have been treated there:— Scarlet Fever 30 Diphtheria 1 Acute Poliomyelitis 6 Measles 3 Whooping Cough 1 EMERGENCY DOMESTIC HELP SCHEME. The Emergency Domestic Help Scheme administered by the Council in this area under delegated powers from the Kent County Council has continued to function satisfactorily during the past twelve months. Approximately 317 formal applications have been dealt with. Forty-five women have been employed under the Scheme, all in a part-time capacity, although several have worked, on an average, 40 hours a week. A total of 148 cases received assistance, and 297 home visits were made. In only 30 cases was full recovery not made. Of the cases referred to the Department for assistance, approximately 66.6 per cent. were recommended by Doctors, 22.5 per cent. by the Hospital Almoners, 6 per cent. by K.C.C. Health Visitors and Clinic Doctors, 2.9 per cent. by Public Assistance and the remaining 2 per cent. from miscellaneous sources, including the District Nurses. The number of women employed under the Scheme steadily increased throughout the year. The great need now is for married women who wish to work about four or five hours per day, but do not necessarily wish to be employed continuously and who do not mind periods of inactivity between cases. We cannot have too many of this type of worker on the Register, as it is our aim, eventually, to be able to answer any call for help immediately, which is not always possible under present conditions. DRAINAGE. The houses in the main portion of the District are on the water carriage system, and most of the houses are connected to the public sewers. 9 SANITARY STATISTICS. Number of houses connected to the sewers. No. of houses not connected to the sewers. Not of houses not provided with a piped water supply. No. of wells still in use for purpose of domestic supply. 12946 2923 347 13 Sanitary Conveniences. W.C.'s Pan or Pail Closets. Midden Privies. Cesspools No. of No. of houses connected. 15580 263 9 2176 2596 WATER SUPPLY. The mains of the Metropolitan Water Board supply the greater portion of the District. In some outlying parts, however, water is obtained from deep wells, and from rain water collected from the roofs of houses and stored in tanks. During the year extensions of the water mains were carried out at Star Lane, Uplands Road, etc., Downe, and also in Biggin Hill Valley. This involved the laying of approximately 9,880 yards of 4in. mains. The supply has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. Bacteriological examination of the water supplied by the Board is carried out each month, an average of four samples being collected on each occasion. No contamination of the water was found during the year, and there does not appear to be any risk of plumbo-solvent action. During the year 40 samples of water were bacteriologically examined of which 39 proved satisfactory. Two chemical analyses of water other than that obtained from the Board's mains which were used for domestic purposes were made and in each case proved satisfactory. 10 PUBLIC CLEANSING. The collection of house refuse throughout the District is carried out by direct labour, the refuse being disposed of by controlled tipping. In the Northern Area a weekly collection is made, and in the Southern Area once a fortnight. CESSPOOL EMPTYING. The emptying of cesspools is carried out as circumstances permit. HOUSING. 1.
