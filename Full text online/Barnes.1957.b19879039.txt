Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1957. The report consists of two parts — a preface in which reference is made to items of special interest, and an Appendix in which is tabulated the statistics relating to the health of the district, regard being given to the Ministry of Health Circular 1/58. I should like to express my thanks to the Council for their continued help and support in public health matters, and record my appreciation of the good work done by the staff during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROSETTA HILL, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1958. 5 PREFACE STAFF AND DUTIES Miss L. M. Fairclough retired from the position of Senior Clerk in the Public Health Department in May, 1957. She first entered the department as a temporary clerk in November, 1943 and was appointed to the permanent staff in 1946. With the introduction of the National Health Service Act, she was transferred to the staff of the Surrey County Council in 1948, but in 1950 returned to take up the appointment of Senior Clerk in the Public Health Department, a position which she held until her retirement. During these years Miss Fairclough gave invaluable service to this Council and I should like to pay tribute to her excellent work and unfailing loyalty. The vacancy was filled by Mr. G. W. Nickolls, who commenced duty on the 13 th May. Mr. J. M. Shearer resigned from his appointment of Junior Clerk on 15 th July. He was succeeded by Miss Diane Day who started work on 26th August. There were no other changes in the staff of the department during the year. SECTION 'A' — STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA The Registrar General supplies local authorities with "Comparability Factors" in respect of births and deaths, and you will see that these have been used in the compilation of the various statistics. I would explain that the use of the factors supplied by the Registrar General gives corrected figures to the local rates, enabling truer comparisons to be made with the remainder of the country—i.e. as though the ages and sexes of the local population were in the same proportion as those for the whole country. The Borough of Barnes, in the County of Surrey, is situated on the South Bank of the River Thames between Richmond and Putney. One of the great advantages of the Borough is the fact that open spaces comprise almost half of its area, including Richmond Park, the River Thames, Barnes Common, Sheen Common, and other parks and recreation grounds. The Borough is mainly residential in character with some light industry. 6 SECTION 'B' — GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA (a) Laboratory Facilities Public Health Laboratory, Epsom — accepts all pathological specimens and the staff are very helpful in advising in outbreaks of dysentery, food poisoning etc. Colindale, Central Public Health Laboratory — carries out special investigations. Richmond Royal Hospital Laboratory — deals with pathological specimens from the general practitioners. (b) Ambulance Facilities The Ambulance Service is based at Kings Road, Richmond, and comes under direction of the Control Station at Maiden. It is administered by Surrey County Council. (c) Nursing in the Home There are two midwives and eight district nurses working in the area. They are based at 31/32, Ranelagh Avenue, Barnes. There are four health visitors in the district, two based at each clinic. (d) Treatment Centres and Clinics There are two clinics in which infant welfare, ante-natal and school medical services are provided:— (i) Essex House, Barnes. (ii) Health Centre, North Worple Way, Mortlake. These services come under Surrey County Council and are administered by the Divisional Medical Officer, Barnes and Richmond forming a division. The Chest Clinic is held also at the Health Centre, Mortlake. (e) Hospitals The only hospital in the area is the Barnes Hospital, which is now used solely for the treatment of chronic sick patients. It was previously the Barnes Isolation Hospital. The principal general Hospitals serving the area are: — West London Hospital, Hammersmith, Richmond Royal Hospital, Kingston Hospital. The hospital for infectious diseases is:— Tolworth Hospital, Surbiton. Occasionally, cases are sent to the London Hospitals. Maternity cases are booked through the clinics for admission to the Kingston Hospital and in addition a number of patients book at the following London Hospitals:— St. Mary Abbots Hospital, Kensington, Hammersmith Hospital, Ducane Road. 7 REMOVAL OF PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION, Section 47, National Assistance Act, 1948 Under the above Section, the Council has power to apply to the Courts for an order for the removal of persons to hospitals or other suitable accommodation where they are:— (a) suffering from grave chronic disease, or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves and are not receiving from other persons proper care and attention. Twenty cases of old people in need of care and attention were investigated during the year. In one case it was necessary to take action under Section 47 but in the remaining cases the old people either agreed to go into hospital or other arrangements were made at home for their care. The case in which action became imperative was one of an old lady aged 89 years living alone in a flat. She was very deaf, but very independent and determined to manage her own place. Her daughter, who lived quite near, came in each day to provide food. The emergency arose by the old lady collapsing one night and being unable to get back to her bed herself. Her daughter found her on the floor the next morning and called in her own doctor, who advised immediate admission to hospital. The patient was adamant in her refusal to enter hospital. As the situation was now urgent, I submitted a certificate jointly with her own doctor applying for an Order under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act. This was granted and she was removed unwillingly to Barnes Hospital. As the Order was for a period of three weeks only, I visited the patient in hospital to consider applying for an extension. I found that she had settled down happily and was well liked by the staff. She agreed to remain in hospital voluntarily and has, in fact, done so. The last report, at the time of writing, stated she was well and happy. Co-operation with Kingston Hospital remains good. The situation as regards admission of urgent cases has improved, although the position was very difficult in the autumn and winter months on account of the epidemic of influenza. The appointment of the Geriatrician, who visits patients in their own homes to assess their need for admission, has done much to ease the situation. The County Welfare Department is always very helpful in arranging for admission of old people to other accommodation. 8 SECTION ‘F’— PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Generally The incidence of infectious disease during the year was relatively low, apart from the epidemic of Measles. There were 5 cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year as compared with 8 in 1956. There was an increase in the number of cases of Whooping Cough — 37 being notified as compared with 17 in the previous year. Most of the cases were mild. 1957 was the epidemic year for Measles and 606 cases occurred. In the epidemic of 1955 there were 489 cases notified. There were no cases of Diphtheria during the year; the last case notified in this Borough was in 1948. Poliomyelitis There was one case of Paralytic Poliomyelitis notified during the year. The patient, a girl of 15 years, developed the disease about two weeks after returning home from holiday in August. She had severe paralysis of the legs, and was treated in the Western Hospital, Fulham, in the acute stage of the disease, and later transferred to Queen Mary's Hospital, Carshalton, for further treatment. At the end of the year she was still in hospital and reported to be making some progress. There was one death due to Poliomyelitis assigned to this area, although the case was not previously notified. The patient was a young man, aged 21 years, in the Merchant Navy, whose home was in this district. He was admitted to the Isolation Hospital in Dover, where he died, the cause of death being Acute Fulminating Poliomyelitis (Paralytic). Tuberculosis The number of new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 19 as compared with 18 for the previous year. The number of cases of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 4 as compared with 3 in 1956. There were 3 deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis during 1957. Four persons who had been notified as suffering from the disease died during the year — of these three died from that cause and the remaining one was due to other causes. Mass Radiography Unit The last visit of this unit was in April, 1956 and it is not anticipated that a further session will be held before August, 1958. 9 Influenza During the Autumn and Winter months there was an outbreak of Asian Influenza. As the condition was not notifiable it is not possible to say accurately the number of people who suffered from it, but judging by absences from school and places of work, it seemed that there was a very high incidence among school children and young people, although the illness was not severe. There was a very marked increase in the death rate among older people however, there being 7 deaths from influenzal pneumonia during the year as compared with 1 death for the previous year. Smallpox In July there was an outbreak of smallpox in Tottenham. The disease was thought to be brought into the country by a man returning from West Africa. He developed a slight illness and infected his brother who later died of smallpox in a Tottenham hospital. A cleaner working in the laboratory in which a post-mortem was carried out on this patient developed the disease and infected her grandson, who subsequently died from smallpox. A suspected case was notified in this area, the patient being a pathologist who had been present at the post-mortem on the patient who died of smallpox in the Tottenham hospial. He had been well vaccinated and was not ill, but as it was thought possible that he might have a modified form of smallpox, he was removed to Longreach Hospital, Dartford. His home contacts were strictly isolated and vaccinated and all other contacts followed up and vaccinated. Neighbouring local authorities were notified and informed of contacts in their area and the local general practitioners were alerted. Fortunately, after full investigations in hospital it was proved that the patient was not suffering from smallpox and he was discharged at the end of three days. Food Poisoning There were 11 cases of food poisoning notified during the year and of these 8 were from two outbreaks at industrial canteens, whilst the other 3 cases were isolated ones and no cause was found. The details of the two outbreaks were:— (i) 25 people became ill about four hours after lunch at the work's canteen. The main symptoms were vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. In most cases the illness was slight and of short duration. All of the people affected had eaten canned processed peas, which were served at lunch. On investigation it was found that food samples 10 (remains of the meal) yielded a growth of Staph. Aureus coagulase positive and the same organism was recovered from the four opened tins from which the peas had been served. This organism was also isolated from one of the patients. Although 25 people were affected only 8 cases were notified as many of the others had a slight illness and did not report to their doctors. (ii) The second outbreak occurred in a work's canteen about three months after the first. About 24 to 30 people were affected, but in all cases the illness was very slight and of short duration. None of the people reported for medical advice and as all of the cases became ill after leaving work it was not notified to the doctor of the staff until the following morning. No cases were, therefore, notified. No specimen meal was available, but a portion of the meat cooked for the meal and a tin of peas of a similar brand to those served, were sent for laboratory examination but yielded negative results. It was not possible to prove the cause of the outbreak, but it is probable that it was caused by processed peas, as the brand used was similar to that which caused the previous outbreak. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths recorded during the year. Infant Mortality Rate The number of deaths of infants under one year was 9 as compared with 5 for the previous year. The infant mortality rate for this area is 20.4 per 1,000 live births as compared with 23.1 for England and Wales. IMMUNISATION AND VACCINATION Diphtheria and Whooping Cough — Immunisation was continued throughout the year. The combined vaccine was used during the winter months, but during the summer months the separate whooping cough and diphtheria vaccines were used. This followed a recommendation from the Ministry of Health that the separate vaccines were less likely to provoke paralytic poliomyelitis. The immunisation in each case is started when the child is three months old. Smallpox — Vaccination was continued throughout the year, usually following immunisation against diphtheria and whooping cough at the age of six months. 11 Poliomyelitis — Vaccination began to gain momentum during the year, as the scheme had only been started on a very restricted scale the previous year. Children born between January, 1947 and December, 1954, who had been registered were eligible for vaccination, but as the British Vaccine was in short supply progress was slow. The scheme is operated by the County Council under the direction of the Divisional Medical Officer. Tuberculosis — B.C.G. vaccination is offered to every child between the age of 13 and 14. The scheme is carried out by the County Council. Lung Cancer The incidence of lung cancer in this area is higher than the rate for England and Wales, and there is a continued increase in the number of cases. Although the deaths in men is rather less than last year there is a marked increase in the number of women dying from this condition. There is now very strong evidence that smoking plays a large part in causing lung cancer and it has been shown that the incidence is much reduced in people who have previously smoked and given it up. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the first step in the prevention of lung cancer is for smokers to stop smoking. This is often very difficult and underlines the importance of teaching young people the dangers of smoking and so prevent them taking up the habit. 12 THE REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR, Mr. W. L. LEACH, IS CONTAINED IN SECTIONS ‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘E’ SECTION ‘C’ — SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The domestic water supply has been of satisfactory hygienic quality and adequate in quantity during the year 1957. The water is derived from the non-tidal portion of the River Thames, stored in the Metropolitan Water Board reservoirs at Staines, Littleton and Walton, and filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. The Board's waters are not plumbo-solvent. Samples are collected at each stage of purification and in the distribution system daily. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination or of any variation in quality. All repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being returned to service. I am indebted to Dr. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination to the Board, for the following information on bacteriological sampling of water supplies:— Type of Test RAW WATER River Thames at Walton WATER PASSING INTO PUBLIC SUPPLY — Hampton Works. No. of samples taken 50 801 Plate Count per millilitre on agar 20/24 hrs. at 37°C. Average Result 1912 Average Result 3.7 Coliform Test (Count per 100 ml) 8465 99.50% Negative Escherichia Coli Test (Count per 100 ml) 4173 99.75% Negative 13 The average consumption of water in the Board's area during 1957 was 327 million gallons daily. Daily consumption per head:— Unmetered 38 gallons Metered 14 gallons Total daily consumption 52 gallons per head SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Although the work of redesigning and modernising the Sewage Disposal Works has not yet been fully completed, the operation of the plant has been carried out in an exemplary manner and a satisfactory effluent has been achieved. Some difficulty was encountered through the unauthorised discharge of certain trade wastes which can have a very detrimental effect on the purification process. As sewage is brought from all sections of the Boroughs of both Barnes and Richmond it is a difficult matter to trace the offenders. The position is being kept under observation and more drastic steps will need to be taken should this trouble recur. There are still too many cases coming to notice where wash basins, baths and sinks have been fitted in premises where the waste pipes have been made to discharge to the surface water drainage system instead of to the foul system. This causes pollution of the River Thames and is an offence. The Council can order such connections to be cut off. Persons carrying out alterations and conversions should realise that proper notification is required by the local authority before such work is commenced. The condition of certain main sewers in the area is causing concern and the Council have accepted a scheme for renewal and improvement over a period of years. VERMINOUS PREMISES ETC. Rodent Control In the Mortlake and East Sheen parts of the Borough the foul sewers have always been infested with rats. The infestation is heavy in the older parts and relatively light where the sewers are more modern and in better condition. These infested sewers are usually treated twice a year with poison bait but, owing to staff difficulties, these had to be curtailed to one treatment only in 1956 and 1957. The following table shows the results of sewer treatments since they were commenced:— 14 SEWER TREATMENTS Total Number of Manholes on Foul System 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 Number Treated 543 779 680 489 584 398 418 402 275 309 Complete Takes 230 177 121 126 80 96 98 127 32 111 Partial Takes 141 72 103 70 30 19 13 65 63 79 Percentage of Total Treated 68.3 32.0 33.0 40.0 18.8 28.9 26.5 47.7 34.5 51.5 It will be seen from the above Table that steady progress has been made to reduce the rat population in the sewers, over a period of years. The gap in treatments in 1956/57 meant that a corresponding increase in labour and materials was necessary when treatments were resumed, but it is felt that the increase was directly proportional and that little was either gained or lost on account of the gap. We have however reached a stage in these treatments where little further reduction in infestation can be expected unless an intensive, and correspondingly expensive, drive was to be made to eliminate entirely the infestation in the bad areas. The rats occasionally break out of the sewers and trouble residents. They are then dealt with by surface treatments and by the tracing and repair of defective drains and sewers. The free treatment of domestic premises against rats, and in a few bad cases, against mice, has continued at a satisfactory level. Improved methods of treatment have resulted in a diminution in the number and degree of infestations. Residents readily avail themselves of this service but it should be realised that it is relatively more difficult to trace and deal with an odd rat than to treat a large infestation. The following is a summary of work carried out:— Premises visited 436 Inspections made 458 Treatment visits 485 Premises treated 148 Minor Infestations of Rats 140 Minor Infestations of Mice 12 15 Other Pests The number of complaints of vermin have again been few. With modern insecticides most casual infestations can be readily dealt with by householders. The identification of insects, with advice on treatment, is a service much appreciated by housewives who are often unduly worried as to the nature of the infestations. No trouble was experienced with the midges in the Castelnau area, which have been the subject of complaints in previous years. This is no doubt due to the energetic measures taken by the Metropolitan Water Board in the vicinity of their reservoirs. The areas where mosquitoes, midges, etc., are likely to be a public nuisance were again treated early in the season. With so much public open space in the Borough however there is not a great deal that can be done in this direction, except at greatly increased cost. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The Clean Air Act, 1956 is now in force. It brings up to date and improves the old law relating to nuisance from smoke and other forms of atmospheric pollution. For many years it has been an offence to emit black smoke from an industrial chimney. From 1st June, 1958 it will be an offence to emit dark smoke from any chimney for more than two minutes in any one half hour. Dark smoke is smoke of a density which most people would object to on sight. It is rare however for domestic chimneys to emit smoke so dense as to be ‘dark’ smoke and thereby commit an offence. However, the new Clean Air Act encourages the creation of Smoke Control Areas. In these areas only such fuel as will produce little, if any, smoke is allowed to be burnt. This means that all those fireplaces in regular use in the area would need to be adapted to burn a smokeless fuel. In the majority of cases this means the substitution of a modern open fire grate for the old fire grate. It need not mean a new surround also. A gas poker or similar device is, however, needed to start a fire burning smokeless fuel. Electric or gas fires, of course, are already smokeless. The cost of adaption is to be shared by the Government (40%), the local Council (30%), and the owner (30%). The actual cost to the average household is likely to be in the region of £3 per fireplace in regular use. If the householder is a tenant this may mean an addition to the rent of about 1d. per week per grate. (Bedrooms will not usually be considered for grant). In return the householder will get a modern grate with more efficient and cheaper heating. He may lose the sight of leaping flames but will eventually enjoy a longer and healthier life with the satisfaction of knowing that he is getting more value from the same weight of fuel than ever before. 16 It should be remembered that in the London Smog incident of 1952 it is estimated that an extra 4,000 people in the Greater London area died on account of fog associated with atmospheric pollution. Again in early December, 1957, three days of fog and atmospheric pollution combined to cause an estimated 800 to 1,000 extra deaths in Greater London. It is reliably estimated that the cost to the nation through damage to buildings, plant life, fabrics and materials, increased laundry costs, road, rail and air traffic delays, etc., amounts to £300 million per year. This smoke control measure is long overdue and it is hoped that it will be welcomed by all thinking residents. An objection which is sometimes voiced is founded on the widely held belief that coke fires emit poisonous sulphur fumes. When it is remembered that coke is produced from coal only and that nothing is added it will be clear that coal must also contain at least the same proportion of sulphur. However, when raw coal is burned the smell of the sulphur fumes is masked by the smoke. If such fumes are present in a room when coke is burned they must also be present when coal is burned and will do as much or more damage when combined with smoke. The moral is that all flues must be efficient and properly maintained whether coal or coke is burned. At the time of writing this report the Council had adopted in principle the creation of Smoke Control Areas throughout the whole of the District over a period of ten years. Whilst progress must necessarily be slow and the overall cost seem large, smoke control is both a sound economic and social proposition and an insurance against a repetition of the tragic circumstances of the smogs of past years, when the causes and effects were not clearly understood. The results so far obtained, in those progressive areas where private Acts of Parliament enabled smoke control schemes to be established, fully justify the expense and trouble involved in the change over. Needless to say, no schemes of conversion will be put into effect until all problems of supply and adequacy of appropriate fuels have been met. Where the cost of the tenants share would bear harshly on people of limited means, such as old age pensioners, the Council may consider enlarging the proportion of the grant payable in such cases. There will be ample provision for discussion and explanation of the details of the scheme when the programme has been settled. SECTION ‘D’ — HOUSING Action to secure the Closing or Demolition of unfit properties has proceeded slowly. One house which was closed as not being repairable at a ‘reasonable’ expense, having regard to the rent being paid under the controlled tenancy, was sold as soon as the tenants 17 had been rehoused by the Council, was reconditioned and resold at a high figure. This illustrates that the key to the problem of housing repairs and reconditioning lies in the obtaining of vacant possession by the owner. It is still too early to attempt to assess the success or otherwise of the Government's rent reform policy, so far as it is intended to secure the better repair of rented property. A few of the houses marked down for closing or, demolition have been given a new lease of life by the carrying out of extensive repairs. The task of dealing with those remaining on the list was held up by rehousing difficulties. Although schemes to meet this need were finally approved by the Council, the Governments economic policy resulted in a curtailment, and slowing down, of clearance action. The suspension of Improvement Grants and loans for purchase did not help matters but it must be admitted that the Improvement Grants Scheme has never had any success in this area as far as rented property is concerned. A noticeable feature of complaints in recent years has been an increase in complaints of dampness due to excessive condensation. This may be due to the fact that many older properties are reaching an age and condition where internal plaster and wall surfaces have lost much of their absorptive properties. Another reason is the use of impervious and hard surfaced plastic materials for both surface lining and decoration and in the manufacture of household furnishings and equipment. An abundance of this type of covering material, coupled with solid floors, lino or plastic tiling and lack of ventilation, due to draught proofing devices, all lead to excessive condensation. The remedies are many and varied and involve considerations of temperature, humidity and the absorptive properties of both the atmosphere and furnishings in a home. Whether the dampness of condensation is any better or worse than dampness in the structure is a matter for conjecture and perhaps further research. When it was confined to the kitchen and bathroom it was tolerable and usually manageable, but the living rooms and bedrooms appear to be increasingly affected in both modern as well as old homes. Excessive condensation clearly has an adverse effect on the comfort and convenience of householders, if not on their health, and it would be beneficial if the causes and effects of condensation were more widely understood by the general public. The service of Notices of Increase in Rent following on the passing of the Rent Act, 1957, inevitably led to a substantial number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair. The slow and laborious procedure which must be followed to secure an abatement of rent, on account of disrepair, has caused much irritation and criticism from both tenants and landlords. The necessity 18 for the proper completion and service of the numerous forms has resulted in many informal and irregular procedures between landlord and tenant. Now that the initial rush of rent increases and repair jobs is over it would be appropriate to consider whether the tortuous procedure involved in the issue of Certificates of Disrepair could be streamlined to the benefit of all concerned. It is already obvious that, when once the initial manoeuvres concerned with rent increases are completed, there is very little recourse to Certificates of Disrepair. As these have never carried any provision relating to the enforcement of repairs the tenants will revert to the procedure of formal complaint and will expect action to be taken under the Housing and Public Health Acts. It was not found possible, nor particularly desirable, to conduct house to house surveys but action was taken to enforce repairs to houses where the landlord had failed to give a satisfactory undertaking and where essential and urgent items needed attention. Caravan Dwellings A caravan site was established in the Castelnau area where there has already been undesirable development through the erection of small factories and workshops on land being formerly the large gardens of old residential property. The site owner and occupiers would have been able to comply with the requirements of the Public Health Act, 1936 and the Byelaws but as permanent Town Planning consent was not granted proper sanitary facilities were not provided. After protracted legal action the caravans left the site in June, 1956, the last remaining caravan being removed onto the highway where it remained, occupied by man, wife and children, until finally towed away to the Council Depot, in June 1957. This experience showed that, whilst caravans may prove useful for certain types of dwelling accommodation, the establishment of sites in an already crowded area of mixed development is not a satisfactory solution to the housing problem. The very compactness of a caravan leads to the difficulty of finding adequate storage space when the van is occupied as a permanent family dwelling. Inevitably, household belongings and equipment come to be stored under and around the van and makeshift sheds and shelters of various kinds soon bring conditions of squalor and depression. OVERCROWDING The position with regard to statutory overcrowding continues to improve, owing to the special consideration which such cases receive when allocations of Corporation dwellings are made. The number of overcrowded families rehoused during the year was ten. 19 SECTION ‘E’ — INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The implementation of the higher standards of food handling, imposed by the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, has proceeded relatively smoothly with the exception of two main features. These were, firstly, the amount of protection from contamination which 'open food' should receive and secondly, the availability of suitable hand-washing facilities where ‘open food’ is handled. On the question of protection from contamination, attention was focussed on the custom of those shopkeepers who display meat, fish, cream cakes, cooked meats, etc., in positions where other persons may cough or sneeze over, or touch the food with hands and shopping bags, or where dust, dirt, and flies can settle on the food. Most traders agree to afford more protection to the food when requested to do so, but invariably the practice of open display is resumed after a little while. It is obvious that customers in general will buy more if commodities are pushed under their noses. It is only when they don't feel so well, after eating them, that they think to complain ! The Food Hygiene Regulations were designed to ensure the safety of food for human consumption. The Food Byelaws also require that food for sale shall not be placed in such a position that 'contamination' may occur. There has always been doubt as to what 'contamination' means. Dust and dirt, smuts, foreign bodies, such as bits of stone, wood, nails, etc., may all be ,most objectionable when found in or on food, but the question which needs to be settled is whether or not such contamination is actually injurious to health. The fact is that rarely can these 'contaminants' be said to carry those germs which would cause illness or disease. To test this matter a case was taken against a local firm of fish merchants who persistently exhibited open food in such a position that street dust settled on it and where it was occasionally touched by customers, small children, passers-by, flies, etc. Bacteriological tests failed to reveal the presence of any organisms likely to cause illness. The Byelaws appeared to require food to be protected from contamination by dust, etc. The local Magistrates, however, decided that, in the absence of any positive proof that the health of the consumer was endangered, there was no offence. Costs were awarded against the Council. From this it is obvious that the primary objective is 'Safe Food' and physical cleanliness of food is merely incidental. To be certain of the safety of food when handled it is obvious that facilities for proper washing of hands shall be readily and conveniently available. A special survey, involving some 80 food shops, revealed that only about one quarter had the use of a separate washhand basin, the remainder using a sink which was also in use for other cleaning purposes. 20 More than half of the food handlers had to go more than 20 feet away from where the food was handled to wash their hands. In virtually all cases this means leaving the shop. In only 13 cases out of 81 did food handling staff have the use of a proper and separate wash' hand basin after using the toilet, and not all of these had hot water throughout the year. It is obvious that in the majority of small food shops the only facility for hand washing is the domestic sink at the rear of the building. Whether this is a proper 'wash-basin', reasonably accessible, is a matter which the Public Health Committee will no doubt be debating during the coming months, when a more detailed report will be presented. Whilst the vast majority of workers in the food distributive trades are naturally clean and careful workers, there were a few cases where illness and financial or domestic worries led to unsatisfactory conditions, but no formal proceedings were necessary on account of dirty conditions. Experience over many years, however, shows that constant vigilance is imperative. The employees whose job it is to maintain cleanliness in food premises are generally the poorest paid. They do not understand fully the principles of food hygiene and are not prepared to devote time and study to the subject. However, the rule of scrupulous cleanliness in every detail would be sufficient to ensure safe food but, as explained earlier, it is a rule that cannot be enforced. It has been noted that there is a marked difference between the very high standards set by the School Meals Service, the Hospital kitchens, the large non-profit making Works’ canteens, and the conditions applying in those commercial kitchens where large profits and small expenses are the first considerations.

Chemical Analysis. 7 samples of milk were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. These samples, taken from milk roundsmen and local retailers, proved to be quite satisfactory. Table 20.— Sampling of Other Food and Drugs. (a) Chemical Analysis.— 54 Samples procured under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, included:— Foods. Bread Sweets Cakes and Confectionery Sauces Fruit Drinks Soups Jams Tinned Meat Medicines „ Fish Packaged Food Mixes ,, Fruit Pastes 39 Hereunder I give the Public Analyst's reports on the samples examined which were found to be irregular or sub-standard. Whilst no legal proceedings were instituted the matters complained of were taken up with the manufacturers concerned with satisfactory results:— Samples Nos. 69 and 70. — Cream of Mushroom Soup. These products, described as cream soup and which contain no butter fat or less than 1½ per cent. by weight of butter fat, should contain not less than 3½ per cent. by weight of edible oil or fat. Samples Nos. 81, 82 and 83.— Eclairs contain Fresh Cream. These samples contained a substance which resembled cream in appearance but which consisted of imitation cream. Sample No. 80.— Macaroon Tarts made with Butter. The unqualified term macaroon is applied to a baked mixture of ground almonds, sugar and egg albumen with or without other ingredients. The term coconut macaroon is sometimes applied to a similar article prepared with desiccated coconut instead of ground almonds. Sample No. 79.— Cream Boats made with Butter and contain Fresh Cream. The pastry portion of this article contained a total of 22 per cent. of fat of which one quarter was butter fat. Although the cream was genuine cream, the claim that this article was made with butter implies that the whole of the fat used in the preparation of the pastry was butter. There was insufficient fat in the yellow icing to admit of a determination of the proportion of butter fat, if any. Sample No. 78.— Rum Babas made with Butter and contain Fresh Cream. The sponge portion contained a total of 9 per cent. of fat of which only one seventh was butter fat. Although the cream was genuine cream, the claim that this article was made with butter implies that the whole of the fat used in the preparation of the sponge was butter. Samples Nos. 97 and 100.— Megg. The label on the containers in which these articles were sold described the product as Megg and the words 'Meat' and 'Egg' appeared in alternate coloured squares over a substantial part of the labels. It is considered misleading to describe a meat product containing only 65 per cent as meat without qualification. Samples Nos. 101 and 106.— Egg and Milk Loaf. These artides contained non-fatty milk solids to the extent of 2 per cent. and 1.5 per cent. respectively and were probably prepared with skimmed milk powder. This content does not entitle it to the description 'Egg and Milk Loaf'. Egg solids were present as well as a substantial proportion of added fat, but no milk fat was detected. Sample No. 103.— Carltona Frig-Ice. The ingredients of this article as specified on the label were:— Full Cream Milk Powder, Sugar, Dextrose, Vegetable Stabiliser, Flavouring, Colouring. The term 'Vegetable Stabiliser' is a generic and not a specific term and does not indicate the true nature of the stabiliser used. It is not in accordance with the requirement of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. 40 Table 21.— Unsound Food. The following articles were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed as being unfit for human consumption:— Where quantities are insufficient for salvage all unsound food is collected and disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor, by incineration. Meat. Fruit. Bacon lbs. 64 Canned Fruit lbs. 293 Beef lbs. 36 Prunes lbs. ½ Canned Meat lbs. 197 Vegetables. Lamb lbs. 72 Poultry.

The district does not now possess a slaughter-house. No animals were slaughtered for food in this district during 1957.
