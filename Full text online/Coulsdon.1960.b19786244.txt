The health of the District remains good and the vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. One case of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred. The patient was one of three school children not vaccinated in a class of 42. It has recently been emphasised by the Minister of Health that poliomyelitis is especially liable to attack the small number of young people who have not yet been vaccinated and it is hoped that their parents will have them vaccinated against poliomyelitis as soon as possible. Cancer of the lung continues to be the commonest malignant neoplasm as it has been for several years. This is to a large extent a preventable condition as statistics indicate that it is often associated with prolonged and heavy cigarette smoking. Young people should be warned of the risk associated with cigarette smoking before they acquire the habit. In conclusion I should like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their continued support and the staff of the Department for their valuable help and co-operation. I am, Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. B. MORWOOD Medical Officer of Health. 4 HEALTH REPORT FOR 1960 PART 1 AREA AND POPULATION The Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley was constituted by an Order of the Local Government Board dated 1st November, 1914, and came into existence on the 7th April, 1915. It has therefore been a separate District for just over 46 years. Situated on the North Downs and for the most part in the Green Belt it is a well favoured residential area. The District has an area of 11,142 acres, these being distributed among the wards as follows:— Coulsdon East 2,812 Coulsdon West 1,253 Kenley 1,292 Purley 685 Sanderstead 2,311 Selsdon and Farleigh 1,924 Woodcote 865 The mid year population was 70,200 in 1960 as compared with 63,770 at the time of the 1951 census. These numbers include persons resident in institutions and schools in the District, the numbers of which at the end of 1960 were as follows:— Cane Hill Hospital 2,218 Netherne Hospital 1,951 Russell Hill School 221 Reedham School 248 In December, 1960 there were 21,077 occupied houses, distributed as follows:— Coulsdon East 3,583 Coulsdon West 3,223 Purley 2,784 Woodcote 1.824 Sanderstead North 2,611 Sanderstead South 3,169 Selsdon 1,917 Kenley 1,966 This gives an average of 3.33 persons per occupied house in 1960, or 3.11 if the institutional population is excluded. 5 PART 2 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 11,142 Registrar-General's estimate of population, mid 1960 70,200 Population, Census 1931 37,666 Population, Census 1951 63,770 Number of occupied houses, December, 1960 21,077 Number of occupied houses, 1931 9,533 Number of occupied houses, 1951 18,071 Rateable Value, December, 1960 £1,395,668 Sum represented by a penny rate £5,675 VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1960 M F Live Births 1,060 Live Births - Legitimate 552 468 Live birth rate per 1,000 Live Births - Illegitimate 18 22 population 15.1 Corrected 16.6 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births = 3.7 Still-births 12 Still-births -Legitimate 3 9 Still-birth rate per 1,000 Still-births - Illegitimate live and still-births 11.l Total live and still-births 1,072 Infant deaths 20 Infant deaths - Legitimate 11 9 Infant deaths - Illegitimate - - Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births - total 18.8 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births - legitimate 19.6 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births - illegitimate Neo Natal Mortality rate per 1,000 live births (first four weeks) 13.2 Early Neo Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (first week) 12.2 Perinatal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live and still-births (still-births and deaths under 1 week combined) 23.3 Maternal deaths (including abortion) - Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still-births M F Deaths 884 357 527 Death rate per 1,000 population 12.5 Corrected 9.0 6 VITAL STATISTICS The following table gives the average population, birth , death, maternal and other important mortality rates for the quinquennial periods 1920-1959 together with the actual figures for 1960.

It will be seen by reference to the preceding table that this is equal to an annual birth rate of 151 per 1,000 population, as compared with 14.9 in 1959. If this rate is corrected in accordance with the RegistrarGeneral's assessment of the atypical constitution of the population it becomes 16.6 and this is comparable with the birth rate for England and Wales which was 171. Illegitimacy.—In 1960, of the births registered, 40 were illegitimate (18 males and 22 females), this being 6 more than in the preceding year. Stillbirths.—The number of still-births registered during 1960 was 12 (3 males and 9 females), which is 9 less than last year. The local still-birth rate was 11.1 per thousand live and still births. 7 DEATHS The number of deaths registered during 1960 as belonging to this District was 884 (357 males and 527 females), a decrease of 43 compared with the previous year. Of this total 291 deaths (69 males and 222 females) occurred in the mental hospitals. The uncorrected death rate was 12.5, but the corrected death rate which allows for the high proportion of deaths occurring in the mental hospitals is 9.0 which compares with the rate of 11.5 for England and Wales. In order that a more accurate comparison can be made, the records in respect of normal residents have been kept separate from those of mental hospital patients and a full list of the causes of deaths and the ages at which they occurred is given in Tables III and IV. The principal causes of death during 1960 are shown in the following table:— TABLE II Cause. Number of Deaths General Population Mental Hospitals Heart and circulatory diseases 230 115 Pneumonia 20 80 Bronchitis 25 4 Accidents 17 16 Malignant neoplasms other than lung 93 13 Malignant neoplasm, lung 24 — HEART AND CIRCULATORY DISEASE Among the ordinary residents the death rate from heart and circulatory disease was 3.27 compared with an average of 3.85 in the preceding five years. CANCER The number of deaths from malignant neoplasms in the general population was 130. Twenty four of these, i.e. 18% were due to malignant neoplasm (cancer) of the lung. This is to a large extent a preventable condition as it has been shown to be associated with prolonged and heavy cigarette smoking and, to a lesser extent, atmospheric pollution. Young people should be told of the serious risk associated with cigarette smoking before they get the habit. MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS Seven deaths were due to this cause. Motor cycle and moped drivers have become aware of the risk they run and the majority of them wear crash helmets. 8 Motorists can also cut down the risk of serious or fatal accidents by the use of safety belts. During the past year these have become much more used than before but still only a fraction of car users have fitted them. The greatest publicity should be given to the value of safety belts, the ultimate aim being to make them as common among motorists as crash helmets among motor cycle and moped riders.

The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales was 0.39 per 1,000 live and still births. INFANT MORTALITY During 1960 there were 20 deaths among children under one year of age as compared with 19 last year and an average of 16 in the last five years. None of the deaths was in respect of an illegitimate child. The resultant infant mortality rate was 18.8 per 1,000 registered births, compared with an average of 17.1 for the previous five years. The rate in 1960 was the highest recorded since 1955. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales was 21.7. The 14 babies dying in the first month correspond with a neonatal rate of 13.2 (i.e. deaths in the first month per 1,000 live births) whereas the average for the past five years was 13. The 13 babies dying in the first week correspond with an early neo-natal rate of 12.2. During the year 11 premature babies were notified as being born at home and 36 in institutions. Of the latter 9 died, 8 within the first twenty-four hours and one within the first month after birth. 11 The following table gives the causes of the 20 infant deaths which occurred during 1960, together with the age at death.

TABLE VI Disease. Numbers Notified. Admitted to Hospital. Total Deaths. Scarlet fever 95 23 — Acute pneumonia 8 — — Measles 60 — — Whooping cough 24 — — Erysipelas 5 — — Dysentery 19 2 — Food poisoning 15 3 — Acute poliomyelitis 1 1 — Puerperal pyrexia — — — Diphtheria — — — Typhoid 1 1 — A further analysis of these cases by ages, wards and the months during which they occurred is given in Tables XVII and XVIII in the Appendix and the number of cases of infectious disease notified since 1930 is given in Table XIX in the Appendix. It will be seen that tuberculosis is omitted from this list of infectious diseases, as it is dealt with separately later. Fewer cases of scarlet fever, measles and dysentery occurred than in 1959 and the steady downward trend in the incidence of whooping cough since 1956 was continued. SCARLET FEVER There were 95 cases of scarlet fever, mostly of a very mild type. Twenty three cases were admitted to isolation hospital. This disease remains difficult to control. The organism responsible for it is sensitive to penicillin, but although penicillin treatment leads to rapid recovery of cases its use in the treatment of carriers is disappointing. ACUTE PNEUMONIA During the year eight cases occurred. This is the lowest number notified since 1952. No case was admitted to hospital. MEASLES Only 60 cases of measles occurred, compared with 930 in 1959 and none was admitted to hospital. Immunisation is not 13 available against measles and it remains one of the commonest diseases of childhood. WHOOPING COUGH Only 24 cases were notified, none being admitted to hospital. This continues the downwards trend in this disease since 1956 and indicates that the immunisation scheme introduced in 1953 is proving effective. The number of children immunised against this disease was 993 and 311 were given reinforcing injections. ERYSIPELAS Five cases occurred during the year. DYSENTERY Only 19 cases of dysentery occurred, well below the average for recent years. Only six school children were affected, most of the patients being adults. FOOD POISONING Fifteen cases of food poisoning occurred. There were three outbreaks, two of them, comprising three and five cases were due to salmonella typhi murium and one of four cases was due to salmonella heidelberg. One case was associated with an outbreak due to salmonella typhi murium in another district. There were two single cases, one due to typhi murium and one due to salmonella bareilly. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS One case of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred. The patient, a girl of five years, became ill on 11th October, 1960 and was admitted to hospital as a case of paralytic poliomyelitis, subsequently found to be due to poliovirus type 1. On receipt of the notification the child's home and school were visited. It was found that her brother had been ill with fever and headache two days after the onset of his sister's illness and had been excluded from school. His symptoms suggested an abortive attack of poliomyelitis and he was subsequently found to be excreting poliovirus type 1. Neither the patient nor her brother had been vaccinated against poliomyelitis. School Contacts At the school it was found that the patient was one of a class of 42 children of whom 39 had been vaccinated. One child, later found not to be excreting poliovirus, was absent with upper 14 tory symptoms, but none of the other children had been ill. The class was closed at once and contacts in other classes were excluded from school. Poliovirus type 1 was isolated from 19 of the 41 class contacts but from none of the children in other classes and from none of the staff. Further specimens were taken and after three weeks 11 children were still excreting poliovirus and they were not all clear until the tenth week. The patient's brother and those class contacts found to be excreting poliovirus were kept in home and garden quarantine as far as reasonably possible until a negative result was obtained. None of their siblings or parents had an illness suggestive of poliomyelitis. School contacts from whom poliovirus was not isolated were excluded for three weeks. Although the patient may have been responsible for the introduction and spread of infection among her class-mates, it is also possible that poliovirus was brought into the community from another source, was transmitted to many of the children and became apparent only when a non-vaccinated child was infected and became ill. Symptomless excreters are frequently found among close contacts, particularly children, of a paralytic case and it is therefore difficult to assess the part played by vaccination in limiting the number of cases among class contacts but the absence of any further case may well have been due to the fact that thirty nine of the 41 class contacts, including all those from whom poliovirus was isolated, had been vaccinated. Closing the infants' class when only one case had occurred proved to be a reasonable precaution. Close co-operation between the laboratory and the Public Health Department proved of the greatest value in tracing the extent of the infection and in planning the necessary control measures. POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATION WEEK A Poliomyelitis Vaccination Week was held from the 16th to the 21st May, primarily for the benefit of the 25 to 40 years age group. A great deal of preparatory work was done and the week was very successful. The number of vaccinations carried out was over 2,000 and the emphasis given to the importance of vaccination against the disease brought in a good many people of all ages who had previously omitted to be vaccinated. I should like to thank the many volunteers who helped to make the campaign week such a success. The total number of persons of all ages in the South Eastern Division who had been vaccinated against poliomyelitis by the end of 1960 with two injections was 34,524 and with three injections was 31,800. DIPHTHERIA No case of diphtheria occurred during the year, but this disease is becoming more common throughout the country as a 15 whole. The provisional total of cases in England and Wales in 1960 was 53. Of these only eight had been immunised in infancy but they had had no reinforcing dose. It is consequently more important than ever that parents should have their children immunised against diphtheria and arrange for reinforcing injections when they are five and ten years old. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,056 and 1,191 were given reinforcing injections. TYPHOID One case of typhoid occurred. The patient was a French boy, 18 years old and the onset of the illness was eight days after arrival in England from France. As the incubation period of typhoid is usually 2-3 weeks the disease was presumably contracted in France. The patient was admitted to hospital and made an uneventful recovery. SMALLPOX The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate time. The percentage of infants under one year vaccinated in this District during the year was 83% and efforts are being made to increase this figure which is well above the most recently published figure of 38.4% for the country as a whole. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccination. The number of primary vaccinations carried out was 838 and the number of re-vaccinations was 118. TETANUS Tetanus is not notifiable and its incidence is not known. Cases do occur, however, and there have been several fatal cases in Surrey during recent years including one in Purley in 1959. It is hoped that parents will have their children immunised against this disease as well as the other diseases of childhood. The tetanus prophylactic injection is usually a combined one with whooping cough and diphtheria prophylactics so that no extra injections are necessary. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,058 and 204 were given reinforcing injections. 16 TUBERCULOSIS The following table presents concisely the position with regard to tuberculosis in the District during 1960:— TABLE VII Pulmonary.

The Council is responsible for rehousing, one of the most important measures in the prevention of this disease and also for disinfection, but the County Council bears the responsibility for all other preventive measures except the treatment of cases which is that of the Regional Hospital Board. There are several methods of control of tuberculosis and their efficient implementation is important in view of the fact that 38 new cases were notified in 1960 which is the same as the average for the last five years. Among these methods the following are especially effective :— Mass X-ray. This has brought to light early cases which have been treated and rendered non-infectious in a short time. 18 B.C.G. Vaccination of School Children. This protects the vulnerable under 25 years age group. Contacts. Tracing contacts and arranging for treatment of those found to be suffering is important in the prevention of spread of the disease. BACTERIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL EXAMINATIONS Almost all the specimens requiring bacteriological examination in the interests of the public health are sent to the Public Health Laboratory, West Hill House, West Hill Road, Epsom, while samples of water requiring chemical analysis and Food and Drug samples are submitted to the Public Analyst. During 1960 reports were received on the following specimens:— Milk, ice cream and water samples 344 Food utensils 460 Nose and throat swabs 302 Faeces 381 Sputum 3 Vomit 1 Urine 2 Blood 6 Serum 2 Fertiliser 1 Mineral Water 1 19 FACTORIES ACTS 1937 to 1959 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

The water is softened and chlorinated and all houses in the District are provided with a direct supply which was satisfactory in quality and quantity during the year. There are no private wells in the District with the exception of the one at Cane Hill Hospital which is used to supplement the public supply. Routine samples of the treated water in public supply were submitted quarterly for bacteriological and chemical examination. In all 23 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and 8 samples for chemical examination with satisfactory results in each case. No samples of raw water were submitted by the department for bacteriological examination. In addition, both the Water Companies and Local Authorities sharing these public supplies provided the department with copies of reports on the samples taken by them of the treated water in public supply. Fifty samples were taken from the supplies of the two Companies and examined for hardness by the department, all of which were satisfactory in that adequate softening had been carried out as required. The private supply at Cane Hill Hospital which is chlorinated is kept under supervision and sampled regularly by the Public Health Department of the London County Council. Copies of reports on the samples taken are submitted to the department for information. RAINFALL The rainfall registered by the Automatic rain gauge installed at Alderstead Heath was 38.48 inches in 1960, an increase of 13.27 inches compared with the previous year and the greatest since 1951 when 44.45 inches was recorded. The monthly totals throughout the year were as follows:— inches January 3.14 February 2.52 March 2.11 April .89 May 1.78 June 1.64 July 3.39 22 August 3.32 September 3.92 October 6.68 November 5.59 December 3.50 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS There are two swimming baths in the District used by the public; one, an open-air pool at Selsdon is owned privately and although operating primarily in conjunction with a large hotel, is made available to the general public at a charge. The second is a covered bath situated at Reedham Orphanage which is used extensively by the Divisional Education Authority for school children. Both baths are filled and replenished as and when necessary from the public supply and provided with the necessary plant for chlori nation and filtration. During the year 15 samples of the water in these baths were submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination and all were found to be satisfactory. In addition, at the Reedham Bath, regular tests are carried out by an Inspector to check the chlorine content and the Ph value of the water. During the year a "Teaching Swimming Pool" came into use at Keston County Primary School. This pool has been installed with the necessary filtration and chlorination plant following representations made by the department and water is obtained from the mains supply. Filtration is by means of a diatomaceous earth filter which is a postwar development of the system of water purification used in the armed forces during the last war. This system, in conjunction with suitable chemical treatment, brings the problem of swimming bath purification within the means of small operators and should prove most useful in connection with small pools at schools and private houses. SEWERAGE By agreement sewage from the District drains into the sewerage systems of the Croydon Borough Council and the West Kent Main Sewerage Board for treatment. By far the most serious problem affecting the District under this heading is the flooding that occurs and has occurred for many years at Purley Corner. The outfall sewer to Croydon receiving sewage from this District and from the neighbouring Urban Authorities of Caterham and Banstead is totally inadequate in times of heavy rainfall. 23 This matter has been the subject of a comprehensive report by an Engineer appointed jointly by all the Authorities concerned and the scheme submitted was the subject of a Public Enquiry by an Inspector of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government towards the end of the year. It is hoped that as a result there will be a speedy solution to this recurring nuisance. From time to time local flooding takes place at other points in the District in periods of heavy rainfall and these matters are receiving consideration. 24 PART 3 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES Since 1948 the local Council has been represented on the S.E. Divisional Health Sub-Committee of the County Health Committee and the corresponding Educational Executive, which bodies have certain specified powers and responsibilities for the Personal Health Services. The Medical Officer of Health for this District and his Deputy, who hold similar positions in the Caterham and Warlingham Urban District, are the officers responsible for the Divisional Health Services which include the following:— Ante Natal Clinic An Ante Natal Clinic is held at 62, Whytecliffe Road, Purley, every Wednesday, 10 a.m. - 12 noon. Home Help Service The activities of this service continue to increase, particularly as there is no comparable agency in this District. Applications for the service of a Home Help should be addressed to the Home Help Organiser, 115 Brighton Road, Purley. In case of emergency the following telephone numbers may be used: UPLands 7014 or 9277, preferably between 9.30 and 10.30 a.m. Home Helps can only be supplied for maternity cases and for other cases genuinely needing their assistance in which ill-health or old-age are involved; the capacity of the Service is limited and priority is given to those in greatest need, the degree of help varying with the physical and social circumstances of the family. Family Planning The local Family Planning Clinic is now held at the Surrey County Council Clinic, Chaldon Road, Caterham-on-the-Hill. Residents needing advice are seen only by appointment and this should be obtained by application to the Divisional Medical Officer at 115 Brighton Road, Purley. Health Visiting The Health Visitors can be contacted through the Divisional Health Visitor between 9.0 and 10 a.m. daily at 115 Brighton Road, Purley, UPLands 9277. Infant Welfare Clinics The following Infant Welfare Clinics are held regularly from 2-4 p.m. except Purley Clinic which is held from 10 a.m. - 12 noon :•— Purley Clinic, 62 Whytecliffe Road, Purley Every Tuesday Methodist Church, Brighton Road, Coulsdon Every Thursday. Coulsdon Boys' Club, Chipstead Valley Road, Coulsdon Every Thursday. 25 Territorial Army Drill Hall, Marlpit Lane, Old Coulsdon Every Tuesday. Memorial Hall, Godstone Road, Kenley Every Friday. Baptist Church, Addington Road, Selsdon Every Monday. Congregational Church, Sanderstead Road, Sanderstead Every Wednesday. St. Anthony's Church, Wentworlh Way, Sanderstead Every Thursday. Church Hall, Mitchley Avenue, Purley 2nd and 4th day in each month. Community Centre, Hooley 1st and 3rd Wednesday in each month. Rent Office, Cherry Tree Farm Estate, Sanderstead Every Wednesday. Rent Office, Wontford Road, Purley 1st and 3rd Tuesday. Mothercraft and Relaxation Classes Classes covering these subjects were commenced in Purley at the end of 1953 and the numbers attending have increased very rapidly. Expectant mothers wishing to join these classes should make application to the Divisional Health Visitor at 115 Brighton Road, Purley, who will inform them as soon as a vacancy occurs. School Health Service The basis of this service is the periodical medical and dental inspection of all the children in attendance at the local schools who, in this Division, now number over 14,000 compared with 7,490 in 1946. Some of the defects noted need to be kept under observation and others are referred for treatment by private doctors, hospitals or specialist clinics. Among the clinics organised are the dental, eye, speech, general medical, child guidance and remedial exercise clinics. Special attention is given to handicapped children, some of whom require to be admitted to special schools, e.g. those for the deaf and mentally or physically sub-normal. Welfare Services The staff of the Health Department work in close cooperation with the local representatives of the County Council's Welfare, Children's and Education Departments and such voluntary bodies as the Guild of Social Service, N.S.P.C.C. and Marriage Guidance Council. The Divisional Medical Officer is responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all concerned with "Problem Families" and children neglected in their own homes. In addition to emergency meetings, all current cases are reviewed at quarterly case conferences. 26 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 The powers given under this Section for securing the removal of aged persons living in insanitary conditions were not utilised during 1960. Periodically border-line cases occur in which the Welfare Officers seek advice, but every endeavour is made to find a satisfactory solution without resorting to compulsory powers. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 50 Under the above section, as from 5th July, 1948, the Council became responsible for the disposal of the remains of any person who dies in the District if suitable arrangements would not otherwise be made. During the year the Council dealt financially with one case of this type. HEALTH PROPAGANDA Constant attention is given to the opportunities for health propaganda at the Clinics and Centres in the area and during the visits made by the Health Visitors and Public Health Inspectors. In addition each year a number of talks are given by the Officers to various organisations and schools. The material supplied by the Central Council for Health Education and other bodies is extremely useful.

Work of the department has proceeded on normal lines and although comparatively uneventful, this may be claimed as indicative of the satisfactory manner in which the routine duties have been carried out. In this respect it is often overlooked that the work of a Public Health Inspector is characterised in many ways by its anonymity and apparent success can only be measured by the frequency or otherwise of complaints, the well being of the people and the standard of environmental hygiene in the district. There has been no lack of new public health legislation during the period under review and this, coupled with the spate of circulars reports and technical information that pours out all the time, provides an exercise in application and endurance that must be accepted if one is to keep abreast of events and developments. During the year a further important step forward was made in dealing with the problem of flooding at Purley Corner. In November a Public Enquiry by an Inspector of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government was held at Croydon to consider and hear objections to the draft scheme prepared by an Engineer appointed jointly by all the Authorities concerned. In conclusion I should like to express my appreciation of the support given to me by the Chairman and Committee, the friendly co-operation of Dr. Morwood, Medical Officer of Health, and the ready assistance of all my colleagues in the department. I am, Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. HA WORTH, Chief Public Health Inspector. 29 HOUSING The following is a summary of work carried out in respect of the sanitary condition of dwelling houses during the year. 1.

In 1955 the Council submitted proposals to the Minister for dealing with 30 houses in the period, including 3 in respect of which action had already been commenced. All these houses have now been represented as unfit either in Clearance Areas or as individually unfit houses, and in addition a further 28 houses have been dealt with in a similar manner during the period. 31 A Compulsory Purchase Order made in respect of 15 houses, comprised 2 unfit houses (3 and 4 Purley View Terrace) included in the original five year programme, 12 additional unfit houses and one fit house (1-13, Kensington Terrace) and was the first order of the kind made by this Council arising out of a Clearance Area. The land forming the subject of the Order now known as the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District (Kensington Terrace and Purley View Terrace [Part of] Sanderstead) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1960 is part of an area comprising a triangular shaped piece of land on the northern edge of the Council's district, bounded by the main railway line on the east side, the Croydon District boundary on the north west and Sanderstead Road on the south west, containing a total of 28 houses and shops. When the question arose of dealing with the unfit houses in the area, the Council were of the opinion that the most satisfactory way of dealing with the area was the acquisition of all the properties in the area "fit" and "unfit" in order to ensure ordered redevelopment. Negotiations to acquire the properties by agreement were unsuccessful and as the Council had no wish to cause hardship it was decided to take no further action in respect of the "fit" properties with the exception of No. 4, Kensington Terrace. The Council was desirous of acquiring the land forming the subject of the order for the following reasons 1. To ensure the proper redevelopment of the whole of the triangular area as described on a permanent basis as and when it becomes practicable and appropriate having regard to the comparatively short expectation of life of the properties immediately adjoining the site comprised in the order. 2. To prevent unco-ordinated development. 3. To prevent the development of nuisance on the cleared site pending its permanent redevelopment. The purchase of No. 4, Kensington Terrace was a practical necessity to the proposal and it is intended to erect garages on the cleared site as a temporary measure. After a formal inquiry the Order was subsequently confirmed by the Minister without modification. Of the balance of the 58 houses dealt with in the period, a further 21 have been purchased by agreement at site value, 6 were Council owned properties and undertakings have been accepted from the owners in respect of six houses that the house or part as the case may be will not be used for human habitation. Thirty houses have so far been demolished and a further 22 remain to be cleared. 32 In a circular issued during the year the Ministry of Housing & Local Government reviewed the progress made by Local Authorities generally in carrying out their existing slum clearance programmes and requested Authorities who had completed their programmes to review the position and, if necessary, submit further proposals. This matter is receiving attention with a view to the submission of further proposals if considered necessary in the light of conditions found. It will be appreciated, however, that it can rarely ever be a clear cut issue whether or not a number of technically "unfit" houses exist at any one time even in a district such as Coulsdon and Purley, where housing standards are comparatively high, but it can be confidently stated that there are no "slums", existing within the Council's area. Housing repair work has followed the pattern of recent years although confined largely to work of an urgent and necessary character. The provisions of the Rent Act, 1957 relating to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair appear to have fallen into disuse. Only one notice of intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair was served followed by an undertaking from the landlord to carry out the necessary repair works. Cancellation certificates were issued in respect of two properties and repair works were completed at four further houses following the issue of Certificates of Disrepair or Undertakings from the landlord. During the year Discretionary Improvement Grants were made in respect of five houses where improvement works were carried out to the total value of £2,599. Standard Grants were also made in respect of the provision of "standard amenities" at five houses where works were carried out to the total value of £804. In all cases 50% grants were made and a high standard of improvement achieved. The Council refused to make either a "Discretionary" or "Standard" Improvement Grant in respect of an application to convert two old cottages into one house and provide certain other amenities, on the grounds that they were not satisfied that after the improvement works were completed the house would be fit for human habitation and likely to remain so for a period of not less than 15 years in view of the conditions of dampness at the premises. These two cottages have since been demolished. DRAINAGE During the year three houses and two other premises were connected to the sewer and seven cesspools abolished. 33 PUBLIC CLEANSING This service is administered under the direction of the Engineer and Surveyor - Mr. H. M. Collins. A weekly collection of house refuse is in operation and trade refuse is collected concurrently as part of the daily routine in the five collection areas. There were no alterations in the methods of cesspool emptying or the disposal of refuse during the year under consideration. House refuse is disposed of partly by incineration at Kenley Works and partly by means of controlled tipping. Cesspool contents are emptied into the sewer. 34 The public sewer in Highland Road, Purley was extended by the Council for a distance of 28 yards to enable the owner of a private property in Cullesden Road to connect therewith and thus eliminate cesspool drainage at the property. In another case where the house was below the level of the public sewer at the front of the property, the Council made an ex gratia payment towards the cost of laying a new drain approximately 300 feet long under the Caterham Valley railway line to connect to the Kenley sewer. A third house was connected to the Council's sewer in conjunction with the erection of a new property. The following is a summary of cesspool conversions carried out since 1950 — Year Pail Closets (end of year) Cesspools (end of year) Houses and other premises connected to sewer Cesspools abolished 1950 17 180 19 houses 1 other 15 1951 14 153 30 houses 2 other 28 1952 11 144 10 houses 2 other 13 1953 11 134 10 houses 12 1954 11 136 3 houses 1 other 3 1955 11 117 21 houses 1 other 21 1956 6 106 10 houses 1 other 15 1957 6 101 4 houses 1 other 10 1958 6 94 6 houses i 1959 6 95 — I 1960 6 90 3 houses 2 other 7 One of the biggest problems exercising the mind of the Council at the present time is the lack of tipping sites in the District and the acquisition and approval of possible sites in the area is a matter that is being actively pursued. Charges are made for the removal of trade refuse and for cesspool emptying. The scale of charges for cesspool emptying is now as follows:— (a) Existing cesspools at private properties erected before 1st April, 1958 — 10/- per load for the first 12 loads in any year and thereafter 15/- per load for all additional loads in the same year. (b) Cesspools constructed on or after 1st April, 1958 and before 31st March, 1959 at newly erected properties — a standard charge of 15/- per load. (c) Cesspools constructed on or after 1st April, 1959 at newly erected properties — a standard charge of 25/- per load. (d) Cesspools at commercial premises — 25/- per load. RIVERS AND STREAMS The only water courses in the District are those provided by the intermittent Bourne flows. These present no difficulties apart from occasional rat infestation along the banks. INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT It is the statutory duty of a Public Health Inspector to inspect and have a thorough knowledge of the sanitary circumstances of the district in order that action can be taken if necessary to abate conditions that give rise to nuisance or are prejudicial to health. Under the following headings comment is made on particular aspects of this work, concluding with a summary of the complaints received, visits made, notices served, works carried out and defects remedied during the year. Camping Sites The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 came into force on the 29th August, 1960 following the submission to the Minister of Housing and Local Government of a comprehensive report by Sir Arton Wilson on his investigations into the use of caravans as homes. The Act confers on Local Authorities additional powers for the control of caravan sites and apart from improved planning powers it provides for a new system of site licensing to be administered by district councils. Site licences can only be issued if planning permission has been granted by the Planning Authority. Site operators in 35 sion of planning permission cannot be refused a site licence which will remain valid for such period as planning permission is granted subject to observance of the site licence conditions. In deciding what conditions to attach to a site licence a local authority must have regard to the Model Standards specified by the Minister. Provision is made for appeal against the conditions of a site licence and subject to this proviso penalties may be imposed for failure to comply with licence conditions. Four applications were received for site licences in respect of existing sites only one of which was in possession of planning permission which expires in December, 1961. The three remaining applications were referred to the Planning Authority for consideration. The case of a single caravan was still under consideration at the end of the year and planning permission was granted for a period of five years in respect of a site for two caravans at Coulsdon Common. In the remaining case, that of an application in respect of Dean Lane Park, Dean Lane, Merstham, where approximately 160 caravans were stationed on the site at the commencement of the Act, the Caravan Sub-Committee of the County Planning Committee acting under delegated powers, resolved as follows:— (a) that permission be granted for the retention of the caravan site on land at Dean Lane, Alderstead Heath, Merstham, as described in applications COU.6722/3, for a temporary period of three years, subject to a condition that where a person or family ceases to dwell in a caravan stationed on the land at the date of this permission, their place shall not be taken by any other person or family, or where a caravan is taken away from a site it shall not be brought back or replaced, and (b) the Surrey Town & Country Planning Committee issue a direction to the Coulsdon & Purley Urban District Council requiring them to attach a condition to the site licence to be issued in respect of the Dean Lane Caravan Site with the object of securing the running down of the site by natural wastage, and that the site licence shall also contain a condition requiring the site operator to maintain a site register giving particulars of the occupants of the caravans and of the caravans on the site, and such other matters as may be considered desirable for ensuring compliance with the condition regarding the natural wastage of the site. The reasons for the limitation of consent referred to in Part (a) hereof are — (i) that this type of development is out of place in the Metropolitan Green Belt; 36 (ii) The Minister of Housing and Local Government has already stated that he would not be prepared to grant a permission which would perpetuate a residential colony in the heart of a downland area which should be kept for agricultural or recreational purposes, and (iii) this method would bring about the discontinuance of the caravan site without causing hardship to the occupants of the caravans. Site licences incorporating certain specified conditions were subsequently issued as follows :— A ddress No. of Caravans Period of Licence Dean Lane Park, Dean Lane, Merstham. 160 3 years from 21.12.60. Hall & Co's., Depot, Marlpit Lane, Coulsdon. 1 2 years from 10.12.59. Windmill Farm, Coulsdon Common. 2 5 years from 29.12.60. An appeal is pending on the planning decision in respect of Dean Lane Park and the site licence conditions in respect of this site were modified in certain respects on appeal to the Magistrates' Court. Site licence conditions in all cases require a water carriage system of drainage, the provision of W.C's, main water supply and fire precautions. In the case of Dean Lane Park, communal ablution and laundry facilities with a constant supply of hot and cold water are additional requirements. Clean Air There has been no change in the policy of the Council regarding the formation of Smoke Control Areas. The district is not within the "Black Areas" around London as designated by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The Council operate a Building Byelaw to provide for the installation in new buildings of appliances for heating or cooking which are suitably designed for burning smokeless fuels and in this respect invaluable work has been done in recent years by various interested bodies and appliance manufacturers to further the cause of a cleaner atmosphere by the use of approved appliances and smokeless fuel. Electricity, gas, oil and solid fuel all have their champions, but whatever the nature of the fuel there can be little excuse for atmospheric pollution if modern appliances are brought into use. 37 Indeed, there is evidence to show that the public are becoming more "Clean Air" conscious and that the national effort being made by the formation of smoke control areas in the worst affected districts, by education and publicity, is having a beneficial and permanent effect. As a further contribution to this campaign the Council have agreed on invitation, to participate in a National Survey of Air Pollution by Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide under the auspices of The Warren Spring Laboratory, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Under this scheme a number of Authorities, including a few in relatively non-polluted areas, have been invited either to start taking measurements or to take measurements at new sites within their area. Stations for the purpose are to be set up in the district at 73, Brighton Road, Purley and Selsdon Library. Apart from a few minor complaints no problem has arisen in connection with smoke nuisance during the year. There is little or no industrial smoke in the district. Hairdressing Establishments Byelaws are now in force in the district which provide for securing the cleanliness of premises and the instruments, towels, equipment and materials used in the premises. During the year 39 visits were made in pursuance of the byelaws. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Inspections are carried out, as necessary, to ensure that domestic heating appliances offered or exposed for sale are fitted with proper guards complying with standards prescribed in regulations made under the Act. Mines & Quarries Act, 1954 This Act requires compliance with provisions designed to prevent accidents arising through lack of proper fencing or too easy access. Routine visits are made to quarries in the district as necessary. Schools In co-operation with the Divisional Medical Officer and in the course of milk sampling, schools are visited from time to time. During the year a complete survey of all the school kitchens in the district, under the control of the County Education Authority, 38 was carried out and a report was submitted to the Divisional Medical Officer with a view to action being taken by the Divisional Education Officer. Shops Act As far as possible inspections have been made in respect of the provision and maintenance of sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation in shops. By arrangement with the Engineer & Surveyor, the Department is given an opportunity of examining all plans submitted for the construction of new shops or alteration of existing premises, with a view to obtaining proper compliance with the requirements of the Act. This is generally appreciated by shop developers who are usually very willing to co-operate. The Council is also the Authority responsible for enforcement of the Shops Hours of Closing and Sunday Trading provisions of the Act and routine surveys and inspections are carried out for this purpose. It would appear that on the question of closing hours for shops it is now time that the Home Office considered bringing up-to-date the law dealing with this vexed problem. The Shops Act, 1950 which is the statute dealing with the closing of shops is merely a consolidating Act dating back to 1912 and its provisions are now considered in many ways obsolete. This has been emphasised by a recent decision of a well known multiple firm to experiment with a five day week in a number of their shops and it is hoped that the appropriate Government department has taken note of the "wind of change" in shopping habits and staffing conditions. The Fabrics (Misdescription) Act, 1913 The Fabrics (Misdescription) Regulations 1959 The above mentioned Regulations which came into force on the 11th May, 1959 prescribe new standards of non-inflammability for textile fabrics to which is attributed the quality of noninflammability or safety from fire or any degree of that quality. During the year 18 shops were visited in pursuance of the Regulations and in no case were goods stocked to which the Regulations apply. Enquiries as to why there was no apparent demand for fire resistant textile fabrics disclosed in every case that the price factor was the principle reason for this lack of interest. Materials which have been treated to render them flameproof or flame resistant are much more expensive and it would appear that until the cost of processing is cut down considerably, a most effective way of reducing burning accidents in the home will not meet with the success it deserves. 39 Radioactivity The Radioactive Substances Act, 1960 was passed during the period under review and this Statute empowers the Minister concerned to require registration of undertakings keeping and using radioactive material and issue authorisations to dispose of radioactive waste. Provision is made for consultation with local authorities if it appears that the disposal of radioactive waste is likely to involve the need for special precautions to be taken by the local authority. This is in line with government policy to place the control of the sources of radioactivity with the central authority. Disinfection and Disinfestation Disinfection is carried out when considered necessary following cases of infectious disease and otherwise on request and on payment of a small charge. Bedding and other clothing if possible is disinfected by arrangement with the Wandle Valley Hospital in a steam disinfector at the hospital. Sick rooms and other articles are disinfected by means of formaldehyde gas or spray, and library books are treated in a disinfecting chamber at the offices at 73, Brighton Road, Purley. The number of library books disinfected has been cut down considerably as a result of a modification of the list of notifiable diseases in respect of which disinfection is now considered necessary. Disinfestation work is now largely confined to the more common domestic pests such as flies, ants, cockroaches and wasps. No case of bug infestation was recorded during the year. School canteens are sprayed annually with a liquid insecticide to prevent fly infestation. The use of proprietary insecticides principally of the liquid variety and having a residual effect, is proving very effective in dealing with all types of insect pests. During the year 148 cases of infestation were dealt with by the department. 40 During 1960 the following disinfections were carried out:— Free of cost Upon Payment Total Loads of bedding, etc. 14 - 14 Houses disinfected 6 -

Compared with 1959 there was a decrease in the number of complaints received and premises found to be infested by rats and mice. During the year the Department continued to carry out on a contract basis certain disinfestation work at agricultural premises formerly carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food. The Department does not, of course, rely solely on the receipt of complaints as an indication of infestation and routine inspections of dwelling houses, business premises including agricultural holdings, council owned properties and land are carried out from time to time and in conjunction with treatment on adjoining premises. Although having no direct control as was the case hitherto, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food continue to take an active interest in rodent control work carried out by local authorities. 44 Technical advice and instructional service through the regional and divisional pests staff is freely available and meetings of the No. 10, London Workable Area Committee of which this Authority is a member, are held from time to time to discuss with the Ministry's Officers, problems and new developments in connection with rodent control. It is the legal responsibility of the occupier of premises to keep the premises free from infestation by rats and mice, and in view of this the Council has maintained the principle that a small charge should be made in respect of destruction work carried out by the Council at private dwellings. A nominal charge of 5/- is made therefore for this service which is generally appreciated and in respect of which no serious difficulty has been experienced since it was first put into practice in 1951. Work carried out at business premises including agricultural holdings is charged at the full cost which, during 1960, was increased to 1 l/9d. per hour plus cost of materials. For the first time for three years a 10% test baiting of the sewerage system was carried out but the results only confirmed past experience that the Council's sewers are comparatively free from rat infestation. Out of a total number of approximately 3,000 manholes on the system 301 were test baited and in only two manholes was there any evidence of infestation. This is probably due to the frequency of surcharging in the main trunk sewers. For a number of years the department has relied principally on the use of Warfarin as a convenient and very effective poison for surface treatment, but on the advice of the Ministry its use has now been extended to sewer treatment by the addition of a preservative which inhibits mould growth in the poison. The Council has continued to undertake rodent control at local schools for The Surrey County Council on a contract basis. 45 46 RODENT CONTROL The following table is a tabular statement indicating the action taken in 1960.

Routine visits are made to all food premises with the object of maintaining these standards and reference to the tabular statement of works carried out will give some indication of the matters to which attention is directed. Guidance and advice in preference to legal sanction is the policy pursued in achieving the object but in one case the threat of legal proceedings had the desired effect. Codes of Practice relating to Hygiene in the Retail Meat and Fish Trades and the Transport and Handling of these commodities have been published on behalf of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the guidance of persons in these trades. Copies of these Codes have been circulated by the Council to the traders concerned. During the year 25 complaints received in respect of contaminated or unsound food were fully investigated. Warning letters were sent in appropriate cases but in three instances it was felt that the circumstances necessitated legal proceedings. Two cases concerned the same baker in respect of a piece of sponge rubber and a nail in two loaves of bread. The firm admitted the offences and were fined £5 for the first offence and £50 for the second with 8 guineas costs. A dairy firm were fined £50 and 8 guineas costs in respect of a piece of cardboard in a bottle of milk but the fine was reduced to £15 on appeal. Arising out of a complaint of pork pies sold by a local retailer in a mouldy condition, the Council made representations to the Food Manufacturers Federation Inc. with a view to securing in lieu of the present coding system a system of marking with dates of manufacture and periods during which such articles of food may safely be assumed to be fit for human consumption. It was considered by the Council that if this method of marking were adopted it would afford the purchaser a greater degree of protection from the possibility of being sold pies out of condition. The Federation replied that for the various reasons set out, date stamping of pies would not be a practical proposition and this view was later reaffirmed at a meeting of Meat Pie Manufacturers. The Federation pointed out that all manufacturers dispatched their pies in "Factory Fresh" condition and that the onus rested with the retailer to ensure meticulous stock rotation. It was felt, however, that a number of retailers needed more education and instruction in the care and handling of pies, and with this in mind the Federation had decided to appoint a small Committee to look into the possibility of drawing up a Code of Practice which could be used as a guide to retailers in the future. 47 It may not be out of place in recording this matter to stress the importance of a proper food storage technique on the part of the food trader and indeed the housewife. One of the most valuable items of domestic equipment in the modern home is the refrigerator provided it is used intelligently and is properly maintained. The refrigerator should be defrosted regularly and used primarily for the storage of those foods most liable to deterioration or contamination such as cooked and uncooked meat and milk foods, suitably covered in appropriate cases to prevent drying. A variety of food samples were submitted for bacteriological examination during the year, including veal, synthetic cream, egg albumen, frozen and dried egg, cream cakes, minced beef, sausages and sausage meat, frozen steakettes, frozen pork cutlets, frozen skinless sausages, desiccated coconut, potted shrimps, scampi, turkey pie, fish cakes, dressed crab and oysters etc. Of 153 samples it was only found necessary to make representation in respect of two frozen meat products which fell below the desired standard. During the year 92 swabs were taken from 460 items of washed crockery and submitted for bacteriological examination. Further details of food samples are recorded elsewhere in this report. The register of premises coming within the scope of the Food Hygiene Regulations at present includes the following:— Confectioners 59 Butchers 32 Fishmongers (wet and dry) 13 Fishmongers (fried) 5 Bakers 23 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 45 Cafes and Restaurants 41 Grocers 74 Chemists 19 Licensed premises 33 Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Guest Houses Hotels 20 Canteens, Clubs, Halls, etc 51 Schools 45 Ten grocers' shops and one baker's premises are registered for the preparation of preserved meat, etc., and all the fish friers' premises are similarly registered in respect of fish frying. Milk. The Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. Apart from small quantities bottled on the farms, milk sold in the larger Urban areas is collected in the distant producing areas and transported in bulk to large processing plants situate in the 48 consuming centres where it is pasteurised or sterilised and bottled for sale by a comparatively few large dairy companies. Residents in this district rely in the main on these sources of supply, there being only one registered dairy now operating in the Council's area. General control by the Department is exercised under the above regulations and only pasteurised, tuberculin tested or sterilised milk can be sold in the district as a result of a Special Designations Order made in 1951. The entries in the register, which has to be kept, were as follows:— Distributors of Milk in the District 17 Premises registered as Dairies 1 Under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1949-1954, the following licences to sell milk were issued during the year Dealers: Supplementary : Tuberculin Tested Tuberculin Tested 8 Pasteurised 22 Pasteurised 8 Sterilised 17 Sterilised 6 Pasteuriser's 1 New Regulations came into force on 1st October, 1960 and as from 1st January, 1961 new forms of licence will be issued whereby dealers licences issued on or after that date will be valid for five years from that date, and will be renewable for subsequent quinquennial periods. The issue of supplementary licences will, in future, be discontinued as dealers' licences will no longer restrict sales to the area of the licencing Authority. A total of 182 samples of milk was submitted for bacteriological examination, with the results set out in the following table :— TESTS REQUIRED BY THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) REGULATIONS, 1949-1954 TABLE XV Designation Number Methylene Blue Phosphatase T urbidity Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Pasteurised 141 141 — 141 — — — T.T.

A total of 66 washed milk bottles was submitted for bacteriological examination with satisfactory results. Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 Ice cream which is now an important and popular item of food, has been the subject of special legislation and more strict control in post war years with the result that its manufacture is mainly undertaken by the large companies who produce an article of uniform quality, pre-packed in a variety of ways for sale by local retailers, from modern refrigerated units. One hundred and eighteen premises are registered for the sale of ice cream within the district and although two premises are also registered for the manufacture of this product, no manufacturing has been carried out for some years. A total of 82 samples of ice cream was examined for bacterial quality by submission to the methylene blue reduction test, and placed in the following provisional grades:— Grade I 80 Grade II 2 Grade III — Grade IV — These results can be considered very satisfactory. Meat Slaughterhouses Act, 1958 Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 Public Health (Meat) Regulations 1924-1955 There are no slaughterhouses in the District apart from the one at Netherne Hospital which is used for the slaughter of surplus animals from the Hospital farm to provide meat for consumption by hospital inmates. The arrangement to carry out post mortem inspection of all animals slaughtered at this slaughterhouse continued during the year. Retailers obtain supplies of fresh and imported meat from the Croydon Abattoir and Meat Market and the Smithfield Market, and in addition small quantities of fresh meat direct from Scotland. During the year a report was submitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the existing and probable future requirements of the district for slaughterhouse facilities in accordance with the Slaughterhouses Act, 1958. Having regard to the information received from interested persons and organisations concerned and the facilities already 50 available, it was considered that the existing arrangements for obtaining supplies of fresh meat for the district were adequate and that there appeared to be no future need for slaughterhouse facilities. The report was worded accordingly and in due course accepted by the Minister. One slaughterman's licence was issued under the Slaughter of Animals Act for the purpose of slaughtering at Netherne Hospital. There are 32 butchers' shops in the District, all registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved meat under the provisions of Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Unsound Food The following is a list of foodstuffs which after inspection were classified as unfit for human consumption. The majority of the foodstuffs were destroyed at the Council's refuse destructor at Kenley. cwts. 1bs. ozs. Fresh fruit — 54 — Sugar, jams, etc. — 4 12 Canned fruit — 90 — Meat, Poultry and Bacon 1 94 — Tinned Meat 2 19 6 Tinned Fish — 26 11 Tinned Vegetables — 50 2 Frozen Foods 3 36 9 Miscellaneous, cheese, fats etc. 10 53 7 Total 19 92 15 Food and Drugs Analysis It is perhaps appropriate in reporting upon work under the above heading for the year 1960 to refer to the Centenary Celebrations in September, 1960 of an International Conference in London to commemorate the passing in 1860 of the first Act of Parliament in this, or indeed any country, for preventing the adulteration of food and drink. Amongst other provisions this Act empowered Local Authorities to appoint Public Analysts for the purpose of examining the purity of articles of food and drink. The Association of Public Analysts felt that this occasion was an opportunity of bringing the work of the Public Analyst to the notice of the public and issued a small brochure which gives not only an introduction to the history of the adulteration of food prior to the passing of the Act but also an outline of the work of the Public Analyst since its inception. This little document emphasises admirably the progress and change that has taken place in the Food Industry and in Food and Drugs Administration since the days when gross and 51 spread adulteration of the commoner foods was rife to the present time with its less frequent but more complex form of irregularity. Some idea of the work involved in present day food and drugs analysis may be gained from a quotation from the brochure as follows: "A sample may have to be examined from all the following aspects:— (1) For compliance with a legal standard when one is prescribed or when no legal standard of composition exists to establish that the article reaches a reasonable quality as judged by normal commercial practice. (2) To see that the article corresponds with the description used and that none of the statements made on the label or the advertisement are false or misleading. (3) Where special claims are made for the presence of vitamins and minerals, the proportions of these constituents must be checked. Similarly any other special claims for nutritive properties must also be justified. (4) In the case of a pre-packed foodstuff it is necessary to check that the article is labelled in accordance with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order and that the declaration of ingredients is given in the correct order. (5) To check for the presence of additives; particularly that the article complies with the Regulations in respect of preservatives, antioxidants, colouring matters, etc. (6) Finally, checks for impurities such as traces of arsenic, metallic contamination such as lead and in certain instances fluorine may also be made. The work now being done in this field confirms the view that food sampling and analysis today not only prevents adulteration but is a means of ensuring that the public obtains not only a commodity it assumes to be getting, but a commodity it is entitled to get from the description of the article sold. During the year the Council were asked through the Urban District Council's Association to assist the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry in its consideration of the Composition of Meat Pies and the necessity or otherwise for statutory control. The Council were asked to arrange for a representative number of meat pie samples to be collected over a period of six months and twenty-two samples were obtained for this purpose. Detailed information collated by the Public Analyst was submitted to the Food Standards Committee in due course. In the early part of the year the writer was invited, and with the approval of the Council, was pleased to accept an invitation from the Urban District Councils' Association to act as one of the Association's representatives on a Local Authorities Joint Advisory Committee on Food Standards. 52 During the year a total of 170 samples of food and drugs, including 34 milk samples were purchased for the purpose of analysis by the Public Analyst. The milk samples were all of good quality but adverse reports were received on 11 of the remaining samples as follows:— Sample No. Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action taken Informal Sample No. 110 STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE The filling of the pie consisted of a coarse mince of meat with gravy and no kidney was detected. In the opinion of the Public Analyst the filling of a steak and kidney pie should include recognisable lumps of steak and at least one or two of kidney. Representations were made to the Company concerned without, in the first place, any success. In view of the fact that the Food Standards Committee was currently considering the question of standards for meat pies, it was felt advisable to leave the matter open for the time being but at the same time acquaint this Committee with our views. It is of interest to record, however, in this case that from information obtained later from a neighbouring Authority which had made similar representations, it was disclosed that the Company concerned had modified the manufacturing technique of small steak and kidney pies with the object of meeting the standards expected. The Public Analyst reported that a subsequent sample of a similar pie from these Manufacturers was a much better article. Formal Sample No. 121 CREAM CHEESE This was a cheese spread containing Milk Fat 34.6 per cent, Total Solids 46.6 per cent (including vegetable gum and salt) Moisture 53.4 per cent. As a cheese spread the ingredients of the article must be declared on the label in accordance with the Labelling of Food Order 1953. Manufacturers agreed to use a new label. 53 Sample No. Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action taken Informal Sample No. 133 MEAT PIE Contained only 10 per cent meat. In the opinion of the Public Analyst a reasonable pies is 25 to 30 per meat content for meat cent. Representations were made to the local baker concerned and an assurance was received that remedial action would be taken forthwith. A subsequent sample pie proved satisfactory. Formal Sample No. 137 CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP The ingredients of the article as declared on the label did not include herbs and dehydrated carrot, which were found to be present. Undertaking to amend labels on future wrappings. Informal Sample No. 148 MEAT PIE Contained only 12 per cent meat. Representations were made to the local baker concerned and a subsequent sample pie proved satisfactory. Informal Sample No. 158 TINNED BEEF & KIDNEY PIE Deficient in meat. Contained only 16-6 per cent calculated on the whole pie. Tinned meat pies contain on an average 27 per cent of meat. Manufacturer explained difficulties involved in ensuring uniform filling of the tins chiefly with the smaller sized pack. Plant Engineer took the necessary remedial action. Formal Sample No. 175 FRANKFURTER SAUSAGES Contained only 66 per cent of meat whereas Frankfurter Sausages of ordinary commercial quality, sold as such, without qualification, contain not less than 80% of meat including fat. These Frankfurters were canned in brine and ready cooked. It was decided to withdraw the the product from sale at an early date and in the meantime to enclose a qualifying label. Informal Sample No. 186 CORNISH PASTY This article was not of the traditional shape and appearance of a Cornish Pasty but consisted of a canned meat and potato pie containing 19 per cent of meat. The Manufacturers stated that when the existing stocks of labels were exhausted consideration would be given to labelling the product "Cornish Pasty Pie". Formal Sample No. 187 CUBE WITH MEAT EXTRACT The ingredients of this article as declared on the label did not include herbs. Discrepancy in labelling to be remedied when new wrappers for the commodity were reprinted. 54 Sample No. Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action taken Formal Sample No. 241 DEVONSHIRE DAIRY CREAM Consisted of ordinary cream containing 36-5 per cent of milk fat. In the opinion of the Public Analyst the term Devonshire Cream suggests Clotted Cream which should contain not less than 48 per cent of milk fat. Considerable correspondence ensued and representatives of the Company concerned were interviewed by Officers of the Council with the object of modifying the label if possible but without success. The producers however decided to discontinue the existing polystrene (carton) container and paper capping and pack future supplies in a new cream bottle with foil capping which it was suggested would automatically convey to purchasers the idea of a liquid cream as distinct from the solid pack of their Devonshire Clotted Cream. Formal Sample No. 248 LUNCHEON MEAT LOAF This article contained only 65 per cent of meat whereas in the opinion of the Public Analyst, Luncheon Meat or any meat product which includes the words "Luncheon Meat" in its description, should contain not less than 80 per cent of meat. Also the ingredients were not specified on the label in the correct order. This was an Australian product and consultations ensued between the Council's officers and the Company concerned. The question of labelling was resolved to the satisfaction of the Public Analyst but negotiations with a view to amending the description of the article were unsuccessful in the absence of any definite legal standard for this type of product. The company concerned were of the opinion that Luncheon Meat Loaf and Luncheon Meat were two separate and distinct descriptions with two different retail price units. In the absence of a legal standard the Council decided to take no further action in the matter. The Commonwealth Veterinary Officer in the office of the High Commissioner for Australia was kept informed on this case and a representative of the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was consulted. 55 LIST OF SAMPLES TABLE XVI Article Analysed Non-Genuine Formal Informal Total Formal Informal Total Ale 1 - 1 - - - Apple Green Colour - 1 1 — — — Beef (Curried) — 1 1 — — — Beef Steak (Cooked) 1 - 1 — - — Beef Steak and Kidney Pie — 2 - — 1 1 Beer - — - — - — Black Pudding 1 — 1 — - — Blackcurrant Vit.
