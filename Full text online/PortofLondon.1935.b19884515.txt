TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Circular 1508 issued by the Ministry of Health on 25th November, 1935, states that " any permanent arrangements which have been fully described in previous Annual Reports and have not been altered may be omitted from the Report for 1935." The permanent arrangements in the Port of London were fully described in my Report of the year 1933. I have, therefore, in this Report dealt only with such changes as have taken place since then. I again invited direct contributions to this Report from your Food Inspectors and Sanitary Inspectors, and I have included one from Inspector F. J. Massie on " The Importation of Chilled Meat from Australia and New Zealand," and another from Inspector C. E. Wright on " The Transport and Handling of Meat." The tonnage of vessels entering the Port of London during 1935 was 29,673,932, being 300,327 tons more than in the previous year. Of the 14,039 vessels arriving from Foreign Ports, 2,199 were boarded and inspected by your Medical Officers. On 240 vessels infectious disease was reported to have occurred during the voyage, the total number of cases being 450, of which 191, including 99 of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, were landed in the Port. In the Training Ships there occurred one case of Diphtheria and three of Chicken-pox. Fifty-two cases, particulars of which are given in Appendix II., were admitted to your Hospital at Denton. No case of Plague occurred in any London bound ship during the year, and of 888 rats from ships and 1,912 from shore premises examined bacteriologically, none showed any evidence of Plague infection. Four vessels arrived in which a total of four cases of Small-pox had occurred, but no case was actually landed in the Port. The Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, continued in operation, and the work done thereunder is reported on page 55. Your Sanitary Inspectors made 15,747 inspections of vessels and 6,764 inspections of shore premises. Two thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight defects were reported in 2,404 vessels, in 2,364 of which the defects were remedied. Thirteen hundred and forty-nine nuisances were reported in 1,334 shore premises, in 1,327 of which the nuisances were abated. Nuisance from smoke was reported in respect of 108 vessels, and in 58 instances a Statutory Notice was served on the Master. The number of vessels fumigated for rat destruction under the supervision of your Inspectors was 125, seventy-four by hydrogen cyanide and 51 by sulphur dioxide. By the former method 702 rats and 158 mice, and by the latter 773 rats and 312 mice, were destroyed. 10 The average number of rats killed per fumigation was 11.8. If mice are taken into consideration also, the average number of rodents destroyed per fumigation was 15.5. In addition, 2,467 rats were trapped in ships and 5,533 on shore in the Port. Intimation Notices were served in respect of 32 cases of infringement of the Bye-laws relating to Offensive Cargoes. I have made further reference to the question on page 52. The arrangements made with the Port of London Authority whereby the annual re-registration of water barges is made conditional upon the satisfactory report of your Officers as to fitness of the barges for the carriage of drinking water, continued to work smoothly. The number of water barges remained at 12. The Boarding Launch " Howard Deighton " has continued to give satisfactory service. In addition to conveying the Boarding Medical Officers to vessels requiring medical inspection on arrival, transporting cases of infectious sickness to your Isolation Hospital, collecting from ships, bedding, &c., for disinfection, and carrying the Sanitary Inspector on his visits to ships lying in the Lower River District, this launch has on several occasions enabled your Officers to render assistance in cases of sudden illness or injury occurring in ships in Gravesend Reach. First aid has been rendered in these cases, and the patients have been landed and taken by motor ambulance to the nearest General Hospital. During the year you authorised the purchase of first-aid equipment, including splints, surgical dressings,sutures, tourniquet, artery forceps, &c., which experience had shown to be necessary and which is now always carried on the launch. At the end of the year a letter was received from the Corporation of Trinity House, expressing appreciation of the services thus rendered on three occasions to pilots. The new Launch " Frederick Whittingham," which was put into commission in November, 1934, for use of the Sanitary Inspector in the Upper River District, has proved to be admirably suited to the work for which she was designed, and very economical in running expenses. The Launch James Howell," which is used by the Sanitary Inspector in the Middle River District is now 13 years old, and it will not be possible to keep her in service much longer. The petrol engine is worn out, and the wooden hull is not in such condition as to make it worth while fitting a new engine. When this launch has to be replaced it would be desirable to build a vessel of smaller dimensions than the " Howard Deighton," but sturdy enough to take over her boarding duties at Gravesend when she is laid up for overhaul. At present, when your boarding launch is out of commission, the Medical Officers are taken off in the Customs launch, and the " James Howell," which is not strong enough for boarding work, must stand by for the removal of cases of sickness to your Isolation Hospital. The Officers of His Majesty's Customs are most courteous and helpful, but obviously their own duties must come first, and their launch cannot be used for the transport of cases of infectious disease. Last year I reported that the old Hulk " Hygeia," your Boarding Station at Gravesend, was in a very bad condition, and that it would be a waste of money to carry out extensive repairs. You therefore decided to purchase another hull and fit it up as a Boarding Station. In April, 1935, you purchased a double-bowed steel lighter from the Admiralty ; plans and specifications for fitting her to your requirements were drawn up by your Chief Engineer, Mr. Roberts, and she has now taken the place of the old hulk, which was sold to the Benfleet Yacht Club. Further improvements have been carried out at your Hospital at Denton. The Nurses' Home has been re-built; a new laundry has been erected ; a new gardeners' store and a new incinerator have been provided and, by the generosity of the Corporation of the City of London, the grounds have been greatly improved. The inspection of imported food is an important part of the work of the Port Sanitary Authority, and during 1935, 2,368 tons of foodstuffs were condemned as unfit for human consumption, and were either destroyed or disposed of for industrial purposes. 11 The proportion of carcases of mutton examined for Caseous Lymphadenitis remained at 5 per cent, throughout the year; pieces of mutton continued to be subjected to 100 per cent, examination. Evidence of the disease was found in only 26 of the 14,495 carcases examined by your Inspectors. A proportion of frozen tongues imported from South America was examined on arrival, the percentage found to be affected with Actinobacillosis being 0.58. Your Worshipful Committee continued to urge the Ministry of Health to amend the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, so as to reduce to a minimum the proportion of meat arriving in such form that it is impossible for your Officers to examine for evidence of disease. The examination of sardines for contamination by lead was continued. During the year 1934, samples from 138 consignments of sardines were analysed. The degree of lead contamination varied from two parts per million to 78 parts per million, the average being 17.3 parts per million. Seven consignments, representing 1,070 cases or 107,000 tins, were re-exported under guarantee that they would not be returned to any Port in this country. During 1935, samples from 55 consignments were analysed, and the degree of lead contamination varied from 0 to 40 parts per million, the average being 11.7 parts per million, a very considerable improvement. Nine consignments, representing 880 cases, or 88,000 tins, were re-exported. At the beginning of the year 12 tins were drawn from a consignment of sardines, and each month the contents of one tin were analysed with a view to ascertaining whether the degree of lead contamination was affected by the period of storage. Previous experience had shown that if a number of tins are taken from one consignment and the contents of each tin are analysed separately, the degree of lead contamination will be found to vary considerably ; for example, in May, 1934, six tins taken from one consignment gave respectively the following results: 13 ; 18 ; 22 ; 22 ; 24 and 58 parts per million of lead. For this reason, and because it is believed that the contamination takes place principally during the preparation of the sardines before they are put into tins, it was not expected that this investigation would show that storage had any effect on the lead content of the fish. This proved to be the case, the results in parts per million of lead over the 12 months consecutively were 14 ; 13 ; 20 ; 14 ; 25 ; 25 ; 20 ; 21 ; 18 ; 15 ; 14 ; 17. These figures are well within the limits of variation found when a number of tins are examined at the time of arrival of a consignment, and there is obviously no relation between the lead content of the fish and the period of storage. It may be of interest to record here that, as some trouble has arisen in regard to the tin content of canned sild, twelve cans of this fish were taken from one consignment, and every month the contents of one can were analysed. The results, in grains of tin per pound, were, in consecutive months, 0.46 ; 1.17 ; 1.79 ; 1.46 ; 2.58 ; 4.34 ; 5.58 ; 3.92 ; 2.92 ; 5.62 ; 4.75 ; 5.33. These figures seem to show that the degree of contamination of this product with tin does increase rapidly during storage, and that the packers should consider how the action of the fish on the container can be prevented. A number of consignments of canned fish of Swedish origin, presumably to be served as hors-d' œuvres in restaurants, were found to contain prohibited preservatives. These were re-exported, and towards the end of the year similar products arrived free from preservatives of any kind. Apparently the packers were unaware of the provisions of the Public Health (Preservatives, &c., in Food) Regulations. Other points of interest in relation to the inspection of imported food are dealt with in the appropriate section of this Report. In no case were legal proceedings taken, as merchants voluntarily surrendered foodstuffs which were unsound or unfit for human consumption, but in one instance the occupier of a warehouse refused to admit the Food Inspector, and it was necessary to obtain a Warrant from a Magistrate. 12 Your Worshipful Committee has for some years desired to amend the Orders you made in 1916 under the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1915, but had been unable to do so because the Regulations did not provide for the Amendment of Orders made thereunder. The issue of the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934, enabled you to proceed to the making of a new Order. The form of the proposed new Order, notice of which was duly given during November, 1935, is set out on page 39. Only one objection was lodged, and this was subsequently withdrawn. The Medway (Shellfish) Regulations, 1935, were issued by the Minister of Health on 11th December, 1935. Part of the " prescribed area " is within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, and the Regulations are therefore set out on page 39 of this Report. A statement of the effect of these Regulations was published in the " Sheerness Times," the " East Kent Messenger " and the " Kent Messenger," and copies were sent to all persons known to be interested in layings in the part of your district affected. Under the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1933, you were empowered to make Bye-laws for the better control of Houseboats lying in your district. Originally two sets of Bye-laws were drafted, one set by the City Solicitor and your Medical Officer relative to the sanitary requirements in all houseboats lying within the Port Sanitary District and to the registration of such houseboats as are within your district but outside that of the Port of London Authority, and another set by the Port of London Authority relative to the registration of houseboats lying within the area for which, under the Act, they are the Registration Authority. It was deemed desirable to combine these two sets of Bye-laws, and this has occasioned considerable delay. Agreement has now been reached between yourselves and the Port of London Authority, and the draft has been submitted for the approval of the Ministry of Health. During July, August and September numerous complaints were received of the pollution of the River by the sewage discharged from the Northern and Southern Outfalls. With the coming of heavy rain in the Autumn the River was flushed with fresh water from above Teddington, and no further complaints were received. During the year all grades of your Staff carried out their duties in an entirely satisfactory manner. Dr. J. A. Jones joined your Staff as a Boarding Medical Officer in April, in the place of Dr. S. C. Parry, who had occupied the position temporarily since the retirement of Dr. Kidd, and who left to study for the Diploma in Public Health. • The health work of so large a Port could not be carried out by a comparatively small Staff without the co-operation of the Officers of His Majesty's Customs and of the Port of London Authority, the Pilots and the Members of the Staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants, whose assistance and courtesy are gratefully acknowledged. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES P. WHITE. 13 I.—AMOUNT OF SHIPPING ENTERING THE PORT DURING THE YEAR 1935. Table A. Number. Tonnage. Number Inspected.

Countries from which passengers principally arrive: North America, Australia, Europe, British South Africa, India and the Far East. (b) Cargo Traffic :— Principal Imports—Merchandise of all kinds, principally Provisions, Fruit, Grain and Flour, Hides and Skins, Meat, Oil and Fats, Eubber, Textile Materials, Tobacco, Wood and Wool. Principal Exports—Manufactured Goods of all kinds. Countries with which the Port principally trades—The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. III.—SOURCE OF WATER SUPPLY. (a) For the Port:— In all the docks, except Tilbury, water is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. Tilbury Docks take water from the South Essex Water Company. The majority of the wharves are supplied by the Public Water Companies within whose areas of distribution they are situated, but several have their own deep wells and some have no water available for ships, in which case any water required may be obtained from water boats. (b) For Shipping :— Ships usually obtain water from the shore supplies as indicated above, but when no water is available at the berth or if a ship is lying at moorings in the river, supplies are obtained from water boats. 14 The general position is the same as reported last year. The arrangements made with the Port of London Authority whereby the annual re-registration of water barges is made conditional upon the satisfactory report of your Officers as to fitness of the barges for the carriage of drinking water, continued to work smoothly. The number of water barges remained at 12. IV.—PORT SANITARY REGULATIONS, 1933. Arrangements for dealing with Declarations of Health remain as described in my Report for the year 1933 and are working smoothly. Boarding of Vessels on arrival.—During the year it became necessary to replace the old " Hygeia," which has served as your Boarding Station at Gravesend for the past thirteen years. The ceremony of naming the new " Hygeia " was graciously performed by Miss Joan Easton, daughter of your Chairman, on 23rd November. The following note was printed in the programme of the day's proceedings :— THE "HYGEIA." The Corporation of the City of London was constituted the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London by an Order of the Local Government Board dated 7th September, 1872. In 1873 an old naval vessel, the " Rhin " was acquired from the Admiralty and was fitted up as a floating hospital and moored off Denton. When the Preventive Officer of Customs considered that a vessel should be medically inspected before being granted pratique, he notified the Medical Officer in charge of the " Rhin," and took him off in his launch. In 1883 a hospital was built on shore to replace the " Rhin." The Boarding Medical Officer was then accommodated on the Customs hulk " Dolphin," and went off with the Customs Officers to visit every ship from foreign. In 1892 Her Majesty's Customs asked that other accommodation should be provided for the Medical Officer to obviate danger of the communication of infection to their officers, and in 1893 the Port Sanitary Authority purchased an old paddle tug, the " Robert Bruce," which was on the point of being broken up, and moored her off Gravesend as the Boarding Station. The " Robert Bruce " was renamed the " Hygeia," and this name has been given to each of her successors. The first " Hygeia " lasted till 1910, when the hull of an old coasting collier, the " Eliza Blaxland," took her place. She in her turn was replaced in 1922 by the present " Hygeia," which is the hull of a twomasted schooner built in New Brunswick in 1873, and which, at the age of 62, is no longer fit to stand the stress and strain of life on the River in Gravesend Reach. The new " Hygeia " is a double-bowed lighter built of steel in 1918 for the Admiralty. She was lying in Chatham Dockyard under the uninspiring name of " Yard Craft, 67," and was purchased from the Admiralty in April this year. The interior of the hull has been fitted up as a store-room and workshop for the engineers of the launches. On deck has been built a house providing a sitting-room for the Medical Officer on duty, three cabins for the Medical Officers and for other members of the staff who must occasionally stay on board to await the arrival of an infected ship, an office, a galley, a cabin for the shipkeepers and lavatory and water-closet compartments. When completed, the new " Hygeia " will take up the moorings of the old " Hygeia," she will be connected to the shore by telephone, and will be lighted by electricity from the Gravesend Corporation Supply. She is much younger and stronger than any of her predecessors, and it should be many years before she has, from infirmity, to retire from the service of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. The Boarding Launch " Howard Deighton " has continued to give excellent service and, apart from the period of her annual overhaul, has been constantly in commission. Notification to the Authority of Inward Vessels requiring Special Attention.—No changes have been made in the arrangements. In my Report of last year I remarked on the difficulty in regard to light signals at night, and suggested that the Ministry of Health should endeavour to arrange a fixed light signal which would indicate definitely that a ship required the attention of the Port Sanitary Authority. So far as I am aware, nothing has been done in this direction, and consequently it frequently happens that at night a ship requiring medical inspection is not dealt with as promptly as she would be if it were possible to pick her out from other approaching vessels as she comes up the River. 15 Mooring Stations designated under Article 10:— (a) Within the Docks ; (b) Outside the Docks. These remain as reported in 1933. There has, so far, been no occasion to make use of them. Particulars of any standing Exemptions from the Provisions of Article 14.-—None have been made, and the arrangements described in my 1933 Eeport have worked smoothly. Experience of working Article 16:— (1) As ships are cleared in the River immediately on arrival, no difficulty has been experienced in preventing the embarkation or disembarkation of unauthorised persons. (2) The arrangements for the surveillance of contacts have been facilitated by the use of the " Business Reply Card " system, described in my Report for the year 1933. What Arrangements have been made for:— (a) Premises and waiting rooms for medical examination. (b) Cleansing and disinfection of ships, persons and clothing and other articles. (c) Premises for the temporary accommodation of persons for whom such accommodation is required for the purposes of the Regulations. As regards (a), (b) and (c), the arrangements remain as described in my Report for the year 1933. (id) Hospital accommodation available for Plague, Cholera, Yellow Fever, Small-pox and other infectious diseases. The Cubicle Ward Block opened at the end of 1934, and described in my last Annual Report, has proved exceedingly useful. Most of the cases admitted have been nursed in the cubicles ; there have been no cross-infections and no difficulties of any kind. The Hospital was further improved during the year by the rebuilding of the Nurses' Home, the provision of a new laundry, a small sewage disposal plant, a gardener's store, a new incinerator, and by the raising of the level of the ground over about a quarter of the site. On 23rd November your Chairman opened the new Buildings, the following brief description of which was printed in the programme of the day's proceedings:— THE NEW HOSPITAL BUILDINGS. Nurses' Home. The original Nurses' Home, built in 1883, comprised -only four rooms on the ground floor and four on the first floor. There were also two bedrooms for maids in the Centre Ward Block. At a later date a single storey annexe was built on to the Nurses' Home, providing four additional bedrooms and the smallest and oldest ward was taken over for the maids. This was an unsatisfactory and uncomfortable arrangement, and it was decided to bring all the stafl together in one building connected by a covered corridor to the new cubicle ward block in which most of the nursing is done. The single storey annexe and the old ward block were demolished and the original Nurses' Home has been extended on two floors in a westerly direction. The new building comprises:— On the Ground Floor—Medical Officer's office, Matron's office, linen and general store-rooms, cloak-room, small waiting-room, Nurses' rest-room, Nurses' dining-room, Maid's rest-room, Maid's dining-room, kitchen, boiler house and water-softening plant. On the First Floor—Matron's bedroom and sitting-room, nine bedrooms for Nurses and Maids, bathrooms, &c. 16 Laundry. A new Laundry has been built on the west end of the Disinfecting Block, and has been equipped with electrically operated washing machines. Steam is supplied from the boiler of the disinfecting plant. Sewage Disposal Plant. Formerly earth closets were used throughout the Hospital. The Cubicle Block, Nurses' Home and Porter's Cottage have now been provided with a water-carriage system and a small sewage-purification plant has been built. The hospital site is below high-water mark in the River and therefore, in order to be able to discharge the effluent into the River, it is necessary to pump the sewage into tanks delivering on to a filter bed some 5 feet above ground level. Gardener's Store and Incinerator. The two older ward blocks are still provided with earth closets. It has therefore been necessary to retain the incinerator which has been rebuilt behind a small new building providing accommodation for the storing, cleansing and lime-washing of pails, and a gardener's store. Grounds. The Corporation has made a grant of £1,000 out of the City's Cash for the improvement of the Hospital grounds. This has been spent in laying out a formal garden between the Nurses' Home and the Cubicle Wards and in raising the level of the ground over about one quarter of the site by tipping loam to an average depth of 3 feet. When this has been levelled, grass has been grown and trees planted, the appearance of the grounds will be greatly improved, and this section will no longer be water-logged throughout the winter. (e) Ambulance Transport. The Boarding Launch " Howard Deighton " and the Upper Biver Launch " Frederick Whittingham " have given excellent service and are economical in running cost. The Middle River Launch " James Howell " is, however, approaching the end of her career. She is a wooden launch with a petrol engine, and was built in 1923. She was designed for work at Gravesend, not only to carry the Sanitary Inspector on his visits to ships in the Lower District, but also to land crews for bathing and their bedding and effects for disinfection at Denton Hospital. All this work is now carried out by your Boarding Launch, the " Howard Deighton," and the " James Howell " is used by the Sanitary Inspector in the Middle River District, except when the " Howard Deighton " is out of commission. The " James Howell " then returns to her old duties and the Medical Officers board from the Customs Launch. When a new Launch is built she should be of steel, and be fitted with Diesel-type engines, and, while not being so big as to be uneconomical in her ordinary duties of carrying the Sanitary Inspector to vessels lying in the River between Greenwich and Purfleet, she should be of sufficient size and strength to take over the work of a Boarding Launch at Gravesend whenever the " Howard Deighton " is out of commission. (f) Supervision of Contacts. No changes have been made in the arrangements described in my Reports for the years 1933 and 1934. Arrangements for the Bacteriological or Pathological Examination of Rats for Plague. Arrangements made for other Bacteriological or Pathological Examination. Arrangements for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Venereal Diseases amongst Sailors. Arrangements for the Interment of the Dead. All remain as reported in detail in 1933. 17 Table C.

" Mongolia."—Previous Information.—On 26th February the Medical Superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company telephoned that a lady passenger suspected to be suffering from Small-pox had been landed from the ss. " Mongolia " at Suez on 24th February. Arrangements were made to send by P. and 0. courier to the ship at Marseilles a supply of cards for notification of address and change of address by passengers and crew. On 7th March information was received that the diagnosis of Small-pox had been confirmed and that the patient had died. 18 Movements of Vessel:— Melbourne January 29 Adelaide ,, 31 Fremantle February 4 Colombo ,, 13 Bombay „ 16 Port Sudan February 22 Suez ,, 24 Port Said ,, 25 Marseilles March 2 London ,, 8 Number of Persons on Board :— Passengers, 475. Crew : European, 127 ; Native, 179. In addition 72 passengers left the ship at Marseilles. History of Case.—The patient, Mrs. B., aged 71, embarked with her husband at Bombay on 16th February. On 19th February the bedroom steward reported that she was " wandering in her mind." The assistance of the Ship's Surgeon was refused, but he insisted on seeing the patient. There were then, however, no symptoms suggestive of Small-pox. On the morning of 24th February Mr. B . . . asked the Ship's Surgeon for a " tonic " and, on being questioned, admitted that the medicine was not for himself but for his wife. Again the Surgeon insisted on seeing the patient. He found her to be very ill, with a temperature of 102-2° F., and the eruption of Small-pox just coming out. The distribution was typical, and during the day the Surgeon observed the development of the rash from the macular to the papular stage. In the evening of the same day the ship arrived at Suez, and the patient and her husband were removed to hospital ashore. Action taken on Board.—After removal of the patient to hospital her cabin was disinfected. All the passengers landing at Port Said were vaccinated before disembarking. On 25th February every member of the crew was vaccinated, and free vaccination was offered to all passengers. 166 passengers accepted vaccination, 128 held certificates of vaccination within the last three years, 15 were exempted after inspection because they had had Small-pox or had marks of recent successful vaccination, 3 were ill and unfit to be vaccinated, and 45 stated that they have been recently vaccinated but held no certificates. Seven refused vaccination ; of these only two had never been vaccinated. Of the 109 military passengers, eight were vaccinated on board and 101 had certificates of recent vaccination. Action taken in London.—The " Mongolia " arrived off Gravesend at 11 a.m., and was immediately boarded by Drs. Warrack, Willoughby, Mellows and Parry, two clerks and two Sanitary Inspectors. The crew and passengers were all medically inspected their names and addresses were carefully checked, and each was given a card on which to notify any change of address Avithin 14 days of disembarkation. The notifications were posted to 204 Medical Officers of Health by the evening post from London. Various articles which had remained in the patient's cabin were removed to Denton Hospital for disinfection by steam and the cabin was again fumigated. The ship was finally cleared at 1.30 p.m. Observations.—Undoubtedly the patient was infected with Small-pox before embarking at Bombay. It appears that the passenger was disinclined to seek the advice of the Ship's Surgeon and, had the latter not been particularly careful and conscientious, diagnosis might have been delayed and the infection widely spread on board. The Surgeon is to be commended for his insistence on seeing the patient, and for the promptness with which he undertook the vaccination of passengers and crew. The double post-card system of recording names and addresses on disembarkation and changes of addresses subsequently worked admirably. 19 The following data is explanatory of the action taken under this sytem:— 403 address cards, representing 602 passengers and European crew, were scrutinised and checked during the medical examination, and were posted to the Medical Officers of Health of 204 individual Sanitary areas in the United Kingdom. Subsequently 131 passengers notified change of address once and eight passengers notified change of address twice. Ten members of the crew notified change of address once and ten notified their return to the ship. Though there were several queries in regard to addresses, every person on board was ultimately traced, and, though no further cases of Small-pox developed, it is satisfactory to know that the system of surveillance can be worked so efficiently. ss. " Mulbera."—The ss. " Mulbera " arrived at Gravesend on the 17th April, having landed a case of Small-pox at Aden on 28th March. On arrival in London the whole of the passengers and members of the European and native crews were medically examined, but there was no evidence that there had been any spread of the infection on board. As the incubation period of the disease had expired, it was unnecessary to arrange for surveillance to be carried out. The infected cabins were disinfected and all bedding, &c., was removed to Denton Hospital for steam disinfection. No further case occurred. ss. " City of Durban."—The ss. " City of Durban " arrived at Gravesend on 31st August, having landed a suspected case of Small-pox at Suez on 17th August. The patient had been ashore at Calcutta on 24th July, and on 9th August complained of a pain in his chest, and on 12th August of a pain in his stomach. He developed an eruption which the Master considered to be " prickly heat." His temperature varied from 99° to 100° up to 17th August, when the patient was landed at Suez. The Port Medical Officer at Suez suspected Small-pox, and removed the case to Hospital. The entire personnel of the ship was vaccinated at Suez on 17th August, and the infected quarters fumigated and sprayed. On arrival at Gravesend the entire crew were inspected by the Boarding Medical Officer. The ship was kept under daily observation while in the Port, and the infected quarters were again fumigated. No other case occurred. A Suspected Case of Typhus Fever. On 17th September the London Agents of the Blue Funnel Line informed me by telephone that they had received news from their Portland Agent that the ss. " Agamemnon " from the Far East, due in London at 3.30 a.m. the next day, had on board a case of Typhus Fever in the person of a Chinese steerage passenger. I suggested that there might be a mistake between Typhus and Typhoid, but the Agents assured me that the case was one of Typhus. Dr. MelloAvs, the Boarding Medical Officer on duty, was informed, a Sanitary Inspector was instructed to be prepared to carry out delousing of living quarters as might be necessary, and arrangements were made for the reception of the patient at Denton Hospital and for the disinfecting and bathing station to be in readiness. On arrival of the ship, Dr. Mellows found the patient to be a Chinese passenger named Soo Foo, aged 41, travelling with his wife. He embarked at Hong Kong on 14th August, and the subsequent ports of call were Singapore, Port Sweetenham, Penang, Colombo, Aden, Suez, Port Said and Marseilles. The last time the patient was ashore was at Penang on 23rd August. He had a slight febrile attack on 4th September, but his temperature returned to normal next day. 20 On 11th September he had a shivering attack and complained of headache and backache and took to his bed. The Ship's Surgeon found him to have a temperature of 103° P. On 14th September he developed a macular rash, profuse on the abdomen, chest, back and buttocks, but sparse on the arms and legs. The rash became petechial, and was confluent in the loins, lower abdomen and groins. The patient was very dull and stupid, and the Surgeon diagnosed Typhus Fever. Since embarkation he had been berthed in the ship's hospital with his wife, and there he remained, a member of the Chinese crew being detailed to attend on him. On arrival in the Port of London the patient was found to have a temperature of 103° F., with pulse 130 and respirations 30. His face was somewhat bloated, the conjunctivae were injected, his tongue was dry and brown, there were sordes on his lips and his nostrils showed evidence of recent epistaxis. He was dull and apathetic, and it was difficult to attract his attention. There was a punctate purpuric rash in the abdomen, back, axillae, loins, buttocks and groins becoming confluent and markedly hæmorrhagic in the groins, loins, lower abdomen and axillae. The skin was dry and hot; there was some congestion at the base of the right lung. The spleen was not palpable. The urine contained a trace of albumen. The bowels were constipated and only a few scybala resulted from an enema. No pediculi corporis or capitis were found, but pediculi pubis were in evidence. Specimens of blood were taken for bacteriological examination, but, in the meantime, your Medical Officers were all agreed that clinically the case was one of Typhus Fever, and therefore not only were the patient and his wife taken with all their bedding and effects to Denton Hospital, where they were deloused before being admitted to the wards, but the ship was treated as being Typhus infected. All persons on board were medically inspected. All were well and free from lice. Nevertheless, since the Chinese Steward who had attended on the patient had lived in the forecastle, he and 18 other members of the Chinese crew were taken ashore and bathed, and their clothing disinfected. Meanwhile, their quarters and the ship's hospital were put under fumigation with sulphur dioxide. The names and addresses of the passengers and white crew were obtained and forwarded the same day to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts of destination. The Chinese crew were prohibited from leaving the ship while she remained in the Port of London. The ship was released from quarantine at noon on the day of arrival. She left for Rotterdam on 21st September, and the Medical Officer of Health of that Port was informed by letter of the circumstances. In Hospital the patient remained in much the same condition for two days and then rapidly improved and, on 22nd September, bis temperature had fallen to normal, he was mentally quite alert and the rash had disappeared, only mottling remaining. He made an uninterrupted recovery, and was discharged on 18th October perfectly well. On 19th September Dr. Scott, of the Ministry of Health, reported that he had tested the blood serum against the three types, Malayan, Mediterranean and European Proteus with completely negative results, but that he had got a good positive Widal for B. Typhosus (titre 1 in 640), and that therefore he thought there was a strong possibility that the case was one of Enteric, and not of Typhus. On 26th September Dr. Scott reported similar results on a second blood sample, except that the agglutination of B. Typhosus was to a higher titre, about 1 in 2,000. He asked for specimens of faeces. A specimen was sent on 30th September, but B. Typhosus were not isolated. However, a further specimen sent on 8th October did yield a colony of B. Typhosus. It is of interest that, though this case appeared clinically to be one of Typhus Fever it was in fact Typhoid. The Weil Felix reaction was definitely not obtained, the Widal reaction was strongly positive at the time of admission to Hospital, and even more strongly positive a week later, and finally B. Typhosus was isolated from the stools. 21 V.— MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS. These remain as described in my Report of the year 1933. There is no doubt that Article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention, 1926, has achieved a great reduction in the rat population in ships. The proportion of Exemption Certificates to Deratisation Certificates is increasing, and the average number per ship of rats killed by fumigation is decreasing. There is an increasing interest in, and appreciation of the value of, rat-proofing both in ships and ashore, and I think it may be claimed that the spread of Plague by sea-borne commerce has been almost stopped. Unfortunately this does not mean that there can be any relaxation of rat-repressive measures. Rats are adaptable and prolific, and rapidly breed up to the limits of the rat-harbourage and the food supply. They promptly take advantage of every circumstance which is even temporarily in their favour. Fumigation, trapping and poisoning are but palliatives. The only treatment which holds out any prospect of lasting relief from rat-infestation is rat-proofing both in ships and on shore in ports. The principles of rat-proofing are perfectly simple, and their practical application is not costly if carried out at the time ships and buildings are constructed. This is gradually being realised by those who build and those who operate ships, and by those responsible for the construction and maintenance of buildings in ports, but the importance of attention to small details is not appreciated. Efficiency in rat-proofing really depends upon care in detail, for rats can pass through small openings, and the points they select for gnawing their way into harbourage or from one compartment to another are just those out-of-way corners which are most likely to escape observation, and most awkward for the men who are carrying out the rat-prOofing to work in.

British 9,671 58 686 1,674 Last year I published a report by Inspectors Hundy and McDermott on " Crew Accommodation in Vessels Inspected in the Upper and Middle River Districts of the Port of London." This year I have received the following observations from Inspector Mackie, whose district is the Surrey Commercial Docks, but who has also had considerable experience in the Tyne Port Sanitary District before he came to London. Mr. Mackie says : " Much has already been said and written on the Hygiene of Crew Accommodation in Ships, but having had some years afloat, combined with a fair experience of inspecting vessels of the tramp class, I should like to submit some of my own observations in regard to crew quarters in such ships. " Many British tramp ships compare unfavourably in this respect with similar vessels of several other nations because of at least one of the following:— " (1) Old type of forecastle without reasonable facilities to encourage a sanitary standard of living " (2) Indifference of certain members of the crew to the cleanliness and comfort of their quarters. " (8) Insufficient time or staff to maintain good conditions. " (4) Failure of the Master of the ship to exercise any control over the conditions of crew accommodation. 23 " In regard to— " (1) It is now generally admitted that accommodation in the bows of a cargo ship is most unsatisfactory. Crew quarters should be in the poop or amidships and the open forecastle should be replaced by two berth cabins. A messroom should be provided and there should be adequate provision for washing. Trough-closets should be replaced by separate pedestal water-closets. Other amenities such as metal wardrobes and lockers for clothes in sleeping quarters and food lockers in messrooms promote cleanliness and add generally to the comfort and convenience of the crew. " (2) Trouble frequently arises between occupants of a forecastle on the question of cleanlinesss and, unfortunately, usually results in the clean members of the crew leaving the ship. " (3) This state of affairs exists in the majority of tramp vessels, and the results are seen quite clearly while the vessel is in port. The work of both deck and engineroom is always pressing, and sanitation in the forecastle receives little or no attention except for one or two hours once a week. On this occasion, which is usually Saturday morning, one man is detailed off to clean up generally. This is totally inadequate, and in many cases I have been able to secure the services of one man for one half-hour after each meal to maintain cleanliness, which has resulted in great improvement. In better appointed vessels and in most foreign ships a messroom boy is carried to keep the crew quarters clean, Avhich is a much more satisfactory arrangement. " (4) The importance of the Master exercising close supervision over the crew accommodation cannot be exaggerated. Such action on the part of the Master can absolutely transform the sanitary condition of the living accommodation, and even in sister ships the standard of cleanliness may differ to the extremes according to the personal interest taken by the Master. But in comparing conditions in ships of similar construction but belonging to different companies, it would not be fair to blame the Master without knowing what encouragement he gets from his owners. Some companies will comply with every reasonable request in connection with maintenance. Others run the ships of their fleet in competition one with another, and the Masters are judged according to their expenditure during the voyage. Such a method results in reluctance on the part of a Master to incur any expense beyond the minimum necessary for the prevention of structural deterioration of his ship. For example, on inspection of a certain ship I found the paintwork on the forecastle in a very dirty condition, and when I drew attention to this I was informed that it was undesirable to wash the paint, as this brought nearer the day when repainting would be required. In the same ship the sailors were provided with one bucket each for washing, but they were required to use the same buckets for ship work, including the baling of filthy water from the bilges. "Masters are often very lenient in the exercise of discipline, and make the excuse that the logging of offenders does no good, and only involves the Masters in a lot of trouble at the shipping office at the end of the voyage." Mr. Mackie's observations are in accordance with the experience of many Port Medical Officers and Sanitary Inspectors. There are three factors in the hygiene of crew spaces. First of all the type of accommodation provided by the owner and the shipbuilder; secondly, the discipline exercised by the ship's officers, and thirdly the standards of the men themselves. It is so easy for a vicious circle to be started ; poor accommodation, in which only men who are indifferent to comfort and cleanliness will sail, and disheartened officers who cease to endeavour to maintain decent conditions; or accommodation which is structurally good, a crew who are indifferent to their surroundings and officers who cannot or will not maintain discipline resulting in a disgusted owner, who comes to the conclusion that it is a waste of money to provide good quarters, because they will not be properly cared for by the occupants. Lastly there is the reasonably good accommodation and the reasonably good crew, but lack of interest on the part of the officers, resulting in all-round deterioration. The Port Medical Officer and the Sanitary Inspector naturally tend to talk and write of the unsatisfactory conditions because they are anxious to get them remedied, and it might appear that they found all owners hard, all officers slack, and all sailors 24 dirty. As a matter of fact, conditions generally are far better than anyone would imagine who read such reports as this without having any first-hand knowledge of ships. There are many owners who are keenly interested in the welfare of the crews of their ships, and who provide them with excellent quarters ; there are many officers who constantly devote care and attention to the conditions under which the crew live, and who exercise discipline in such a way that the men are happy and contented ; and there are many sailors and firemen who show practical appreciation of good accommodation, and who even make the best of unsatisfactory quarters. Moreover, I believe that things are improving ; that there is a greater willingness on the part of owners to carry out any suggestions for improvements, and that the standards of the men are higher. No doubt the latter will be favourably influenced by improved housing conditions ashore. As regards discipline, I am not so sure of improvement. A brutal discipline would quite rightly not be tolerated nowadays. To an increasing degree the poAver to keep discipline depends on personality, yet it is as essential as ever on board ship. There must be many psychological stresses and strains for the man who spends his life at sea, and he unconsciously derives strength and support from a reasonable discipline. Progress is being made, but there is yet much to be done. It is not, the job of the Board of Trade or the Ministry of Health or Port Sanitary Authorities, or Shipowners or Ship Builders, or officers or men, alone. All must play their part and each must refrain from obstructing, actively or passively, or from stimulating obstruction. The shipping industry has been very sick, and the convalescent must not be called upon for effort beyond his strength ; on the other hand, if he is not encouraged to do what is within his capacity and excuses of weakness are always accepted, he may become a hypochondriac, demanding tonics which provide temporary stimulation, but which Mall never restore him to health. The Heating of Crew Accommodation in British Merchant Ships. Inspector L. R. Hundy reports as follows In British ships heating of accommodation is by one of the following methods:— (1) Coal fires usually of the bogie stove type. (2) Steam heaters. (8) Electric heaters. (4) Central heating by low-pressure hot water. Bogie stoves are still the means of providing heat in many ships, especially those of the smaller class. Sometimes all the living accommodation is thus heated ; sometimes only the crew spaces, the officers' quarters amidships being heated by steam or electricity. Steam heaters are quite common. Electric heaters are rare, at any rate in ships berthing in the Upper River District. It is only in recently-built ships, viz., the motor vessels of the Newcastle Coaling Company, the Tyne Tees Steamship Co., the Dundee, Perth and London Steamship Co., and the Fulham Borough Council's Steamships that I have found the low-pressure hot-water system of heating. From my enquiries and from inspections and reinspections, I have formed the opinion that this means of heating is very satisfactory in vessels where the quarters are compact. The advantages of the bogie stove are that it promotes ventilation and assists in maintaining a steady flow of air from the quarters up the flue, thus keeping the air in the accommodation moving. It is not dependent on any mechanism, a very important point, and the men who require the heat can regulate it as they like. In small vessels when the men live in one compartment, a large coal bogie stove and a metal bin for storage of fuel is quite a satisfactory arrangement. 25 It is in larger vessels where the crew are housed in different rooms that the disadvantages of the bogie stove are manifest. In the first place it is dirty. A common sight in crew quarters during the winter months is a bogie stove in each room with no means of storing coal, heaps of ashes and coal strewn round the stove, and the paintwork black with soot. In the second place it is uneconomical. The life of a bogie is short, a year or two at the best, and the flues and cowls are constantly becoming defective. Each stove requires a store of coal, which is usually issued in a sack, so that there is a sack of coal in every room. It is obvious that paintwork very quickly gets dirty in a room containing a bogie stove. In the method of central heating by low-pressure hot water, the boiler is situated in the crew mess room, or in the galley if it is adjacent to the forecastle, and requires very little attention. Pipes run from the boiler to the various compartments, and thus the alleyways through which they run, as well as the rooms, are warmed. This method is much cleaner and more economical than bogie stoves, and when the quarters are grouped together in the poop, as they usually are in modern ships, it appears to be very efficient. The initial outlay may be higher than for bogies, but if central heating is installed when the ship is being built, the difference in cost should be very small, and should very soon be more than repaid by the reduction in fuel consumption. The following figures are taken from two motor vessels belonging to the same Company. Both vessels carry eight hands, are of about the same size, and engaged in a similar trade. One has a coal-fired galley range and a boiler for central heating by lowpressure hot water. Two tons of coal last one month. The other has a coal-fired galley, a coal stove in the saloon and a bogie stove in the forecastle. Two tons of coal last ten days. Moreover, the Master of the latter vessel says his room is never warm, as it only has borrowed heat from the saloon. The Chief and Second Engineers have oil stoves in addition. Central heating by low-pressure hot water was recommended in the Report of the Manning Committee of the Shipping Federation on " Officers' and Crews' Accommodation in Cargo Vessels," issued in 1930. Steam heaters are clean, but tend to make the atmosphere of compartments too hot and too dry. Moreover, steam is often not available when the ship is in port. Electric heating is clean and convenient, but is easily damaged, and again is often out of commission when the vessel is in port. VII.— FOOD INSPECTION. Chilled Meat from Australia and New Zealand. (By F. J. Massie, Food Inspector.) During the year ending 1935 there was a considerable increase in the amount of chilled meat imported from Australia and New Zealand into the Port of London. The quantities are given in the appended Table. The examination of the meat covering the two years showed very little variation in general condition upon discharge. This fact is indicative of a strict adherence to the method of transportation prescribed by the Cambridge Low Temperature Research Department, viz., an agitated air and gas circulation of 90 per cent, of air and 10 per cent. C02, in addition to chilling by brine circulation. Three systems of air and gas circulation are employed. In some steamers an end to end or fore and aft method, and in others a side or thwartships delivery, is adopted. A third system is that of overhead delivery from ducts let into the deck head, or through perforated hanging rails. Of the three systems enumerated, the latter method is said to be the best, because in descent a more thorough and efficient diffusion is obtained. All three systems form a completely enclosed air cycle. 26 On discharge, small variations in the condition of the meat were noticeable and upon making investigations it was found that the different methods of applying the air circulation, coupled with varying heights of the chambers, produced these differences. In most of the cases where meat turned out in good chilled condition, the deck heights were generally in the neighbourhood of seven feet. This ideal height only allowed for hanging of hind quarters singly, and crops or fores in two tiers, one below the other. Where, however, the deck heights were greater, the tendency was nearly always to hang as much meat as possible in the space available, and the method of hanging in such spaces differed from the former in that hinds were hung overlapping, the upper hind in close proximity to the overhead hanging rail and the lower quarter suspended from a chain to within about six inches of the deck. Crops and fores in such chambers were hung in block form, generally three tiers deep. This type of chamber is very naturally not conducive to so good an out-turn, because of excessive contact resulting from overlapping of quarters of beef. Where meat has turned out slimy, or showing an excessive mould growth, such faults have primarily been found to be attributable to the contact previously referred to, the degree of damage in this respect varying in accordance with tightness of stowage and the weather experienced during voyage. Where chafing and contact have only been normal, we have had instances of unsatisfactory condition resulting from faulty prehandling, such as inefficient wipingdown of carcases after dressing, and unfavourable conditions in the transportation of meat from cooler to steamer. Again, definite deterioration has often been apparent through the length of time the meat was in the steamer. As will be seen in the attached lists, this period has occasionally extended over 70 days. This was forcibly shown in the case of 150 crops which, on discharge, were affected by a heavy growth of mould, and were sour and tainted round the "clod and sticking." This parcel had been loaded in very hot weather. When the meat had been in the vessel's chambers from 60 to 70 days, the flesh presented a tired and dead appearance, with shrinkage of the muscle round the aitch bone, and with the fat looking bleached or washed out. Most of the quarters were from animals approximately four years old ; those which were younger were brighter and, naturally, more pleasing in appearance. Where the amount of C02 gas was lower, the flesh was considerably brighter in colour, showing that the higher amount of C02 gas tends to darken the flesh and, in some cases, causes the fat on the outside of the quarters to take on a greyish hue, though less, if any, mould growth has been present. One of the effects of the agitated air in the chambers is to dry off the meat, as the water vapour is continually being taken up by the brine pipes and held in the form of snow. Though this causes shrinkage and loss of weight, it also helps in keeping down mould growth and slime. Chilled pork has been brought over from New Zealand in small quantities, but the parcels have not turned out very successful. In the case of one parcel the flesh was slimy and showed considerable mould growth. This parcel, however, had not been treated with C02; the shipment, including chilled beef, having been carried under brine circulation only, for experimental purposes. Chilled mutton also has been brought from New Zealand, but since this commodity has not been exploited to the fullest extent, and the number has therefore been small, few data have been obtained, though those carcases which were examined were in very good condition, and showing only slight mould growth. Presumably the chilling of pork and mutton is not an economical proposition at present. 27 Steamer. Date of Aerival. Austbalia. New Zealand. C02 Gas. Time Meat on Boabd. Hinds. Crops. Hinds.

The transport and handling of chilled and frozen meat cargoes constitutes a major part of the work within the Royal Docks, the supervision of which is one of the principal duties of the Sanitary Inspector in this area. On an average 30 vessels arrive each month, fully laden with chilled and frozen meat, the total weight of meat landed during 1935 being 687,000 tons. The principal countries of production are: South America (Argentine Uruguay, Brazil and Patagonia), Australia, New Zealand, and small quantities arrive from South Africa, Iceland and the United States of America. In recent years there has been an increasing importation of chilled beef, as opposed to frozen beef. Chilled beef is suspended from the deckhead on hooks and chains, in chambers specially constructed for the carriage of this product; frozen beef is stowed in bulk in an horizontal position. Where chilled beef is brought long distances and is on board ships from 40 to 70 days, it is generally stowed in specially constructed air-tight chambers, and the meat treated with a 10 per cent, concentration of C02 gas to retard the growth of mould. It will be appreciated from the large quantities of meat products discharged within this area that large numbers of men have to be employed in discharging the meat from ship, handling it on the quay, and removing it by means of hand trucks or electric bogies, to be loaded in insulated lighters, railway trucks and motor or horsedrawn vehicles, in which it is conveyed to all parts of the country for immediate consumption, or storage in one of the many cold stores in London and the Docks. The procedure of discharging meat from the ship to the lighter or vehicle is as follows: Men employed in the ship's hold have their boots and legs covered with hessian or canvas and, in addition, running boards are placed over the working tier of carcases to prevent contamination of the meat. These men place the carcases or quarters in the rope and canvas, or flexible (self-cleansing) metal and wire slings. Each sling holds about 15 to 20 beef quarters, 40 pork carcases, 60 mutton carcases or 29 100 lamb carcases, according to size. The crane lifts the set out of the hold, and lands it on to a large table supported on trestles, situated on the quay. Men then transfer the carcases, according to marks and numbers, to electric bogies or hand trucks, and thence to insulated lighters, railway trucks, or motor vans, where they are tallied and neatly stowed or hung. From the Docks the meat is conveyed to Markets throughout the country. In some cases the meat is lifted out of the hold by the ship's derrick, and landed on a table on deck, from whence the crane transfers the set to the quay. In other cases the set is landed direct on to the electric bogey, no table being used. At three berths in the Docks special mechanical overhead conveyers are fitted, and used for chilled meat only, the quarters being hung on chains and conveyed to the various loading places, where they are hung on hooks in railway trucks or vans. Section 21, Part VI. of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations deals with the transport and handling of meat. It is with these Regulations that the Sanitary Inspector is mostly concerned. The Regulations make it necessary for the Inspector to keep a constant watch on all vehicles and appliances used for the transport and handling of meat. In practice, points to be observed by the Inspector are : (1) Men to have proper and clean covering over their boots ; (2) Slings and tables to be kept clean and scrubbed from time to time ; (3) Hand trucks and bogies to be kept clean, coverings and mattresses to be kept clean and scrubbed ; (4) Surrounding quayside to be covered with straw or sawdust, to prevent contamination of carcases falling to the ground ; (5) Insulated lighters to be kept clean and dry (ceiling, sides and top), also forward and after compartments ; (6) Railway trucks and vans to be kept clean and free from odour and scraps ; and (7) Slings, bogies and hand trucks not to be overloaded, causing carcases to fall off and become contaminated from the quay. It is also very necessary that the meat should not become wet from rain or other causes, otherwise mould may soon develop. With regard to the Regulations, I would like to make the following observations : As all quarters or carcases are covered either with stockinette or hessian, or both, it is not incumbent on the men handling meat to wear overalls and head covering. The Regulations, however, definitely state " stout covering " in excluding the wearing of overalls, &c., and as mutton, lamb and pig carcases and, to a great extent, beef quarters, are only covered with stockinette (a very flimsy covering), I consider this does not constitute " stout covering " within the meaning of the Regulations ; in which case men should be provided with suitable overalls and head covering, when handling meat so covered ; provided always that the Docks are defined as a " place wholly or mainly used for the storage of meat before it is distributed to retailers." The use of straw on the floor of vehicles is unhygienic and unsatisfactory. Straw harbours a quantity of dust, mould spores, &c., and, if damp, would hasten the growth of mould on the meat. I consider washed canvas sheets, or strips laid on the floor of the vehicles, would be much better and cleaner ; a strip or sheet for each bottom tier, placed, as and when required, before commencing the next bottom tier. After discharge the strips could be rolled up, and kept in the lighter or vehicle, ready for the next freight. With reference to insulated lighters, the ceiling or floor calls for most attention and inspection. Men, whilst stowing meat in the hold of a lighter, have to walk up and down over the ceiling, which soon becomes dirty and maybe contaminated, for one knows not where their boots have trod previously. Similar strips of washed canvas as mentioned above could well be used, or gratings about three feet wide placed on the ceiling as the meat is stowed. Finally, a further point which I suggest worth considering is that a considerable quantity of meat is sent into the cold store in the Docks prior to reconditioning. The act of reconditioning necessitates the stockinette covering being removed from 30 the carcase, which latter is placed on a table, and certain unsound or brine-stained portions removed. Men employed on this work should be provided with overalls, and the reconditioning done under cover, to keep dust and flies, &c., from contaminating the meat. Butchers engaged in jointing meat in the Docks should be provided with a proper closed butcher's shop. Apricot Pulp from Spain. On the 1st July, a consignment of 21 barrels of apricot pulp arrived in the East India Dock from Spain. The consignment was detained pending the result of the analysis of a sample drawn from one of the barrels. The analysis showed that the pulp contained sulphite preservative equivalent to 3,850 parts of sulphur dioxide per million. The result of this analysis was reported to the Ministry of Health, and also to the Importers, and at the request of the latter a further sample was drawn from the same barrel as the first sample and an additional sample from another barrel. The results of the analysis of these two samples showed the presence of sulphur dioxide to the extent of 2,980 and 1,400 parts of S02 per million respectively, the former being in excess of the maximum amount permitted under the Public Health (Preservative, &c., in Food) Regulations, namely, 1,500 parts per million, and the latter just within the maximum permitted. The Importers were informed of these results, and it was pointed out to them that as one sample showed an excess of sulphite preservative and the other was just below the maximum permitted it was only reasonable that either the whole consignment should be returned to the shippers, or that the consignment should be sorted by analysis, the cost of which should be borne either by the importer or the shipper, after which all barrels found to contain iess than 1,500 parts of S02 per million would be admitted. The Importers agreed to the latter proposal, and the following is the results of the analyses of the whole of the 21 barrels. SO 2 Parts per million. SO 2 Parts per million. Barrel No. 1 1,980 Barrel No. 12 1,470 „ 2 2,100 „ 13 1,265 „ 3 1,120 „ 14 1,970 „ 4 1,140 „ 15 1,890 „ 5 940 „ 16 1,495 „ 6 1,690 ,, 17 1,400 „ 7 1,710 „ 18 940 „ 8 1,895 „ 19 3,850 „ 9 1,240 „ 20 1,425 „ 10 2,040 „ 21 2,070 „ 11 1,210 After consideration of these figures 11 barrels were placed at the disposal of the Importers, whilst 10 were re-exported under guarantee from the Importers that they would not be re-shipped to any port in the United Kingdom. Sardines. During 1934, 138 samples of sardines were examined for lead. Results showed parts of lead per million varying from 2 parts per million to 78 parts per million. No sample was entirely free. The average amount of contamination per sample examined was 17.3 parts per million of lead. Seven consignments representing 1,070 cases or 107,000 tins were re-exported 31 During 1935, 55 samples were examined and the degree of contamination with lead varied from nil to 40 parts per million, though only one sample contained no lead. The average contamination per sample was 11.7 parts of lead per million. Nine consignments representing 880 cases or 88,000 tins of sardines were re-exported. At the beginning of the year 12 tins were drawn from a consignment of sardines, and each month the contents of one tin were analysed with a view to ascertaining whether the degree of lead contamination was affected by the period of storage. Previous experience had shown that if a number of tins are taken from one consignment and the contents of each tin are analysed separately the degree of lead contamination will be found to vary considerably; for example, in May, 1934, six tins taken from one consignment gave respectively the following results : 13, 18, 22, 22, 24 and 58 parts per million of lead. For this reason, and because it is believed that the contamination takes place principally during the preparation of the sardines before they are put into the tins, it was not expected that this investigation would show that storage had any effect on the lead content of the fish. This proved to be the case, the results in parts per million of lead over the 12 months consecutively were 14. 13, 20, 14, 25, 25, 20, 21, 18, 15, 14 and 17. These figures are well within the limits of variation found when a number of tins are examined at the time of arrival of a consignment, and there is obviously no relation between the lead content of the fish and the period of storage. During 1935 a number of samples of tinned fish were examined for metallic contamination and the presence of prohibited preservatives. Amongst these imports were frequent consignments of fish from Sweden for use in the restaurant trade as hors d'œuvre and entered as:— Herrings in Remoulade Sauce. Pary Herrings. „ ,, Madeira Sauce. „ „ Dill Sauce. Herring Tit Bits. „ „ Onion Sauce. „ ,, Mustard Sauce. Anchovy sprats in Oyster Sauce, Kron Anchovies. Koster Tit Bits. Koster Sills. Fish Balls. Kaviare. The tin content of the majority of the samples examined was very low, but in practically every case a preservative (benzoic acid) was detected. This fact was brought to the notice of the Importers, and towards the latter part of the year consignments began to arrive which contained no preservative. It was noted that in a few consignments the tins bore an inscription to the effect that the contents contained a certain amount of benzoic acid. This was accounted for by the fact that certain countries do not prohibit the addition of preservatives. In June, at the request of the Ministry of Health, a number of samples of Californian oranges were drawn and examined for the presence of boric acid on the skins. It has been stated that when imported into this country oranges have been found to be treated in various ways. The external treatment of this fruit has included the use of formaldehyde and boron preservatives; treatment with borax and colouring matter ; coating with paraffin-wax; and the covering of the skins with a varnish of coloured cellulose. 32 Twenty-one samples of various brands of oranges were examined, 9 of which were free from the presence of boron preservative, while 12 showed traces only, the largest amount found being 0.0l grain per pound. In July a consignment of sweets in bottles arrived from Japan. A sample was drawn and sent to the analyst, as it appeared that the glass was particularly fragile and there seemed to be a real danger of a consumer unwittingly swallowing fragments of broken glass mixed with the sweets. The result of the analysis confirmed this suspicion, and the attention of the Importer was called to this dangerous method of packing, with a request that he would take the matter up with the packer. No further consignment of this nature has been noted in the district. Caseous Lymphadenitis.—During the year the proportion of carcases of imported mutton examined for Caseous Lymphadenitis, irrespective of the country of origin, remained at 5 per cent., and that for pieces of mutton at 100 per cent. The results of the examination during the year of mutton and lamb, weight 43 lbs. and over, from Australia, New Zealand and South America, were as follows :— Where from. Carcases examined. Carcases found to be diseased. Carcases found to have Lymphatic Glands missing. Australia 3,779 12 — New Zealand 7,416 3 — South America 3,300 11 — Totals 14,495 26 — Percentage condemned. From Australia 0.32 „ New Zealand 0.04 „ South America 0.33 Pig Carcases.—A careful examination was made of a percentage of pig carcases arriving in the Port, the number of carcases examined being 3,148. Two carcases were found to be diseased. Actinobacillosis in Ox Tongues.—A percentage examination was made of every consignment of frozen ox tongues arriving in the Port. 243 consignments were put into dock store, where careful examination was made by your Officers of 23,137 tongues, and 134 tongues were found affected with Actinobacillosis. Action taken under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, resulted in 2,368 tons 13 cwts. 3 qrs. 20 lbs. of unsound food being destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption.

Dodgson, Director of the Shellfish Research Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries at Conway, your Medical Officer visited the Oyster Purification Station at Brightlingsea. This is the first, and at present the only, station for the treatment of oysters in this country. The principle is the same as that employed for mussels at Conway, viz., to cleanse the shells and then let the shellfish cleanse themselves by leaving them submerged in a tank of sterile sea-water for a sufficient period. The main difference in practice is that in the case of oysters in cold weather the water in the tank must be warmed to about 56° F., whereas with mussels this refinement is not necessary. The shellfish treated at Brightlingsea are Portuguese and American Blue Point Oysters, which have been relaid in a tidal creek of the estuary of the River Colne. At low water the oysters can be clearly seen on the mud banks in the creek, and it is obvious that the layings are exposed to serious risk of sewage pollution. The procedure of cleansing is as follows : The oysters are brought to the station and laid not more than two deep on wooden gratings in concrete tanks (45 feet by 35 feet by 2 feet 6 inches). They are then hosed with powerful jets of sterilised sea-water from a specially designed rake with which the double layer of oysters is turned over so that all are thoroughly washed. The sea-water is sterilised by the addition of the necessary amount of a solution of bleaching powder. The tanks are sloped towards a channel at one end and the dirty water escapes through a drain at the lowest point. The tank is then filled with sterilised sea-water and emptied again, thus flushing away all the dirt that has been washed off the shells. The next stage is to get the oysters themselves within their shells washed. This is done by filling the tank with sterile sea-water, sufficient of a solution of sodium thiosulphate being allowed to drip into the water as it enters the tank to neutralise any residual chlorine. The submerged oysters open and pass the sterile water through their shells as they naturally do in breathing and feeding, thus washing themselves 38 clean. They are left submerged overnight, and the next morning the tank is drained and the oysters are again hosed to wash away everything they have excreted. Then for a second time the tank is filled with sterile sea-water and the oysters remain submerged for a second night. The tank is then drained, the oysters hosed and all excreta flushed away. The last stage is to give the oysters a shallow bath for one hour in sea-water to which sufficient bleaching powder has been added to give two parts per million of residual chlorine. In this bath the oysters do not open, the object being finally to sterilise the shells. The oysters are then taken from the tank and may either be packed at once in receptacles (bags or baskets) which have been sterilised by immersion in water treated with bleaching powder so as to contain 10 parts per million of residual chlorine, or they may be stored for not more than one week and not more than six deep in sterile sea-water which is changed every day. Each package of oysters leaving the station is sealed with a specially stamped lead seal. It was not anticipated that this treatment would remove all bacteria from the oysters, but in fact samples taken up to the present have proved to be sterile. The station is quite small and compact, yet it is capable of dealing with six million oysters per annum. The plant comprises two outdoor treatment tanks for use in summer and four smaller covered tanks for use in the winter, when it is necessary to warm the water to about 56° P., the optimum temperature for the cleansing process. There are in addition electric pumps for pumping the sea-water from the creek into the storage tanks and also to give the necessary pressure for the hosing process. There are four water-storage tanks, each holding 28,000 gallons of water and alongside there is the boiler house for warming the water in the winter. The seawater is sterilised by the addition of a solution of bleaching powder as it enters the storage tanks. A small storage tank, a tank for the sterilisation of receptacles and an office are also provided. The whole area of the station is fenced and concreted, and everyone who enters must walk through a pool of water to which bleaching powder has been added. No smoking is permitted, mainly to discourage spitting. The charge for purification is eightpence per hundred oysters, but if the station was working to capacity the charge could be reduced to sixpence. However, even eightpence per hundred does not seem to be an excessive price to pay for the certainty that oysters are a clean and safe article of diet, and several fishermen remarked to your Medical Officer that their only complaint was that they were placed at some disadvantage in competition with others who gathered oysters from layings which it was contended were equally polluted, but who were not obliged to cleanse their oysters. Unfortunately, neither the retailers nor the general public yet realise the advantage of the cleansing of shellfish, and there was therefore no special demand for purified oysters. It may be hoped that in the near future either public opinion or regulations of the Ministry of Health will insist that all molluscan shellfish shall be cleansed by a satisfactory method at an approved station before being sold for human consumption. Under the Public Health (Cleansing of Shellfish) Act, 1932, Local Authorities have power to provide tanks or other apparatus for the cleansing of shellfish (together with all works and appliances necessary for the proper use thereof) and to make in respect of the use of any tank or other apparatus so provided, such reasonable charges as the Authority may determine. Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934. On 14th November the Court of Common Council resolved to make an Order under the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934, and subsequently copies of the following Notice were sent to the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, to the Kent and Essex Sea Fisheries Committee, to the Worshipful 39 Company of Fishmongers, the Corporation of the County Borough of Southendon-Sea ; were served on the owners and tenants of private layings and were posted in conspicuous places near the public layings:— PUBLIC HEALTH (SHELLFISH) REGULATIONS, 1934.

On the 23rd May, one of your Food Inspectors, an Officer duly authorised by the Port of London Sanitary Authority to act in the execution of the above-mentioned Regulations, made provisional arrangements with the Warehouse Keeper of a Warehouse in the St. Katharine Dock to draw samples of certain classes of tea the next morning. The samples were required on a request from the Ministry of Health. The Inspector called at the Warehouse on the 24th May at the time arranged, and was informed by the Warehouse Keeper that he had received instructions from his Head Office that he was not to allow the Inspector to draw samples, nor indeed to admit him to the Warehouse. 52 I pointed out to the occupiers of the Warehouse than an authorised Officer of the Port Sanitary Authority had the right, under Part II., Articles 7 and 8, of the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, to enter any premises in the district of the Port Sanitary Authority at any reasonable time and examine and sample any foodstuffs therein, and I suggested that they Should withdraw the instructions which they had given to their Warehouse Keeper not to admit the Food Inspector of the Port Sanitary Authority, nor to allow him to draw samples from the tea stored in the Warehouse. This they declined to do; therefore the matter was reported to Mr. Solicitor, who, on the 28th May, applied for and obtained a Magistrate's Warrant authorising the Inspector to enter the Warehouse and search for and examine any article of food deposited therein. ALIENS ORDER, 1920. Medical Inspection of Aliens. During the year 22,842 Aliens (excluding Alien Seamen) and 1,770 Transmigrants landed in the Port of London from vessels.

Thames Warrant to enter issued. The Loading of London House, &c., Refuse into Barges from Wharves on the River Thames. Bye-laws made by the Port of London Sanitary Authority in 1894 provide that dustbin and other offensive refuse carried in a vessel within the district of the Port Sanitary Authority shall not be loaded above the coamings or hatches and shall be properly and securely covered so as to prevent nuisance from or escape of refuse. The Bye-laws further require that a vessel loaded with refuse shall not remain in the district of the Port Sanitary Authority more than 48 hours. In spite of these Bye-laws the conditions under which refuse is loaded, transported and discharged in your district are very unsatisfactory. With few exceptions the loading berths are not properly equipped to prevent refuse blowing about or falling into the river or on to the foreshore during the operation of filling the barges. The barges are regularly loaded high above the coamings and the refuse is inadequately covered during transport down river. At the discharging berths loaded barges often lie uncovered for 24 hours and the foreshore is littered with refuse which has fallen from the grabs. It has been recognised that it is unreasonable to prohibit the loading of lighters above the permanent coamings because the refuse is so light, perhaps weighing only six or seven cwt. per cubic yard, and it has been accepted that temporary coamings should be allowed. This is quite satisfactory if the temporary coamings are of solid construction, but wooden gates are unsatisfactory and sheets of corrugated iron are worse. Proper covering of the refuse is impossible if the refuse is stacked high above the coamings unless good temporary coamings are fixed. The usual material employed for covering is hessian, and when tarpaulins are asked for the reply is given that the refuse gets very hot under the tarpaulins, which consequently perish rapidly. It is obvious that hessian is easily torn, and unless it is kept in good condition it is a most inefficient covering. Many Statutory Notices have been served in respect of infringements of the Byelaws, and they are followed by temporary improvement so far as the particular craft are concerned, but there is no general improvement. I submit that repeated prosecutions are not the best way of solving this problem. The trouble really is that your Officers almost inevitably come on the scene too late ; the offence has already been committed. The problem should be dealt with at its source, viz., the loading berths, but this can only be done by the Corporation of the City and the Councils of the Metropolitan Boroughs through their Superintendents of Cleansing. I would further suggest that it is unreasonable to require the men in charge of the barges to take steps to prevent refuse blowing or falling into the river Avhen similar steps are not taken at the loading berths. I recently visited the refuse wharf of the City of Westminster in Grosvenor Dock, where, on account of the proximity of a block of flats, it has been necessary to take special precautions against the occurrence of any nuisance. Here I saw what can be done in the way of screening barges during loading and of covering loaded barges awaiting removal. The Stepney Borough Council also carry out the loading of refuse under very satisfactory conditions at Duke Shore Wharf. But at the majority of refuse wharves it appears that little attention is paid to the prevention of refuse falling or blowing into the river during loading, and no effort is made to see that barges are covered, so as to comply with the Bye-laws of the Port of London Sanitary Authority before they leave the wharf. Unless conditions are improved at the wharves and the loading and covering of barges is closely supervised there, it will continue to be almost impossible for your Sanitary Inspectors on the River to enforce compliance with your Bye-laws. 55 PARROTS (Prohibition of Import) REGULATIONS, 1930. 680 parrots, &c., came under the notice of your Officers during the year. 101 Notices were issued in respect of 209 parrots, &c. Number exported in respect of Notices served 202 Number destroyed (Notice served to export) 7 Number exported (not time to serve Notice owing to short stay of vessel) 7 Number on through Bill of Lading to another Port 11 Number admitted under Ministry of Health permits 420 The bodies of 33 birds were sent for investigation to the Ministry of Health 33 680 In addition, 95 parrots were reported as having died in vessels during the voyage, the bodies being destroyed before arrival in the Port. VISITORS TO THE PORT SANITARY DISTRICT. During the period covered by this Report the following Medical Officers and Sanitary Inspector visited the Port of London to study the sanitary administration either in general or in some particular respect:— Dr. Z. de Teisseyre of Gdynia. (Port Medical Officer.) Dr. J. N. Mcintosh of Jamaica. (Government Medical Service.) Dr. Hsu, of Peking. Mr. B. N. Shami, Assistant Sanitary Surveyor, Haifa, Palestine. In July Dr. A. R. Wellington, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, Hong Kong, called at the Port Sanitary Office to enquire whether I could recommend a suitable man to undertake the work of supervising fumigation of ships and other measures of rat repression in Hong Kong. After consideration of the responsibilities of the position and the conditions of service, I informed Dr. Wellington that I had no recommendation to make, but suggested that if they could find a suitable man for the appointment he might receive a course of training in the Port of London. On 12th October I had a letter from the Crown Agents for the Colonies informing me that they had selected a Mr. Littlewood, who had formerly been a Sanitary Officer in Iraq, and asked if he could be given a two months' course of instruction, commencing on 4th November. Your Worshipful Committee acceded to this request. Mr. Littlewood completed his training on 3rd January, 1936, and sailed for Hong Kong on 4th January, 1936. VISIT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SHIPS TO THE THAMES, 15th-22nd May. As your Worshipful Committee always have a Medical Officer on duty and three Launches capable of carrying stretcher cases, your Medical Officer undertook to render any assistance required in case of urgent sickness or accident on board any of His Majesty's ships lying between Gravesend and London Bridge. The detailed arrangements were made between Surgeon-Commander H. Willoughby, B.N.V.B., and the Naval Health Officer at the Nore. 56 Assistance was rendered on three occasions as follows:— On 15th May, at 7.30 p.m., the Boarding Medical Officer was asked to remove a case of acute appendicitis from H.M.S. " Crusader," lying in Tilbury Dock. In one hour the Motor Launch " Howard Deighton " locked in and out of the dock, and landed the case to a waiting ambulance at Royal Terrace Pier, Gravesend. On 19th May an A.B., suffering from pneumonia, was landed from H.M.S. "Orion" lying in Gravesend Reach, and transferred by Naval ambulance to the Royal Naval Hospital, Chatham. On 20th May the Sanitary Inspector on the Upper River District called at H.M.S. "Kempenfelt," and was informed that a man had swallowed a sixpence the previous night and was complaining of slight pain. Your Medical Officer recommended that he should be taken in the Motor Launch " Frederick Whittingham " to the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, for X-ray examination. This was done, and it was ascertained that the sixpence had gone down his windpipe and lodged in one of the larger air-tubes, whence it was removed by means of the bronchoscope. VISIT OP THE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH CHIEF CLERKS. On Friday, 28th June, the Association of Public Health Chief Clerks visited the Port of London, and were the guests of your Chairman on board the s.y." St. Katharine," which the Port of London Authority kindly lent for the occasion. Forty-six Members of the Association were present. The party embarked at Tower Pier at 10 a.m., and proceeded down River to the Royal Docks. After cruising round the Royal Docks the voyage was continued to Gravesend, where the party transferred to the Boarding Launch "Howard Deighton," in which they visited the "Hygeia" and the Port Sanitary Hospital. The return journey was made in the "St. Katharine" to Tower Pier, which was reached shortly after 6 p.m. At luncheon the toast of "The Port of London Health Committee" was proposed by Mr. T. B. Clark, Chairman of the Association, and your late Chairman responded. Captain G. S. Elliston, President of the Association, proposed the toast of " The Chairman." The Port of London Authority co-operated with your Worshipful Committee in giving the visitors a very interesting and enjoyable day. ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PORT SANITARY AUTHORITIES OF THE BRITISH ISLES, May 29th to 31st. In accordance with the instructions of the Corporation of the City of London, as the Port Sanitary Authority, Sir William Thomas and your Medical Officer attended the above Meeting. On the evening of 29th May the Delegates were received by the Mayor of Grimsby at the Town Hall. At 10 a.m., on 30th May, was held the first Session of the Annual Meeting. The following extract from the Minutes is of special interest to your Worshipful Committee:— " Port Sanitary Authorities—Alteration of Title. Sir William Thomas moved, Alderman F. Askew seconded, That, in view of the wide scope of the work of Port Sanitary Authorities at the present time, and the limited significance popularly attached to the word ' Sanitary,' it is desirable that the title ' Port Sanitary Authority ' should be altered to ' Port Health Authority.' The Legal Adviser read a letter, dated 26th April, 1935, from the Clerk to the Hartlepool Sanitary Authority, stating that his Authority had passed a resolution supporting the foregoing motion. Motion carried. 57 Sir William Thomas moved, Councillor C. H. Parkinson seconded, That this Association of Port Sanitary Authorities of the British Isles is of the opinion that the scope of the work of its members would be more generally understood and appreciated if they were entitled " Port Health Authorities ' instead of ' Port Sanitary Authorities,' and requests the Minister of Health to take, at the earliest opportunity, the steps necessary to effect the desired change of name. Mr. W. L. Platts moved, Alderman S. J. Brice seconded, as an amendment, That all words in the motion after the words 'instead of Port Sanitary Authorities ' be struck out, and that the following be substituted therefor:- That the Minister of Health be desired to support the proposed change. That the Local Government and Public Health Consolidation Committee be requested to insert appropriate provisions in any Public Health Consolidation Bill which it may recommend to H.M. Government. The mover and seconder of the motion concurred in the amendment. Amendment carried. The Motion as amended was thereupon put as a Substantive Motion as follows:- (a) That this Association of Port Sanitary Authorities of the British Isles is of the opinion that the scope of the work of its members would be more generally understood and appreciated if they were entitled ' Port Health Authorities ' instead of ' Port Sanitary Authorities.' (b) That the Minister of Health be desired to support the proposed change. . (c) That the Local Government and Public Health Consolidation Committee be requested to insert appropriate provisions in any Public Health Consolidation Bill which it may recommend to His Majesty's Government. Carried." At the Dinner given in the Town Hall by the Mayor and Corporation of Grimsby, Sir Arthur Eobinson, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, proposed the toast of the Association and, in so doing, said that the desired change of name would have his full support. The Association also approved the Minutes of the General Committee of 3rd May, and decided to forward to the Minister of Health the following Resolution which had been drafted by your Medical Officer, and which your Worshipful Committee, at their Meeting in April, instructed your Delegates to support:— That it is the opinion of the Association of Port Sanitary Authorities of the British Isles that the present system of control of shellfish layings by closure is unsatisfactory as a Public Health measure and ruinous to the Shellfish Industry ; that it has now been proved that shellfish can be efficiently cleansed by relaying in the case of oysters and mussels, and by steaming, in the case of cockles and winkles, that the necessary apparatus can be established and operated on a self-supporting basis, and that therefore the time has now arrived when legislation might be introduced with advantage to both the Public Health and the Shellfish Industry, requiring that only such shellfish (whether home-produced or imported) as are certified by a responsible Authority to have been cleansed in this country by an approved method, in a recognised establishment, should be sold for human consumption. Alderman Cyrus T. Clissitt, J.P., representing the Port Sanitary Authority of Newport (Mon.), was elected President, and Councillor J. Crawford, representing the Port Sanitary Authority of Glasgow, was elected Vice-President for the year 1935/6. After the transaction of formal business, Sir John Marsden, Bt., read a paper on " The History of the Development of the Port of Grimsby." The second Session of the Annual Meeting was held on Friday, 31st May, when the following interesting Papers were read:- Dr. J. A. Kerr, Medical Officer of Health of Grimsby, on " Fish Inspection and Modem Development." Dr. J. R. W. Hay, Port Medical Officer of Immingham, on " Weil's Disease as affecting the Fish-worker and Fishing Ports generally." Dr. D. A. Cadman, Assistant Medical Officer of Health, Hull and Goole, on "A Survey of Crews' Accommodation in Merchant Ships at the Port of Hull." 58 Visits were paid to the Fish Market, Ice Factory, Fish Curing Factory, Immingham Docks and the Grimsby and District Hospital. The Delegates were cordially welcomed and generously entertained by the Mayor and Corporation of Grimsby, and the Meeting was, from every point of view, both valuable and enjoyable. RECOGNITION OF GALLANT ACTION BY INSPECTORS HUNDY AND COOMBE. Mr. L. R. Hundy, Sanitary Inspector.—On 14th January, 1935, Inspector L. R. Hundy dived into the River Thames to rescue Deck Boy S. Strange, who had fallen overboard from the m.l. "Frederick Whittingham." On 24th April, at Wapping Police Station, Inspector Hundy was presented with the Honorary Testimonial of the Royal Humane Society, inscribed on parchment, " for having on the 14th January, 1935, gone to the rescue of a boy who was in imminent danger of drowning in the River Thames at Wapping, and whose life he gallantly attempted to save." Mr. P. W. Coombe, Food Inspector.—The following letter was received on 1st April from the Chief Police Officer of the Port of London Authority:— "I have pleasure in bringing to your notice the commendable action of Mr. Paul Westron Coombe, a Food Inspector residing at No. 34, Longlands Park Road, Sidcup, in the employ of the City Corporation. The circumstances, as reported by my Divisional Inspector, were as follows:— "On the 11th April, 1935, at 'K' Shed, West India Dock, a van drawn by two bay horses, owned by Messrs. Carter Paterson & Co., Ltd., took fright and bolted at the sound of railway shunting operations. "When the van approached 'S' Shed, Mr. Coombe, appreciating the danger, cycled up to the back of the van, threw his cycle to one side, caught hold of the tailboard, and endeavoured to climb in. The sway of the van, however, threw him face downards on the ground and, as a result, he sustained an injury to his right hand which was subsequently treated at the Ambulance Station. In the opinion of an eye-witness, Mr. Coombe took considerable risk in attempting to board the van, as at the time it was travelling very fast. " I shall be obliged if you will be kind enough to convey to Mr. Coombe an expression of my thanks for his courageous act. " The van was brought to a standstill shortly afterwards by a carman employed by the London and North-Eastern Railway." CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority during the year ended 31st December, 1935. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a "canal" for the purposes of the Acts "includes any river, inland navigation, lake or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb and flow of the tide." The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary rivers and creeks of the River Thames:- On the right bank— From Teddington downwards:— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Dock. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth).
