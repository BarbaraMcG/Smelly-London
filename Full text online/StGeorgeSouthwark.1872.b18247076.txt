Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1871—72. 3 Parish of Saint George the Martyr Southwark annual report made to the vestry by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. for the year ending lady-day, 1872. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Since I presented my last Report to you, the results of the Census, then just taken, have been published, so that now we know accurately the number of persons who dwell in this Parish, and the number of houses occupied. I told you in that Report, that the mortality had notably decreased in each of the Sub-districts, but at the same time expressed it as my opinion, that the decrease would to some extent be found due to a diminished population, consequent on the destruction of houses for railways and new streets. This opinion has been found true as regards one Sub-district, namely, the London-road. In this Subdistrict, considerable improvements have been made; two or more narrow streets of wretched and dilapidated houses have been removed, with several small unventilated and filthy courts and alleys, and which have been replaced by broader streets, and houses of a superior class, whilst the courts and alleys have been utterly abolished. There were 231 fewer inhabitants in the last Census than in that of 1861; and the increase in the two other Sub-districts has been small, in comparison with former numberings. Thus in the Borough-road Sub-district, the increase was but 26, in contrast with 805 of the Census of 1861; in the Kent-road Sub-district, there was 778 increase in contrast with that of 1527 ; and in the London-road Sub-district, in place of an increase of 1353, there was, as I have told you, a decrease of 231. The increase of the population of the District amounted to 573. Since 1831 there has been a gradual diminution of the rate of increase. In the ten years from 1831 to 1841, the increase reached to 6,875; in the ten years from 1841 to 1851, the increase fell to 5,180 ; and in the ten years from 1851 to 1861, the fall was still greater, amounting only to 3,685. The population now numbers 56,083 persons. I must remark, however, that the decrease of the mortality in the year 1870-71, occurred with an increase 4 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. of the number of the people, and so far is a cause of satisfaction. The 56,083 persons occupy 6,903 houses, making a little more than eight persons to each house. But although the population has increased, the number of houses has decreased to the extent of 335. In the previous ten years, there were 7,238 houses occupied by 55,510 persons; now there are only 6,903 houses for 56,083 persons, consequently the overcrowding must be more than ever. This fact gives greater emphasis to the decrease of the death rate, as it significantly shows that the sanitary regulations carried out, have prevented the normal results of overcrowding. There are in this Parish (speaking in round numbers) 27,280 persons to the square mile; in Southwark 83,280 to the same space; and in London 26,680. This contrast between the population and the mileage becomes still more remarkable, when we examine that of the eleven Registration Districts of this Kingdom. The North Western Division, the most dense except that of London, numbers 1,082 persons to the square mile; the remaining ten are as follows:—412, 419, 288, 259, 254, 243, 241, and 178, making an average of 389. What a demand upon the labour and perseverance of a Vestry does this revelation denote, namely, to make habitable a Parish, which within such confined limits, contains so large a number of people, the greater proportion of which consist of the poorest, the most unthrifty, and the most helpless. However, this Parish, which has been far away beyond the remembrance of the present generation a bye word and reproach, remains no longer so : it may no more take its rank as the lowest amongst the low and wretched Parishes of London, in which disease and death hold high and continued carnival. Perhaps I may be permitted to make a few more remarks about the Census, although not necessarily connected with the scope of my Report. At midnight on April 2nd, 1871, the population of London within the Tables of Mortality was 3,251,804. Great cities have been called the graves of mankind, and if vastness of size, and number of people aggregated together gives authority for this name, then may London be emphatically so called. And this title claims the especial attention of all who concern themselves in sanitary matters, when it is found that out of the 22,704,108 of the population living in England and Wales, 12 900,000 live in large towns, and the remaining 9,804, 108 live in small towns and country parishes. There was an increase of 2,637,884 over the numbers living when the Census of 1861 was taken. The town districts have grown twice as fast as the country districts; nevertheless, their growth has not been so groat in proportion as in the previous ten years. The average number to each house was 5.3 persons. More than half a million of houses have been built. The population increased at the rate of 705 persons daily. The increase has proved greater than in any previous ten years. Should the present rate continue, the population will double itself in 56 years. This fact will create-fear to those who look upon an increasing population with alarm, and there are many thoughtful philanthropic men who are possessed with this fear. One writer upon this subject humourously tells us, that he already begins to feel a kind of Black Hole of Calcutta sensation. The fear is premature. The earth is as yet comparatively uninhabited and uncultivated. " Canadian forests stand unfelled, boundless plains and prairies remain unbroken with the plough; on the east and on the west are green desert spaces never yet made white with corn." Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1871—1872. 5 Besides, experience has taught us that as civilization and population have increased, so in proportion have the means of existence, and even in a more rapid proportion. And that in the most densely peopled countries food is " not only absolutely, but even relatively most abundant.'' Doubtless the individual consumes the same, but then the means of ???roduction increase indefinitely. Many blades of corn grow now where formerly only one grew ; and far more will be made to grow in the future where the many do now. Famine has more closely threatened this country when the population was hardly half what it is at present. A population cannot go beyond the means of .subsistence. The latter restrains he former. Whilst then, an increase of population is not to be dreaded; neither is it to be looked ???pon as a sure sign of prosperity. The quality of a race is of far more importance than he quantity. " 'Tis pedantry to estimate nations by the census or the square miles of and, or other than by their importance to the mind of the time." The number of births registered in this District during the year ending 30th March, 1872, was 3,943; of these 1,005 were males, and 938 females. 1,444 deaths were registered; of which 705 were males, and 739 were females. Whilst more males were born, more :emales died. The excess of births over deaths was 499. The death rate was 25 in 1000 persons living.

From the highest to the lowest death rate in these "years, the deaths have varied to the number of 388 ; and the excess of births to 458. The second Table gives the weekly deaths from all causes in the three Sub-districts, which form the District, with the mean temperature. The deaths have varied in one week from another to the number of 24. The lowest death rate that has happened in one week was 17, and the highest 41. It Will be found upon examining this Table that with a decrease of temperature, an increase of the death-rate takes place. Thus in the 50th week there were 41 deaths with a temperature ranging in the previous weeks about 35°. 6 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. TABLE No. 2. Week. Rent Road. Borough Road.

This class includes small pox, measles, scarlet fever, whooping-cough, diarrhoea, diphtheria, fever, and other like diseases. It has long claimed the serious attention of the Sanitarian ; and every now and then it challenges that of Society also. Always some of these diseases are present, laying-up, crippling, or destroying. They heed neither place nor person. Whether in the private house or public asylum ; whether in the crowded and busy town, or in the dull and lonely hamlet; whether in the decayed hut, or stately ancestral home, hitherto escape from them has been impossible. They care not for rank nor wealth ; they attack 8 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. the outcast in the street, whom nobody heeds for, or the Heir to a Throne for whom bows down a nation in sympathy and prayer. Diseases which destroy in England somewhere about 110,000 persons annually may not be slighted. In this district during the past year, 453 deaths have been attributed to Zymotic diseases. The most fatal amongst them has been small pox, which has numbered 120 victims. So far as this particular disease is concorned, every one of these 120 might at this time have been in the full possession of life, instead of forming grave-heaps in a cemetery. Macaulay writing about an epidemic of this disease which was raging in 1694, and which carried off the Queen, thus puwerfully characterises it: "That disease, over which science has since achieved a succession of glorious and beneficent victories, was then the most terrible of all the ministers of death. The havoc of the plague had been more rapid ; but the plague had visited our shores only once or twice within living memory ; and the small pox was always present, filling the churchyards with corpses, tormenting with the constant fears all whom it had not yet stricken, leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous traces of its power, turning the babe into a changeling at which the mother shuddered, and making the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maiden objects of horrour to her lover." Unfortunately, science and its teachings are not always appreciated, nor put into practice. The following ways in which this disease was propagated, or may have been propagated came under our notice. We have known under-clothing taken from a person suffering from small pox and pawned or sold ; we have seen mangling done where a small pox patient lay in an adjoining room, and where dress-making was going on in the same room; we have seen men walking in the streets with the disease full upon them ; we have seen the contents of a costermonger's barrow under a bed upon which lay a small pox patient; we have known a child go out to work in the day, and sleep at night with a sister suffering from small pox; and in two or three instances we mot with schools in houses where there were eases of small pox present. I need not mention the going out and coming in of persons where small pox was present, and who must have carried the poison in every direction. There is no possibility in crowded towns of isolating contagious diseases. The remedy lies in prevention. The disease still smoulders amongst us, bursting out suddenly and unexpectedly in various localities, but happily much milder in form. Diarrhoea caused 78 deaths, the next in number after small pox. This disease is closely connected with temperature: it is a summer disease. Two deaths were referred to cholera, one of which happened in Westcott Street, the other in London Street. Fortunately our fears with reference to the advent of cholcra were not realised; nevertheless those fears did not prove barren in result. Movements were made to examine, cleanse, and drain, by Bodies unused to such exertions. “I can testify," says the Home Secretary, " to the improved perception of sanitary evils, and the alacrity and vigour infused into our Sanitary Legislation by the presence of the cholera." Measles and whoopiDg-cough have proved exceptionally fatal. The death rate was higher in both, than has happened in any of the last ten years. The deaths from fivar were exceptionally low, only 19 deaths being attributed to that cause. The year 1364-5 witnessed 128 deaths from fever. The sixth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1871—72. 9 Table will show the number of deaths that have been caused by the. principal zymotic diseases, during the last ten years.

The most natural and most economical mode would be, to distribute it upon the laud, and thus return it to the place from whence it was taken. This seems the probable use that will be made of it. However, this plan is not free from danger. The sewage may drain into the rivers from which our water supply is taken, carrying pith it the seeds of fever and cholera. The terrible outburst of the latter, in the East of London during the cholera epidemic, was chiefly referred to this cause. There is another disease, which an authority some time back declared would be spread broadcast over the land, and which caused considerable alarm and discussion. Sewage undoubtedly contains the ova or eggs of various kinds of parasites, and which consequently would be spread along with the medium in which they existed, and thus our cattle would eat them and become infected, and we should eat the cattle and become infected likewise. A suspicion complete in all its parts, and one of a most disagreeable kind. Fortunately, this matter has been thoroughly put to the test and cleared up. Mr. Hope, a gentleman who has had more experience in sewage-farming than any other man living, had an animal slaughtered, That had been born of parents fed on sewage produce, and which itself had also been fed on sewage produce, and that of the roughest kind, as the outside leaves of cabbages, the rakings of rye-grass and the like. The animal was most rigidly and most minutely examined by a Committee of Scientific Experts, the result of which was, that they reported " the perfect freedom of that animal from internal parasites of any kind." The thanks of the community are due to this gentleman for thus taking the labour and the expense of effectually and decisively allaying the fears so generally and reasonably excited. Deaths from diseases of the brain and nerves show a decrease of 37 compared with those in the year 1870-71. During the last three years these diseases have been upon the decrease, but only to a very slight extent. 10 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Out of the 1,444 deaths thirty-two were attributed to premature birth and debility Seven infants, their ages ranging from sixteen days to three months, were accidently suffocated. A girl, aged seven years, was burnt to death. Two males died from injury to the head ; one by falling from a cart, the cause of the other was not discovered. A male child, aged one year, died from the effects of a scald. A male, aged fifty-seven years, committed suicide, by blowing out his brains. The deaths under five years of age were 829, at 40 to 80 years 341, and 29 at 80 years of age and upwards. The united ages of three of the deaths amounted to 270 years.

The Chemical Reports on the London Waters, published by the Registrar General, have been declared to be sensational and worthless. When chemists themselves disagree, who may decide ? One chemist prefers a mode of analysis, which another chemist asserts to be unreliable. The duty of the Public Analyst is not enviable, as he must, if truthful in his Reports, often run counter to the interest of the Water Companies, who will take care he does not escape criticism. Two reasons have been given for the impure condition of the water distributed to us. It seems that some of the Companies have lately been engaged in improving their works, and had not sufficient room for storage of water, hence they had to hurry on the filtration, which consequently was imperfectly done: and then there were heavy floods, with which we have been visited, which gave rise to the turbidity of the water. Major Bolton, R.E , Water Examiner to the Board of Trade, agrees with the Royal Commission on the Supply of Water to the Metropolis, that the Thames is a suitable source from whence to take our water supply, if only properly filtered. This he intends, as far as his powers will permit him, to see thoroughly carried out. If then the water should not prove of sufficient purity, the Board of Trade will have to interfere. * The tons figured, are so many tons of imparity in 100,000 tons of water. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1871—72. 11 You are aware that the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, is in operation. A constant water supply may now be ensured by taking the proper steps. The demand for it must proceed from the Metropolitan Board of Works to the Water Companies; but how the Metropolitan Board of Works is to become acquainted with the want is not stated. Any Company may object to the demand by presenting a memorial to the Board of Trade in Which is set forth their objections. The Board of Trade may make such order in reference thereto, as to them shall seem just. Any Company may object to give a constant supply until the regulations provided for by this Act are made and are in operation; or, if more than one-fifth in such district are not provided with the prescribed fittings. The prescribed fittings include communication pipes, and also all pipes, cocks, cisterns and other apparatus used for supply of water by a Company to a consumer. Every owner or occupier will have to provide the fittings, and keep them in repair; failing to do this, the Company, if they think fit, may provide such fittings; the owner or occupier paying the expenses incurred. Any Company may repeal or alter any of the regulations made, or make new regulalations instead of any of the same, under the sanction of the Board of Trade. Penalties are fixed on Company and Consumer, for non-compliance with the regulations of the Act. The 33rd clause will directly affect the Vestry, as they will have to act, should necessity require. It sets forth, that the absence in any premises of the fittings shall be a nuisance, within the section 11 and sections 12-19 of the Nuisances Removal Act, 1855; and that nuisance shall be presumed to be such as to render the premises unfit for human habitation. One advance in sanitary improvement is becoming manifest, and that is, the conversion of Church yards into places of health and ornament, instead of places of disorder and neglect; and, as formerly, of disease and disgust, when the dead were shovelled up as fast as-they were shovelled down, and a pestiferous miasma spread abroad injurious alike to worshipper, visitor, and the neighbourhood. The Churchwardens and Overseers deserve the gratitude of the Parish, for the steps they have taken to improve the graveyard of St. George's Church. Money so spent is wisely spent, the result exercising in many ways a wide and beneficent influence. When a Churchyard is " a place grown all over with thorns, and nettles cover the face thereof; " with tombstones broken and tottering to their fall and heaps of disorder everywhere, it is not an object to be desired nor pleasant to look upon. On the contrary, when cleanly and orderly kept, and planted with flowers and shrubs, it serves as a public example worthy of imitation in the various details of life ; for where there is cleanliness and order, there is health and comfort. In connexion with this subject, I may inform you that there were sixty-one boxes filled with human bones removed from beneath the Chapel which stood in London Road, and just around. These boxes it is estimated contained upon the average thirty bodies in each; so that 1830 were removed from that narrow space of ground and conveyed to Woking Cemetery, where they were again committed to the earth, and one may hope finally. 12 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark.

The death rate however has proved comparatively high, reaching to 23½ in 1000 persons living, or one in 43. I find from Reports of other Model Buildings a more favourable state of health prevailing, the death rate averaging 17 per 1000 only, a little higher than three or four of the most salubrious spots in England. It is necessary to bear in mind when considering this low death rate, that those who live in these Buildings, are for the most part the temperate and best conducted of the working classes. Peabody's Buildings were too soon occupied after being finished. Months afterwards, when visiting them, we found many of the ground floors very damp. This housing of the people, as regards health and morality, is a matter of the gravest and of ever increasing importance. There is material wealth in abundance, and which might reasonably be applied to this purpose. And wealth in this case, as in other cases, would beget wealth ; for the real and abiding wealth of a nation consists in the health of its masses. Health to the majority of the population is their only wealth ; without it they become pauperised, a plague to themselves and to every one about them ; fulfilling apparently no duty in life, except indeed it bo to call forth the patience and self-sacrifice of those who minister to them To maintain health is a duty, to which hitherto due imporTance has not been given. Wo seem rather to have shown how far recklessness might be carried, to the injury and destruction of our bodies. And it happens that in those cases here care is shown in their preservation, it is in the following out of old saws which would be better disregarded and forgotten. " All breaches of the laws of health are physical sins;'' and bring about as sad and disastrous results as those brought about through breaches of the moral laws. And it is quite time that every person should feel his own responsibility 14 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. in this matter, and know how much he can do for himself, and which another cannot do for him. " It is the individual man, the individual conscience, the individual character, on which mainly depends human happiness or human misery." or human health, or human sickness. There remains to be reached by mankind a greater length of days than has yet fallen to their lot; and a length of days that shall include continued vigour of mind, and a death like unto the falling asleep of the weary man. A distinguished writer has said, that he has heard it argued, whether lawyers have not as great an interest in the ill-health of mankind as doctors. It would be difficult to compute the number of disasters, great and small, which have left their mark deep and ineffaceable in this world's history, that have taken their origin from this cause alone. Yet, is not the fresh countenance, the firm and compact body, " the iron joint and supple sinew," looked upon as coarse and vulgar, not to be tolerated in the ball-room, or the drawing-room, or the assembly-room ? Only the languid frame, the pallid countenance, the feeble gait, are deemed compatible with refinement and delicate sensibility. He was a wise man, " who instead of doffing off his hat to the high-born, the rich, the well-dressed, only showed that honour to the healthy: coroneted carriages with pale faces in them passed by as failures, miserable and lamentable, while trucks with ruddy-cheeked strength dragging at them were greeted as successful and venerable." It has been said that a soul in right health is the most blessed thing that earth receives of heaven. And wherein to shrine this precious gift, an healthy body is imperative. The men in this great City who enjoy good, sound, intellectual and physical vigour might be easily numbered ; whilst those who are neither well nor ill, who can neither fully perform their duties, nor enjoy life, are innumerable. And when we reflect that all the vast and multifarious concerns, legislative and commercial, are carried on by men in this condition, the conclusion at which we are compelled to arrive is far from satisfactory. A diseased body will warp the judgment, enfeeble the will, and affect every faculty of the mind. What an unregistered catalogue of human woe and sorrow may be attributed to this source alone. Our civilization thus far,has by no means proved an unexceptionable blessing. Whilst it has been the means of evoking great and wide good, evil as its shadow has followed hard behind. Highly favoured as our position is at this moment, there are many points where we stand at a disadvantage compared with the savage. New diseases have been created, and old diseases intensified. The blessings common to man, air, earth, and water have been changed into curses. Growth of civilization necessarily means growth of towns, and growth of towns involves aggregation, and as a result the generation and spread of epidemicB, with degeneracy of race. Waterton in his wanderings, tells us that amongst the South American Indians, diseases are few, and that the chief cause of man's removal from this world into another, is old age. Whilst amongst them he never met with a single idiot, nor a deformed child. Death in childbed was unknown. What a contrast is this with our Idiot Asylums, and Lunatic Asylums, casting their dismal shadows over some of the fairest portions of the land ; and with our Orthopœic Hospitals crowded with the crippled and deformed in such variety, that imagination fails to conceive of what is not there represented. Brain | diseases and insanity are upon the increase, and with them " a spectral troup of shadowy nervous diseases." In England there are over 48,000 insane persons who are receiving Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1871—72. 15 lief from the poor rate. Insanity is. one great cause of pauperism. Such results show a long continued violation of the laws of nature. They are the punishments for such violations. Not always have we erred wilfully, often from ignorance, but ignorance is not accepted as a plea for exemption. The cause why a law is broken does not affect t!ie result. "Our ancestors," says Kingsley, "fasted and prayed, but in vain. They called the pestilence a judgment of God, and they called it by a true name, but they knew not I what God was judging thereby—foul air, foul water, unclean backyards, stifling attic-ks, [house hanging over the narrow street, till light and air were alike shut out. That there lay the sin ; to amend that was the repentance God demanded." It would seem as if in the middle ages sanitary knowledge had gone out: for in long past ages it was known and practised. Great cities existed and carried on mighty works; and vast armies marched, and camped, and fought, which could not well have happened without the practice of sanitary measures. But the legacies left by those who have preceded us, have not all alike been thus injurious and demoralising: generation after generation have worn themselves weary, and lain them down to die in their endeavour to make England what it is; and it behoves the Present Age with its increased means and its greater knowledge, to labour and struggle with unsubdued energy, not only to hold fast that which has been bequeathed to it, but to add to, and to extend those precious possessions, the chief amongst which is—health.
