THE CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1962, which includes the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. During the year the Health Services in the District came under review during consultations held in connection with the proposed reorganisation of London Local Government. Evidence was submitted in support of the Council's successful appeal for the District to be excluded from the proposed Greater London Area. VITAL STATISTICS. There has been a slight fall in the birth rate which, at 10.9 per thousand of the population is nuch below the average for England and Wales (18.0). The death rate (11.9 per thousand) is roughly the same as the average for England and Wales (11.6) and the causes of death remained virtually the same as in recent years. Diseases of the heart and circulation (223) head the list, with malignant diseases (117) as the second commonest group among a total of 479 deaths in the District. There were six deaths from road vehicle accidents and seven other accidental deaths which is a small but welcome reduction from last year's figures (eight and ten respectively). No mothers died from pregnancy, childbirth or abortion. PREVENTION OF ILLNESS. Immunisation. Programmes against smallpox, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis and whooping cough were actively continued and the low incidence of infectious diseases during the year has been very gratifying. Owing to the importation of smallpox cases into the country from Pakistan, demand for vaccination was greatly increased for a time, and there were many enquiries about goods, contacts and travelling restrictions. Several contacts kept under daily surveillance throughout the incubation period remained well. Diabetes Detection. It is estimated on the basis of research work carried out in other communities that between three and four hundred people in this District may be potential diabetics in need of medical advice and treatment. Most of these are likely to be overweight persons above 50 years of age, or relatives of known diabetics, or persons with failing eyesight or women who have experienced many or complicated pregnancies. These are the so-called "high risk" people who under the present provisions of the National Health Service remain -3- /unidentified unidentified and therefore untreated unless they happen to attract the interest of a hospital clinic or family practitioner, or until they develop signs or complications of the disease, which lead them to seek treatment. It is my opinion that this situation will persist until such time as the Ministry of Health gives its approval to schemes of publicity and a screening test available to the whole population as in the case of Mass Radiography. The Council has already indicated its own wish for such a policy to be adopted in this District, and detailed proposals were submitted to the Ministry's officers in order that the necessary expenditure could be authorised. The Ministry has hovever not so far agreed to any Local Authority schemes for screening tests open to the general population,as this is contrary to their present policy of relying on "high risk" members of the communities reporting to their doctors of their own accord for testing, or being found and tested by general practitioners, clinics and hospitals, in the normal course of their routine work. There is abundant evidence that this has not been effective so far, and it is difficult to foresee any greater success for early detection of diabetes by these means in the future, except possibly through extensive schemes of public education on a National Scale over a long period. Close relatives of known diabetics, women who have borne more than six children (or a baby weighing more than ten pounds) and people over fifty who are, or have been, too fat, should ask their doctors to check periodically - especially if any of the following symptoms are present:- thirst, passing of water in excessive amounts, skin irritation, or loss of weight. Accident Prevention. During the year, dairy firms in the District were approached with a view to obtaining their assistance in a drive to reduce the dangers from broken milk bottles. With their co-operation, which is now gratefully acknowledged, 10,000 labels were distributed with milk bottles supplied by salesmen and shop assistants. Tobacco Poisoning. Every opportunity was taken, particularly during visits to schools, to discourage young people from acquiring the habit of smoking cigarettes with a view to reducing their liability to chronic bronchitis and lung cancer in later life. Atmospheric Pollution. Your Chairman of the Public Health Committee and I continued to represent you on the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council. The support of the Joint Conference of the Local Authorities (S.W„ Essex), was obtained for your representations to introduce further legislation for making the sealing of diesel fuel injector equipment obligatory. /PUBLIC -4- PUBLIC HEALTH (INFECTIOUS DISEASES) REGULATIONS. 1955. One person was required under the above Regulations to suspend her employment as a food handler for a period of ten days with a view to preventing the risk of spreading a food-borne infection, namely Salmonella typhimurium. A claim for compensation amounting to £3.4„2d.t was met by the Council. SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT. 1951. Seven persons in possible need of care and attention were brought to the notice of this Department during the year. These cases were Jm^stlgated and, together with the one outstanding from last year, were kept under observation by the appropriate Department. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Education Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

Welfare: Mr, R„N. Weston, Area Welfare Officer, Crown Buildings, Crows Road, Epping. Tel: Epping 3253/4. LABORATORY FACILITIES: The Central Ministry of Health Laboratory at Colindale, and the Branch Laboratories at St. Margaret's Hospital, Epping and at Chelmsford and Essex Hospital, Chelmsford, according to requirements Water, milk, ice-cream and other foods are also on occasion examined at the Counties Public Health Laboratory, Thresh House, Verulam Street, Gray's Inn Road, London, W.C.I. All milk and other food samples taken under the Food arid Drugs Act, are sent for analysis to the Public Analyst, J.H. Hamence, Esq.,Ph.D.,M.Sc.,F.R.I.C., 20 Eastcheap, London, E.C.3. AMBULANCE FACILITIES: The transport of the sick and injured and maternity cases, is provided free by the Essex County Council under the provisions of the National Health Service Act. In case of accident or emergency, (including maternity cases), an ambulance may be called by dialling 999 on the telephone, where automatic, or lifting the receiver and asking the operator for that number in other areas - or, of course, by directly contacting the ambulance station, Knighton Lane, Buckhurst Hill. Non-emergency calls are only accepted from responsible officers of the health service, e„g. doctors, nurses and midwives. Hospital services are provided by the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board at the Forest Hospital, Buckhurst Hill, and at hospitals in neighbouring districts. -11- /HEALTH HEALTH CENTRES: The County Council has four Health Centres serving the District, as follows:- BUCKHURST HILL: Essex County Council Clinic, Buckhurst Way. Tel: Buckhurst 5180. CHIGWELL: Essex County Health Services Clinic, Manford Way. Tel: Hainault 3143. LOUGHTON: Essex County Health Services Clinic, Loughton Hall. Tel: Loughton 5221. Essex County Health Services Clinic, The Drive. Tel: Loughton 5776. At each of these centres there are clinic sessions for expectant mothers, Infant welfare, school children etc., and details of these may be had on application to the centre. Each centre has two or more health visitors or school nurses who call upon mothers in their own homes in addition to giving advice at the centres. In addition to the above, infant welfare centres are also held at the following CHIGWELL; St. Winifred's Hall, Manor Road. The Manse, Chigwell Row. LOUGHTON: Roding Road Church Hall. SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE; The following extracts from the Annual Report of the Divisional School Medical Officer are of interest:- "(a) Health Education: Health visitors have continued to give lectures to girls at secondary schools, these talks being supplemented by visits to a maternity hospital, day nurseries, infant welfare clinics and aged persons' flats. -12- /In In the case of 7 - 11 year olds, lectures are given each term on the care of skin, hair and teeth, with some reference being made to minor ailments. The County Film Library is put to very good use. Films on Public Health subjects, judging by the questions and lively discussions which follow their showing, being very popular. The continued demand for talks and film shows underlines the interest in Health Education and I am sure rewards the staff concerned with their efforts. (b) Defective Hearing: With the appointment of a clinic nurse solely for Audiometric purposes, some headway has been made towards reaching the goal of testing the hearing of every new entrant to infant schools. Children who fail this "Sweep Test" are re-tested and then if necessary seen by a school medical officer to determine whether further investigation is required. Cases at risk (i.e. hearing loss suspected) have continued to be tested. (c) Speech Therapy: A summary of the work carried out in the Chigwell Urban District is shown below Number of centres: 3 " " clinical sessions held: 382 " " individual children treated: 134 " " visits to schools and homes - (i) for treatment - (ii) " consultation - " " attendances at clinic: 1,875 " discharged - (a) cured: 34 (b) unsuccessful: 3 " failed to continue treatment: 5 " refused treatment: 1 " under treatment as at 31.12.62 91 " on waiting list as at " -13- /(d) (d) Specialist Services: Ophthalmic, Orthoptic, Orthopaedic and Physiotherapy services remain the responsibility of the North-East Metropolitan, Regional Hospital Board who continue to provide an adequate service. (e) Chigwell High View Residential School: There are now 114 educationally sub-normal boys of secondary school age on the roll and these pupils continue to have a routine medical inspection each year. Apart from an occasional referral to an Ear, Nose and Throat Consultant or the need for Speech Therapy, no important defects were discovered. They also take part in the B.C.G. Vaccination scheme. 22 pupils left the school during 1962 of whom 8 were recommended for supervision after leaving the school. The provision of this comminity care is the responsibility of the Mental Welfare Department. (f) Maladjusted Children: No progress has been made in the establishment of a Child Guidance Clinic in the Forest Division despite the number of referrals remaining fairly constant. Children from this District attend the Walthamstow Child Guidance Centre. The use of the alarm apparatus in the treatment of Enuresis achieved a certain measure of success and a number of parents wrote letters praising the efficacy of the apparatus,," HOME NURSES: BUCKHURST HILL: Mrs. Jo Turner, 55 Walnut Way (Buckhurst 7689).

To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council. MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1962. I am indebted to the Engineer and Surveyor, Mr. R.W. Edwards, A„M.I.C.E., M.I.Mun.E., for providing the information on pages 18, 19 and 20 regarding rivers and streams, drainage, sewerage and public cleansing, also to Mr. H.E Bywater, M.R.C.V.S.F.R.S.H.,M,Inst. Meat, for his report on riding establishments on pages 23 and 24. R. ROPER, F.R.S.H.,M.A.P.H.I Chief Public Health Inspector, June, 1963. 17 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 1. WATER SUPPLY. Excepting two private well supplies, the whole of the District is supplied by water provided by the Metropolitan Water Board. It has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity and is not plumbo-solvent. In regard to the contaminated supply from the shallow well which was reported in my last report, this dwelling continues to be supplied with water from the Metropolitan Water Board's supply, by tank wagon, pending the completion of a new house to which the occupier will be transferred in the near future. This house will also be provided with main drainage. Examination of the supply from the deep well in the area, indicated contamination at the point of storage in the underground tanks. The owner was advised on work necessary to avoid this contamination, the work was carried out and subsequent samples of the water were reported to be satisfactory. The number of dwelling houses supplied from public water mains is 17,901. The estimated population is 62,070, 2. SWIMMING POOLS. There are six swimming pools in the District, all privately owned. Four are situated in schools, one in the Girl Guides' camping ground at Lamboume Road, Chigwell, and one at Grange Farm Centre, Chigwell, the latter is open to the public. The pools are all supplied with main's water and are treated by chlorination. Routine tests are made during the season and results have been satisfactory. 3. RIVERS .AND STREAMS, The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area within this District which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex River Board. Some flooding of fields in the valley occurs during the exceptionally heavy winter rains. 4. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough Lane which were improved in 1938, extended after the war and are now nearing the end of a further stage of improvement, although the constant increase in the 18 /number number of dwellings in the District is making yet further work inevitable Additional effluent and storm water treatment is to be provided to comply with the higher standards now required by the Essex Rivers Board A smaller part of the District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works, The Council sees the need for improvement there, and a scheme is being prepared. As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing flows from new development but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers. Present proposals envisage new sewerage in both the north and south parts of Loughton. A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of Wanstead and Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme, There are four outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. The four stations include the new one at Roding Road and the newly enlarged one at Bradwell Road. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. A commencement is to be made on providing surface water sewers in the older part of Buckhurst Hill and thus prevent the overloading of soil sewers with rain water. 5. CLOSET ACCOMODATION AND CESSPOOLS. Such premises as have earth closets, chemical closets or cesspools are situated in areas which have no sewer available for drainage connections. Extension of the sewerage system is progressing and connections are being made as these extensions permit. Number of Septic Installations:- Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 62 Loughton 13 76 /6. 19 6. PUBLIC CLEANSING. Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of seven compressing type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a free service of removing bulky articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. This free service cannot be stressed too much as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses etc. into ditches or on to forest land. Trade refuse is also collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse, the character of which is clearly not domestic. Refuse is at present disposed of by controlled tipping at a tip within the District where a bulldozer levels, compacts and, with inert material, covers the refuse. The area exposed at any one time is kept to a low minimum and measures are taken against flies and vermin as may be necessary from time to time. The present tip will be filled in a few years and so long term arrangements for future refuse disposal are now under consideration. Salvage of paper and rags continues to produce sales. A modern salvage building complete with a new mechanical paper baling press has been provided at the Depot, Rectory Lane, Loughton. Road gullies in adopted roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine three times during the year by contract. 7. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. The following statistics show the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the years- (a) 1,061 complaints were received and dealt with. /(b) 20 (b) Summary of complaints; Food condemned 36 " complaints 23 Sewage 12 Polluted ditches, watercourses and ponds 10 Flooding 7 Defective or blocked drains 194 " water closets 14 " water supply pipes 9 Dampness 19 Defective roofs and gutters 10 Accumulations of refuse 20 Defective dust bins 12 Insanitary conditions 6 Vermin 4 Rodents 378 Wasps 106 Other insect infestations 71 Smoke 28 Smells 19 Noises 12 Animals and birds 14 Miscellaneous housing defects 27 Miscellaneous 30 (c) Summary of visits and inspections; General Sanitation; Moveable dwellings 117 Swimming pools 1 Drainage 802 Ponds, ditches etc. 18 Public conveniences 29 Stables 15 Piggeries 4 Refuse 102 Rodents 2,212 Pests 224 Verminous premises 21 Infectious diseases 117 Atmospheric pollution 162 Smell complaints 48 Water supply 49 Noise complaints 40 Schools 13 Accumulation of refuse 4 Miscellaneous 452 4,430 /housing: 21 Brought forward Housing Food Control Factories and Shopg Acts Other Acts and duties Total visits and inspections 4,430 1,704 1,140 1,128 267 8,669 (d) Summary of notices served and complied with: Served Complied Public Health Acts; Statutory Notices 2 1 Informal ,, 72 86 Housing Acts: Statutory ,, 2 - Food & Drugs Act: Informal ,, 30 43 Other Acts: ,, ,, 2 1 8. INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND FOOD POISONING. 117 enquiries and revisits were made during the year regarding notifications of the following infectious diseases Poliomyelitis 1 Scarlet Fever 48 Food Poisoning 11 Sonne Dysentery 5 Where necessary, specimens were taken and submitted for examination to St. Margaret's Hospital Pathological Department, or the County Laboratory. 9. RODENT CONTROL. Throughout the year a total of 399 inspections of private and business properties were carried out and of these 344 were found to be infested and treated by the Local Authority. In addition, all the farms in the District were visited in the early part of the year to ascertain the degree of rodent infestation, if any, and the methods of control. Infestations were found to be small and control satisfactory. Baits were also laid in 222 sewer manholes with 10 takes resulting. 22 /10. 10. WASP AND OTHER INSECT NUISANCES. 106 complaints regarding nuisance from wasps' nests were received and dealt with. Where these nests are accessible they are rendered inert and removed, in other cases treatment is carried out by the use of gammexane dust. Many requests for advice are received concerning infestation from ants, woodworm, carpet beetles, larder beetles, cockroaches and silver fish. In such cases a visit is made and the complainant advised on the method of treatment. 11. CARAVANS. Inspections of the licensed caravan sites have been carried out and improvements in the amenities provided have been made in compliance with the licence conditions. There are 17 licensed sites in the District. 12. CLEAN AIR ACT. 1956 - AIR POLLUTION, A survey of industrial furnaces has been carried out and occupiers of these plants have been advised of the requirements of the Clean Air Act. No serious contraventions of the Act have been reported during the year, but in some instances, plant operators have been advised on methods to reduce smoke emission. The District continues to be free from any serious pollution, but the development now taking place and the installation of new plants calls for a watchful eye to be maintained to ensure that this continues,, The apparatus for the volumetric estimation of air pollution continues in operation and daily estimates are made in the Department of any pollution recorded. 15. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT. 1959. The Riding Establishments in the area have been inspected by Mr. H.E.
