Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, This Report is presented in the traditional fashion although the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea has, at the time of writing, ceased to exist following on the re-organisation of London Local Government. The Council of the London Borough of Wandsworth, as the new Authority which has inherited the residual liabilities of the old Authorities under Article 15 of the London Authorities Properties, etc., Order, will be responsible for meeting the cost of printing this Report. By Article 8 of the London Authorities (Health and Welfare Services) Order, 1964, the London Borough of Wandsworth must send copies of this Report to the Minister of Health and to the Greater London Council and, no doubt, the London Borough of Wandsworth will desire that this be done. There was a further slight decline in the population in 1964, the Registrar General's mid-year estimate being 102,820, some 120 less than the previous year. The total number of births was smaller in 1964 and the live birth rate correspondingly lower, being 19.98 as compared with 20.87 in 1963. The rates for London, and England and Wales were 17.2 and 18.4 respectively. The death rate dropped from 12.76 to 11.43, this figure being slightly below that of 11.9 in 1962. The total number of deaths attributed to Battersea was less than the previous year, namely, 1,152 as against 1,288. The corresponding rates for London, and England and Wales as a whole, were 11.7 and 11.3 respectively. There were 51 deaths of children under the age of one year as against 47 in 1963, giving an infant mortality rate of 22.59 as against 19.91 in 1963. There was, as in 1963, one death from puerperal causes, giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.44 per thousand live and still births. The number of cases of infectious disease notified in 1964 was 744 as against 937 in 1963, the reduction of 193 being due in the main to the reduced number of measles cases reported, namely, 552 as against 703 in 1963. For the third year in succession, no cases of poliomyelitis occurred Borough. The number of cases of whooping cough which, in the previous year, was comparatively high, was reduced in 1964 to 35 cases. As deaths from whooping cough or measles were reported. As regards dvsenterv, there were 41 cases reported as against 30 in 1963 and 94 in 1962. Last year, I reported a reduction in the number of notifications of tuberulosis. During 1964, however, there was in increase, a total of 67 cases of tuberculosis, all forms, being notified, as compared with 46 in 1963 and 75 in 1962. In addition, 41 cases were reported or otherwise came to our knowledge, making a total of 108 cases coming to our notice within the year. At the end of the year there were 798 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis on the Register as against 841 at the end of 1963. There were 6 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis in 1964 as against 7 in 1963 and 12 in 1962. 6 In my Report for 1963, I referred to the effect of the severe winter on deaths from respiratory diseases, particularly pneumonia and bronchitisand to the possibility of the severe weather having caused an increased number of deaths, I pointed out that although the figures were too small for statistical analysis, the cold weather might, in fact, have been a factor. In the current year, there was quite a marked reduction in deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis compared with the previous year. For instance, there were 53 deaths from pneumonia in 1964 compared with 95 in 1963 and 78 from bronchitis as compared with 99 in 1963. Moreover, in 1963 there were 8 deaths from influenza but in 1964 no deaths were recorded from this disease. This is a welcome reduction of deaths from respiratory illnesses. The routine work of the Department continued throughout the year and details will be found in the body of the Report. I do not think that any mention need be made of any special activities except to say that the work in connection with houses in multiple occupations continued, and that further progress was made in work under the Clean Air Act. 1956. For the greater part of the year, but particularly in the latter halfmuch time and attention was necessarily given to problems raised by the re-organisation of London Local Government. Senior staff of the Department in particular were involved and it was necessary to review the work of the Department, to collate information and statistics and to exchange information with the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth and generally to do everything to ensure that the change-over of responsibility would be as smooth as possible. I should like to thank my senior colleagues for their help in these tasks. This brings me to the end of my Report for 1964, and the last Health Report to the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea. Over the years, the Health Committee through its Health Department has served the people of Battersea well and it is confidently hoped and expected that this service will continue with no less enthusiasm in the future than in the past. It has been a great privilege and a very happy experience to have been Medical Officer of Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea. I would like to take this final opportunity of saying how much I have valued the guidance, support and courtesy of the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee, and also the other Committees with which I was concerned, over the period of more than 13 years that I was Medical Officer of Health of Battersea. I also thank my colleagues and the staff of the Public Health Department for their unstinted application over the years to their work and duties. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health. 7 Principal Figures for 1964. Area of Borough, excluding tidal water (acres) 2,164 Home population (1961 census) 105,870 Home population (Registrar-General's Mid-Year Estimate) 102,820 Structurally separate occupied dwellings 28,124 Births (live 2,258, still 40) 2,298 Live Birth rate 19.98 Deaths—1,152. Death rate 11.43 Maternal Deaths—1. Maternal death rate 0.44 Infant Deaths—51. Infant mortality rate 22.59 8 Vital Statistics. For the purpose of standardisation, the Registrar-General's area comparability factors, which make allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, have been applied to the rates for births and deaths. The factor for births is 0.91, and for deaths 1.02. POPULATION. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 102,820, which shows a decrease of 120 on the previous year's estimated figure of 102,940. This estimate has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. The population of the Borough at the Census taken in 1961 was 105,870 (50,620 males and 55,250 females, a proportion of 100 males to 109 females). The present estimated population of 102,820 shows a decrease of 3,050 (or 2.9 per cent.). Just over a hundred years ago the population of Battersea was estimated at 15,970, and appears to have reached its maximum density in 1910 when it was reported to be 188,222. Since then there has been a steady and gradual decline to its present estimated figure of 102,820. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1964 was 437 (216 males, 221 females). Of this number 9 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough and 1,830 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 2,258 births (1,149 males, 1,109 females) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 19.98 per 1,000 population. All the Battersea births (428 live and 5 still) which occurred within the Borough were " domiciliary births." Illegitimate live births numbered 325 or 14.4 per cent, of the live births. The live birth rate for England and Wales was 18.4. Still-Births. The registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1953. During 1964 there were 5 still-births registered in Battersea, relating to Battersea parents. Thirty-five still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 40 in all represening a still-birth rate of 17.46 per thousand births (live and still) registered. Of the 40 still-births 7 (17.5 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered and the still-births rate from 1955 to 1964 were as under:— No. Rate No. Rate 1955 32 18.1 1960 35 17.78 1956 48 26.42 1961 37 19.93 1957 51 27.01 1962 44 19.73 1958 39 20.34 1963 38 15.84 1959 36 17.42 1964 40 17.5 The still-birth rate in 1964 for England and Wales was 16.3. 9 MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1964 numbered 866. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 16.9. Year Marriages Marriage Rate 1959 876 16.2 1960 961 17.9 1961 935 17.8 1962 949 18.1 1963 949 18.4 Mean 1959/63 934 17.7 1964 866 16.9 The marriage rate for England and Wales was 15.1. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1964 was 2,160. Of these 1,354 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the person ordinarily resided. There were on the other hand, 346 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,152 (553 males and 599 females). This gives a recorded death rate of 11.43. The rate for England and Wales was 11.3. Of the 1,152 Battersea deaths 767 (or 66.6 per cent.) occurred in hospitals, etc. The average age at death is shown in the following table:Average Age at Death. 1945 62.4 1955 67.7 1946 61.4 1956 66.9 1947 62.6 1957 67.2 1948 63.3 1958 68.3 1949 65.3 1959 67.7 Mean, 1945/1949 63.0 Mean, 1955/59 67.6 1950 65.5 1960 66.9 1951 66.7 1961 67.4 1952 67.7 1962 68.5 1953 68.9 1963 68.2 1954 67.2 1964 66.7 Mean, 1950/1954 67.4 Males 63.1 Females 70.0 10 The deaths of 767 residents of Battersea aged 65 years and upwards were registered during 1964. These 767 deaths constituted 66.6 per cent, of the total deaths at all ages. The natural increase of population (that is, excess of births over deaths) was 1,106 in 1964 as compared with 1,073 in 1963. The causes of the 1,152 deaths in 1964, classified in age groups, are shown in the following table, compiled from figures supplied by the Registrar-General:— Causes of Death in Age Groups during 1964.

The death rate from the disease per 1,000 of the population was 2.36. The deaths from cancer constitute 21.1 per cent, of the total Battersea deaths during the year. The following gives the comparative average death rates from cancer in Battersea for quinquennial periods since 1901. 1901-1905 0.88 1931-1935 1.75 1906-1910 0.95 1936-1940 1.99 1911-1915 1.11 1941-1945 2.44 1916-1920 1.28 1946-1950 2.11 1921-1925 1.33 1951-1955 2.07 1926-1930 1.51 1956-1960 2.29 1960 2.45 1961 2.36 1962 2.38 1963 2.27 1964 2.36 Details in age groups and the location of this disease will be found on page 10. Infant Mortality. During 1964 the deaths of 51 infants under 1 year of age were registered as belonging to Battersea. The total number of live births registered during the year was 2,258, giving an infant mortality rate of 22.59 per 1,000 live births as compared with 19.91 in 1963 and 20.59 in 1962. The infant mortality rate in England and Wales during 1964 was 20.0. The following table sets out the causes of death in detail. 13 Infant Mortality Rate, 1964.

The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1964 was 21.21, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 145 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1963 was 113 to 100. Maternal Mortality. There was one death from "diseases or accidents of child-birth" during 1964, which is equivalent to a fatality rate of 0.44 per 1,000 births (live and still). This was due to septic abortion. The rate for England and Wales in 1964 was 0.25. Comparative Statistics of Births, Mortality, etc. (Compiled from Registrar-General's Returns.)

During the year 744 notifications of infectious disease were received which when compared with 937 in 1963 shows a decrease of 193. This decrease was, in the main, due to the number of measles cases reported, 552 as compared with 703 in 1963. For the third year in succession no cases of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough. There were no cases of smallpox during the year, but 30 indirect contacts arrived from endemic areas. As they were not in possession of valid international certificates of vaccination against smallpox they were all kept under surveillance for 17 days.

During the year 1964 there were 67 cases of tuberculosis (all forms) notified in Battersea as compared with 46 in 1963, 75 in 1962, 63 in 1961, 79 in 1960 and 75 in 1959. 16 In addition 41 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 108 cases for the year. The case rate per 1,000 population (excluding inward transfers) was 0.65 or 65 per 100,000. At the end of the year there were 798 pulmonary cases and 50 non-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis on the Register. This is equal to a morbidity rate per 1,000 population of 7.8 in the case of pulmonary, and 0.5 in the case of non-pulmonary tuberculosis or 8.3 both types. The tables on page 17 give details of additions and deletions of cases on the Register during the year. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1964 deaths from tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 6. All were due to pulmonary tuberculosis. The death rates per 100,000 of the population during the 60 years ended 1960 in quinquennial averages, and for the years 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1964 are given in the following table : — Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 1946-1950 53.1 6.1 59.2 1951-1955 22.1 2.8 24.9 1956-1960 9.7 1.1 10.8 Average (60 years) 86.9 20.2 107.1 1961 11.4 1.0 12.4 1962 11.5 — 11.5 1963 6.8 1.0 7.8 1964 5.8 — 5.8 17 Tuberculosis, 1964.

At the request of the Ministry of Health arrangements are made for the authentication, by the Medical Officer of Health, of certificates of vaccination and inoculation issued by medical practitioners in the Borough in respect of persons going abroad. During 1964, 810 certificates were authenticated. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, Section 26. This section is concerned with the prevention of the spread of notifiable infectious diseases, and the diseases to which section 23 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, applies. It authorises a Metropolitan Borough Council, if they think fit, to compensate a person who is required by the Medical Officer of Health to cease his or her employment to prevent the spread of the disease. The Health Committee decided that compensation to be paid should be based on the merits of each case reported. No cases were dealt with during the year. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The bacteriological examination of clinical material (with the exception of sputum which is dealt with at the Chest Clinic) was carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service, County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.I. No charge is made to the Council for these examinations. During the year 750 examinations were made as fllows : — Description Disease Number of Specimens Positive Results Faeces Dysentery and Food Poisoning 681 95 Faeces Typhoid and Paratyphoid 16 Urine Typhoid and Paratyphoid 16 — Throat Swabs Diphtheria 37 20 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the work of the Department in relation to sanitation:— Inspections— Personal Cleansing Treatments— Complaints 2,361 To adults 99 Rent Act 48 To children 260 Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 105 Defects Remedied— Drains— Repaired 65 Urinals and Conveniences 319 Reconstructed 34 Caravans 152 Sealed off 151 Water certificates 11 Ventilated 71 Infectious disease cases— Cleared 132 Notifiable 154 Frontages laid 44 Non-notifiable 22 Roofs repaired 380 Drainage 2,634 Rainwater pipes and gutters renewed / repaired 154 Pet shops 32 Hairdressers 134 Rodent control 3,977 Dampness remedied 570 Other visits 4,072 Waste pipes renewed/ repaired 48 Re-inspections 5,757 Notices served— Water closets repaired or cleansed 123 Public Health (London) Act. 1936— Water closets installed 126 Fifth Schedule (Intimation) 733 Water cisterns cleansed or repaired 18 Fifth Schedule (Statutory) 320 Water supplies reinstated 98 Water fittings renewed or repaired 88 Section 197, etc. (Infectious Disease) 10 Additional water supply to tenement houses 1 L.C.C.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 67 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, By-laws, Regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below:— Cases Public Health (London) Act, 1936 65 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 2 67 Fines totalling £60 10s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these Proceedings, and £34 17s.0d. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to ford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling-houses could be secured. During the year, 733 Intimation Notices (relating to 575 premises) and 320 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices (relating to 307 Premises) were served. It was found necessary to refer 90 cases to the Council's Solicitor with instructions to take steps, by legal proceedings if necessary, to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices. In 25 of these cases a warning letter from the Solicitor had the desired effect in the remaining 65 cases, however, summonses had to be issued. As a result. Nuisance Orders were made by the Court in 21 instances Of the remaining summonses 36 were ultimately withdrawn, the Notices having been complied with subsequent to the issue of the summonses, and 8 were dismissed. Defective conditions in 719 houses were remedied—364 by owners following the service of Intimation Notices; 358 by owners following the service of Statutory Notices and in 7 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken, and the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. Section 25 of the above Act relative to choked drains was used on 44 occasions. This Section enables a notice to be served upon an owner or occupier to clear a stopped-up drain, water-closet or soil pipe, within forty-eight hours. If the notice is not complied with the Council may carry out the work and recover the cost. It was necessary for the council to do the work on 19 occasions. Section 26 enables the Council to re-instate a water supply to a dwelling after the supply has been withdrawn by the Metropolitan water Board following a defect in the supply pipe or fittings. Notices were served on twelve occasions and in five cases the Council did the work in default. 22 Authority has been given by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and the Chief Public Health Inspector to serve Section 27 notices on behalf of the Council to remedy nuisances within a specific time where unreasonable delay would be occasioned by following the normal procedure. It was necessary to serve 11 such notices during the year, and the Council carried out the work in default of the owner on five occasions. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1925, Section 33. Because of recurring nuisances arising from the deposition of insanitary refuse, and the improper use of open sites, action was taken under the provisions of the above Section. Two Notices were served, and in one instance the Council carried out the clearance and the enclosure of the site in default of the owner, the cost being chargeable to the owner. Dustbins. During the year, one notice was served under Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, concerning the provision of a dustbin. A total of 45 dustbins were provided by the owners following the service of intimation notices. Drainage Work. Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing premises, and drainage in connection with conversion schemes, are carried out under the supervision of officers of the Department. Drains were constructed to 171 new dwellings, and 193 plans of proposed work were deposited in connection with drainage generally. During the year, 46 drains were tested with smoke—30 of these were found to be defective. The water test was applied on 1,150 occasions. to drains in the course of construction. 44 frontage drains (the length of drain between the house property to its connection with the sewer) were constructed or reconstructed. This work is carried out by the Council's workmen under the supervision of the Inspectors. Drainage and Watercloset By-laws made by the London County Council are enforced by the Council. In 8 instances it was necessary to request the Council's Solicitor to take legal action for non-compliance with the By-laws in connection with the failure by persons concerned to notify the Council of the work to be carried out, or work carried out which did not comply with the requirements of the By-laws. In each instance the By-laws were complied with before summonses were heard. Sewerage and Sewers. The sewerage system, in common with other London Boroughs. discharges into the main London County Council's sewers, and disposal is carried out by the County Council. The Borough Council's brick and pipe sewers are regularly cleansed, and are adequate for their purpose. Back-flooding that did occur in the lower part of the Borough during heavy summer storms has become progressively infrequent since the reconstruction and enlargement of the London County Council's sewers in the area, and the reconstruction of the pumping stations at Creek Street and Nine Elms. No complaints were received during the year. 23 Water Supply. The major part of the water supply in Battersea, in common with other Metropolitan Boroughs, is obtained from the mains of the MetroPolitan Water Board, who are responsible for its purity, and with whom close liaison is maintained. One part of the Borough, however, namely the Council's Latchmere Estate, is supplied from deep wells situated at the Latchmere Baths adjoining the Estate. Bacteriological examination of the well-water before chlorination, and prior to its supply to the Estate, is carried out at fortnightly intervals. Chemical analysis shows no significant change in the character of the water. In the event of a breakdown of the pumping apparatus serving the Latchmere Estate, or any other contingency, the system can be adjusted to receive water from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. All the premises in the Borough have a mains water supply. During the year 9 certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 171 new or re-erected dwellings. Thirty notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the MetroPolitan Water Board. Caravans. All caravan sites in the Borough are licensed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959. The conditions attaching to licences granted relate to the number of moveable dwellings which may be kept on any particular area of land; the amount of free space between the dwellings; the provision of a water supply, sanitary conveniences, adequate paving, dustbin accommodation, fire Protection arrangements and the prevention of nuisance from noise. The five sites in the Borough are regularly inspected, and during the year 152 inspections were made. Mobile Dwellings. In addition to the five permanent sites, during the year a licence was granted on the application of the London County Council for the siting of three "mobile" dwellings on the site of Nos. 14-16 Sleaford Street. The intention is to move these dwellings on to other sites when the site so used is required for permanent building. It is on this basis that the dwellings are erected—the drainage being of pitch fibre, which can readily moved from site to site, and in place of concrete over-site, Pre-cast paving slabs are used and jointed. At the end of the year, licences were in force in respect of 118 Mobile dwellings on 10 sites in the Borough. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestation of rats and mice and where possible to Prevent infestations occurring. These duties are carried out by the Senior Rodent Operative, assisted by two Rodent Operatives. 24 All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Public Health Inspectors. In the case of private dwellings the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Rodent Control Staff free of cost, and on request at business premises, where the cost is charged in full. The baiting of sewers under the control of the Council is undertaken three times during the year. Similar work is carried out by all London Boroughs, and has the result of reducing the rat population not completely, but to an irreducible minimum. The following table shows the number of premises inspected which were found to be infested with rats or mice:— Property Infested by Rats Mice Major Minor Major Minor Council's properties — 2 1 — Dwelling houses — 255 22 53 Business premises — 39 4 4 — 296 27 57 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 3,977. Verminous Premises. During the year 108 premises which were found to be infested with vermin were disinfested. The insecticide used contains Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T. and gives a prolonged residual effect. Dangerous Structures. During the course of inspection for any purpose carried out by the officers of the Department, should any dangerous structure or any dangerous condition appertaining to a building be noticed, the District Surveyor of the London County Council is informed for any action he may decide to take. There were 67 such cases notified during the year. Local Land Charges. Enquiries relating to Local Land Charges in connection with Notices served by the Department, information concerning the issue of Disrepair Certificates, and the way in which premises are drained, are regularly received. These enquiries require a careful search of records and drainage plans. During the year, 2,202 enquiries were dealt with. Common Lodging Houses. There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. 25 Rag Flock and Other Filing Materials Act, 1951. There are three registered premises in the Borough at which filling Material other than rag flock are used. Samples of the fillings used are submitted for analysis. There are no premises at present dealing with rag flock. Rag Dealers and Sorters. Premises occupied by rag sorters in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection, and no statutory action was necessary during the year. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat melting is carried on. The firms concerned have been established for many years, and the trades are conducted satisfactorily. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act is chiefly concerned with the distribution by sale or other-wise of poisonous substances. The list of poisons is contained in an order made under the Act. This Order is divided into Part I and part II. With the poisons contained in Part I, the Council are not concerned, since an "authorised seller" is a pharmacist registered with the Pharmaceutical Society, and enforcement is entrusted to Inspectors appointed by that Society. substances specified in Part II may be sold by "listed sellers", and these are persons who, on written application in a prescribed form, and on payment of stated fees, are recorded by the Council as "persons entitled to sell poisons in Part II of the Poisons List" at the premises recorded on the register. The Council are required to enforce the Act and orders so far as they relate to "listed sellers" and have appointed the Public Health Inspectors as Inspectors under the Act. At the end of the year and there were 82 persons registered under the Act. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The object of the Act is to regulate the sale of pet animals, with particular reference to their welfare whilst kept for sale in pet shops. A pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Licenses were issued in respect of 9 shops and 32 visits were made during the year. Animal Boarding Establishments Act, 1963. This Act provides that no person may keep a boarding establishment for animals (i.e. cats and dogs) in the Borough except under the authority of a licence granted by the Council. Considerations which the local authority must have in mind before granting a licence are laid down, and an applicant has the right of appeal to a Magistrates' Court. Contravention of the Act is punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding £25, or imprisonment for not exceeding three months, or both. 26 The Council charge a fee of ten shillings in respect of the grant of a licence, and have authorised the Health Committee to act on its behalf for the purposes of the Act. They have also authorised the Medical Officer of Health and the Public Health Inspectors to carry out inspections in this connection The operative date of the Act was 1st January, 1964, and two premises were registered during the year. Barbers and Hairdressers. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954—Section 18. The Council, under the provisions of the above-named Section, registers all barbers and hairdressers and their premises. At the end of the year there were 93 registered premises in the Borough, and 134 inspections were carried out. Consumer Protection Act, 1961. This Act repealed the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, and the Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960, but Regulations made under the former Act concerning fireguards on certain heating appliances offered for sale are still in force, and new Regulations have been made concerning oil burners, specifying standards of safety, and prohibiting the sale of oil heaters or component parts which do not comply with the Regulations. No contraventions of the Regulations were reported during the year. Licensing Act, 1961. Under Section 31 of the Licensing Act, 1961, it is provided that where a Club applies for a registration certificate for the sale of intoxicating liquor in respect of any premises, an Officer of the Local Authority, authorised in writing, may inspect the premises. The Public Health Inspectors have been so authorised. The inspection is primarily concerned to see that adequate sanitary facilities are available, but the Inspector is also required to report upon the suitability of the premises for the proposed use. Noise Abatement Act, 1960. Since the passing of this Act, the number of complaints concerning noise have grown considerably. Prior to the passing of the Act, the law governing noise nuisance in London was contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937, which provided that any "excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary noise which was injurious to health" could be dealt with summarily as a nuisance. The proof necessary to satisfy these requirements before Court procedure could be instituted was often difficult to obtain. The new Act substitutes for these words "noise which is a nuisance", and the procedure is thereby simplified. It is not necessary to prove injury to health, or that the noise was excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary. With regard to industrial noise, however, it is still a good defence to prove that the best practicable means have been used to prevent or counteract its effect. As well as the Council having authority to take action, any three persons who are aggrieved by a noise nuisance can take action by complaining to a Magistrate. 27 It has been the practice of the Health Department to take all the necessary action when complaints of noise have arisen in connection with a trade or business. Industrial noise clearly has a health angle, in that it is often continuous and of considerable intensity. The service of Notices has not been necessary, because a letter calling attention to the complaint has invariably had the desired results. Complaints, however, received from persons who complain that rowdy parties take place at certain times in adjoining premises, or that the person in the flat above causes undue noise, are not considered the type of complaint that should be dealt with by the Inspectors. There Would appear to be no specific hazard, but rather a personal problem arising from, in the majority of cases, behaviour difficulties between neighbours. This is the type of complaint that could well be dealt with by the persons aggrieved. Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963. Part of this Act came into operation in 1964 with regard to the registration of premises. As from the 1st May of this year anyone intending to employ people in office, shop or railway premises was required to send notification to the Authority responsible for enforcing the Act in those premises. Premises already in use had to be registered in this way between 1st May and the 31st July. As well as extensive provisions covering fire prevention and means of escape, requirements in connection with cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, lighting, sanitary conveniences, washing facilities, drinking water, accommodation for clothing, seating arrangements and eating facilities are also contained in the Act. A number of inspections were carried out, and employers advised in connection with the Act generally. 28 Housing. Provision of New Accommodation During the year 1964 construction of the following 171 new dwellings was completed:— By the Battersea Borough Council:— Dwellings Malins Court, Nightingale Lane 8 38/43 (consec.) Sudbrooke Road 6 14 By the London County Council:— — Antrim House, Stormont Road 10 103/125 (odd) Battersea Park Road 12 Savona House, Savona Estate 54 Shepton Court, Handley Street 42 Mobile dwellings:— Arden Street 9 Stainforth Road, Shillington Street, Este Road 29 156 By Private Owners:— — 120/146 Stewarts Road (Caretaker's flat) 1 — 1 171 Slum Clearance. During the year, two small areas in Chatham Road and St. James Grove were represented for slum clearance, and were declared as clearance areas by the Council. A total of 28 houses were inspected, and 12 were represented as unfit. In addition, the Doddington Road South Area, comprising 35 houses, which had been represented in 1962, was declared as a clearance area by the Council in 1964, and the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the Barmore Street Areas Nos. 1-6, which had been declared in 1963. Inspections made during 1964 totalled 283. Houses in Multiple Occupation. An area comprising approximately 130 houses is at present being inspected. Detailed inspections of 38 houses have been made, and 315 visits carried out. Providing undertakings are received from the owners of properties to carry out all the necessary work, including the provision of additional facilities and the means of escape in case of fire, formal notices are not served. In the event of work in connection with these undertakings not being carried out within a reasonable time, authority is obtained from the Housing Committee to serve formal notices. No displacement of persons from premises, because of the use of rooms in the premises to provide additional facilities for the families in occupation, has yet occurred. The standards required are based on 29 those suggested by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee and cover:— natural and artificial lighting; ventilation; water supply; personal washing facilities; drainage and sanitary conveniences; facilities for the storage and preparation and cooking of food, and the disposal of waste water; installations for space heating, or for the use of space heating appliances. Closing Orders. Under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957, three Closing Orders in respect of dwelling houses were made during the year; 6 underground rooms and 3 rooms in other parts of dwellings were closed under Section 18 of the Act. Overcrowding. Eleven cases of overcrowding creating offences against the provisions of Section 78 of the Housing Act, 1957, were investigated and appropriate action taken to secure the abatement of the overcrowding. Rent Act, 1957. The following table shows the work carried out during the year in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:— Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) received 22 Decisions to issue Certificates of Disrepair (Form J) 21 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) 11 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) accepted 10 Certificates of Disrepair (Form L) issued 11 Certificates of Disrepair refused Nil Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) received 12 Cancellations of Certificates of Disrepair issued 13 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from landlords 8 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from tenants Nil Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to landlords 7 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to tenants Nil Inspections carried out 48 Work under the Rent Act still continues, there being twenty-two applications for Certificates of Disrepair as compared with thirteen m the previous year. Not so many applications for cancellation were received, but applications from owners for Certificates re Undertakings increased. At the end of 1964 there were 148 Certificates of Disrepair still in force. 30 Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). During 1964 a total of 546 cases were dealt with on the grounds of ill-health or unsuitable accommodation. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 34 applications and 15 cases were referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration on these grounds. In 7 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis. In 23 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council notify cases in which the application to that Council alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. 31 Factories and Outworkers. Factories Act, 1961. Metropolitan Borough Councils are responsible for the enforcement the provisions of this Act in regard to:— (i) Sanitary conveniences—Section 7—In all factories. (ii) Cleanliness, Overcrowding, Temperature, Ventilation, and Drainage of Floors—Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6—In all factories where mechanical power is not used.

There were 11 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year. All of these are classed as factories, and 9 of them use mechanical power. Thirty-seven inspections were made. Two of the bakehouses were "basement bakehouses" within the meaning of Section 70 of the Factories Act, 1961. 32 Outworkers. During the year, in February and August, lists of outworkers were received from Battersea employers and from other authorities as required by the Factories Act, 1961. Some of these lists included outworkers not residing in Battersea, and these were forwarded to the appropriate authorities. The total number of registered outworkers' premises in the Borough at the end of the year was 78. The total number of inspections made was 135. The premises were found to be generally satisfactory, and it was not necessary to serve any notices or take any other action. The following table gives details of the outworkers' premises:— Trade Number on Register Premises Workrooms Persons employed Wearing Apparel 70 70 70 Household Linen 1 1 1 Boxes, etc. 4 4 4 Lamp Shades 3 3 3 78 78 78 A further table, giving prescribed particulars under Part VIII of the Act, will be found as part of the annexe to this Report. 33 Atmospheric Pollution. Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke Control Areas. By the end of 1964, 1,431 applications for approval of proposed works of adaptation or conversion of fireplaces, and payment of grant, in the No. 3 Smoke Control Area had been approved, and over £25,400 had been paid in grants by the Council in respect of these cases. The applications related to 2,168 fireplaces. No. 4 Area extends that part of the Borough covered by Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Smoke Control Orders to Lavender Hill and St. John's Hill on the north, to the railway lines to the west of the Borough boundary on the east. (See map on the next page). This Area covers 144 acres and contains 4,593 dwellings; it was declared on the 25th March, 1964, and was confirmed on the 16th September, 1964. The operative date of the Order will be the 1st July, 1965 By the end of 1964, 583 applications in connection with grants had been approved for the No. 4 Area, the grants amounting to over £11,300. work was completed in 97 cases, £1,512 being paid in grants. During the year 3,539 visits were made in connection with inspections and surveys. Smoke, etc., Nuisances and Observations. During the year, complaints were received alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises in various parts of the Borough. All these complaints received careful and sometimes prolonged investigation. In addition to dealing with specific complaints, observations are kept upon the chimneys of any industrial plant which merits observation, and the appropriate action taken. A total number of 185 observations was made. Smoke Measuring Station. The smoke measuring station installed in the Department in 1956 continues to give valuable information concerning smoke density and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The readings are taken by members of the staff of the Department, and the Department of scientific and Industrial Research receive the results and collate the information with other results obtained from Authorities all over the country. Notification of Installation of Furnaces. Notification is required under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, the installation of any furnace with a heating capacity of 55,000 B.T.U's or more per hour. The Section does not generally apply to furnaces designed solely or mainly for use for domestic purposes. The purpose of the Section is to see that any new furnaces installed shall be, so far as is practicable, capable of being operated without emitting smoke. Eleven such notifications were received during the year. CHELSEA. ° 35 Exemption of Premises engaged in Investigation and Research. Section 21 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, provides for firms engaged in research with regard to air pollution and the efficiency of furnaces generally to apply for exemption in the event of emission of smoke above the prescribed density. One application for exemption under this Section was received, and this was granted for one year. No untoward emissions were observed. 36 Protection of Food Supply. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is sold or stored is carried out. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and regulations made thereunder, is the principal Act under which action is taken. FOOD PREMISES. As at 31st December, 1964. Milk Distributors 114 Restaurants, Cafes 138 Canteens, Kitchens 67 Butchers 56 Ice Cream (Sale) 259 Ice Cream (Manufacture) 13 Fish Shops (Wet and Fried) 36 Food Factories 16 Bakehouses (Not underground) 9 Bakehouses (Underground) 2 Preserved Food 93 Bakers 41 Greengrocers 63 Confectioners 195 Grocers and Provisions 219 Miscellaneous (Chemists, Public Houses, Off-Licences) Stalls:— 181 Grocers 4 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 52 Fish and/or Poultry 6 There are 901 food premises in the Borough, together with 62 food stalls. Some of the premises shown above are listed under more than one trade category. Milk Distributors. At the end of the year there were 114 premises in the Borough whose occupiers were registered as milk distributors. All these premises were visited during the year, and a summons was issued against one occupier for failing to keep the walls, ceiling and floor of a food room in such a condition as to enable them to be properly cleansed in accordance with Regulation 23 (i) of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960. A fine of £10 was imposed, and £2 costs were awarded to the Council. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. The number of Dealers' (Pre-packed Milk) licences issued during 1964 was nine. Normally, licences granted since the Regulations were made in 1960 are valid until the 31st December 1965, but in September, 1963, the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963, were issued. These 37 Regulations re-enact with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The principal changes are that on and after the 1st October, 1964:— (a) "Untreated" replaced "Tuberculin Tested", as the special designation for raw milk. Current licences for Tuberculin Tested milk were not valid after that date, and new licences issued for Untreated milk will expire on 31st December, 1965. (b) The test for untreated milk is the half hour Methylene Blue Test. (c) From the 29th September, 1963, until the 31st December, 1964, a person holding the appropriate licence could use the words "Tuberculin Tested Milk (Pasteurised)" as an alternative to the words "Pasteurised Milk." (d) From the 1st October, 1964, until the 31st December, 1964, milk could be labelled as "Tuberculin Tested Milk" if the conditions applicable to the use of the special designation "Untreated" were otherwise satisfied. Ice Cream Premises. Section 16 (a) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the sale, or manufacture for the purpose sale, of ice cream, or the storage of ice cream intended for sale. The number of premises registered at the end of the year was 272. Prior to registration, the premises are inspected as to suitability before recommendation to the Health Committee. The majority of applications are for the sale of pre-packed ice cream from refrigerated containers. Particular attention is paid to the 13 premises where manufacture takes place, and samples of the product are taken for examination. (See page 43). Butchers' Shops. There are 56 butchers' shops in the Borough. All these shops are systematically inspected, 742 visits having been made during the year. It was not necessary to serve any notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Fish Shops. Shops in which fish, either cooked or uncooked, is sold, or where the curing or smoking of fish is carried on, are regularly inspected. There are 36 such shops in the Borough. 111 inspections were made, but no notices were served under the Food Hygiene Regulations. Preserved Food Premises. Section 16 (b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the Registration of premises used for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. A total of 93 premises (56 butchers' shops, 36 fish shops and 1 other premises) were registered at the end of the year. Inspections of all these premises were carried out and one notice under the Food Hygiene Regulations was served. 38 Catering Establishments. All restaurants, cafes, canteens and kitchens are regularly inspected throughout the year. There are 205 of these premises on the Register, and 743 inspections were made, 2 notices under the Food Hygiene Regulations being served. Food Stalls. All street stalls from which food for human consumption is sold are regularly inspected and, where the food sold is stored in the Borough, the storage places are also inspected. There are 62 food stalls in the Borough, the majority of them being in the two street markets in Battersea High Street and Northcote Road. FOOD PREMISES. Summary of Operations.

The analysis of samples of food and drugs purchased formally and informally under the Food and Drugs Act is carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough, D. G. Forbes, Esq., B.sc., F.R.I.C., at his premises, 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11. General bacteriological examination, and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream, is carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1964 was 50. In addition, 339 informal samples were procured. The following tables give details of the articles of food and drugs of which samples were obtained for the purpose of analysis.

Of the 50 formal samples taken for analysis none were reported as unsatisfactory. In the case of informal samples, 339 were taken of which 15 (4.4 per cent.) were found to be not up to standard or incorrectly labelled. Food The labelling of an informal sample of cheese spread was misleading in as much as the word "Flavoured" was smaller type than the rest of the title. The manufacturers were informed of this and no further action was considered necessary. Three informal samples of fish paste were deficient in fish content. As other samples taken were satisfactory no further action was taken. An informal sample of Cydrax contained an excess of saccharin while another informal sample of Fruit Juice Syrup had a misleading label. After contacting the manufacturers no further action was considered necessary. Four informal samples of meat paste were deficient in meat content. further samples were taken which proved satisfactory. An informal sample of condensed milk was deficient in fats, but formal samples taken proved to be satisfactory. Drugs An informal sample of Tincture of Iodine contained an excess of Potassium iodine. Further samples proved satisfactory. Three other samples of drugs were incorrectly labelled, and the Manufacturers were informed. The percentages of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory during the quinquennia 1921 1960 are given in the following table. The years 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1964 are shown separately. Year Formal samples (per cent.) Informal samples (per cent.)

Forty-three formal samples of milk were taken during the year. Of the 43 samples, 10 were designated as "Channel Islands" or "South Devon" milk, for which a higher minimum percentage (viz., 4 per cent.) of milk fat content is provided for under arrangements made between the producers and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. All of these samples were reported to be in conformity with this standard, their average composition being:— Milk fat 4.41 per cent. Non-fatty solids 8.92 ,, Total milk solids 13.33 „ The milk fat content of the 10 samples of "Channel Islands" or "South Devon" milk ranged as under:— between 4.5 and 4.6 per cent. 3 samples ,, 4.4 „ 4.5 ,, 4 ,, ,, 4.3 „ 4.4 ,, 1 sample ,, 4.2 „ 4.3 ,, 2 samples 10 All the 33 samples of ordinary milk were reported as genuine and the average composition was as follows:— Milk fat 3.67 per cent.

Samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Health Laboratory Service for the prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out:— Phosphatase Satisfactory Failed Methylene Satisfactory Blue Failed Pasteurised 4 — 4 — Turbidity Satisfactory Failed Sterilised ... ... ... 11 — 43 Ice-Cream. Thirty-four samples of ice-cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the methylene blue test. The samples were, as a result of the test, placed grades:— in the following Provisional Grade 1 19 „ „ 2 6 „ „ 3 4 „ „4 5 34 FOOD POISONING Three cases of food poisoning were notified during the year and a further seven cases were otherwise ascertained. In 9 cases the causative organism was found to be of the following types:— Salmonella brandenburg 7 Salmonella st. Paul 1 Salmonella typhi Murium 1 9 The causative organism of the remaining case was not identified. Foreign Matter in Food. There were four instances of foreign matter in food reported to the Health Committee during the year. In two cases the Committee instructed that no further action should be taken owing to lack of proof that the foreign matter was in the food at the time of sale. The case of a doughnut containing a large lump of black doughy material was dealt with by a cautionary letter to the firm concerned. On analysis, the foreign matter proved to consist of uncooked starch, mineral oil and grease, iron particles and atmospheric dirt, the dough having been in contact with a lubricated surface, of a machine used in the manufacturing process. In the fourth case, which proved to be mineral oil with particles of carbon in a bread roll, no observations were received from the firm concerned, and legal proceedings were taken. The firm pleaded SUI'ty> and a fine of £50 was imposed, and costs of £7 7s. Od. were awarded to the Council. Unsound Food The following table gives particulars of the unsound food which, under the provision of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrended to the Council. 44 Commodity Lbs.

Care of Old People. I have reported in previous years on the expansion of the services for the old people of the Borough, and this work continued during 1964. A total of 783 visits were made by the Old People's Visitor during the year, and once again I am pleased to report that it was not necessary to resort to the compulsory removal of any old person under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Home Bathing Service. The Home Bathing Service, which was started in 1962, has proved be an essential adjunct to the many other services provided for old people in the Borough. In addition to the actual bathing service, many visits are made to old people by the three Home Bathing Attendants, and these visits become a welcome and beneficial interlude in the lives of the elderly house-bound. The Attendants work in close co-operation with the Borough Council's Old People's Visitor, who is kept more readily acquainted with any change in an old person's circumstances or health. By the end of 1963 111 old people were on the register for this service. During the year, 1,756 baths were given, and 2,741 other visits were made by the Attendants, thus showing the necessity for such a provision. Laundry Service for Incontinent Persons. There is an increasing demand for the Department's Laundry Service for incontinent persons, and in 1964 9,270 articles were laundered by the Cleansing Station. This is a vital service in assisting an infirm old person to remain at home and in relieving some of the burden of relatives, who are often aged and infirm themselves. Home Safety Act, 1961: Accidents in the Home. The Home Safety Act, 1961, repealed and replaced Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957. The Act empowers the Council to promote safety in the home, by publishing or making other arrangements for giving information or advice relating to the Prevention of accidents in the home, and to contribute to non-profit making organisations concerned with the promotion of home safety.

Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying, or being found dead, in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 11 cases were dealt with. The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 11 cases was £106 3s. and of this amount £86 13s. 9d. was recovered. Public Swimming Baths. The Council maintain four public swimming pools—three at Latchmere Baths and one at Nine Elms Baths. 47 The source of water supply at the Latchmere Baths is from deep wells. In the event of breakdown or any temporary cessation of supply from the wells, the water is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. The Nine Elms Baths are supplied from the Board s mains. The Bath water is effectively chlorinated, and there is a turnover or change of water in the Baths approximately every 3½ hours. Samples of water from the swimming pools are taken at fortnightly intervals and submitted for bacteriological examination. The results have been satisfactory. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. All the lavatory accommodation at each of the conveniences is provided free, and, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities are also available. One public urinal is maintained, and in addition the urinals attached to six licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Methods of Disinfection: Following the notification of a case of infectious disease requiring disinfection, an inspection is made and the following methods used. The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Advice is also given to the occupier that a thorough "spring cleaning" of the room is a very effective "disinfection" process, and should be carried out in addition to the work of disinfection by the Council's staff. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam-treated at the Station, where the disinfection plant consists of two large steam disinfectors. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the adjoining laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected are also treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. . Disinfestation of Verminous Rooms : Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T., which gives a prolonged residual effect. In the case of a heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper penetration of the insecticide. Control of Insect Pests: The construction by the Council of large blocks of flats containing covered ducts taking hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has raised a problem of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult to deal with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator has been purchased by the Council, and this fitting, haying a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling out on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. 48 Personal Cleansing Station. There are facilities for treatment of scabies and verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, Sheepcote Lane. During this year 135 treatments were given to persons suffering from or contacts of scabies—72 to adults, 32 to school children, and 31 to children under school age. In addition to the above, 27 adults and 197 children found to be verminous were cleansed. Of the 197 children 173 attended from local schools by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Council for the use of the Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council, while the disinfestation of clothing and, if necessary, of the home is carried out by the Borough Council's staff. The following table shows the number of treatments at the Personal Cleansing Station since 1955:— Year Adults Children Verminous and Scabies Verminous and Scabies 1955 246 2,318 1956 262 1,517 1957 289 1,535 1958 288 1,756 1959 221 1,259 1960 142 640 1961 86 305 1962 188 301 1963 152 219 1964 99 260 The contract with the London County Council, referred to above, provides for the payment by them of 3 s. 6d. for each treatment given, whether for vermin or for scabies, with a minimum payment of £500 per annum. Arrangements have been made with the Wandsworth Borough Council, and the Lambeth Borough Council, for certain of the residents in those Boroughs, who require treatment or cleansing, to attend at the Battersea Personal Cleansing Station, the cost of this service being born by the respective Boroughs in which the patients are resident. During the year 49 treatments were given to Wandsworth residents and 6 treatments to Lambeth residents. 49 Coronet's Court and Mortuary.
