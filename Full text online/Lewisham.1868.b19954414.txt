Gentlemen, As enacted by the 43rd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1862, I have again the honour of laying before you an account of the estimated population, together with the tabulated records of births and deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1868. In table No. I. (see p. 13) I have given the enumerated population for 1851 and 1861. Tho estimated population as calculated logarithmally to the middle of 1868. The estimated population, at so many per house, taking the number per house in 1861, the last census. The number of inhabited houses, 1851 census. The number of inhabited houses, 1861 census. The number of inhabited houses, rated at £20 and under, at the middle of 1868. The number of inhabited houses, rated above £20, at the middle of 1868. The total number of inhabited houses at the middle of 1868. The average number of persons per house in 1851 (census). The average number of persons per house in 1861 (census). 6 The average mortality per 1000, assuming a population obtained from the number per house in 1861, and the number of inhabited houses in 1868. During tho year 1868 the mortality of the whole of London amounted to 74,908. Of these deaths, zymotic diseases were fatal in 14,142 cases. This result was less than that of the previous year. Diarrhoea was unusually fatal: 4060 deaths, and 320 from simple cholera were registered. The other fatal zymotic diseases were—fever, 2483 deaths; scarlatina, 2921; whooping cough, 2369; measles, 1989. The number of inhabited houses was about 400,778, each occupied by about eight people (7.8), nearly twice that of an average family. Table No. II. (see p. 14), compiled from the Registrar General's Summary of Weekly Returns for 1868, gives the population of London and thirteen other large towns, together with the rate of mortality. In table, No. 3, I give the population of Hampstead (a similar district to that of Lewisham), estimated logarithmally, with the number of deaths and the rate of mortality per 1000. TABLE III.

In table No. 4, I give you the returns of births and deaths in the different Registrar's sub-districts in Lewisham Parish and the Hamlet of Penge, comprising together " The Lewisham District," with the Mortality of the several Public Institutions. 7 TABLE IV.

From these tables it may be perceived that 205 persons died of zymotic diseases. 34 died of measles. 77 „ scarlet fever. 6 „ diptheria. 7 „ croup. 8 „ whooping cough. 5 „ typhus fever. 15 „ enteric fever 2 „ simple continued fever. 3 „ erysipelas. 4 „ puerperal fever. 1 „ dysentery. 29 „ diarrhoea. 1 „ remittent fever. 5 „ rheumatism. 1 „ pyœmia. 8 114 deaths took place from constitutional diseases, of which 69 died of consumption of the lungs. 15 „ other tubercular diseases. 305 deaths took place from local diseases affecting the brain, lungs, heart, intestines, &c., of which 96 died of diseases of the brain. 44 ,, diseases of the heart and circulation. 191 „ diseases of the lungs. 47 „ diseases of the digestive organs. 10 „ diseases of the urinary organs. 114 died of developmental diseases, 91 of which occurred chiefly amongst infants. 23 died of old age. 18 died from violent deaths, and 3 from causes not ascertained or not specified. 227 deaths took place under 1 year. 111 above 1 and under 5 years. 40 „ 5 „ 10 „ 43 „ 10 „ 20 „ 97 „ 20 „ 40 „ 96 „ 40 „ 60 „ 121 „ 60 „ 80 „ 26 „ 80 and upwards. 761 From the above abstract, we find that zymotic disease was unusually fatal in 1868. The principal mortality having occurred amongst children from scarlet fever and measles. No death occurred from small-pox throughout the year, a fact indicative of the useful results arising from the attention which has been paid to vaccination in the district. The deaths from zymotic disease were more than a fourth part of the total mortality. The mortality amongst young children is very much to be deplored. Out of a total of 761 deaths, 338 have occurred amongst children five years of age and under. 9 In connection with the prevalence of zymotic disease, in my last year's report I called your attention to the 23rd section of the Sanitary Act, which provides for the disinfection of woolen articles, clothing, &c., which may have been rendered liable to communicate disease. This disinfection of articles of wearing apparel, &c., which have been used by those suffering from contagious disease, would, in a most effectual manner, tend to check the spread of epidemic disease. Two disinfecting establishments have been erected in Liverpool, and have been in operation for some time ; and from the Report of Dr. French (the medical officer), the people are becoming more fully alive to the important benefit to be derived from their use, for in the year 1868 the number of articles disinfected amounted to 16,639. I may also remind the Board that they have not yet adopted the 35th clause of the Sanitary Act, which provides that the Secretary of State may, upon application of the local authority, empower them to make regulations for registering houses occupied by moro than one family, of which there are a great number in this district, and fixing the number of occupants; also for inspecting them, and affording them appliances and means of cleanliness, all of which may be enforced under penalties. North Surrey District School. The new infirmary at the North Surrey District School was opened for the reception of patients in November. The building contains eight wards for the reception and classification of sick children, besides two small wards for cases of serious illness which require more complete isolation. It has also two large airy day-rooms, for the use of convalescents, connected with the building by a covered way. Bath-rooms and latrines, with a well-ventilated passage between, are also connected with each of the larger wards. A washing establishment quite disconnected from the 10 building is used for washing the clothes of the sick children, and hot and cold water is supplied from the same building to each of the wards. The drainage of the baths and lavatories is severed from the main sewer by allowing the pipe to hang over a trapped drain outside, so that there can be no possibility for sewer gas to enter the building through these openings. Previous to the erection of the infirmary children were not admitted to the schools under the reputed age of four years, and sick children were not received from tho unions under any circumstances ; but, since the building has been opened for the reception of patients, children are admitted at the reputed age of two years, and sick children are received from the unions as well as healthy ones. Notwithstanding this, the mortality, which bears no comparison with that of children at their own homes, has not, for the last ten years, exceeded one-half per cent. per annum; and, during the year 1868 (notwithstanding several outbreaks of epidemic disease), no death has occurred amongst a population of over 900 children. Water Supply. The following quotations from the Report of the RegistrarGeneral on the Analysis of Water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Companies during the year 1868, has an important bearing upon the supply of this district. The past year (1868) was distinguished by very heavy floods in the Thames basin in the winter, followed by excessive droughts in the summer; it was, therefore, to be expected that the quality of the water would vary between limits equally wide. In January the Thames overflowed its banks above the point at which the metropolitan water supply was drawn, and, washing the surface of cultivated fields, mingling with stagnant ditches and ponds, and receiving the contents of the suddenly-flushed sewers of Oxford, Reading, Windsor, &c., became contaminated to an intolerable degree. 11 On the other hand, in the summer months, the water attained a greater degree of purity than ever before observed ; the excessive drought prevented much animal matter, both solid and liquid, from reaching the streams. The refuse was absorbed into the thirsty soil, whence it was afterwards partially dislodged by the heavy rains of October and December. It has been frequently asserted, but without proof, that the noxious organic matter of sewage, when discharged into a river of considerable magnitude, is entirely destroyed by oxidation after a flow of a few miles Tliis assertion is erroneous. In his evidence before the Rivers Pollution Commission, Sir Benjamin Brodie says,— I should say that it was simply impossible, that the oxidizing power acting upon sewage running in mixture with water over a distance of any length is sufficient to destroy its noxious quality. I believe that an infinitisimally small quantity of decaying matter is able to produce an injurious effect upon health. Dr. Frankland calls attention to the very inefficient filtration of a considerable proportion of the water supplied to the metropolis, and says that (amongst others) the water of the Lambeth Company was occasionally in such a muddy condition as to render it totally unfit for domestic use. This state of the water was observed after heavy rainfall in this district, and the Company were communicated with upon the subject. That this muddy state of the water was unnecessary, may be derived from the fact that the West Middlesex Company, which draws its supply from the Thames, did not fail upon any occasion to send out the water clear and transparent. During the year the Kent Company's water exhibited tor a time an exceptionably high state of contamination. In February it contained no less than 59.2 parts ot solid impurity in 100,000 parts. Of the above 59 2 parts 14.7 were common salt, the occurrence of which in such quantities it is difficult to account for, without assuming contamination from a tidal river. In March the condition of things was worse, for the solid impurity had increased to 70.2 parts an the common salt to 23.7 parts. 12 The attention of the Company's engineer was strongly drawn to this abnormal state of the water, and in the following month the excess of impurity disappeared. The Company's works are situated close to and on both sides of the River Ravensbourne, from which a considerable portion of the supply was formerly derived. The old reservoir and filter beds, occupying a large area of land sunk below the level of the Ravensbourne, are still retained; and one of these at least is used for the temporary storage of a portion of the water raised from the Company's wells. The position of the reservoirs must render it very difficult to exclude percolation from the foul river which runs within a few yards of them for a considerable distance. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. 13 Registrar's Sub-Districts. Enumerated Population, 1851.
