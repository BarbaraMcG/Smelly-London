PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, ELMFIELD HOUSE, HIGH STREET, TEDDINGTON. To His Worship the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Twickenham. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the work of the Health Department ; the statistical tables refer to the calendar year 1964. This is my last Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health. It would be out of place for me to comment on the present health services, or the changes which will come about through the formation of the new London boroughs and the break-up of the old areas. I am more than grateful for the very great kindness, understanding and comfort I received from our Chairman of the Health Committee, Alderman F. J. Edwards, and the members of the committee. Mr. H. J. Pugh our Chief Administrative Officer was on the staff when I came here in September, 1938; he has always been an unfailing source of information about the statutes, rules, regulations, and resolutions affecting our department; he has been constantly at my side with advice, encouragement, and often caution. My debt of gratitude to him for his unfailing loyalty can never be repaid. Another member of the staff who has been with me all this time is Miss Margaret Williams who has served faithfully and loyally. I have leaned heavily on the services of the medical, technical and administrative staff of both the Borough and the Area; I would especially like to mention Dr. Wilkinson, Dr. Wales, Dr. James, Mr. Easter, Mr. Durey, Mr. George and Mr. Mallaband. I would like also to commend my secretary, Miss Reeves for her faithfulness and patience in many trying and difficult situations. To all these I offer my sincere thanks, and wish them well in the new regime. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Yours sincerely, JOHN MADDISON, Medical Officer of Health. 2 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE Ex-Officio members : THE MAYOR, COUNCILLOR J. E.

Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, for the following report: "The source of water is the River Thames, which is stored in the Thames Valley reservoirs at Staines, Littleton, and Walton. After storage the water is filtered and chlorinated at the Board's works at Hampton, Ashford Common, Hanworth Road and Kempton Park. Samples of water are collected at all stages of the purification process at least five times a week and the summary of the analyses showing the quality of the treated waters are set out in Table 6. The supply is not plumbo-solvent and there have been no important extensions to trunk mains nor changes in the general scheme of supply to your area during 1964. New mains have been laid in Twickenham to the extent of 2,116 yards and all these new as well as repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being restored to supply and samples of water from them are tested to establish that its quality is up to that normally supplied". KEEPING THE BOROUGH CLEAN I am obliged to A. S. Knolles, Esq., B.Sc., M.Inst.C.E., M.I.Mun.E., Chartered C.E., the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for the following report of Drainage and Sewerage and Refuse Disposal. Drainage and Sewerage. Work is continuing on the construction of a new gravity sewer in the Hampton area to replace a number of old ejectors and to provide additional capacity. Its completion will also enable worn out air compressors to be disposed of at the Hampton Works and improvements to be effected to the pumping stations at Bell Hill and Hampton Wick. Refuse Disposal. The question of the bulking of the refuse continues to give concern and results in increased tipping of crude refuse and longer working hours at the plant. The compost plant is now operating satisfactorily, and the sales market is being investigated in conjunction with the Greater London Council, who assume responsibility for refuse disposal on the 1st April, 1965. FOOD Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 Table 17 gives details of the work carried out under these regulations. It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings in the following 9 cases. 1. Baker conditionally discharged with £10. 10s. costs for selling a loaf of bread with a splinter of wood in it. 2. Baker fined £2. with £5. 5s. Od. costs for selling a chocoloatccoated coconut slice containing a spent match. 3. Fishmonger fined £20. with £10. 10s. costs for selling a mouldy pork pie. 4. Baker fined £5. with £10. 10s. costs for selling apple and cream tarts with a mould growth on the apple. 5. Fishmonger fined £25. with £7. 7s. costs for selling unfit fish sticks, 4 6. Baker fined £10. with £5. 5s. costs, payable to the retailer, for selling to the retailer a mould affected apple turnover. 7. Dairy fined £20. with £7. 7s. costs for selling mouldy pancakes. 8. Baker fined £20. with £6. 6s. costs for selling a custard tart containing a fly. 9. Greengrocer fined £10. with £5. 5s. costs for smoking whilst handling food. Fifty-four complaints were received about unsound food purchased from retailers in the Borough. INDUSTRIAL HEALTH Factories. All factory premises are inspected periodically to ensure that suitable sanitary accommodation is provided. Factory premises where mechancial power is not used are inspected to see that they are kept clean, are not overcrowded, are sufficiently ventilated and that floors are adequately drained. Most of the 332 factories in the Borough are engaged in light industry. The number of persons employed ranges from just over 600 in the largest to one or two in the smallest. Outworkers. Under Section 110 of the Factories Act, 1937, the occupier of every factory has to submit to the local authority twice a year lists of outworkers directly employed by him in the business, outside the factory. The number of outworkers in the Borough in 1964 was 121. HOUSING Further progress was made during the year in dealing with unfit houses. Closing or Demolition Orders were made in respect of 6 unfit houses and an undertaking was accepted from the owner not to use 1 house for human habitation. One Closing Order was amended and one Closing Order determined following works which rendered one room in a basement and all rooms in another basement fit for human habitation. Section IV of the Housing Act, 1964, which deals with Houses in Multiple Occupation came into force on the 16th August, 1964. This section now re-instates the penalty clause for non-compliance of a notice served under Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961. Rent Act, 1957. During the year 4 applications were received for certificates of disrepair. Two certificates were issued and in 2 cases an undertaking was given by the landlord under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule. There were no applications for cancellation of certificates. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 In October, 1964, Smoke Control Order No. 4 was made by the Corporation. This order will come into force on 1st October, 1965, and covers an area of 875 acres in Hampton and Hampton Hill. It contains 399 Corporation houses, 2,659 Private houses and 147 Industrial and Commercial premises and it is estimated that the total cost of conversions will be £33,288. Smoke Control Area No. 3 came into force on 1st October, 1964, and this brings the total acreage in the Borough covered by Smoke Control Orders to 1,260, 5 Smoke from Furnaces. Section 3 of the Act deals with the installation of new furnaces and the requirement that new furnaces shall be so far as possible smokeless. During the year 1964 no applications were received to instal furnaces. PEST DESTRUCTION Rats and Mice. The service provided by the department is free in respect of residential premises but work carried out at business premises is paid for by the firm concerned and is not a charge on the rates. Insect Pests. Residents of the Borough are able to have insect pests identified and advice is given as to the best methods for their eradication. Unusual specimens are sent to the British Museum (Natural History section) for identification and I am most grateful to them for their willing and valuable assistance. Control of Birds. The Local Authority are given power under Section 74 of the Public Health Act, 1961, to take steps to abate nuisances caused by the congregation in built up areas of doves, pigeons, starlings or sparrows. No complaints were received during the year 1964. HEALTH EDUCATION During the year I gave a number of talks on health topics to various associations in the Borough. Many more were given by the Chief Public Health Inspector and his staff, and by the doctors, health visitors and nurses in all parts of the area. Where appropriate, films and filmstrips are used; propaganda by posters and leaflets has been continued. GENERAL MATTERS Shops Act. 1950. Section 38 of this Act deals with provisions for the health and comfort of staff employed in shops. Shop premises are required to be properly ventilated, adequately warmed, sufficiently lighted and to have toilet and washing facilities; if the staff take meals on the premises there must be suitable arrangements made for them. Occasionally it happens, as in the case of a small lock-up shop, that it is impossible for the occupier to provide a separate toilet on the premises. Provided that alternative arrangements are made to use a nearby toilet, a certificate of exemption can be granted from the requirements of the Act. There are 22 exemption certificates in force. Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963. The majority of this Act came into force on 1st August, 1964, but a general administrative provision dealing with applications for registration, applications for fire certificates and for exemptions came into force on 1st May, 1964. The administration of the Act has proceeded smoothly and the technical assistant employed specifically for this work has quickly settled down and carried out his work in a very satisfactory manner. He has at all times the assistance of the district public health inspectors concerned. It is probable that about 20% OSR (1) (Registration Forms) have yet to be returned and it is hoped eventually to take the necessary steps to obtain the return of these forms. 6 Employers generally have co-operated very well and many contraventions have already been remedied after service of informal notices. Set out in Table 20 is a copy of the report for the 6 months ended 31st December, 1964. Schools. Inspections of the sanitary arrangements and canteens at schools within the jurisdiction of the Divisional Executive were carried out by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. The general standard of the canteens is good. It was not necessary to close any schools on account of infectious disease amongst the children. Complaints. There were 985 complaints on general matters of health received during 1964. Pet Animals Act, 1951. No person is allowed to keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of this Act. There are 9 licences in force in the Borough and 43 visits were made for the purpose of securing compliance with the licensing conditions. Animal Boarding Establishments Act, 1963. This Act came into force on the 1st January, 1964 and provides for a system of licensing and inspection by the Local Authority of any establishment at which a business of providing accommodation for cats and dogs is carried on. During the year 3 establishments were licensed by this Authority. Petroleum Installations. Regular inspections are made of all premises where petroleum or petroleum mixtures are stored and in the year 429 visits were made to the 97 premises licensed. Registration of Hawkers of Food and Their Premises. A strict watch is kept on all street traders selling food. Both the person and the storage premises have to be registered, and if conditions are unsatisfactory registration can be refused. During 1964, 2 persons were registered and 49 visits were made by Inspectors. Establishments for Massage, Chiropody, Electrical and Special Treatment. 7 licences in respect of establishments were issued during the year 1964. Hairdressing Establishments. The Corporation have made Byelaws under the Middlesex County Council Act for "the purpose of securing the cleanliness of any premises used for the purpose of carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber and of the instruments, towels, equipment and materials, used in such premises." During the year 27 inspections were made of these premises. It was not found necessary to take any action for contraventions. Common Lodging Houses. There are no common lodging houses in the Borough. 7 Swimming Baths. Excellent facilities are provided for swimming at the Corporation's three open air baths. Twickenham Bath is the largest with a capacity of 280,000 gallons; Hampton Bath has a capacity of 206,000 gallons, and Teddington Bath 180,000 gallons. Water for all three baths is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board's Main and is purified by continuous sand filters with marginal chlorination. The Teddington and Hampton Baths have venturi-induced aeration and the Twickenham Bath has cascade aeration. The whole of the bath water is completely changed at both Twickenham and Teddington every 6½ hours and that at Hampton every 4 hours. During the 1964 season 30 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and all the samples proved satisfactory. Laboratory Work. The usual arrangements continued during the year and worked satisfactorily. Type of Sample or Specimen. No. Taken. Result.

Mortuary. The number of bodies admitted to the Mortuary during the year was 419. Chronically Sick Aged Persons. In accordance with the Authority of the Corporation the provision of a laundry service for incontinent patients has been continued. This service, in conjunction with the issue by the Area Health Office of incontin' ence pads has gradually been extended and greatly assists in the maintenance of patients at home who would otherwise be in Hospital. The incontinence pads, which are placed in disposable bags, are, thanks to the co-operation of the Borough Surveyor, accepted for direct disposal at Charlton Refuse Works. 8 STATISTICAL TABLES for the year 1964 Table 1 Summary Area in acres 7,078 Population (census 1961) 100,971 Civilian population—estimated to mid-year (as supplied by the RegistrarGeneral) 101,970 Number of inhabited houses 31,786 Rateable value £5,166,465 Sum represented by a penny rate £21,315 Total M.
