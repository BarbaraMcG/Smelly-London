KEN95 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1868 - MARCH, 1869) 33 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Vestry Hall, Kensington, Sanitary Department, June, 1869. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you a short account of the mortality which has occurred in your Parish during the year 1868, with an account of the Sanitary work carried out. It is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of your population, as houses are being erected with so much rapidity, the estimated number being 100,000. The last year comprises 53 weeks, from the week ending January 4th, 1868, to week ending January 2nd, 1869. During this period 3522 births took place, viz.: 2907 in the Town "Ward, and 615 in the Brompton. The total mortality was 2232, which allows a gain to your Parish of 1290; the deaths being'1691 in Kensington, and 541 in Brompton. Pauperism has been excessive, on account of the great depression in trade, and the high price of provisions. The number of deaths exceeds that of 1867, by 974; and of births, by 364. The extra mortality has principally occurred with the poor. In your Workhouse, 165 deaths were registered; and in the Hospital for Consumption, 138. 34 The diseases of a zymotic character have been principally— scarlatina, 170; measles, 84; fever, 52; and diarrhoea, 113. Whooping cough killed 34 children; from small pox only four deaths are returned: this must be considered very satisfactory as compared with the returns of the last few years, during the previous year 29 having died of that complaint. The Parishioners must be glad to know that an officer has been appointed to ascertain that Vaccination is properly carried out. The disease has been almost entirely exterminated from many States on the Continent, and to a great extent from Ireland; there is therefore no reason why it should not be expelled from our own country, if efficient Vaccination were carried out. A new Act of Parliament connected with Sanitary matters has come into operation during the past year, "The Workshop Regulation Act," to limit the hours of labour to young persons and children. The principal trade in your Parish carried on under this Act, is that of Milliners; and according to your instructions, printed notices have been served by your Inspectors, upon all the Owners of these Establishments, who were known to come within the meaning of the Act. I have appended as usual a list of the complaints, visits made in consequence, and amount of work done during the past year, in a tabular form. We have fortunately not been obliged to resort to legal proceedings in many cases, as landlords of houses have, as a rule, carried out works required of them to my satisfaction, without the necessity of legal interference. I still notice that about 1.75 per cent. of the total number of deaths are returned as uncertified by a Medical practitioner. Sufficient attention has not hitherto been given to this subject, and it shews, that not only is it not necessary to register the birth of a child, but that the Registrar can give an Order for Burial on his own responsibility. • The following return shows the amount of work performed by your two Sanitary Inspectors, from March 25th, 1868, to the same date in 1869. This represents the number of complaints attended to, and of Notices, &c. served; but, as in very many cases nuisances are removed, without official notices being served, they are of course not recorded in this report. I regret that the system of a constant water supply has not yet been afforded to the poorer localities of London. The water, improved as it is, by obtaining it from above tidal influence, is given with such scarcity in many cases, that cleanliness is with difficulty preserved. 35 I have reported to you so frequently upon trades' nuisances, that I do not think it necessary to enter much on this subject. I may remark that the Potteries are in a more cleanly and healthy condition, principally owing to the improved drainage afforded by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and that Jennings' Buildings is now comparatively clean. With regard to the Tallow Melting Establishment, known as Messrs. Tuckers', in the High Street, Kensington, constant supervision has been exercised over it. A Report has been handed to you by Professor Miller and myself, which shews that the offensive smells ought to be reduced to a minimum if the subordinates attended properly to the valves connected with the flues. The Proprietor has been put to very considerable expense in endeavouring to abate the nuisance and, I am certain, will do all in his power to mitigate the evil. I am, Gentlemen, Tour faithful Servant, F. GODRICH, Medical Officer of Health. 36 REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE NUISANCES REMOVAL ACT, From 25th March, 1868, to 25th March, 1869. DISTRICTS North.
