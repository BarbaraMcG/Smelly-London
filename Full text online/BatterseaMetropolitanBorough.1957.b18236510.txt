Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report for the year 1957 on the Health of the Borough of Battersea. In accordance with precedent, the report is mainly statistical, with comments as they appear to be necessary, and as in previous years, in this preface I refer to one or two matters of particular interest. I mentioned last year the slight decrease in the population of the Borough, which had been noticed over the previous two or three years. and in 1957 this decrease continued. The home population was 111,800 as compared with 112,900 in 1956. The live birth rate, which in 1956 was 15.6, was, in 1957, 16.42, showing a slight increase, while the death rate in 1957 was 10.89, compared with 10.83 the previous year. The infant mortality rate in 1957 was 22.33 compared with 23.74 in 1956. Forty-one deaths of infants under one year compared with 42 in the previous year were recorded. There were 3 deaths from causes associated with pregnancy and childbirth, the same as in the previous year, but as there was a slight increase in the number of births, the rate is slightly below that of 1956, at 1.59 per 1,000 births. I have on previous occasions discussed the importance of infant mortality, particularly the number of infant deaths in the first month of life, and more particularly in the first week of life. The causes of death in the first month, and more particularly in the first week, of life are very complicated. The causes of still-births, and the causes deaths of infants in the first week of life are closely related, and an extensive nation-wide investigation has just been started to throw light on this problem. We are co-operating in this investigation which, it is hoped, will provide data to enable measures to be taken to reduce the number of still-births and the number of deaths of infants in the first week of life. Infectious diseases showed an increase in the number of notifications received, as compared with the previous year, this being mainly due to the increased prevalence of measles; in 1957, 1,402 cases were notified compared with 274 in 1956. As against this, however, the number of cases of dysentery, to which I made reference last year dropped considerably, from 157 to 32, a decrease of 125, and there was also a reduction in the number of cases of whooping-cough. Many parts of the country, including parts of London, experienced a sharp increase in the number of cases of poliomyelitis in 1957. I am happy to say that Battersea remained comparatively free. Eleven cases of this disease were notified to this Department, but in two of these cases the diagnosis was not confirmed, so that we had only 9 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis, of which three had some residual paralysis. There was one death recorded due to this disease. In the previous year, there were 29 cases, with one death. In the late autumn, Battersea, like most parts of the country, was swept by "Asian" influenza. It was not possible to ascertain the exact number of cases which arose, because influenza as such is not a notifiable disease, but from information we received from schools and 5 other institutions, it was evident that the illness was very widespread. It did not, fortunately, take a very severe form, and most cases recovered fairly quickly. Towards the end of the year the number of cases tailed off, although there seemed to be a small secondary wave in the New Year. The number of cases of tuberculosis notified was 100, compared With 108 in the previous year. The number of cases, however, which came to the knowledge of the Health Department otherwise than by notification was 70, so that in all 170 cases came to our notice, cornpered with 165 in 1956. The table on Page 17 shows the way the death rate of this disease has dropped over the years. Work under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, which I mentioned In last year's report, continued in 1957, and considerable headway has been made. I am happy to say that we received considerable co-operation from tradespeople, and although it cannot yet be said that the Regulations are fully complied with in Battersea, the number of premises which are not complying must now be comparatively few. In 1957, two pieces of legislation fell to be administered, in part at least, by the Public Health Department. The Rent Act, 1957, came into operation and that part of the Act dealing with Disrepair Certificates, which formerly were dealt with under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, continued to be the responsibility of the Health Department. The new Act, as far as we were concerned, was more complicated to administer, but in spite of the large number of applications under this Act, the work was handled expeditiously, and although a number of Problems arose, mainly of a legal nature, we were able to deal with them in conjunction with the legal department. The second measure which came into force in 1957 was the Clean Air Act, 1956, particularly those sections relating to Smoke Control Areas. This has meant a good deal of extra work for the Department, and I am happy to say that quite good progress has been made. At the time of writing, application has been made by the Council to the Minister in connection with the making of a Smoke Control Order, and, in the It is time, a detailed survey of the area in question is proceeding. It is hoped, also, to hold a Clean Air Exhibition, in connection particularly with the first Smoke Control Area, and no doubt I shall be able to report on this next year. Although it will be some considerable time before the whole of Battersea will be free from smoke, at least a start has been made, and it is to be hoped that it will not be too long before the whole Borough will be a Smoke Control Area. I feel that I should make some reference to a matter which is causing grave concern to everyone associated with public health, namely, the shortage of Public Health Inspectors. As I pointed out last year, Public health is constantly changing, and as some problems are at least partially solved, others arise. The two examples cited earlier in this preface, namely, the new legislation on clean food and clean air, demonstrate the added emphasis which is being placed on clean food and pure air, although the necessity for these had always been evident. The important point is, that in spite of progress from both the social and health aspects (the two of course are very closely connected) there will always be problems to be tackled in public health, and there will always be a demand for qualified and experienced workers in the field 6 of public health. It is therefore a matter for concern that very few health departments are able to recruit their full establishment of Public Health Inspectors, and in Battersea our establishment of qualified Inspectors is now half of what it should be, with little immediate prospect of our recruiting new Inspectors up to our normal complement. Towards meeting this problem, the Council has approved a scheme for training Public Health Inspectors, and we have one student Inspector now working in the Department, but this is a long term policy, and will not yield quick results. In the meantime, in spite of our depleted stall the work of the Public Health Department must continue, and every effort is being made to ensure that standards do not fall. It would. however, not be realistic to ignore the fact that standards may not always be as high as we would wish, if present circumstances continue. although every effort will be made to maintain them. Meanwhile. a considerable burden falls on the existing inspectorial staff, and I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the way the extra responsibility is being met. In 1957, Dr. A. Garland, who had been Deputy Medical Officer of Health since 1952, left the Department to take up an appointment of a similar nature in Wandsworth. Fortunately, Dr. Garland has not completely severed his connection with the Battersea Health Department. because under the tripartite agreement, he is still available to act for me when necessary and has in fact done so already on one or two occasions during the year. I should like to thank Dr. Garland for his excelled work over the five years he was a member of the Battersea Health Department. He left with the good wishes of everyone, both members of the Council and officers. To take Dr. Garland's place, the Council appointed Dr. D. M. O. Lowry as Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Dr. Lowry took up his new duties in August, 1957, and very quickly proved to be a great help in the Department. I should like to thank him for the assistance he has given me during his first six months in office. It is again a pleasure to express my thanks for the help I have received from Councillor Miss E. A. Coles, J.P., Chairman of the Health Committee, and also the various Committees with which this Department is concerned, particularly the Health and Housing Committees. I should like also to thank the Chief Officers of the Council and their Departments who have again been most helpful and co-operative many matters. Finally, I should like to thank the members of the staff of the Health Department in all grades, and particularly the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. G. W. P. Weeks, for their continued and loyal support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of August, 1958. 7 Public Health in Retrospect 1857-1957. The following has been extracted from a report made by Dr. Connor, Medical Officer of Health for the Battersea Parish, in 1857. "Particular attention is called by Dr. Connor to the unsanitary Condition of the houses in Francis Street, in one of which seven cases of Scarlet Fever had occurred, and which he conceived had been greatly aggravated by the filthy state and defective drainage of this locality. In one of the returns, there is also mentioned an inspection of Ford's Buildings, which disclosed similar deficiencies as those found in Francis street, the keeping of pigs (77 in number, in the rear of the buildings), Contributing in no small degree to the unhealthiness of the neighbourhood. Other inspections are alluded to, and the houses said to be greatly deficient in drainage, dustbins, and traps to the gullies. The health of this sub-district is spoken of as having been tolerably good throughout the quarter, but that several of the diseases of the zymotic class had been prevalent." As a matter of interest, Francis Street was re-named in 1887, and is now known as Lithgow Street. Ford's Buildings were in York Road, and the site is now occupied by Durham Buildings, erected approximately 8 Principal Figures for 1957.

The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 111,800 as compared with 112,900 in 1956, a decrease of 1,100. The estimated population at the Census taken in April, 1951, was 117,140; the 1957 figure of 111,800, when compared with this, shows a decrease of 5,340 (or 4.6 per cent.). The estimated mid-year home population figure of 111,800 has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1957 was 536 (267 male, 269 female). Of this number 107 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being ouside the Borough, and1,407 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 1,836 births (931 male, 905 female, an excess of 26 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 16.42 per 1,000 population. This is an increase of 0.75 on that of 1956. Of the Battersea births (429 live and 8 still) which occurred within the Borough, 426 were "domiciliary births." Illegitimate live births numbered 151 or 8.2 per cent, of the live births. The live birth rate for England and Wales was 16.1. Still-Births. The Registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1957 there were 8 still-births registered in Battersea, all of which were of Battersea parents. Forty-three still-births occurring outtside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 51 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 27.01 per 1,000 births (live and still) registered. Of the 51 still-births 6 (11.8 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered and the still-birth rates from 1943 to 1957. were as under:— No. Rate No. Rate 1943 36 21.6 1952 42 23.2 1944 40 24.0 Mean 1943-52 47 22.9 1945 38 23.3 1946 59 22.7 1947 74 27.0 1953 38 20.9 1948 46 20.1 1954 50 28.0 1949 43 20.8 1955 32 18.1 1950 53 27.2 1956 48 26.42 1951 37 19.2 1957 51 27.01 The still-birth rate in 1957 for England and Wales was 22.5. 10 MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1957 numbered 966. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 17.3.

The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1957 was 2,060. Of these, 1,212 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. There were, on the other hand, 369 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,217 (641 males and 576 females). This gives 3 recorded death rate of 10.89 compared with 11.5 for England and Wales. The following table shows the age and sex distribution of the total deaths (corrected) in Battersea during 1957:— Under 1 year 1— 5— 15— 25— 45— 65— 75+ Total M. 26 1 1 3 34 188 183 205 641 F. 15 5 4 4 24 90 148 286 576 Totals 41 6 5 7 58 278 331 491 1,217 % of total 3.4 0.5 0.4 0.6 4.7 22.9 27.2 40.3 100.0 Of the 1,217 Battersea deaths 748 (or 61.5 per cent.) occurred in hospitals, etc. The average age at death is shown in the following table:— Average Age at Death. 1945 62.4 1950 65.5 1946 61.4 1951 66.7 1947 62.6 1952 67.7 1948 63.3 1953 68.9* 1949 65.3 1954 67.2 Mean, 1945/1949 63.0 Mean, 1950/1954 67.4 1955 67.7 1956 66.9 1957 67.2 * During 1953 all deaths, with the exception of those from tuberculosis, that occurred in St. John's Hospital, a hospital for the aged sick, were assignable to Battersea, irrespective of the home address of the patient prior to admission. 11 The deaths of 822 residents of Battersea aged 65 years and Upwards were registered during 1957. These 822 deaths constituted 67.5 per cent. of the total deaths at all ages. The natural increase of population (that is, excess of births over deaths) was 619 in 1957 as compared with 546 in 1956. The causes of the 1,217 deaths in 1957 classified in various age groups, are shown in the following table. Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life in Battersea during 1957.

The total number of live births registered during the year was 1,836 giving an infant mortality rate of 22.33 per 1,000 live births as compared with 23.74 in 1956 and 24.71 in 1955. The infant mortality rate in England and Wales during 1957 Was 23.1. The following table sets out the causes of death in detail. Infant Mortality, 1957.

The death rate amongst illegitimate children during 1957 was 46.36 per 1,000 illegitimate live births, as compared with 48.78 in 1956. The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1957 was 20.18, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 230 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1956 was 223 to 100. Maternal Mortality. During 1957 there were three deaths from "diseases or accidents of child-birth," which is equivalent to a fatality rate of 1.59 per 1,000 births (live and still). There were three such deaths during 1956. The rate for England and Wales in 1957 was 0.47. Comparative Statistics of Births, Mortality, etc. (Compiled from Registrar-General's Returns.)

There was a large increase in the number of notifications received dluring 1957, as compared with 1956. Notifications to the number of 1.831 were received, which, compared with 910 received during the Previous year, shows an increase of 921. This is accounted for mainly by a rise in the incidence of measles, 274 cases being notified in 1956 against 1,402 in 1957, an increase of 1,128. To offset this increase, dysentery notifications dropped from 157 in 1956, to 32 in 1957, being a decrease of 125. Also whooping cough notifications declined from 178 to 118. No major outbreaks of dysentery occurred during 1957. In the latter part of the year there was a slight outbreak in one of the Day Nurseries in the Borough, but this was quickly contained and of a short duration. One case of enteric (typhoid) fever was notified. A member of the crew of a ship that visited West African ports was taken ill on his arrival home and removed immediately to hospital, where he was diagnosed as suffering from this disease. There was again no case of diphtheria notified, the last case occurring in 1953. Eleven cases of poliomyelitis were notified during the year, but in 2 of these the diagnosis was not confirmed, leaving 9 confirmed cases (3 paralytic and 6 non-paralytic). The death of an adult male was recorded as due to this disease. There were 29 cases during the Previous year, 1956, with one of these cases proving fatal. Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation, Smallpox and Poliomyelitis Vaccination. . Diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation and vaccination against smallpox and poliomyelitis were carried out during the year under the control of the London County Council. 16 Analysis of Cases (after Correction of Diagnosis) of Infectious Disease Notified during the Year 1957.

In addition 70 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 170 cases for the year. The case rate per 100,000 population was 152.1. The tables on page 18 give details in age groups of the 170 cases- Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1957 deaths from tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 11, of which 10 were due to pulmonary tuberculosis, and 1 to another form of the disease. The death rate per 100,000 of the population during the 50 years ended 1950 in quinquennial averages and the years 1951, 1952, 1953. 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957 are given in the following table:— 17 Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 1946-1950 53.1 6.1 59.2 Average (50 years) 101.0 23.9 124.9 1951 39.3 3.4 42.7 1952 29.2 2.6 31.8 1953 12.2 4.4 16.6 1954 17.5 3.5 21.0 1955 12.3 — 12.3 Average (5 years 1951-55) 24.1 2.8 26.9 1956 12.4 0.9 13.3 1957 8.9 0.9 9.8 The death rate per 100,000 population was 10.6 for England and Wales.

S.E.I. No charge is made to the Council for these examinations, During the year 590 examinations were made as follows:— Description Faeces Faeces Throat Swabs Foodstuffs Disease Dysentery or Food Poisoning Typhoid or Paratyphoid Fever Diphtheria Food Poisoning Number of Specimens or Food Samples 539 21 22 8 Positive Results 136 Nil Nil 1 INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION and INOCULATION. At the request of the Ministry of Health arrangements are made for the authentication, by the Medical Officer of Health, of certificates of vaccination and inoculation issued by medical practitioners in the Borough in respect of persons going abroad. During 1957, 500 certificates were authenticated. CANCER. During 1957 the number of deaths of Battersea residents from cancer was 278 (157 males, 121 females) as compared with 231 in 1956, 247 in 1955, 214 in 1954 and 242 in 1953. The death rate from the disease per 1,000 of the population was 2.49. The deaths from cancer constitute 22.8 per cent, of the total Battersea deaths during the year. The following gives the comparative average death rates from cancer in Battersea for quinquennial periods since 1901. 1901-1905 0.88 1936-1940 1.99 1906-1910 0.95 1941-1945 2.44 1911-1915 1.11 1946-1950 2.11 1916-1920 1.28 1951-1955 2.07 1921-1925 1.33 1956 2.05 1926-1930 1.51 1957 2.49 1931-1935 1.75 Details in age groups and the localisation of this disease will be found on page 11. 20 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the main work of the Department in relation to sanitation:— Summary of Main Operations for the Year 1957. Sanitary Operations. Inspections— Work carried out—(contd.) 42 Complaints 2,998 Water closets installed Houses let in lodgings 18 Water cisterns cleansed or repaired 30 Certificates of Disrepair 337 Slum clearance 759 Water supplies reinstated 69 Urinals and conveniences 224 Caravans 139 Water fittings renewed or repaired 67 Water certificates 45 Infectious disease cases— Water certificates issued 18 Notifiable 310 Sinks, lavatory basins, baths renewed 44 Non-notifiable 138 Tuberculosis 40 Plaster renewed 570 Drainage inspections 2,573 Floors and stairs repaired 193 Other visits 1,626 Re-inspections 10,202 Doors and windows repaired 347 Notices served— Intimation 1,607 Fireplaces and flues repaired 135 Statutory (Infectious Disease) 77 Additional lighting, ventilation 3 rQ Statutory (Nuisance) 740 Summonses issued 65 Rooms cleansed 58 Magistrates' Orders obtained 17 Premises disinfested 121 Dustbins provided 105 Work carried out— Yard paving renewed or repaired 44 Drains— Smoke tests 128 Other defects remedied 181 Water tests 1,057 Dangerous structures referred to District Surveyor 203 Found defective 45 Repaired 61 Reconstructed 22 Water waste referred to M.W.B 55 Sealed off 11 Ventilated 45 Premises disinfected 662 Frontages laid 26 Articles disinfected 5,657 Roofs repaired 525 Personal Cleansing Rainwater pipes and gutters renewed/repaired 266 Treatments— To adults 289 To children 1,535 Dampness remedied 597 Rodent Control— Waste pipes renewed/ repaired Premises dealt with— 125 98 Rats Water closets repaired Mice 89 or cleansed 198 Inspections 2,889 21 Legal Proceedings. During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 66 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, by-laws, regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below, and further details will be found in the sections dealing with the respective matters at the pages stated. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Food and Drugs Act, 1955 By-laws as to Tents, Vans and Sheds, etc Cases 64 1 1 66 Page No, 21 35 Fines totalling £3 0s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these Proceedings, and £13 13s. 0d. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling houses could be secured. During the year, 1,607 Intimation Notices (relating to 1,290 Premises) and 698 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices (relating to 538 Premises) were served. It was found necessary to refer 97 cases to the council's Solicitor with instructions to take steps, by legal proceedings if necessary, to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices. In 33 of these cases a warning letter from the Solicitor had the desired effect. In the remaining 64 cases, however, summonses had to be issued. As a result, Nuisance Orders were made by the Court in 17 instances. The remaining 47 summonses were ultimately withdrawn, the Notices having been complied with subsequent to the issue of the summonses. In 15 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken, and the Council carried out the work in default of the Persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council ere entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. During the year defective conditions in 1,217 houses were emedied—631 by owners following the service of Intimation Notices; 571 by owners following the service of Statutory Notices, and the ouncil's workmen entered and did the work in default of the owners on 15 occasions. Dustbins. Procedure with regard to the service of notices requiring the Vision of dustbins has been simplified with the passing of the Lodon County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. The notice is served upon the owner, and he has a right of appeal to the Court, information as to these rights is always included when notice is served. During the year, 105 dustbins were provided, 24 of these being supplied by the Council in default of the owners, from whom the cost was afterwards recovered. 22 The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. Section 25 of the above Act relative to choked drains was used on 30 occasions. This Section enables a notice to be served upon an owner or occupier to clear a stopped-up drain, water closet or soil pipewithin forty-eight hours. If the notice is not complied with the Council may carry out the work and recover the cost. It was necessary for the Council to do the work on seven occasions. Section 26 enables the Council to re-instate a water supply to a dwelling after the supply has been withdrawn by the Metropolitan Water Board following a defect in the supply pipe or fittings. Notices were served on six occasions and in two cases the Council did the work in default. Authority was given by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and the Chief Public Health Inspector to serve Section 27 notices on behalf of the Council to remedy nuisances within a specific time where unreasonable delay would be occasioned by following the normal procedure. Six such notices were served, and the Council did the work in default in two cases. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. All the lavatory accommodation at each of the conveniences is provided free, and, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities are also available. Three public urinals are maintained, and in addition the urinals attached to ten licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public. Drainage Work. The by-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Acts with regard to drainage and also those under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, relating to water closets, etc., are enforced by the Council. During the year new drains were constructed to 291 new dwellings. and the drains of 22 old buildings were partially or entirely reconstructed under the supervision of the Officers of the Health Department. 133 plans of proposed drainage work were deposited in 1957, as compared with 118 in 1956. During the year drains were tested by smoke on 128 occasions and 45 were found defective. The water test was applied on 1,057 occasions, this being mainly to drains in course of construction. The frontage drains of 26 premises were constructed or reconstructed. Combined Drainage. No claims were made against the Council in connection with combined drainage. 23 Local Land Charges. Enquiries relating to Local Land Charges in connection with Notices served by the Department, information concerning the issue of disrepair Certificates, and the way in which premises are drained, are regularly received. These enquiries require a careful search of records and drainage plans. During the year, 1,244 enquiries were dealt with. Atmospheric Pollution. During the year, 16 complaints were made alleging nuisances from snioke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises in various parts of the Borough. All these complaints received careful and sometimes prolonged investigation. In addition to dealing with specific complaints, observations are kept upon the chimneys of any industrial plant which merits observation, and the appropriate action taken. A total number of 208 observations were made. No notices were served. Snioke Measuring Station. A smoke measuring station was installed in the Public Health department in the latter part of 1956, but insufficient readings were available at the end of that year to include any information of value. The station has been successfully run by the Inspectors of the Department throughout 1957, and the following graph indicates the variation of sulphur dioxide and smoke in the atmosphere noted throughout the year. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research receive the results and collate the information received from Authorities all over the country. 24 Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke Control Areas. The Clean Air Act, 1956 (Appointed Day) Order, came into operation on the 31st December of that year, and brought certain provisions of the Act into effect. Section 11, one of the effective Sections, gave the Council power to establish smoke control areas by means of Orders confirmed by the Minister. Following the coming into operation of a smoke control order, if on any day smoke is emitted from a chimney within the area, the occupier of the building would be guilty of an offence, the maximum penalty being £10 for each day the offence is committed. No offence, however, will be committed providing an authorised fuel has been used. The Act provides for payment of Exchequer and Council grants towards the cost of conversion or adaptation of any fireplace to burn smokeless fuel in a private dwelling. Following a detailed report, the Council decided that the area surrounding St. James' Hospital was a suitable area to declare as their first smoke control area, and a preliminary survey was made. The area is compact, and is bounded by Belle Vue Road, Wiseton Road, Nottingham Road, St. James' Drive, Upper Tooting ParkBoundaries Road, Heslop Road and Ravenslea Road. Approximately 570 private dwellings are involved. Following this survey, the matter was reported to the Council for further consideration, and work is now in hand on a detailed survey of the area. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat melting is carried on. The firms concerned have been established for many years, and the trades are conducted satisfactorily. Water Supply. During the year 18 certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 291 new or re-erected dwellings. Fifty-five notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc.. observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Underground Water Supplies. In 1947, my predecessor made a comprehensive report, following a survey of all the deep wells known to exist in the Borough. The Survey was made at the request of the Minister of Health, to ascertain whether pollution existed, following the bombing of London during the war. I thought it appropriate, after a period of ten years, to re-survey the wells in use in the Borough to bring the information up-to-date. There are now ten wells in use in the Borough, five having fallen into disuse and having been sealed off during the last ten years. Water from five of the wells in use is fit for drinking purposes. Reports on the sampling of water taken for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis show that the water at the time of sampling was of a high degree of purity, although in certain instances there was slight deterioration chemically. In one instance, because the Analyst's report showed the presence of a small amount of tidal water, the owner of the well immediately agreed to the installation of a 25 chlorination plant. The plant has now been fitted, and gives very satisfactory results. In another instance, because of a positive bacteriological result, and an adverse chemical report, the water, originally used for drinking Purposes, is now not used for that purpose. A second bacteriological examination proved negative. Water from wells used for drinking purposes has been proved satisfactory by chemical analyses and bacteriological examinations, the Position being safeguarded by regular sampling, and the submission of the results of analysis to the Public Health Department throughout the year. Rag and Bone Dealers. Premises occupied by rag and bone dealers in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 109 inspections were made. No offences by rag and bone dealers were reported. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestations of rats and mice and where possible to Prevent infestations occurring. These duties are carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by two Rodent Operatives. All infestations coming to light whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Public Health Inspectors, In the case of private dwellings the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Rodent Control Staff free of cost, and on request at business Premises, where the cost is charged in full. The sewers under the control of the Council are treated twice yearly, in accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Infestation Control Division). Their recommended meethod of treatment, namely, the laying of unpoisoned bait on the first and third days, followed on the fifth day by poisoned bait, is followed. The Ministry make a grant of 50 per cent. towards the cost of the service. The following table shows the prevalence of rats and mice in the borough for the year:— Property Infested by Rats Seriously infested by Mice Major Minor Council's properties - 2 - Jewelling houses - 61 43 business premises - 62 46 - 125 89 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 2,889. 26 Verminous Premises. During the year 121 premises which were found to be infested with vermin were disinfested. The insecticide used contains Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T. and gives a prolonged residual effect. Van Dwellings. The sites in the Borough on which van dwellings have regularly been placed for many years are generally well kept. The newer sites, however, need constant inspection to prevent overcrowding of the site, and to ensure that sufficient watercloset accommodation and water supply are available. Inspections were carried out on 139 occasions. Dangerous Structures. During the course of inspection for any purpose carried out by the officers of the Department, should any dangerous structure or any dangerous condition appertaining to a building be noticed, the District Surveyor of the London County Council is notified for any action he may decide to take. 203 of such cases were notified. Vacant Sites, Static Water Tanks, etc. Nuisances caused by the dumping of rubbish and the accumulation of rainwater in disused static water tanks, and the dumping of rubbish on cleared sites, is still proving a problem, but the number of complaints is gradually diminishing due to the sites being used for rebuilding and other purposes. Arrangements are in operation whereby the Council are empowered to clear static water tanks and to obtain refund of the cost from the London County Council. Shops Act, 1950. One exemption certificate was issued under Section 38 of this Act in respect of a shop where restricted space precluded the provision on the premises of a sanitary convenience. The application was granted on the grounds of access to suitable alternative accommodation being available. Public Swimming Baths. The Council maintain four public swimming pools—three at Latchmere Baths and one at Nine Elms Baths. Samples of the water from these pools are taken fortnightly for bacteriological examination. The results show that the water has consistently maintained a high degree of purity. 27 Protection of Food Supply. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is prepared, stored or sold has always been carried out as a routine. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1956, was a consolidation measure repealing the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, and consolidating it with the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, and certain other enactments amending and supplementing Part V of the Act in relation to slaughterhouses and knackers' yards. The Food Hygiene Regulations, made under the new Act, came into operation on the 1st January, 1956. They are in the main being implemented, and a complete register of all food premises in the Borough has been compiled. Two exemption certificates were granted in connection with the Regulations during the year. FOOD PREMISES. As at 31st December, 1957.

Any other type of container must be closed with a tightly fitting cover and suitably sealed and labelled. Pasteurised milk must be delivered in containers closed at the dairy where they were filled, with a cap or cover over-lapping the lip of the container and labelled " Pasteurised Milk." All persons who pasteurise or sterilise, or deal in special designation milk, are required to hold licences, which (except in the case of producers of raw milk) are issued by Food and Drugs Authorities. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951. requires that all milk sold by retail (other than in catering establishments as part of a meal or refreshment) in the areas specified must be sold under one or other of the special designations.

The analysis of samples of food and drugs purchased formally and informally under the Food and Drugs Act is carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough, J. E. Woodhead, Esq., B.SC., F.R.I.C., PH.C., at his laboratory at 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11. General bacteriological examination, and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream, is carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1957 was 274, of which 1, or 0.4 per cent., was certified to be adulterated. In addition, 285 informal samples were procured, of which 8, or 2.8 per cent., were certified to be adulterated. The percentages of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1955 are given in the following table. The years 1956 and 1957 are shown separately. Year Formal samples (per cent.) Informal samples (per cent.)

One hundred formal samples of milk were taken during the year. Of the 100 samples, 17 were designated as "Channel Islands" or "South Devon" milk, for which a higher minimum percentage (viz., 4 per cent.) of milk fat content is provided for under arrangements made between the producers and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. All of these samples were reported to be in conformity with this standard, their average composition being:— Milk fat 4.48 per cent. Non-fatty solids 9.12 „ Total milk solids 13.60 „ The milk fat content of the 17 samples of "Channel Islands" or " South Devon " milk ranged as under:— Over 5.0 per cent. 1 sample. between 4.8 and 4.9 „ Nil. 4.7 „ 4.8 „ 2 samples. 4.6 „ 4.7 „ 3 „ 4.5 „ 4.6 „ 2 „ 44 „ 4.5 „ 4 „ 4.3 „ 4.2 „ 4.4 „ 4.3 „ 4 „ 1 sample. 17 All the 83 samples of ordinary milk were reported as genuine lnd their average composition was as follows : — Milk fat 3.68 per cent.

Cream of tartar—20 parts per million excess of lead. Cautionary letters were sent to the manufacturers in appropriate cases. The deficiency of sulphur dioxide in the fruit preserving tablets was due to storage, and existing stocks were consequently withdrawn. Heat Treated Milk. Samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Health Laboratory Service for the prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out: Phosphatase Methylene Blue Satisfactory Failed Satisfactory Failed Pasteurised 37 – 37 – Turbidity Satisfactory Failed Sterilised 32 – Monthly returns of the samples taken, and of the results of the examinations, are sent to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and they are at once notified of any adverse report. Milk supplied in Schools and Hospitals. Samples of milk in course of delivery to Schools and Hospitals in the Borough are taken, both for chemical analysis and for submission to the prescribed tests for such milk. The samples are included in the general totals given on pages 31,32 and 34. The results of the analyses and tests are communicated to the London County Council or to the appropriate Hospital Management Committee. Ice-Cream. Forty-eight samples of ice-cream were taken during the year, each sample beine submitted to the methylene blue test. The samples were, as a result of the test, placed in the following grades:— Provisional Grade 1 29 „ 2 11 „ 3 6 .,4 2 48 35 Where samples of ice-cream made at premises in the Borough receive unsatisfactory reports, the premises, plant, and methods of operation are examined, and, where possible, improvements are suggested. Foreign Matter in Food. There were 14 instances of foreign matter in food dealt with during the year, and in 13 of them cautionary letters were sent to the Persons concerned. In one case a summons was issued and a fine of £3 obtained with £2 2s. Od. costs to the Council. This was in connection with a piece of cloth in a bun. Unsound Food. The following table gives particulars of the unsound foodstuffs which, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council.

Two outbreaks of food poisoning occurred during the year—one at a school, and the other originated at a cafe. The school outbreak affected 20 children; the causative agent, following laboratory investigation, proved to be Clostridium welchii. those affected made a complete recovery. The cafe outbreak affected 3 persons, and was caused by a Phylococci infection. This was isolated from the remains of the consumed. The staff of the cafe were all in a good state of health, and the kitch and premises were in a clean condition. The illness was of a short duration, recovery being complete in 24 hours. 36 Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. During the year 1957 construction of the following 291 new dwellings was completed:— By Battersea Borough Council:— 33, 35, 62, 64 Devereux Road 4 houses 21/70 Berry House 50 flats f 4 houses 60/78 (even), 68a, 78a Sarsfeld Road i 6 flats 1/70 Macdonald House ( 6 maisonettes 70 flats 60/90 (even) Boundaries Road ( 4 houses 6 flats (. 6 maisonettes 20/28 (even), 33/43 (odd) Fontarabia Road 11 houses 36/46 (even) Marmion Road 6 houses 1/19 Bishopstone House 19 flats 1/16 Farnhurst House 16 flats 1/77 Dresden House 77 flats 19/27 (odd) Nansen Road ... 5 houses 290 By Private Owners :— 79 Kyrle Road 1 house ^ Total Dwellings 291 Slum Qearance. Representations for slum clearance were made in respect of tel1 areas, 93 premises being represented out of 175 inspected. The tefl areas concerned are situated in the Battersea Park Road area and Winstanley Road area. Following a Public Inquiry concerning one area represented 111 1956, the Order was subsequently confirmed. The Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector is engaged with the initial inspections and the submission of detailed reports. Further inspections are made by the Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the selected premises are then represented. Determination as to unfitness for human habitation is governed by Section 4 of the Housing Act, 1957, in individual cases, and by this Section and Section 42, as respects an area to be represented. A considerable amount of specialised work devolves on the clerical side of the Department. Closing Orders. Thirty-four Closing Orders under Section 18 of the Housing 1957, were made during the year, in respect of basement rooms, and sixteen Closing Orders in respect of dwelling houses under Section of the Act. 37 Demolition Orders. Two Demolition Orders in respect of houses were made during the year. Both houses formed parts of clearance areas. Certificates of Disrepair. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. Rent Act, 1957. Work under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act continued until July, 1957, when the Rent Act, 1957, came into operation. The following tables give the relative figures:— January—July. (Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954). Applications for Certificates of Disrepair received 9 Certificates of Disrepair issued 9 Certificates of Disrepair refused — Application for revocation of Certificates received 7 Revocations of Certificates issued 8 Revocations of Certificates refused — August—December. (Rent Act, 1957). Applications for Certificates of Disrepair received 323 Decisions to issue Certificates of Disrepair (Form J) 257 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) 108 Certificates of Disrepair issued 72 Certificates of Disrepair refused 2 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates received 10 Cancellations of Certificates issued 7 It will be seen that the work increased considerably, following the operation of the new Act. One of the chief difficulties experienced by the Inspectors was the interpretation of the tenants' G. Forms, when the Majority of tenants had little knowledge of building terms, and, in consequence, were unable to describe the defective conditions to which hey wished to draw attention. The administrative work, in connection with the applications and advice required by many of the applicants, necessitated the full-time services of one of the office staff, and, at one Period, evening work was necessary. The work has been carried out in Elaboration with the Town Clerk's Department, to whom all legal Series were directed. Houses Let in Lodgings. Since the repeal of By-laws relating to houses let in lodgings such houses were dealt with by Sections 11 and 12 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, and these Sections have in turn been superseded by Section 36 of the Housing Act, 1957. Power is given to the local authority to restrict the number of persons occupying the house, and to require adequate facilities for those persons in occupation. It was not necessary to serve any notices in this connection during the year. 38 Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants and licensees of requisitioned premises. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). During 1957 a total of 317 cases were dealt with on the grounds of ill-health or unsuitable accommodation. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 6 applications and 4 cases were referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration on these grounds. In 5 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis, 4 of these being referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration as the accommodation was inadequate. In 11 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council notify cases in which the application to that Council alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. 39 Factories, Outworkers and Shops (other than food shops). Factories Act, 1937. Metropolitan Borough Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act in regard to:— (i) Sanitary conveniences—Section 7—In all factories. (ii) Cleanliness, Overcrowding, Temperature, Ventilation, and Drainage of Floors—Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6—In all factories where mechanical power is not used. (iii) Certificates of Suitability for Basement Bakehouses—Section 54—In all basement bakehouses. (iv) Water Supply (where derived from a source other than the public mains)—Section 53—In all factories. The following table gives the number of factories on the register at the end of the year, with the number of inspections, defects found; and action taken. 1.—INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health.

The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, Section 18, gave the Council authority as from the appointed day to Agister barbers or hairdressers and their premises, and no person should carry on such a business unless both he and the premises are registered. Model By-laws were adopted and the appointed day fixed as the 1st January, 1956. A register was compiled of all such establishments in the Borough, and inspections carried out. Any person registered under this Section must keep displayed in the premises in respect of which he is registered a copy of his certificate of registration and of any by-laws made by the Council. At the end of the year there were 78 registered premises in the Borough, and 101 inspections were carried out. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The object of the Act is to regulate the sale of pet animals, with particular reference to their welfare while kept for sale in pet shops. A pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Licences were issued in respect of 15 shops and 22 visits were made during the year. A request was received from the Secretary to the Royal Society the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with regard to the issue by owners of pet shops of leaflets concerning the care of animals sold to the general public, and suggesting that proprietors of pet shops should be Compelled by a suitable regulation endorsed on their licence to issue these leaflets in the case of each animal sold. The Council were advised that legally this condition could not be imposed, and the Health Comlimittee agreed that a letter should be enclosed with every licence ganted, calling attention to the desirability of the leaflets being supplied when pets were sold. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The principal provisions of the Act relate to registration of premises in which rag flock or other materials are used in upholstery, etc., and the licensing of premises used for the manufacture and storage of rag flock. An authorised officer of the Council has the right of entry, inspection and sampling of any filling materials. The madical Officer of Health and Public Health Inspectors are deemed to be authorised officers. Subsequent Regulations made by the Minister prescribed the standard of cleanliness for each kind of filling material, the methods of testing samples and the nature of the tests to be applied. are 6 premises in the Borough at which filling materials other than rag flock are used, and these are registered. There are no premises at present dealing with rag flock. b Seventeen visits were made to registered premises during the year, but no contravention of the Act was discovered. 42 Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. Regulations under the above Act prescribe that heating appliances suitable for use in a dwelling house or other residential premises shall be fitted with a robustly made guard securely attached to the appliance, and shall satisfy certain other tests set out in a Schedule to the Regulations. It has been found, since the passing of the Act, that almost without exception appliances on sale are sold to a British Standard specification, which gives the double assurance of their being subject to inspection at the place of manufacture. Occasional cases of second-hand appliances of an old type being offered for sale may occur, however, and a constant watch is kept for such appliances. One such case which occurred was dealt with by a cautionary letter, the vendor having pleaded ignorance and removed the article from sale. Bakehouses. There were 25 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year, three having been closed during the year, and one opened. All of these are classed as factories, and 22 of them use mechanical power. 109 inspections were made but it was not necessary to serve any notices. Four of the bakehouses were "basement bakehouses" within the meaning of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937. Outworkers. During the year lists of outworkers were received from Battersea employers and from other authorities as required by the Factories Act, 1937. Some of these lists included outworkers not residing in Battersea, and these were forwarded to the appropriate authorities. The total number of registered outworkers' premises in the Borough at the end of the year was 272 (including 5 contractors), 55 premises having been added, and 148 removed, during the year. The total number of inspections made was 470, most of them by the female Inspector. The premises were found to be generally satisfactory, and it was not necessary to serve any notices or take any other action. No cases of infectious diseases occurred at outworkers' premises.

The work and problems as outlined in previous Reports remain, and during the year there have been no outstanding developments. One of our Public Health Inspectors devotes a considerable part of her time to the care of old people, and at the end of the year had 227 old people on her Register whom she visited and kept in touch with. Close liaison is maintained with other organisations and agencies concerned with the care of old people, particularly the London County Council local Health Department, the Home Help Organisation and the Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or other suitable place of any person who is aged or infirm or suffering from some grave chronic disease, and is living under insanitary conditions. This power is exercisable on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health. Seven clear days' notice of the intention of making an application to the Court must be given to the person concerned, or to some person in charge of him. The Order remains operative for a period of three months, but the Court may, on application by the Council, extend it for such further periods, not exceeding three months each, as are considered necessary. The procedure under Section 47, as outlined above, was amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which came into operation on the 1st September, 1951, for the purpose of enabling very urgent cases to be dealt with more expeditiously. The new Act provides that the Court, or a single Justice of the Peace, may, on the certificates of the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practtioner, make an Order without formal notice of the application having been given to the person concerned or to the hospital authority, subject in the case of the latter, to evidence being produced of their willingness to admit the person. The length of time a person may be detained 45 Under such Order is limited to three weeks, instead of three months, and any application for an extension of this period must be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 47. An application Under the 1951 Act may be made by the Medical Officer of Health without special authority from the Health Committee in each individual case, provided a general authority to act is given. Such general authority has been given by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health and his Deputy. It was not necessary to take such action under either Act during the year. Use of Slipper Baths by Old Age Pensioners. The Council make available to old age pensioners free use of the dipper baths at their Baths Establishments (with use of a towel) on Production of their pension books. This facility has also been extended to blind nersons. During the year 1957 this arrangement was taken advantage of at the respective Bath Establishments as follows — Males Females     Latchmere 3,467 3,581 Nine Elms 1,170 497 Plough Road 564 759 Total 5,201 4,837 Burial of Deceased Persons. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying, or being found dead, in the Borough, and have power to recover form the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 3 cases were dealt with. The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is provided for follow. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. total cost incurred in dealing with the 3 cases was £50 approximately, and of this amount approximately £34 was recovered by the end of the year. 46 Personal Cleansing Station. There are facilities for treatment of scabies and verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, Sheepcote Lane. During the year 302 treatments were given to persons suffering from or contacts of scabies—159 to adults, 110 to school children, and 33 to children under school age. In addition to the above, 130 adults and 1,392 children found to be verminous were cleansed. Of the 1,392 children, 1,331 attended from local schools by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Council for the use of the Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council, while the disinfestation of clothing and, if necessary, of the homes is carried out by the Borough Council's staff. The following table shows the number of treatments at the Personal Cleansing Station and the expenditure incurred since 1950:- Year Adults Children *Expenditure * Amount Contributed     Verminous and Scabies Verminous and Scabies £ £ 1950 226 2,238 1,750 410 1951 200 1,858 1,992 406 1952 176 1,994 1,956 535 1953 144 1,943 1,932 508 1954 214 2,499 1,966 512 1955 246 2,318 2,371 526 1956 262 1,517 2,681 547 1957 289 1,535 3,202 553 * Financial year ending 31st March. Other columns, calendar year. The contract with the London County Council, referred to above, provides for the payment by them of 3s. 6d. for each treatment given, whether for vermin or for scabies, with a minimum payment of £500 per annum. Arrangements have been made with the Wandsworth Borough Council, and the Lambeth Borough Council, for certain of the residents in those Boroughs, who require treatment or cleansing, to attend at the Battersea Personal Cleansing Station, the cost of this service being borne by the respective Boroughs in which the patients are resident. During the year 104 treatments were given to Wandsworth resident and 67 treatments to Lambeth residents. 47 Methods of Treatment:— Scabies: Persons attending for treatment are given a hot bath for twenty to thirty minutes, thoroughly dried, and Benzyl Benzoate applied to the whole of the body. This is repeated on alternate days, there being three treatments in all. Verminous heads: The hair is treated with a preparation containing cotton-seed oil, tar oil, paraffin oil and oil of lemon grass, and then washed with a shampoo of soft soap and borax. It is then dried thoroughly, combed with a Sacker's comb to remove nits, washed, died and combed again. The operation takes approximately half an hour for each child, and a final check is made by the Sister in attendance. The Council have two flats attached to the Personal Cleansing nation for the temporary use in emergency of people or a family displaced, usually following fumigating procedure. The Council have agreed that these shelters may be used for Wandsworth residents at an annual fee of £25 for the right to use the shelters and a weekly charge of £1 10s. 0d. per shelter for every case sent there. Disinfection and Disinfestation. The disinfection plant at the Council's Disinfecting Station, Sheepcote Lane, comprises two large steam disinfectors, and disinfection is carried out at 12 lbs. pressure and a temperature of 239° F. An instrument charts the pressure and temperature during the process and these records are kept. Methods of Disinfection : Following the notification of a case of intectious disease requiring disinfection, an inspection is made and the following methods used. The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam treated at the Station. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the adjoining laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected are also treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. Disinfestation of Verminous Rooms: Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T., which gives a prolonged residual effect. In the case of a heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper penetration of the insecticide. Control of Insect Pests: The construction by the Council of large blocks of flats containing covered ducts taking hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has raised a problem of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult to deal with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator has been purchased by the Council, and this fitting, having a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling out on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. This fitting is in use and is proving very successful. 48 Coroner's Court and Mortuary.
