REPORT OF THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAH ENDING 25TH MARCH, 1 8 7 7. 4 PADDINGTON. The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone ; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board it returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (August excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow ; viz.:— WARD ONE. All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 WARD TWO. All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite the West end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a dircct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD THREE. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD FOUR. All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Boro' of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in tho Parish 14 Ecclesiastical Districts viz.:— St. James', St. Luke's, ” John's, ” Saviour's,” Mary's, ” Michael and All Angels, Holy Trinity, Christ Church, St. Paul's, St. Mary Magdalene, All Saints', Peter's, St. Matthew's, ” Stephen's. 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines; Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George, Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board meeting at the Vestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish ; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Vestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz. :— the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. The number of inhabited houses being 11,874.

TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall ; 30th June, 1877. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this, my Annual Report, on the chief Works executed, and in reference to various business transactions in this Department, during the year ended Lady-day, 1877. Highways. In Albion Mews North and Chester Mews, the old pebble and rag stones were taken away, broken up and used for repairing macadamized roads. New Granite Paving has been substituted, and the surface rendered more suitable and convenient for traffic. The carriage roads under the arch-ways of four Mews have been paved with wooden blocks, at the request of occupiers of adjoining premises, and at the cost of the Vestry. Four Cab Stands were paved with new Granite Cubes, and thereby rendered healthy for men and horses. 4 The macadamized roadway on Bishop's Road Bridge has been removed, and new Granite Cube Paving substituted. The accumulation of loose stones on the surface of the road and its frequently muddy condition is now obviated. The channel paving in various streets has been taken up, relaid and repaired with old stones, re-dre3sed for the purpose. Fifteen crossings at the intersections of streets were paved with Granite of the best description. The footway pavements in many parts of the Parish have been taken up and relaid where necessary, and new Yorkshire flags substituted for those worn and broken by the traffic. The paving of several new streets under the powers of the Metropolis Management Acts have been executed by the Vestry, at the cost of owners of houses and land, and the length thereof added to the previous extent of roads, make a total of 43 miles, 3 furlongs, and 65 yards, now under the control of the Vestry. The Carriageways have been successfully repaired, with the assistance of the Steam Road Roller, during the stoppage and diversion of the traffic, as approved by the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Gas and Water Companies and other parties have opened the streets in 2,171 places, for the purpose of laying and repairing Pipes, constructing and repairing Vaults and Ovens, and making alterations or additions to premises. The costs of re-instating the streets were paid to the Vestry. 5 Buildings, Sewers, and Drains. Orders of Vestry have been served upon 43 persons, who gave the required Notices in accordance with the 76th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, for the drainage of 129 new Buildings, namely— 2 Chapels, 2 School Buildings, 120 Houses, and 3 Stables; also blocks of Stabling in two private stable yards. Copies of such Orders, attached to the Notices, are filed at the Vestry Hall for future reference. Two miles, five furlongs, and one hundred and sixty-eight yards of Stoneware Drain Pipes have been laid down to the above-mentioned new premises, at an estimated cost to the owners of the property of £1,270. Ninety applications have been received from owners and occupiers of houses, for the re-construction and repair of Drains under the public roads and footways, and the Works were executed by the Vestry's Contractor, at the applicants' expense. In the undermentioned new streets, Brick Sewers of the capacity of 3' 9" by 2' 6", together with the requisite side entrances and air openings, have been constructed by private parties, viz.:— Thorngate Road. Rundell Road. Barnsdale Road, between Walterton and Fernhead Roads. Fernhead Road, between Barnsdale and Errington Roads. Princes Square, from No. 22 to Moscow Road. Warwick Road North. 6 A portion of the Brick Barrel Sewer in Maida Hill West, opposite the house No. 2, has been taken up, and 12" stoneware pipes laid in lieu thereof, at a lower level, to improve the drainage of the said premises, at the expense of the owner thereof. In consequence of complaints received from the Engineer of the Metropolitan Railway, respecting a leakage of sewage through a portion of the retaining wall on the South side of Queens Road Station, adjoining Poplar Place, the brick and pipe sewer abutting on the wall being defective, it was taken up, and 15" stoneware pipes laid in lieu thereof, at the expense of the Vestry. About sixty feet of pipe sewer in Porchester Square Mews being defective, new pipes were substituted, at the cost of the Vestry. Four hundred and sixty distinct Works, relative to the repair of sewers and gulleys, laying pipe drains and fixing traps, have been executed by the Vestry's Contractor, at a cost of £2,429 3s. Od. This sum includes £846 6s. Od. received from various persons for laying drain pipes under the public footways and roadways in connection with house drains, fixing traps in sewers at outlets of drains, and constructing gulleys in old and new streets. In addition to the above Works, ninety-eight examinations of house drains were made from sewers as to stoppages in them, and whether trapped at their outlets, at a cost to the applicants of £19 12s. Od. 7 One hundred and fifty-five subjects of complaints have been received, referring to stoppages in house and gulley drains and other matters, which received prompt attention. The drains were invariably relieved from stoppage, and left in working condition. To maintain the sewers in good sanitary condition, they have been flushed with water as often as considered necessary, and with beneficial results. The work of cleansing the sewers, gulley drains, and catch-pits, is still done by workmen in the employ of the Vestry. During the year 150 loads of heavy deposits which impeded the flow of the sewage matter have been raised to the surface of the roads and carted away. The deposits in catch-pits of the street gulleys have been removed, and 28,603 removals were effected, being at the rate of about 92 gulleys per day, thereby allowing the rain-fall to flow freely away to the sewers. The seven Public Urinals, with dribbling water apparatus attached thereto, were kept in a state of cleanliness and efficiency by a workman specially employed by the Vestry for that purpose. The following further improvements in the sewers and street gulleys have been carried out, namely —the construction of 15 side entrances and 3 air openings; also the construction and re-construction of 78 gulleys, and the repair of 52 others. 8 Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses. The following Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been carried out in accordance with the 87th Section of the Act of 1862 :— date of obder. locality. subsidiary names abolished. no. of houses re-numbered. 1876.

I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, GEORGE F. STEVENS, Surveyor. Paddington. THIRD ANNUAL REPORT of the INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC LIGHTING upon the subject of the AVERAGE METER SYSTEM. Public Lighting Department, Vestry Hall ; June 21 st, 1877. to the VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Third Annual Report relative to the working of this Department during the year ending Lady-day, 1877. It will be remembered that the Gas Company applied to the Referees to re-consider and amend the system of measurement for the supply of Gas to the Public Lamps in this Parish, and the result of such appeal, after they had collected much practical information, and tried many experiments, was the issuing of a modified notification on the llth August, 1876, by which they recommended all the Lamp Cocks, when fully open, to have a Gas-way of one twenty-fifth of a square inch, and that all Governors should be adjusted to come into action at a pressure of .2 of an inch of 4 water at the point of ignition, instead of .5 ; this provision they considered ought to be made to meet any contingency, should the pressure in the Mains at any time get below .6, (this being the minimum pressure the Company is bound to maintain by Act of Parliament,) there then being a possibility that the friction of the Meter might slightly influence its correct registration. The alteration, so far as the Governors are concerned, has been the means of producing a better light at 4.6 cubic feet per hour than when formerly burning 5 cubic feet per hour, therefore in working at a lower pressure directly under the Burner, the greater amount of illuminating power of the Gas is obtained. The annual testing of Meters, in situ, for friction and accuracy of registration, has been successful, but this work entails more labor and time than when the above-mentioned apparatus was taken to the Vestry Hall, and tested by the Gas-holder there. During the year the Gas Company have been served with 113 Notices for the rectification of stoppages and defective supplies in their service pipes, all of which they have cleared. 5 The following details will shew the Annual Expenditure and gain during the 12 months ending March 31st, 1877 : — Plant and Stock (additional)— £ s. d . £ s. d. d. £ s. d.

The total number of Public Lamps in lighting, including those on Urinals and in Kilburn Lane, being 1,747. The working of the Meters, &c., continues to give general satisfaction, and the Vestry may congratulate themselves upon now paying only for the actual quantity of Gas consumed. In testimony of the favor in which the Average Meter System is held as an equitable mode of purchasing Gas, it may be remarked that during the past year three large Metropolitan Parishes have followed the example of Paddington.

SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 18 7 6. BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. J. M.0RT0N, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. Paddinton SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1876. BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. J. MORTON, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. SECOND ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, During the 52 weeks in the year 1876, 2,905 births and 1,966 deaths were registered in Paddington. The difference between these figures, viz., 939, shews the natural increase of population. To arrive at an approximate estimate of the population of the parish, it is necessary to add the further number contributed by the immigration of persons from the country and from neighbouring parishes, Assuming the rate of increase to be the same as that shewn by the Census of 1871, the population in the middle of the year 1876 may be estimated at 107,323, giving 68,583 inhabitants to St. Mary's, and 38,740 to St. John's sub-district. Of the 2,905 births, 2,177 were registered in the subdistrict of St. Mary, and 728 in that of St. John. In both sub-districts the births were slightly fewer than in the preceding year; the number of male children being 1,495, and of female, 1,410. The proportion of the sexes was 100 males to 94 females, as compared with 100 males to 95 females throughout the Metropolis. In St. Mary's the proportion was 100 males to 94 females, and in St. John's 100 males to 96 females. 4 The births were most numerous in the first, and least so in the third, quarter of the year. The ratio of births to the entire population of the parish was 1 birth to 37 inhabitants—the birth-rate being 27 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate for London was 36.5. In St. Mary's District, the ratio of births to the population was 1 to 31.5 persons living—or 31.7 births per 1,000 inhabitants. In St. John's, the ratio of births to the population was 1 to 53, with a birth rate of 18.8 per 1,000. Some of the foregoing particulars are shewn in the subjoined Table;— Sub-Districts. Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. John's 38,740 728 1 to 53 18.8 St. Mary's 68,583 2,177 1 to 31.5 31.7 Paddington 107,323 2,905 1 to 37 27. The birth-rate for 1876 was below that of 1875, and of the ten previous years, 1866-75. An examination of Table I. will show that the number of births in St. John's has during the last three or four years been nearly stationary ; from which it may be inferred, that the condition of its inhabitants, as regards their ages and numbers, presents little variation. Of the 1,966 deaths, 220, or 11 per cent., occurred in the two hospitals in the parish, viz., 1 in the Lock, and 219 in St. Mary's Hospital; and of the remaining J. M.ORTON, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. 5 1,746 deaths 1,275 occurred in St. Mary's District, and 471 in St. John's. The deaths were most numerous in the first and least so in the fourth quarter of the year. It will be observed that, notwithstanding the increase of population, the deaths of parishioners (1,746) were fewer than in the year 1875, the death-rate being 16.3 per 1,000 persons living ; which contrasts favorably with the death-rate of 1875, and with that of any one of the ten preceding years, or the decennial average rate. In fact, with the exception of the year 1872, the mortality in the Metropolis, from all causes, was less in 1876 than during any one of the previous 20 years. This was attributed by some to certain meteorological conditions, to differences of temperature, of atmospheric pressure, and of rainfall during the summer months, and to the warm days and nights of the last quarter of the year. Some of the above particulars are shewn, as under:— Sub-Districts. Population. Deaths. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. John's 38,740 471 1 to 82 12.2 St. Mary's 68,683 1,275 1 to 54 18.6 Paddington 107,323 1,746 1 to 61 16.3 In 1876 the death-rate for London was 22.3 per 1,000. „ „ Edinburgh 20.5 ,, „ „ „ Dublin 25.8 „ „ 6 Not only is the death-rate of the parish six per thousand less than that of London generally, but it is lower than that of any one of the twenty largest English towns. It retains, moreover, its position, when compared with the death-rate of any one of the five groups of districts into which the metropolis is divided, or with that of its most favoured sub-district. Deaths registered in the London Districts. Annual rate of mortality per 1,000 :— 1875. 1876. West Districts 22.1 21.0 North „ 22.3 21.4 South ,, 24.0 22.1 East ,, 25.5 24.0 Central ,, 26.0 24.0 Paddington „ 17.6 16.3 In Paddington, the ratio of deaths to the population, including the two hospitals, was 1 death to 54 persons, equal to a death-rate of 18.3 per 1,000 persons living. There are some who would be disposed to regard 16 per thousand as the minimum death-rate of an English town. A cursory examination of Table III. should at once satisfy such persons that, were the laws of health properly observed, and clearly ascertained sanitary conditions honestly obeyed, a death-rate of 16 per thousand might be greatly reduced, probably to the extent of more than one-half. Such an examination will show that in our own parish, as in other parts of the country, many infants and children died J. M.ORTON, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. 7 from measles, scarlet-fever, whooping-cough, and other largely preventible diseases, which it cannot be said we have made any serious endeavour to prevent, so long as the compulsory registration of such diseases, and the compulsory isolation of them, are not enforced. Whilst it is true that at my suggestion the Sanitary Committee obtained the consent of the Vestry to provide hospital treatment, at the expense of the parish, for persons above the pauper-class who were suffering from small-pox or scarlet-fever, by sending the one to the Small-Pox Hospital at Highgate, and the other to the London Fever Hospital in the Liverpool Road; it is nevertheless certain that cases of scarlet-fever, and probably also of small-pox, occurred in the parish, of which the Sanitary Department received no information whatever, or was not apprized until after their recovery, or their names had appeared in the death-returns ; and that such cases, whilst under treatment and during their convalescence, were sources and centres of contagion to those around them. Such a state of matters, with the annual huge mortality consequent thereon, will continue until an educated people, conscious of its duties and jealous of its rights, demands from a tardy executive the intervention of the legislature to prevent it. The annexed Tables succinctly show the causes and the extent of the mortality in the parish during the past year, and at the same time afford, in relation to such matters, the opportunity of comparison with former years. 8 It will be seen that the deaths of infants under one year of age were absolutely the same (413) as in 1875; and, though fewer relatively to the increased population, were more relatively to the total number of deaths. The deaths of children under five years of age were 681, as compared with 712 in the previous year. The principal death-factors at these early ages were measles, scarlet-fever, whooping-cough, and diarrhoea. Of the 256 deaths from these four diseases, 200 occurred in St. Mary's and 56 in St. John's subdistrict. In the two sub-districts into which the parish is divided, the same difference is apparent as regards the distribution of these diseases, not to mention others, and as regards the mortality from each of them, as was pointed out in my first Report, and shows clearly both the want of accommodation, or of care to prevent their extension, and the want of means or of good nursing to arrest their development. In St. Mary's District the proportion of deaths at all ages from these diseases to the population was in every instance nearly double that which obtained in St. John's, and the percentage of deaths to the total number of deaths from all causes was also very much greater.

M.ORTON, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. 9 Percentage of deaths from the undermentioned diseases of the total deaths:— St. Mary's. St. John's. Measles 5.9 3.4 Scarlet Fever 2.2 1.5 Whooping Cough 3.5 3.2 Diarrhœa 4.1 3.8 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The number of deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases, which is the best indication of the healthiness of a community, notwithstanding the increase of the population, exceeded by three only the number of deaths from the same diseases in the year 1875. Nevertheless, these diseases furnished nearly one-sixth of the total deaths from all causes. As in the parish only two deaths occurred from small-pox in the course of the year under review, although the disease was extensively prevalent in other parts of the metropolis, and occasioned 735 deaths, I defer for the present adding anything to the observations which appeared in my letters to "The Times" of the 19th January and 5th April, 1877, upon this and the cognate subject of hospital accommodation at Highgate. To prevent the spread of the disease I urged the Inspectors to spare no effort to get every case which came to their knowledge removed to the hospitals with as little delay as possible. From this parish, 4 patients were sent to the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital at Highgate, and 21 to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 3 being conveyed to 10 Homerton, 8 to Stockwell, and 10 to Hampstead. Whilst few or none of the persons thus sent could be considered paupers, or regarded themselves as such, all belonged to the humbler ranks of the community. Scarlet-fever, which prevailed in an epidemic form in the previous year, claimed its tale of victims (35), and will continue to do so until the fitful ravages it annually makes are more generally known, and the fearful character of the disease more fully appreciated, even when it appears under the milder guise and the blander designation of "only scarlatina." Surely the time has arrived when medical men, without needlessly alarming the friends of their patients, can afford to call diseases by names "understanded by the people," and to tell them, in the interest of the community at large, that scarlatina is the latinized term for scarlet-fever, and that, in its mildest form, it is capable of producing in others the same disease of the most malignant character. Nearly one-third (91) of the total of these deaths (286) was due to measles, a disease which ordinarily terminates favorably, unless complicated during its progress or towards its decline, when the danger is greater, by the occurrence of bronchial or pulmonary inflammation, the consequence too frequently of exposure to cold. Of the 60 deaths from whooping-cough, 48 were those of children of parents, who it may be assumed from their occupation as stated in the death-returns J. MORTON, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. 11 were in the receipt of weekly wages. Comment is unnecessary. Some of the 14 deaths registered from typhoid-fever were certainly "imported" into the district, and of others it may be fairly questioned whether they were genuine cases of enteric or typhoid fever, whilst in a few instances the apparent cause was the escape of sewer air from defective soil pipes and untrapped drains. To summarise my remarks under this head, I do not hesitate to say, that if proper sanitary precautions had been adopted, of the 286 persons who succumbed to these diseases, very many would have escaped, and that suffering from one or other of these diseases, if their surroundings had been more favorable, irrespective altogether of medical treatment, many of these little ones, for such they were, "had not died." VACCINATION. Table VII., furnished by the Vaccination Officer of the Parish, Mr. Dudman, shows that more than 91 per cent. of the 2,905 children whose births were registered in the parish were either successfully vaccinated, or died before being vaccinated, and that of a small percentage only of the remainder is there no return as to vaccination. SANITARY WORK. Table VI. imperfectly shows the precise nature and the amount of the work done by the Sanitary Inspectors. Much of their time was occupied in investigating and 12 remedying, so far as was practicable, the complaints of parishioners, and in attending to the removal of the infectious sick. Inspector Biorn in the performance of his duties unfortunately caught scarlet-fever, which was followed by rheumatic-fever. This necessitated his absence for a period of nearly three months, during which Inspector Clifford cheerfully performed his brother officer's duties in addition to his own. BAKE-HOUSES, COW-SHEDS, & SLAUGHTERHOUSES. These are under the charge of Inspector Clifford, and were by him regularly inspected. A great improvement is observable in many of these places since I first saw them. No complaints respecting them have been received. In one case I deemed it necessary to oppose an application for the renewal of a license for a slaughter-house, but as the applicant agreed to make certain structural alterations the Magistrates granted it. Permission was sought to establish a cow-shed in Cirencester Mews. The Sanitary Committee examined the situation, and subsequently withheld its sanction of the proposed transformation. WATER. The parish, it will be remembered, is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and the West Middlesex Companies. Of the five Companies deriving their supply from the Thames, Dr. Frankland, in his report to the Registrar General, points out that the West Middlesex continues to deliver the best water, and the J. MORTON, PRINTER, STAR STREET, EDGWARE ROAD. 13 Southwark and Vauxhall Company the worst. This superiority is due to the West Middlesex Company having a large subsidence and filtration plant, so that it is not compelled to take in water during floods, and is able uniformly to deliver it in an efficiently filtered condition. During the months of January, March, April,October and December, the water drawn from the Thames, owing to heavy rains, was wholly unfit for dietetic purposes. These heavy rains, more particularly in the month of December, converted stagnant pools and ditches into tributary streams, causing the river to overflow its banks, and, on returning to its natural channel, to carry with it the accumulated filth of the dry summer months, and the washings of the adjacent richly manured and cultivated lands; so that when it reached the intakes of the Companies loaded with organic impurities, the water was incapable of being rendered by subsidence and filtration or any other process fit for domestic use. Nevertheless it was so delivered to its consumers. These impurities, being of animal origin, make the water more objectionable, and its use not without danger to health. The sediment deposited by it on standing almost always reveals living and moving organisms. Such organisms during the year were on three occasions discovered in the water of the Grand Junction Company. The annexed tables exhibit some of the results of Dr. Frankland's observations, and of his microscopical 14 and chemical examinations of the water supplied to the metropolis by the different companies. As the Lea seldom overflows its banks, the water drawn from it by the New River and East London Companies is, after efficient filtration, of a greatly better quality than that obtained from the Thames, being much less polluted with organic matter. No complaints of the quantity or quality of the water were made during the year by any of the parishioners. Any remarks upon the scheme recently propounded by certain eminent engineers for the supply of the metropolis with the best available water for dietetic purposes, and for the extinction of fires, I reserve for a future Report, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health.
