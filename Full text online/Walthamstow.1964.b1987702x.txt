Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, As this is my last report to the Walthamstow Committee for Education I would have wished to include a review of the achievements over the years since the inception of the School Health Service, and especially those more recent advances since the publication by Dr. Powell of the Jubilee report in 1958. Unfortunately the urgent pressure of preparing for the amalgamation of the New Boroughs has enforced the edict that reports should be kept to a minimum, and I can only hope that future reviews of the School Health Service of Waltham Forest will include, and duly acknowledge, the attainments of Walthamstow. Certainly the new Borough is inheriting some of the finest schools in the Country despite a high proportion of sub-standard and obsolete buildings, and I must acknowledge the ready encouragement and help I have received from the successive Chairman and Members of the Walthamstow Committee for Education, from the Borough Education Officer and his staff, and from my own colleagues in the Health Department, especially those directly concerned with the School Health Service. I am, Your obedient Servant, M. WATKINS Divisional School Medical Officer. 5 STAFF OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH DEPARTMENT - 1964. Divisional School Medical Officer and Medical Officer of Health: M.

"The year has been marked by ever-increasing co-operation with parents, and, once again, I would like to thank my own staff for their loyal support and members of the Town Hall staff for their help at all times. "The average roll for the year was 92." WILLIAM MORRIS SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF:- Mr K.S.

Total Deaf Boys 1 7 3 11 Girls 2 7 2 11 Partially Boys - 12 7 19 Hearing Girls - 6 8 14 3 32 20 55 SPECIALIST CLINICS CHILD GUIDANCE CLINIC:- The Consultant Psychiatrist,Dr.J.E.Wilson, reports as follows:- I do not feel that I have been here quite long enough to fully evaluate these statistics. Unfortunately they do not appear to give a really adequate picture of the complexity of work undertaken at this clinic. For example, the diagnostic work involves rather lengthy investigations into family relationships, social and other environmental influences, such as the school, undertaken by the whole team of Phychiatrist, Psychiatric 11 Social Worker, and Educational Psychologist. Perhaps I might add here that symptoms are merely a signal of some kind of underlying distress, and do not constitute a diagnosis. The plan of treatment will depend on a variety of factors, such as the degree of emotional disturbance, as well as the capacity for insight and cooperation of both child and parents. The type of treatment offered is also dependent on the amount of time available. Usually treatment is supportive in character and is directed to removing obstacles which may be hindering the child's normal development. Psychotherapy is a more lengthy and intensive form of treatment which is unfortunately not yet available for many of the cases which might benefit, owing to lack of psychiatric time and the absence of Child Therapists. There is a growing awareness of the need to develop the more prophylactic aspects of our work. We have increasing links with Health Visitors, Probation Officers and Child Care Officers, and I hope that these will be strengthened. In this connection we hope to develop the work already started at this clinic by Dr. H.Gillespie with regard to the children who are under 5 years. Another relevant problem is the question of selecting the child who really needs help now because of the risk of future mental breakdown, rather than the one who has more "nuisance value" or a greater capacity to arouse anxiety in others. This is clearly a very difficult problem to solve, and requires a very close working relationship between the clinic and the referring agencies. EAR, NOSE AND THROAT CLINIC The weekly Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic has continued under the clinical charge of Dr. A. Cammock, M.B., B.Ch., D.L.O. EYE CLINIC The Clinic continues under the clinical charge of Dr.Hilton Ho. The services of a dispensing optician and an orthoptist are available to patients. ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC Mr. K. Dalliwall, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon in charge of the clinic reports that the Orthopaedic Clinic at Hale End Road continues to deal with a large number of children with conditions ranging from minor orthopaedic defects to seriously disabling conditions requiring special care and attention. 12 PAEDIATRIC CLINIC The fortnightly clinic at the Town Hall has continued under the clinical care of Dr. Elchon Hinden, Paediatrician to Whipps Cross Hospital. DENTAL CLINIC Mr. G.P.L. Taylor submits the following report on the work of the School Dental Service: - "Once again staff changes have interfered with the smooth running of the department. Although we have been able to do less inspections at school than in 1963, we have been able to increase the number of fillings done and the number of teeth saved. The number of extractions of unsaveable teeth has also been reduced. The employment of the Dental Auxiliary has proved a success. Her work is very satisfactory and her manner with young children excellent." 13 STATISTICAL SUMMARY SCHOOL POPULATION No. of schools No. on roll (20.12.64) Secondary 17 7216 Junior 17 4599 Infant 20 3119 Special 4 273 Nursery 1 81 PERCENTAGE ATTENDANCE Jan.
