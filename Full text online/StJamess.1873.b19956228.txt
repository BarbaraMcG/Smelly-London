JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE TEAR 1873-1874. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, March 25th, 1874. Reverend Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, In making a short Report accompanied by a General Summary of the principal matters that * have been executed by the Vestry during the last twelve months but little explanation is needed, as all the matters have from time to time been so minutely explained to, and examined by, the Works Committee, and through them brought before the Vestry, that the recollection of them, or those events that are worth remembering, will be fresh in the minds of most of its members. 14 It must be borne in mind that the amounts shown as the result of the McAdam and other roads are to be taken as the results of the past year only, and though some of the amounts expended may appear to be comparatively small, the next year may show a large increase, as a great deal depends upon the time of year at which the work is done, the return shewing only from March to March. There can be no doubt but that the use of the roller has been the means of greatly improved surfaces for the roads, combined with considerable reduction in the cost of maintenance. Experience will be the best guide as to the advisability of even increased rolling. The only drawback in a district like St. James's is the immediate inconvenience of the operation, because in the busy thoroughfares the traffic is not much less by night than by day, so that the problem of rolling without inconvenience has yet to be solved; perhaps next to the city the traffic of St. James's is the most incessant, and certainly much more rapid. On the whole the Roadways of the Parish are in very fair condition, and considering that every trifle is brought before the Works Committee, and approved by them 15 before execution, very little need be added here as to Paving Works particularly or generally. There is even less to be said with regard to Sewers matters, not that little has been done, on the contrary, a great deal has been attended to, but of an apparently commonplace character. Several of the most important Sewers of the Parish, which are the recipients of many other Sewers, require constant attention to keep them clean ; the causes of this are, in the first place, complicated, andhavebeen often explained; suffice it to say that in cleansing Sewers of that nature, cleaning Gullies, assisting at the construction of House Drains, Flushing, &c., &c., a great deal has been done, but being mostly underground and out of sight it does not excite the attention that is usually given to Surface Works. The other matters referred to in the accompanying list, although themselves of an apparently insignificant character, are, or have been, a part of the general duties of the Vestry, which general duties, if properly performed, are of the highest importance, and the Vestry are to be congratulated that no accident, or action at law, or any result of negligence has occurred during the past twelve months, except to those in their own employ, 16 the death of one and severe injury to another being one result of the entry of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. But the circumstances attending that Procession, the various matters connected with the visit of the Shah of Persia, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, and the Czar of Russia, were on the whole most satisfactorily carried out, as far as the part the Vestry to perform had on the various occasions. Much of the completeness of these arrangements were due to the individual energy and exertions of some members of the Works Committee, who at once acted as officers and undertook and thoroughly carried out those matters of superintendence so necessary at a time of unexpected and unusual excitement. As these processions cannot be included in the general functions of a District Board or Vestry they must be considered as exceptional, as of course everything else must give way. But little further allusion need be made to these matters as the Vestry were perfectly conversant with the details at the time. I had hoped to have been able to report something satisfactory with regard to the construction of Public Conveniences. This subject does not meet 17 with the general attention it deserves, but there can be no doubt that the St. James's Vestry have given all the attention to it that they could. The Parish of St. James's having always been the locality above all others for everything new to be exhibited has become such a kind of museum of Paving, Gas, Water, and every kind of General Work of all kinds, that there is actually a difficulty in finding a convenient site for a Public Convenience, even below the surface ; years since I came to the conclusion that practically they could not in this neighbourhood be openly constructed on the surface, but it always appeared feasible to construct them below; this of course can still be done, but as the subterranean part of the neighbourhood has not been overlooked by others the general accumulation of Vaults, Gullies, Gully Drains, House Drains, Local Sewers, Main' Sewers, and all the approaches to the same, Gas and Water Pipes and Mains, Telegraphs, &c,, &c., are beginning to make the effort to find sufficient room below ground very difficult. It is however a matter of congratulation that the difficulty of site is the only one, that the Vestry have so freely at all times supported the attempt to provide these most necessary con- b 18 veniences (in fact they are more than conveniences, being essentials), that sooner or later, and I trust within the current year, a signal success, which it will really be, will be effected in the matter. One success has to be recorded, though of course all the details have been so constantly before the Vestry that nothing more than a passing allusion is necessary, that is the actual opening of the communication between Rupert Street and Crown Court; although it is a pity that more was not accomplished, still the improvement is patent and great, has much benefitted the neighbourhood, and will be more felt in ten years hence than now. All the details of this alteration being fresh in the recollection of the Vestry a very slight allusion is required here, but it should be borne in mind, in justice, that in such an important neighbourhood as St. James's, the carrying out of any scheme at all is attended with so many obstacles to be overcome, that anything whatever actually done may be considered as a triumph, in a small way, perhaps, but it is so here, as what would be easy at Brixton or elsewhere is really serious in the St. James's District or Parish. 19 With the exception of personal thanks for another year of office and confidence, which I trust will be deserved and given, there is nothing farther to add to this brief summary. I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, ALBERT P.

JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE YEAR 1873, BY EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D., LL.D,, F.R.S., &c. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND FOOD ANALYST FOR ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. TO THE VESTRY of The Parish of St. James's, westminster. Reverend Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, I have great pleasure in laying before you my eighteenth annual Report to be able to state to you that it is equally favourable with that of last year, and that I have comparatively little beside to which to call your attention. General Mortality of the Parish in 1873. The total number of deaths registered during the year 1873 by the Registrars of the Parish, in quarters, were as follows:— First Quarter 131 Second Quarter 142 Third Quarter 162 Fourth Quarter 251 686 This death rate must, however, be diminished by the returns of deaths in the Workhouse, of persons who have been brought into the Parish 28 from St. Anne's, Soho. The number this year is larger than usual— Death rate in St. James, Westminster 686 Deaths of persons brought to the Workhouse from St. Anne's, Soho 57 True death of St. James's, Westminster 629 The death rate of the year 1872 was 620, so that the cxcess of deaths over the last year was only 9. But for the unfortunate outbreak of Measles in the last quarter of the year, bringing up the death rate from the average of 145 in each of the previous quarters to the number 251, last year would have been the healthiest year ever recorded in the Parish. As compared with the average death rate in the Parish, which has been 730, it shews a diminution of ONE HUNDRED AND 01SE DEATHS. The deaths below the average for the last three years have been as follows:— 1871 680 50 below average. 1872 620 110 ,, 1873 629 101 ,, Total 261 ,, When it is remembered that where one life is saved that above 20 cases of disease are prevented, you will see how large an amount of anxiety, suffering, and money has been saved. The following tables will give the ages at which 29 the persons have died during the present and two previous years. 1871. Under 1 Year. Above 1 and uuder 5. Above 5 and under 20. Above 20 and under 40. Above 40 and under 60. Above 60 and under 80. Above 80. Total.

Thus we find that whilst in 1872 only 149 children under one year died, that in 1873 163 died, making a difference of 14. In children under five years of age the increase in the death of children is still more appalling. In 1872 the death of children above one and under five was 86, whilst in 1873 it was 110, making a difference of 36. I drew your attention last year to the large death rate of children in your Parish, and shewed that the death rate of children under five years of age was greater than nearly every other town in the Kingdom. I also drew your attention to the fact that this mortality was due to the overcrowding of the Berwick Street district. The returns of the last year shew that the death rate of children have very much increased. I am endeavouring to trace the cause of this mortality to its source by procuring special returns of the deaths of all children dying under one year of age. I do not expect to arrive at any other conclusion than that want of fresh air is the cause of the mortality. So great is the evil of this mortality that the College of Physicians have memorialised the Government to induce it to take some steps to prevent the awful destruction of life that is now going on through the dirt and filth which is the result of overcrowding. As I have before said I 31 think it would be most unjust to apply Torrens' Act in this Parish as it has been in other parishes. At the same time I would strongly recommend that any measure brought before Parliament should secure— 1. Whenever a population is removed from the reason of overcrowding that there should be provision made for taking them to other lodgings. 2. That a proper compensation be given to those whose property is destroyed by removing the houses of the poor. Zymotic Diseases.

It will be seen that there has been but one 32 33 case of Small Pox, whilst Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea exhibit their average numbers. Measles present a slight excess above the average, and this was due to an outbreak which occurred in the month of December. In the four weeks of that month 12 cases of death from Measles were recorded in Berwick Street district alone In the second week of the outbreak as the disease shewed unusual malignity I determined to treat the houses and families as though they were cases of Scarlet Fever. The rooms where the disease was were visited by the Sanitary Inspector, and disinfectants were distributed, and the clothing of the infected families were sent to the Disinfecting Apparatus in the Stone Yard. The consequence was that the spread of the disease was almost immediately stayed. Need of a Mortuary. In the more thickly populated parts of the Parish the need of a mortuary is deeply felt. The presence of the dead amongst the living, especially in the hotter parts of the year, is a source of disease to the family in which it occurs, and of great and painful annoyance to other families living in the house. I trust some steps will be immediately taken to supply this especially sanitary institution. Public Bathing. In October last I reported to the Vestry as follows:— " During the past summer my attention has been 34 " drawn to the deficient means for Bathing in " London and Westminster. The practice of bathing " is most strengthening to the system, whilst the " act of swimming is most important in preserving " and saving human life in a great sea-girt country " like great Britain. On the Continent of Europe " extensive arrangements are made for bathing and " learning the art of swimming. There are several " swimming baths in the Seine, both for men and " for women. The same is the case in the Rhone " at Geneva, and many other Continental cities. " It would be unreasonable to erect swimming baths '' in the Thames so long as it retains its present " character. From the specimens before you of " Thames water obtained at several places between " Westminster and Battersea, you will see how " unfit such water must be for bathing. There is "one public spot in London provided with " abundance of water, which I think might be " used for the purpose of constructing public baths, " and that is Hampstead Heath. In the ponds " there, covering several acres, an admirable means " exists of constructing public baths. Bathing is " permitted there by the Board of Works at present, " but the dirt of the ponds, the public exposure, " and the annual loss of life render it any thing " but desirable that the practice should continue. " These ponds, however, might be levelled, their " bottom concreted, and walls erected around, so " as to render them every thing desirable for public " bathing. 35 " The heath is no longer private property, it has " been bought by the Metropolis, and belongs to all " London and as much to St. James's, Westminster, " as to the parish of Hampstead. Under these " circumstances I recommend the subject to your " attention, believing any action that you may take " would be followed by the rest of the Vestries " in London, and that in a short time we should " see the desirable object accomplished." ADULTERATION OF FOOD. This year I am able to hand a more full Report on the subject of Adulteration of Food than the previous years on account of the larger powers given to Vestries under the Adulteration of Food Act, 1872. Having been re-appointed to the post of Food Analyst, I commenced at the beginning of this year a more active exercise of the duties devolved upon me. Although the Adulteration Act * does not require the Inspector or Food Analyst to examine food that has not been sent them for analysis, I proposed to do what has lately been done in so many other districts of the Metropolis, to send the Inspector to purchase various articles of food, and to analyse them, and leave to you the discretion of directing prosecutions should any be deemed necessary. I now submit you two lists, one consisting of articles which have been sent to be examined in the year 1873, and which, without exception, were all found to be free from adulteration; and second, a list of articles analysed which were purchased by the Inspector during the same year 36 FOOD ANALYSES.

Of the eleven articles suspected, not one has been found to contain any kind of adulteration. In only one instance was any indication. given as to what was the kind of adulteration suspected. The second table contains a list of 119 articles, which have been submitted to me for analysis by the Inspector. Milk. The most important of these articles has been milk. This article of food is most extensively employed, and is more easily adulterated than any other. The adulteration to which it is exposed is water. This may bo most easily employed, and is of all things the most difficult of detection. This arises from the fact that although by analysis of a great number of specimens it is easy to say what is the quantity of butter, cheese, and sugar they contain, it is impossible to compel each cow to give the same quantities of these substances. It is a known fact that these substances will differ in almost every specimen of milk obtained from different cows, and from the same cow at different milkings. Hence it seemed to me to demand very great caution in proceeding against milk dealers, unless their milk was out of all proportion to what it ought to contain. 40 It will be seen by the tables that many specimens of the milk were suspicious, and others decidedly bad. In these cases it was decided that the vendors should be apprised of the inferior quality of their milk before any steps were taken. ]n one case it, was clear that the milk sold was skimmed milk, and had been sold by mistake for new milk. In all cases when the vendors have been cautioned milk has been purchased from time to time, and the milk has been so far improved that no fair prosecution could have been urged. The decided improvement after warning in our own parish, and the readiness with which milk sellers have paid the fines inflicted on them in other districts is perhaps an indication that the milk has been really adulterated. I would suggest here that a much more economical way of punishing adulterators than that of fining after conviction before a magistrate would be that of publishing a quarterly list of articles analysed, with the nature and extent of the adulteration, and the names of the persons of ivhom they were purchased. I believe if such a list were published quarterly, and stuck up outside the Vestry Hall and the doors of the Churches and Chapels, and sent to the principal hotels and places of public entertainment it would do more to check adulteration than any fines inflicted under the Adulteration Act. Tea. Several specimens of cheap black teas were 41 purchased and examined, none of these exhibited any kind of adulteration. It is always difficult to detect the presence of exhausted tea leaves which have again been prepared by processes similar to which tea is originally prepared. With regard to the facing of teas which consist in the addition of materials to the tea which gives them a more decidedly black or green appearance; these materials, although some of them as Indigo and Prussian Blue, are injurious in themselves are yet never added in sufficient quantity to produce any serious effects. These facings may rather be regarded as materials to make the tea look better than as materials added to profit the seller, or calculated to injure the buyer. They are like coloring matter in confectionery, and brandy and sugar in port, the purchasers know these things are present, and would not buy the articles if these adulterants were absent. Port without brandy and sugar sweetmeats without colors would not be acceptable to the British public. Nor would green tea without facing. In working out the Adulteration Act in favour of the tradesman, it should never be forgotten that in many cases the British public prefer an adulterated to a pure article, acting on the principle probably, that " Sure the pleasure is as great, Of being cheated as to cheat." Mustard. From the table it will be seen that eighteen specimens of mustard have been examined, of these 42 ten were adulterated, and eight were genuine. The principal adulteration was starch. To several specimens tumeric had been added to give a colour. The tumeric is not added to increase the weight, or to alter the dietetical quality of the mustard, but because the public will have dark mustard. The starch varied in quantity from one to ten per cent. The starch is not so much added as an adulterant as to give the mustard a finer appearance. There is also a notion that the mustard alone will not mix so well with water as when starch is added. There is no doubt, however, that starch may be added for the purpose of increasing the bulk, of the mustard, and thus increase the vendor's profit. It is most desirable that in all such cases as this the manufacturer should be compelled to say how much per cent. of the foreign article he has used. Thus in the case of the mustard the quantity of starch or wheat flour added to the genuine mustard, should be prominently put upon the paper; and if the analyst found the starch in excess of the declared quantity, the Inspector should be directed to proceed against the vendor In the case of the specimens examined by me, containing starch, it was stated on the papers that the mustard was " a mixture." No action was therefore taken or contemplated. Coffee. Six specimens of Coffee were purchased at the suggestion of the Anti-Adulteration Society. In each specimen chicory was found, and in each case 43 the chicory was declared to be present by the vendor. At the same time the quantity of chicory was not declared. The case of coffee is like that of mustard, and the law by allowing any quantity of chicory to be added to the coffee, provided it be declared, sanctions the possibility of a gigantic fraud. Of course if the Goverment were in earnest about preventing adulteration altogether, it would have positively interdicted the addition of the adulteration. But the public is here again consulted, and if the public wishes to have chicory with its coffee it is to be indulged. At the same time the public ought to know if it wishes to have chicory with its coffee, it had bettter buy the two separate, and take the quantity of each which it prefers. An instance of how the Government plays " fast and loose " on these adulteration questions, is seen in its refusal to take any notice of the frauds practised by Chinese merchants on the subject of tea. Whilst on the other hand the Inland Board of Revenue refused to allow the vendor of roasted coffee to add one per cent, of a perfectly innocuous substance on the ground that it increased the weight of the coffee, although the manufacturer was perfectly willing to pay duty on the quantity of the substance he used. Arrow Root. This substance is starch procured from various species of Maranta, grown in various parts of the 44 world. It is sold in the market under the name of East Indian, West Indian, Bermuda, and French Arrow root or Tous les Mois. All these arrow roots consist of grains of starch, and as such are no better and no worse as articles of diet than potatoe or wheat starch. The mixing of the cheap starches with these arrow roots for the purpose of diminishing their cost to the vendor is undoubtedly an adulteration. Twelve specimens of arrow root were purchased and examined under the microscope. Of these ten specimens were unadulterated genuine arrow roots of one kind or another. Two, however, exhibited degrees of adulteration with wheat starch and rice starch. The vendors were cautioned. Sugar, Sugar is not liable to much adulteration. Soft sugar containing much molasses may be sold at a higher price. But the charging a high price for a bad material is not adulteration, although for some recent magisterial decisions it might seem to be thought so. Six specimens of raw sugar were examined, but no adulteration of any kind was fonud. Sausage- Meat. In this article of diet the meat is cut fine, and mixed with other ingredients. Amongst other things it is usually mixed with bread. Of twelve specimens of beef and pork sausages bought, all these contained a certain quantity of bread. The lowest quantity found was five per cent., whilst 45 some of the specimens contained as much as twenty per cent. According to the Adulteratiou Act it is for the magistrate to decide as to whether he considers certain additions to compound food as adulteration. Already the adulteration of mustard with flour has been heavily fined, and it is for the Vestry to say if they wish the manufacturers of sausages containing 20 per cent, of bread to be prosecuted. It appears to me that if any good is to be done in this department of adulteration, it must be by insisting on the quantity of any compound mixture being stated on the cover in which it is sold. Sausages contain many other constituents beside the meat of which they are principally composed, and the only way of meeting the difficulty of regarding any of these substances as an adulteration is for the Government to decide what the normal constituent ought to be of a genuine sausage, and inflicting fines when they are discovered to be differently constituted. The difficulties of dealing with compounded foods which are ordinarily sold in the shops is enormous. Who can dictate the quantity of flour, plums, currants, or sugar in plum puddings and cakes ? and yet it is notorious that they differ in these and other constituents. If the public cannot judge of these things they should be left to themselves, for if they cannot distinguish between one article of food and another, they are hardly entitled to the aid of the Government to assist them 46 unless the food they purchase is a poison, which they are really unable to detect. Soda Water. The Adulteration Act gives power to the analyst over drugs as well as food. On the border land, between food and drugs, stands a beverage or medicine known by the name of Soda Water. This liquid is sold in bottles, and is professedly an imitation of some natural springs which contain a certain quantity of carbonate of soda and carbonic acid. In England this water is entirely an artificial preparation, and is sold by chemists and druggists as a medicine and by publicans as a beverage. It is supposed to contain from ten to fifteen grains of carbonate of soda in a bottle containing about ten ounces of water. The medicinal agency of this beverage consists in its carbonate of soda, and it becomes a matter of importance for sick people and convalescents, for whom this liquid is ordered, that they should have the supposed quantity of soda in the water. From an examination of six specimens of this water bought at chemists and druggists and publicans, I found that none of them contained in the bottle a residue of ten grains; that various other salts besides carbonate of soda were contained in the water and that in some of them was a considerable quantity of organic matter. The conclusion I came to was this : that none of these waters were genuine mineral waters; that 47 most of them contained less saline matter than the mineral water they represent contain; and that the only thing they contained in tolerably certain quantity was carbonic acid gas. Confectionery. Twelve specimens of sugared sweetmeats were purchased and examined. All the specimens were colored. The agents employed for coloring were principally vegetable. Two specimens were colored with cochineal. Six specimens were more or less adulterated with subtances containing starch. As sweetmeats are sold as compounds and net guaranteed as pure sugar, no proceedings were taken. It is, however, very evident that starch may be added to a very large extent to the disadvantage of the purchaser and to the advantage of the seller. But here again the public ought to be the best judge. If a child prefers a bon-bon with starch, the Legislature is surely not expected to fine tradesmen for indulging the child's taste when it leads to no injurious result. No injurious substance was found in any of these sweetmeats. Peppers. Twelve specimens of powdered black pepper were purchased. Although pepper may be very successfully adulterated so that the public could be deceived, yet none of these specimens were found 48 to contain any thing more than what might be regarded as an accidental adulteration. The substances found in the pepper, which were never found in pepper corns, were minute quantities of starch, the spiral vessels and ligneous fibre of other plants. The reason of the purity of pepper is undoubtedly the fact that it pays a duty to Government, and the Board of Inland Revenue have therefore an interest in looking after it. As a body of skilful analysts few men exceed the staff at Somerset House where all our custom house officers get a better education in the detection of adulterations than that attainable by most of the food analysts under the Adulteration of Food Act. I would suggest that it would not be a difficult piece of legislation to make a small charge on all articles of food likely to be adulterated delivered by the manufacturer to the retail vendor in order to pay the expense of maintaining a class of educated officers who should be empowered to examine from time to time such special articles. This would save the annoyance and injustice of fining tradesmen for adulteration of foods of whose qualities they are perfectly innocent. Under the present law half the convictions at least have fallen upon parties innocent of the adulteration of the articles they sell. Beer. One specimen alone of beer has been examined, and this was suspected to contain strychnine. Some years ago a French chemist expressed a 49 suspicion that English bitter beer might be made so by the addition of strychnine; extensive analyses were made at that time, and no beer was found to contain strychnine. This substance is not difficult to detect in compounds where it is present, and I had no hesitation in affirming that the above specimen of beer was free from the slightest adulteration. Tobacco. One specimen of tobacco was sent suspected of adulteration. Chemical analysis or microscopical examination cannot detect the substitution of an inferior for a superior tobacco leaf. Tobacco is undoubtedly subject to many adulterations; but the active chief of the Inland Revenue Laboratory with his staff of intelligent analysts is much too acute to allow any of them to pass. There was nothing but tobacco leaf in the specimen sent for examination. The same kind of tobacco bought at another shop presented exactly the same appearance as the suspected tobacco.
