A REPORT Of the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the works undertaken and executed, &c., for the year ending Ladyday, 1874. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Act," 1855. N .B.— The Medical Officers and Sanitary Reports will be issued separately. REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1874, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £55471 12s. 1d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. l1d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 1873, 8d.; to Michaelmas 8d.; to Christmas 9d.; and to Lady-day, 1874, 10d., the same total amount as in the previous year. the gross amount levied was £64,938 from which has to be deducted losses from defaulters, excused, vacant premises, and allowances to owners, equal in all to about 13 per cent. of the gross sum charged. This proportion has been calculated a priori and is verified by the result. The mode in which this sum has been expended will be seen by reference to the statement signed by the Poor Law Auditor given in the Accountant's Report. At Lady-day, 1873, the Vestry was indebted to the Guardians on Contribution Orders £7000, and at the same period, 1874, the same amount. The amount of the Guardians Contribution Orders for the year ending Lady-day, 1873, was £44,000, and for the year ending Ladyday, 1874, £38,500. Further particulars will be found in the Balance Sheet given with the Accountant's Report. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The Accountant's statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last two years, ending Lady-day, were 1873 1874 General in the 1/6 1/6 Sewers ditto 4d. 4d. 6 ASSESSMENTS. The Provisional and Supplemental Valuation lists for the year have been duly prepared, and the totals for the present year are fixed at £561,817 10s. gross value, and £448,272 rateable value. The totals for the Metropolitan District are, gross value £25,226,885, and the rateable value £20,731,709, subject to appeals pending. It is upon the total rateable value that the Police, County, Metropolitan Board's, School Board's, and other charges are levied. METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS. The following paragraph appeared in the last Report:— "The Act of Parliament which the Metropolitan Board obtained last Session for the widening of the High Street, and the making of a new street, from Old Street to Shoreditch, &c., has been put into operation; the works have not actually commenced, but the Metropolitan Board is actively engaged in settling the claims for compensation involved, and the actual works may be expected to commence in a short time." The above is equally true for this year, no works having actually commenced. TRAMWAYS. The North ???Tramway Company has now completed the whole of the works authorised within this Parish. The amount paid by them in respect to pavements taken is £7309, and there is a balance of about £500 to be paid when the exact measurements have been decided. No Bill was promoted by the Company last Session affecting this Parish except that in an Extension of Time Bill, a proposal was made to authorise the use of steam propelling power, but that was not proceeded with. RAILWAYS. The only Railway Bill affecting the Parish was one promoted by North London Railway Company to authorise the appropriation of the roadway under the Sun Street Bridge, which would, as proposed, have involved the stopping up of the thoroughfare from Sun Street to Liverpool Street, between the two stations. 7 After some negotiation between the North London and Great Eastern Companies, and between these Companies and the City Commissioners of Sewers and the Improvement Committee of this Vestry, the matter was settled by the Company conceding to the City a continuation of the said theroughfare from Sun Street to Skinner Street, and by surrendering to this Parish a small plot of ground in Skinner Street, which had been the cause of a considerable nuisance, and foregoing the claim for payment for the piece of ground in Worship Street which the Company was bound to sell to the Parish, the estimated value of which, was £2500 The Metropolitan Board had agreed to bear the cost of this improvement, hence the saving will be to the Metropolis in general and not to the Parish in particular. THE PROPOSED MORTUARY. The Vestry has decided against erecting a Mortuary on the ground in rear of the Town Hall. The whole question is at present in abeyance, but there are some prospects of an arrangement being made by which such a provision may be made in the Parish Church Yard. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Five persons were prosecuted upon information by parishioners for keeping disorderly houses. Three females and two males; all pleaded guilty. Three were ordered to find bail to oome up for judgment when called upon, and two (females) were sentenced to six months' hard labour, the cases being bad ones, and the disreputable practises being carried on during the time the offenders were under remand. ADULTERATION OF FOOD ACT. Dr. Stevenson, Professor of Chemistry at Guy's Hospital, has been appointed the analyst for this Parish, for one year, at a salary of £50, with 10s. for each analysis; and the appointment has been approved by the Local Government Board. The Vestry has fixed 2s. 6d. as the fee to be paid by purchasers of articles on submitting the same for examination. During the year ensuing the 24th of June, sixty-one samples were submitted for examination. Of these, twenty were submitted by private purchasers, including five by the officers of the workhouse. 8 Six cases were certified by the Analyst as proper for prosecution. the articles wore milk, and the offenders were fined ton shillings each, and nine shillings costs, being the charge for the summons and the fee to the Analyst for attendance at court. the Analyst's Reports are appended. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Largo If all has boon lot 156 times; the Council Chamber 21 times; the Committee Rooms have been frequently used by Local Societies, School Board Committees, &c., mostly free of charge. the receipts for lotting were £977 6s. 6d.; the amount paid for cleaning after letting, £90. In the autumn of 1873 the Hall was thoroughly repaired and renovated, and the Large Hall was in some respects altered at a total cost of about £1150. OFFICERS. the Inspectors of Nuisances, Messrs. Dennis and Robinson, resigned their offices at Christmas last, and Mr. Fletcher was appointed Inspector of Nuisances and Mr. Alexander, Sanitary or House Inspector, at a salary of £150 each Appended is a list of the Contracts taken by the Vestry for the Year, with other requisite information. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1874. 9 REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTANT. TO the Vestry of ST. Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, In accordance with the provisions cf the Metropolis Local Management Act, it becomes my duty to present you with an official report of the Financial affairs of the Parish of Shoreditch under control of the representative Vestry, for the year ending the 25th March, 1874, and the financial condition of the Vestry at the close of that official year. On reference to my report it will be seen that the total amount of money received during that year, by Poor and Vestry rates, was £93,506 17s. 4d., with a balance in the hands of the Treasurer, at the commencement of the year, of £5,576 7s. 8d., and leaving a balance on the credit side of the account at the end of the year of £5,663 17s. l0d. to be carried forward. The amount of Poor rates so raised was £55,471 12s. 1d., being at the rate of 2/11 in the pound; and that of the several Vestry rates to £38,035 5s. 3d., being at the rate of 1/10 in the pound. This result shews a satisfactory state of things in so far as the Financial affairs of the Vestry are concerned, and, as compared with the corresponding collection of the previous year, the amount is equally satisfactory, although a larger amount was collected during 10 the last than during the preceding year, in consequence of improved systematic collection, and the extension of rateable property brought under assessment. The chief items of expenditure are comprised in the forms tabulated in my report, a perusal of which affords grounds of congratulation as well on the part of the ratepayers as of the Local authority under whose supervision the several rates are expended. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. E. COLE, Accountant to the Vestry. Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1874. 11 VESTRY OF SAINT LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. POOR RATE.
