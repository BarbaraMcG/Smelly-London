CAM 74 1870-71. ST. GILES, CAMBERWELL, SURREY. Fifteenth Annual Report OF THE VESTRY OF THEIR Proceedings under the Local Management Act, 1s & 19 Vic., cap. 123. LONDON: W. BRICKHILL, STEAM PRINTING WORKS, FINSBURY STREET, E.C. 1871. Fifteenth Annual Report OF THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. GILES, CAMBERWELL. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them, and an Account of their Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 25th March, 1871. 1870-71. General Purposes Committee's REPORT. Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. THE GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE BEG TO PRESENT TO THE VESTRY THE FOLLOWING REPORT ON THE VARIOUS MATTERS WHICH HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH BY THEM DURING THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1871. "NEW ROADS." The following list of New Roads will prove to the Vestry that these much needed works have received considerable attention during the past year. Fourteen of these Roads, comprising a length of 3,661 yards (over two miles), have been surveyed, estimated, contracted for, and the works executed and completed under the superintendence of your Officers, the cost being charged to the owners of the property abutting thereon; four others are now in hand, and 39 additional Roads are at this time under either survey, notice to repair, or other arrangement, with a view to their being in like manner proceeded with, as those before referred to, so that the inconvenience arising from unmade Roads, so 6 long complained about, may be got rid of as quickly as possible. Your Committee beg to call attention to tbe many delays and difficulties which have to be overcome in connexion with this description of work, arising from persistent opposition in some instances, in numerous others from the great difficulty of collection even of a portion of the cost before they are executed, (a course which it has been found necessary to adopt, so as not to embarrass the finances of the Vestry), and to many other causes, both legal and technical, which seriously impede the carrying out of. these works so rapidly as the Committee would desire. The following is a list of the "New Roads "referred to which have been Paved and taken under the Vestry control, under Clause 105 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120.

The Vestry having directed, for the information of the Ratepayers, that the "Report upon Tar Paving, Asphalte, &c.," which your Committee presented in June last, should form a portion of their Annual Report, it is unnecessary further to refer to this subject than to state that, following closely upon the reception of that Report, your Committee were authorized to commence a portion of the works therein referred to, viz.:— Paving with Val de Travers Asphalte the Footway in the Peckham Road on the north side, from the Vestry Hall to Brunswick Square; also, with Wright's Tar paving, the Footway of the Peckham Road on the south side, from Vestry Road to Peckham High Street, at Peckham House, both of which specimens of paving have been since reported upon by your Committee as satisfactorily executed; and, as by a third Report adopted by the Vestry, they were further authorised to proceed with additional works of Tar Paving, they have to announce that at the time of compiling this Report, these works are being carried out with all despatch, in order to complete, as much as possible, before the Winter. 10 ROAD REPAIRS, ROAD WATERING, WELLS, &c. The General Repairs of the Public Roads of the Parish have received the necessary attention, and as regards the Watering the extension of this work, as adopted last season, has given much satisfaction to the inhabitants. A further addition has been made this season. Your Committee also report that the Road Wells sunk last season, and upon which a detailed Report by the Surveyor was included in the last Annual Report, have proved very satisfactory, and have, in their several localities, effected the saving in the purchase of the water which was anticipated. IMPROVEMENTS. In last year's Report it was intimated that attention would at once be given to the rebuilding of the present very inconvenient and dangerous structure crossing the Grand Surrey Canal, called GLOBE BRIDGE. 11 Your Committee are now enabled to Report that all the preliminaries are completed, the sanction and promise of contributions obtained from the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Canal Company, and that by directions of the Vestry, advertisements have been issued for tenders for this work, so that it may be completed before the coming Winter. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS. During the past year the following Roads have been re-numbered, under the authority of precepts from the Metropolitan Board of Works:— Leipsic Road, Wyndham Road. Cator Street (including also James Street and John Street, which latter Streets have merged into Cator Street). Camden Grove North. Peckham Park Road, late Park Road, from the Old Kent Road to Hill Street. Further Re-numbering and, in some instances, Re-naming Streets and Roads have been submitted to the consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and await only their direction to carry out the same, as follows:— 12 Alpha Road, Green Hundred Road. Arthur Street, Clifton Road. Acorn Place, Meeting House Lane. Bird-in-Bush Road, Peckham. Carlton Road. Denmark Hill. Emily's Cottages, Meeting House Lane. Earl Street, Old Kent Road. Grove Lane. Gatton Road. George Street, Green Hundred Road. Grange Street, Old Kent Road. Ledbury Street, Commercial Road. Naylor Road. Victoria Place, Old Kent Road. BUILDING FRONTAGES, PROJECTIONS, NEW STREETS, &c. During the past year 62 notices on the above subjects were submitted by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which received full consideration and examination by your Committee, and were then reported to the Vestry, previous to transmitting the Yestry's views thereon to the Board. LIGHTING. Your committee has given this subject constant 13 attention, especially in the newly-built upon portions of the Parish. The return of New Lamps fixed, and the altered positions of others, is as follows:— Name of Gas Company. New Lamps. Removals. Total No. of Lamps.

What is the sanitary and general condition of your parish or district now as compared with its state previously to the Metropolis Local Management Act coming into operation ? ANSWER. 3, 9 and 11. Previous to the Metropolis Local Management Act coming into operation, a very large proportion of the houses had common privies and cesspools; since then 4,352 cesspools have been abolished, and 4,222 water closets have been provided through the direct action of the Vestry; and at the present time (except here and there in the rural parts), there is scarcely a cesspool or privy anywhere in the parish. Pump water was largely used for drinking purposes, but that has been greatly diminished, especially among the poorer classes, in 1,484 instances water has been laid on for drinking purposes. It may be added that since the act came into operation, systematic house to house inspection has been carried on, 42,093 houses have been inspected; 3,831 houses have been cleansed and whitewashed; 939 have been repaired, 960 yards have been paved, more than 2,913 dust bins have been provided or repaired, 9,797 drains have been trapped, cleansed, or amended, and more than 20,000 nuisances of various kinds (including trade nuisances, animals filthily kept, accumulation of offensive matter) have been dealt with. The slaughter-houses, bake-houses, and workshops are periodically inspected, and latterly (within the last few 23 months), an order of regulation in reference to houses let in lodgings, has been sanctioned by the Home Secretary, and is now being brought into operation. A vehicle for the removal of infectious cases has been provided by the Guardians, which is by arrangements generally available. A Mortuary has been erected by the Burial Board in the Parochial Burial Grounds, (which is within the parish), and can be used for the purpose indicated in the Amendment act of 1866. The Vestry has ordered the erection of a disinfecting apparatus. Up to 1866 there were two Inspectors of Nuisances; since then there have been four. By Order of the Vestry, G. W. MARSDEN, April 20th, 1871. Vestry Clerk 1870-71. Sewers and Sanitary Committee's REPORT. REPORT of the SEWERS & SANITARY COMMITTEE.

The statistical information supplied for this Report by your Medical Officer, contains explanatory Tables and Details, which will inform the Ratepayers of the large amount of Sanitary Work which has been performed in this Parish during the past 12 months. 28 NEW SEWERS Have been constructed at the public expense, in Beckett Street, Wyndham Road, Brayard's Road, and Gordon Road, Peckham, Public Footpath, from Peckham Rye to Linden Grove, Bengali Road, Old Kent Road. New Gullies for the improvement of the SurDrainage of the Public Streets have been ucted. PRIVATE SEWERS WORKS. Applications for permission to lay down New Sewers at the cost of the owners of the respective properties have been considered and approved, and the works supervised by the Vestry Officers, at the British Land Company's Estate, near Lordship Lane. Minett's Estate, leading from Camberwell New Road to Brixton. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The following shows the number of Houses drained into the Public Sewers of this Parish during the past year. 29 No. of Houses permanently Drained. No. of Houses temporarily Drained, 763 Nil. Total No. of Houses Drained, 763. (Signed) ANDREW MIDDLEMASS, Chairman of the Sewers and Sanitary Committee. 1870-71. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT by J. S. BRISTOWE, M.D., Lond., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; Physician to, and Lecturer on General Pathology at, St. Thomas's Hospital; Examiner in Medicine at the University of London, and in Anatomy and Physiology at the Royal College of Physicians. Gentlemen, In the 52 weeks ending Saturday, December 31st, 1870, there were registered in London 113,499 births, and 77,278 deaths; which numbers (on the supposition that there were living in London in the middle of that year 3,214,707 persons) give respectively a birth-rate of 3-531 per cent.,and a death-rate of 2.412 per cent. The births were more numerous, the deaths less numerous than in the previous year, and the death-rate consequently was smaller. The following is a statement of the mortality of the more important zymotic diseases in the years 1869 and 1870:— Small-pox. Measles. Scarlet Diphtheria. Hooping Fever. Diarrhea & Fever. Cough. Cholera. 1869 273 1425 5803 343 3755 2414 3617 1870 958 1443 5998 313 1935 2053 4011 34 From this it will be seen that while Small-pox increased much in fatality, and Scarlet Fever a little, there was a considerable diminution in the deaths from Fever, and an exceedingly large diminution in the deaths from Hooping Cough. Scarlet Fever prevailed as a serious epidemic throughout both 1869 and 1870; in each of which years more than four times as many persons died of it, as died of it in the year 1867. In 1868 the deaths from Scarlet fever were 2,921. Deaths from Small-pox were unusually few in 1869, and were few also in the beginning of 1870; but they rapidly increased towards the end of the year, at which time that epidemic, which is now so alarming, may be considered to have commenced. In the first quarter of the year there were 99 deaths from Small-pox, in the second 118, in the third 157, and in the last 584. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, 1870 was, on the whole, a year of more than average good health. It may be added that relapsing fever (which, though scarcely affecting the death-rate, prevailed to a very great extent in the latter part of 1869) gradually disappeared from amongst us in the early part o.f 1870. The death-rates of the five groups of districts into which London is divided, were as follows :— West, 2.431 ;North, 2.380; Central, 2.463; East, 2.528; South, 2.331. I subjoin, also, a table shewing the population in 1861, together with the number of deaths, and the number of deaths due to each of certain specified forms of zymotic diseases which occurred in the year 1870, in each of these groups :— 35 Population 1861. Total Deaths, 1370. Deaths from Zymotic Diseases, 1870. S.pox Measles. S. Fever Dipth. H.Coug. Fever. Diarr.

In the parish of Camberwell there were, in the year 1870, 3,739 births—23 less than in 1869 ;and 2,362 deaths—8 less than in 1869.*Of the births,60 occurred in Dulwich,1,006 in Camberwell,1,423 in Peckham,and 1,250 in St.George's; of the deaths,47 in Peckham,787 in Camberwell,845 in Peckham,and 683 in St.George's.But of the 787 deaths ascribed to Camberwell,169 took place in the Workhouse and 73 in two Lunatic Asylums,and are,therefore,only accidentally included in the mortality of the Camberwell subdistrict.By deducting these from the mortality of the latter division of the parish,and then distributing them in fair proportion over all the sub-districts,the mortality for the year becomes, for Dulwich, 47+=52;for Camberwell, S45+62=607 ; for Peckham, 845+97=942;for St. George's,683 +78=761. It might be supposed, and it may be a fact, that the smaller number of deaths in the parish this year than last * For statistics of births and deaths see Tables I and II in the Appendix- 36 indicates an improved state of the health of the parish. It must be borne in mind, however, that this diminution in the number of deaths is associated with a still larger diminution, in the number of births,and that the latter circumstance renders it exceedingly probable that,instead of the usual increase, there has been latterly some falling off in the population of the parish. The unusually large number of houses which have remained empty in various parts of Camberwell enhances the probability of this explanation. In order to obtain the death-rate, it is necessary to know not only the number of persons who have died in the year, but the average number of persons who have been living in the year. But it is impossible at the present time to ascertain the latter fact for Camberwell with any degree of certainty; and still greater uncertainty of result must attend any endeavour to determine the population of the several sub-districts. I will however now, as I have done in several former years, estimate the population of the parish and of its subdistricts, and also their death-rates, by two methods, both of which are orthodox,but which furnish widely different results; and I shall do this partly because I am anxious to obtain for your information the facts above referred to as accurately as I can obtain them, and partly because it will be interesting to compare my results with those which the Census-returns will soon furnish us with. It must be borne in mind, however, that the Census-returns of population will relate to the night of the 3rd of April, 1871;my own estimates of population relate to the middle of the year 1870. 37 Assuming that Camberwell, and its several sub-districts, have each increased annually since 1861 at the same rate at which they each increased annually between 1851 and 1861: the population of the whole parish was in the middle of 1870 about 91,626, that of Dulwich about 1,811, that of Caruberwell about 25,209, that of Peckham about 39,586, and that of St. George's about 25,579. Again, assuming that the birth-rate is constant, and at 3"314 to every hundred persons living, and basing our estimate of the population on the number of children born during the year, the population of the parish was, in the middle of 1870, 112,836, that of Dulwich was 1,811, that of Camberwell 30,359, that of Peckham 42,943, and that of St. George's 37,723. According to the former series of estimates, the death-rate of the parish was 2.578 per cent., that of Dulwich 2.87, that of Camberwell 2.407, that of Peckham 2.379, and that of St. George's 2.957. According to the latter series, the death-rate of the parish was 2.09, that of Dulwich 2.87, that of Camberwell 2.00, that of Peckham 2.19, and that of St. George's 2.02. Now it is obvious that the above series of results differ very widely, and that they cannot both, and probably are neither of them, correct; and I may add, that the estimates for Dulwich, which alone coincide, are probably the most inaccurate of all. The fact is, we know positively that the parish, neither as a whole nor in its parts, has been increasing uniformly, or according to any ascertainable rule; and we know also that, although the birth-rate may remain uniform for a very extensive area and a very large population, that general uniformity is made up of probably as many special 38 variations from that uniformity as we choose to make subdivisions of that area and population, and these variations become wider and and wider as we increase the number, and therefore diminish the size, of our sub-divisions. We know, further, that the birth-rate among the well-to-do classes is lower than that among the poor, and that on that account (if on no other) the population of Dulwich has been under-estimated in the above calculation, and the population of St. George's and of Peckham has been over-estimated. Making a rough guess, I should be inclined to think that the population of the parish, and that of each of the subdistricts (excepting Dulwich) lie about half way between the two divergent estimates which have been given. * Whole Dulwich.

Population ascertained by Census} 111302 4041 31251 42159 33851 * Since the above calculations were made, and the above paragraphs were written, Mr. Stevens, clerk to the guardians, has published a summary of the more important results which the late census has revealed with regard to the Parish of Camberwell. I have added this summary to my report, as the 3rd table in the appendix. And I have thought it desirable here, in a foot note, to bring together for comparison the results of my own calculations as given in the text, and those of the census. It must not be forgotten however that the census-returns are for the current year, and will therefore be especially available for the purposes of my next annual report; and that my own calculations, being for the middle of 1870, apply to a period of nine months earlier date. 39 Of the 2,362 deaths, 621 occurred in the first year of life, and 383 between one and 5. The deaths were also numerous towards the other limit of life : 225 persons died between 60 and 70, 212 between 70 and 80, 101 between 80 and 90, and 13 over 90, of whom one is said to have attained the age of 100. Hence over 1000 of the total number of deaths took place below the age of 5, and over 500 above the age of 60. Among the chief causes of death may be enumerated, "accidental, or other violence, "which caused 40 deaths; "premature birth, or defective vitality continuing from birth, "which accounted for 184; "pneumonia, bronchitis, and other inflammatory affections of the lungs." which caused 361 deaths; "diarrhaaa, dysentery, and English cholera," which caused 160 deaths; "hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy," which caused 162 deaths; and "phthisis, and other forms of tubercular diseases," which caused 323 deaths ; "child-birth," which was fatal in 20 cases, and "inherited syphilis," which was fatal in 10; and the various forms of infectious fever. Of these latter, small-pox destroyed 23 persons, measles 24, hooping-cough 49, fever 57, diphtheria 10, and scarlet fever 192. Small-pox produced 14 more deaths in 1870 than it did in 1869. The deaths were distributed, as to area, one in Dulwich, 2 in Camberwell, 18 in Peckham, and 2 in St. George's; as to time, 4 in the first quarter of the year, 4 in the second, 8 in the third, and 7 in the fourth. It is obvious, therefore, that the disease during the whole year hung more about Peckham than other parts of the parish, but that it at no time prevailed epidemically, and that it showed no tendency 40 thus to prevail even during the last quarter of the year, when it had become severe in the eastern districts of London. Camberwell had its share in the epidemic of scarlet fever which prevailed in London during the two years, 1869 and 1870 ; there were 164 deaths from scarlet fever in 1869, and 192 in 1870. Of the 164 for 1869, one took place in Dulwich, 37 in Camberwell, 47 in Peckham, and 79 in St. George's of the 192 for 1870, one took place in Dulwich, 50 in Camberwell, 58 in Peckham, and 83 in St. George's. These figures shew that, in both years, the epidemic prevailed with disproportionate severity in the district of St. George's. But although scarlet fever destroyed more lives in 1870 than in 1869, the period of its greatest severity was in the last three months of 1869. In the first three months of that year scarlatinal deaths were 14, in the second 7, in the third 31, in the fourth 112; in the first three months of 1870 they were 59, in the second 19, in the third 49, and in the fourth 65. I may add that, during the present year, this disease has to a great extent subsided. Hooping-cough caused comparatively few deaths, and these, like the deaths ftom scarlet fever, were more numerous both actually and relatively to the population in St. George's than in the other disticts. Of the total number of deaths, 26 occurred in the first quarter, 8 in the second, 11 in the third, and 4 in the fourth. The great mortality from hooping-cough in the early part of the year was connected with an epidemic prevalence of the disease, which extended throughout the whole of 1869, and was prolonged into the commencement of 1870. Deaths from measles and diphtheria, which were few in 41 number, call for no special remark. And as regards the deaths ascribed to fever, which were also not numerous, it may be asserted that few, if any, were due to relapsing fever or typhus, and that doubtless a good many of them were the result of typhoid or entric fever. The distribution of deaths, according to season, was somewhat unusual. For the most part, the second quarter of the year is the least fatal to life; then comes the third quarter, then the first, the most fatal of all being the fourth quarter. But in the year 1870, the first quarter of the year was marked by a much higher mortality than any subsequent quarter; the third quarter was next in order of fatality, and in the fourth quarter the deaths were unusually few : 665 deaths occurred in the first quarter, 614 in the third, 573 in the third, and 510 in the second. The undue mortality of the first quarter seems to have been largely owing to an unusual fatality from acute pulmonary affections, and the comparatively numerous deaths from hooping-cough, which marked that season. The undue mortality of the third quarter seems to have resulted mainly from the extensive and fatal prevalence of diarrhaea, and other allied affections of the bowels. It may be mentioned here, that during the year 18 bodies of children—newly-born, or a few weeks or months old— were discovered in different parts of the parish, and that some of these were proved to have been the bodies of children who had been under the charge of the notorious Mrs. Waters—the baby-farmer. Sanitary operations.—The report upon sanitary operations relates, not to the year 1870, but to the 12 months ending March 25th, 1871. 42 During this period the Inspectors, Wood, Cooper, and Waters (Cooper, however, having been removed from the work of house-to-house inspection, and detailed to special duties in reference to small-pox, from February 13th, 1871, to the end of the quarter), visited and reported specially on the condition of 13,503 houses. And as a result of these inspections, and the sanitary defects discovered, 581 drains were cleansed, and 240 trapped; 119 cesspools were emptied, and 108 filled up, and 117 closets were provided; 554 houses were cleansed and repaired; water was supplied to premises on 5 occasions, butts and cisterns on 36, and 153 butts and cisterns were covered; 539 dust-bins were provided, 5(3 yards paved, and 471 miscellaneous nnisances (from collections of manure, from pigs, &c.) were remedied. In connection with these works, 1,466 first and 182 second notices were served, and 21 summonses were taken out. Besides the above, 3,92 7 complaints as to non-removal of dust were attended to ; and 78 cow-houses, 61 slaughter-houses, 126 bake-houses, and 39 workshops were kept under observation. At the close of the year 33 orders, as yet uncomplied with, were outstanding. • It should be added, that during the year the three inspectors above-named kept, as far as they were able to do, a daily watch over the dust-carts in their respective districts; and that they carried out between them the re-numbering of 244 houses. It will be seen from these figures that the amount of work done by the Inspectors of Nuisances during the last 12 months was very much greater than the amount done during any previous 12 months. This result has been mainly due, I 43 believe, to the very judicious rearrangement of the Inspectors' duties made by the Sewers' Committee. Hitherto the Parish had been divided between the four inspectors; each inspector having to perform for his own section of the Parish every sanitary duty required within that section, including a daily visit, if not two, to the Vestry Hall, in order to receive and to register complaints, and not merely the serving, but the writing out of all orders and notices of the Vestry or Sanitary Committee having reference to sanitary matters. Thus it happened that some two or three hours of each inspector's time were daily lost to the active performance of his duties; and as the inspectors had always to attend to their daily quota of complaints, to serve notices, to see that works that had been ordered to be done were carried out, to attend at police courts, and to perform other imperative duties, it happened also that the systematic inspection of houses (a most important part of their duty, and certainly the most shewy statistically) had necessarily but little time comparatively allotted to it, in fact only the varying time left in the intervals between other labours. After very careful enquiry and consideration, the Committee came to the conclusion that the mere clerk's work of the inspectors was of itself nearly sufficient to occupy the whole time of one man, and that by assigning to one of the inspectors the duty of attending daily, and for the whole day, at the Inspectors' Office, to perform there all the clerk's work of the other inspectors, to receive all complaints, to give information and advice to all applicants, and to distribute to the acting inspectors the complaints and other incidental duties which daily accrued, and by dividing the Parish between the other three, who would 44 thus have two or three hours additional to devote daily to the duties of inspection, they would be able to get a much larger amount of systematic house-to-house inspection done than had been possible on the previous system. It was calculated, indeed, that not only would each of the acting inspectors be able to look more thoroughly than he had hitherto done after the nuisances arising in his district, but that he would be able to report also on the condition of at least a hundred houses weekly, instead of only about thirty. The results of the year's work have borne testimony to the judicious character of these changes. Gearing, who was appointed to do office work, found ample occupation in the duties of his office; and the other three inspectors, released from that portion of their labours, were enabled to do between them a very much larger amount of house-to-house inspections than four inspectors working on the old system had been able to accomplish. After much deliberation it was determined by the Vestry, in the coarse of the year, to bring the Parish under the operation of the 35th clause of the Sanitary Act, 1866, a course which had already been taken, with more or less success, in several of the Metropolitan Parishes. I here quote the clause :— "On application to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secre"taries of State by the Nuisance Authority of the City of "London, or any district or parish included within the Act "for the better local government of the Metropolis, or of "any Municipal Borough, or of any place under the Local "Government Act, 1858, or any Local Improvement Act, or "of any city or town containing, according to the census 45 "for the time being in force, a population of not less than "five thousand inhabitants, the Secretary of State may, as "he may think fit, by notice to be published in the London "Gazette, declare the following enactment to be in force in "the district of such nuisance authority, and from and after "the publication of such notice the nuisance authority shall "be empowered to make regulations for the following matters, "that is to say :— "1.—For fixing the number of persons who may occupy "a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or "occupied by members of more than one family : "2.—For the registration of houses thus let or occupied " in lodgings : "3.—For the inspection of such houses, and the keeping " the same in a cleanly and wholesome state : "4.—For enforcing therein the provision of privy accom" modation, and other appliances and means of cleanliness, in "proportion to the number of lodgings and occupiers, and "the cleansing and ventilation of the common passages and "staircases : "5.—For the cleansing and lime-whiting at stated times of such premises : "The nuisance authority may provide for the enforcement "of the above regulations by penalties not exceeding forty "shillings for any one offence, with an additional penalty not "exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which a "default in obeying such regulations may continue; but "such regulations shall not be of any validity unless and "until they shall have been confirmed by the Secretary "of State : 46 "But this section shall not apply to common lodging "houses within the provisions of the Common Lodging " House Act, 1851, or any act amending the same." A series of regulations (see Appendix) was drawn up in accordance with this clause, and having been approved of by the Vestry, was submitted to the Home Secretary, and by him declared to be in force in the Parish of Camberwell, from and after the latter part of last year. The new responsibilities thus assumed by the Vestry are very important, and it was impossible at the beginning (indeed it is impossible even now) to estimate accurately the amount of work and the kind of work that it would need to bring the regulations into general and efficient operation. Hence it was determined to employ for a time an additional inspector, whose duties should be mainly to look after lodging houses, and to bring our regulations into systematic operation in regard to them. Mr. Fraser, who was already, in another capacity, in the employment of the Vestry, and who has since been appointed one of the staff of Sanitary Inspectors, was selected for this purpose; and from the time of his appointment (early in November) up to the 25th March, he has reported with all necessary ■detail on 524 lodging-houses, which were subsequently put upon the register; serving 354 notices on owners and occupiers, and distributing 1,858 cards and copies of regulations. But other duties also were assigned to him, one being the visitation of workshops under the Workshop Regulation Act; the other being the suppression of certain disorderly houses. His visitations extended to 108 workshops (to discover which about 900 shops were visited), 47 and he was instrumental in suppressing 8 disorderly houses (of which one had to be cleared twice). The epidemic prevalence of Small-pox in the East of London, in the latter part of the year 1870, and its subsequent dissemination throughout the Metropolis, made it essential that steps should be taken here to arrest its progress as far as possible. It is a well-known fact in medicine that there are certain contagious febrile diseases of limited duration, which, as a rule, occur only once in a lifetime, or in regard to which an attack is in a very high degree protective against any subsequent attack. It is not pretended that every person, who has suffered from an attack of one of these diseases, never under any circumstances suffers from a second attack of the same disease; for it is quite certain that now and then the same person has one of these affections two or three, or even a larger number of times, and perhaps dies of his last attack, and that there is, in every case, a tendency for the protective influence to diminish in some degree with the lapse of years; but it is thoroughly well established that the great majority of persons who have had one attack of one of the diseases referred to never do (however much they may be exposed to its contagion) experience a second attack; and that of the comparatively small number of persons who have the disease a second time, the great bulk have it then in a mild or modified form. The more important of the diseases here referred to are—typhus fever, scarlet fever, measles, small-pox, chicken-pox, and hooping cough. It is Jenner's great merit to have proved that the 48 inoculation of cow-pox (vaccination) has precisely the same protective influence in respect of small-pox that a previous attack of small-pox has : that, taking any number of persons who have just had an attack of small-pox, and an equal number of persons who have just been successfully vaccinated, the chances of escape from subsequent attacks of small-pox are equal for each group. It will be seen by collating the above statements of facts that it follows, that while a single successful vaccination is protective in a very high degree against small-pox, it cannot be expected to give perfect immunity in all cases; and that the immunity which it does afford tends in a greater or less degree to lessen as years progress; but that, nevertheless, of the comparatively small number of vaccinated persons who contract small-pox, by far the larger proportion have it in the form of a very slight and (so far as they are personally concerned) unimportant ailment. It has been proved, however, by the most ample experience that vaccination may be made almost absolutely protective, if it be repeated at the time, or from time to time, when its protective power is undergoing diminution. By repeated vaccination the nurses at the Small-pox Hospital have, ever since the foundation of the hospital, been preserved from small-pox; and by the same method, even during the present epidemic, the progress of the disease has been at once arrested when it has found an occasional entrance into any of the general hospitals of the metropolis. It is believed now by those who have given most attention to the subject, that a second vaccination 49 about the period of puberty is all (putting out of the question a certain small number of exceptional cases) that is really needed to protect a person for life. This is very likely true; but it is obvious that trustworthy statistics in reference to this point must be very difficult to obtain; and meanwhile I suspect that it is on the whole wise, notwithstanding a second successful vaccination at puberty, to submit to further vaccination if some years after that period there should be, or should threaten to be, special exposure to the small-pox poison. I have used the term successful vaccination more than once, and I have used it advisedly; because it is not sufficient that the operation of vaccination should be performed, but it is essential that some visible result should follow the operation. It is no proof that a person operated upon is insusceptible of cow-pox or of small-pox, when the puncture made with the lancet dies away like the ordinary prick of a pin—it is simply a proof either that the lymph has lost its virtue, or that from bleeding or some other cause it has failed to become lodged in the substance of the skin. Under such circumstances the operation should be repeated, and if necessary repeated again.* The present epidemic of small-pox, while it proves conclusively that the great majority of persons living in the Metropolis are fully protected by vaccination (other - * Let me add the fact, that the latent period of small-pox is longer than the time which intervenes between the performance of vaccination and the ripening of the pock which results; and that it is therefore possible for a person who has already caught small-pox to be vaccinated and to have at the proper time a well-developed pock, and within a day or two afterwards a severe attack of small-pox. 50 wise, looking to the very small number of porsons among us who have previously had small-pox, it would have spread among us with the rapidity and the violence of a plague), proves equally conclusively that there is a considerable percentage of persons who are insufficiently, or not at all, protected, of whom some have never been successfully vaccinated and some have never been vaccinated at all, who constitute the pabulum on which the epidemic feeds. The duties of parishes in reference to small-pox are divided between the Boards of Guardians and the Batch7-0169 Vestries. Boards of Guardians are responsible for carrying out all laws relating to vaccination; Vestries are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the various sanitary acts. I trust I shall not be deemed impertinent when 1 say that, to the best of my belief, the Guardians of the parish have done their share of these duties with zeal and liberality, and considerable success, and that there has been cordial and useful co-operation between their officials and those of the Vestry. The following are the measures which, up to March 25th of the year, have been taken by the Vestry in reference to small-pox:— (1.) A handbill was printed and extensively circulated pointing out in a few words the impending danger of an epidemic of small-pox, the chief causes of that danger, and the necessity of efficient vaccination. (See appendix.) (2.) Another handbill (a reprint, with slight modifications, of one published in the appendix to my last report) entitled "Measures to be adopted against the spread of Fevers," was also printed and largely distributed. 51 (3.) The Board of Guardians communicated with all the medical men in the Parish early in the year, requesting them to give the Board immediate information of the occurrence of small pox in any locality; and the information thus obtained has been since that time placed at the disposal of the officers of the Vestry. (4.) For a short time each inspector, in his own district, looked after the houses in which small-pox was ascertained to have occurred; but it was very soon felt to be injudicious to compel the same man to visit small-pox cases habitually, and to perform at the same time ordinary house-to-house inspection, and hence, on the 14th February, 1871, Cooper was removed from his ordinary work of inspection, and directed to give his whole attention to the duties connected with small-pox. These duties were to call periodically at all houses in which it was known that small-pox was prevailing, to advise with regard to vaccination, isolation of the sick and disinfection, to take steps (in connection with the Guardians) in reference to the removal of patients to hospital, and in reference to the removal and burial of the dead, to provide disinfectants, and to enforce, especially where the small-pox had subsided, and if need were to superintend, the cleansing, lime-whiting and disinfecting of premises, and the disinfecting or the destruction of infected clothes and bedding, and to see further that infected clothes and bedding were not illegally transmitted from place to place, and tha. houses empty after small-pox were not let before they had been sufficiently disinfected. (5.) On the 1st of March the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Sewers and Sanitary Committee, gave their 52 sanction to the erection of a disinfecting apparatus, thereby carrying out the 23rd section of the Sanitary Act of 1866. (6.) And shortly afterwards the Burial Board ordered the mortuary, which had been previously erected in the Forest Hill Cemetery, to be altered so as to be applicable to the purposes referred to in the 27th section of the same Act. (7.) Early in 1871,I put myself into communication with the Managers of the parochial and charity schools, and some of the private schools of the parish, and obtained from nearly all of them permission to have the children attendant at these schools inspected by the district vaccinators, in order that those among them who had not been vaccinated, or had been insufficiently vaccinated, might be vaccinated, and that those who having been successfully vaccinated in infancy had attained the age of 9 or 10 and upwards, might, if it were thought desirable, be re-vaccinated. This measure gave, I believe, a large impulse to vaccination, and was instrumental in raising the vaccinations by the Public Vaccinators in the quarter ending March 25th to the large number of 6,607, of which 1,590 were primary,, 5,017 re-vaccinations. Among the nuisances grouped together in the table as "Miscellaneous Nuisances," was one of sufficient importance to be put on separate record. It was the nuisance caused upon the space of ground occupying the angle between the trunk of the Grand Surrey Canal and its Peckham branch, by the formation there of three dust shoots—that of the Newington Vestry, that of Mr, Lipscomb, and that of Mr. Reed. The Newington Vestry had taken their plot of ground 53 for the purpose of depositing and sifting upon it the dust of their parish in the latter part of 1868; so that at the time proceedings were taken against them they had been carrying on operations there more than a year and a half; Reed had begun depositing and sifting the dust of some other South London parish on an adjoining plot about 3 months before proceedings were commenced: and Lipscomb, the Camberwell contractor, had begun to do similarly for the Camberwell dust on another adjoining plot of ground 6 or 8 weeks subsequently to Reed. At the time when it was decided to put an end, if possible, to these nuisances (the beginning of June, 1870), about 60 cartloads (in round numbers) of dust were being deposited daily, about 30 women were engaged in sifting, and huge accumulations of sifted and unsifted dust covered the whole space. The nuisance, which had been serious when created by the Parish of Newington alone, was now multiplied threefold, and had become unbearable to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood; and, moreover, threatened to increase rather than diminish. With reference to the proceedings taken by the Vestry, it is scarcely necessary to say more than that they were essentially successful. The Vestry was supported by the evidence of persons living on the spot, by that of several of the local general practitioners, and especially by the valuable evidence of Drs. Aldis, Druitt, and Letheby; and Mr. Woolrych, after having himself inspected the locality in question, made an order upon all three defendants requiring them to abate the nuisance, and to remove all existing accumulations. Various practical difficulties arose 54 to prevent the immediate and complete carrying out of the Magistrate's order, but, nevertheless, within a very short time the nuisance was, to a considerable extent, abated, and by the 25th March, Lipscomb and Reed's premises had ceased to be shoots for dust, or the seat of dust-sifting; and the Newington plot of ground, though still remaining a dust-shoot, only remains a dust-shoot pending the completion of certain works which are in progress in their own parish, and which will have the effect of rendering their dust-shoot in our parish needless for them. I cannot conclude this report without again returning my thanks to the Vestry and to the Committee with which my duties are specially connected, for the kindness which during the past year I have, without intermission, received from them; nor without offering a tribute of sincere respect to Mr. Gearing, who now, after many years' service (owing, I regret to say, to failing health and advancing age), retires from the post of Sanitary Inspector, which he has filled, to the best of my judgment, with singular zeal, ability, straightforwardness, and tact. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. S. BRISTOWE. APPENDIX No. 1.

APPENDIX No. 2. SMALL POX. This disease is now very prevalent in London, and is spreading. Its spread is due mainly to Three causes:— 1st.—Total neglect of Vaccination, 2nd.—Imperfect Vaccination, and 3rd.—Non-renewal of Vaccination after the protective power of the operation has died out. Persons perfectly protected by Vaccination rarely take Small Pox, and when they take it, have it as a rule, mildly, those, on the other hand, who are insufficiently or not at all protected, catch the disease readily, have it severely, and often die of it. The Inhabitants of Camberwell are therefore cautioned to see that in their own persons, in the persons of the members of their households, and in the persons of others over whom they have control, efficient protection from Small Pox is as far as possible secured; and to this end, it is specially advised:— 1st.—That all young children, and others who have not yet been Vaccinated, be at once Vaccinated, either by their own Medical Attendant or by the Public Vaccinator: 2nd.—That all persons who have been Vaccinated, but in whom the scars are Invisible or Indistinct, be re-vaccinated: 3rd.—That all persons whose last Vaccination Dates upwards op Seven Years Back, be re-vaccinated: and 60 4th.—That all persons who shall be Vaccinated appear on the Eighth day after the operation before their Vaccinator, in order that the sufficiency or insufficiency of the operation may be authoritatively determined.

Giles, Camberwell, in the County of Surrey, have examined and audited the foregoing Accounts of the Vestry of the said Parish, from the 26th day of March, 1870, and the items therein comprised, and having found such Accounts correct, do now sign the same, in token of our allowance thereof; and we have appended to such Accounts a Summary Statement of the Moneys owing to, and the Debts and Liabilities owing by such Vestry. Dated this 9th day of May, 1871, and continued by adjournment until the 19th June, 1871. Wm. F. Carey, Wm. H. Elliot, Peter Fawcett, Walter Lean, Richard Keen. Auditors of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. 1ll auditors report, We have to report that the Rate Books of the following Wards were in order, viz., Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, and Dulwieh; that belonging to Ward No. 3 had the figures in several cases entered in pencil only; while in the book belongingto the Ward No. 1, several amounts which had been received were entered as " empties" or " amounts not recoverable exclusive of empties or legally excused. On calling the attention of the Collector to the same, heacknowledged his errors in the posting of the Rate Book, and has since paid the money (£6 7s. lOd.) into the Bank to the credit of the Vestry, We would call the attention of the Collectors to the fact that we should have been materially assisted in verifying the amount carried forward as arrears, if they had, in all cases where the rates were not received nntil after the Rate Books had been closed entered on the counterfoil in the receipt-book the date of payment. Having ascertained from the books that there were no entries of the fees received for summonses and distress warrants, we made enquiries and found that the issuing of summonses was left in the hands of the Collectors. We think this system very objectionable, inasmuch as it leads, 112 to a temptation to the Collectors to use the summonses as a second intimation that the rates are due. We would suggest that the Collectors should hand over their books to the Assistant-Overseer, at a date to be fixed by the Vestry, before the collection for the next quarter has commenced, and that the issuing of summonses should be left in his hands, and he should be empowered to employ the necessary assistance for the service of the summonses, and that the arrears should be paid to him, the costs of summonses being appropriated towards the payment of the interest on the money borrowed by the Vestry. We have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the neatness and accuracy of the books kept by Mr. Beery, also to the courtesy he has always shown us during the 21 nights we have been engaged on the audit of the accounts.

With respect to the Aged Parishioners' Grant, your Committee retained the same Pensioners as the year previously, except in cases of death, removal, or any circumstances of a peculiar nature, and by means of the increased amount paid to them by the Trustees of the Charity Estates, they were enabled to increase the Grant to a few of the old Pensioners who were in the receipt of very small amounts monthly, and also to increase the number by the addition of other Recipients. With respect to the Samaritan Fund, your Committee resolved that each Distributor should receive £15 instead of £10 as last year to distribute in his district, thus 193 ing the benefit to several more poor persons than they were enabled to do last year. In every case the Distributors have personally visited the Aged Parishioners, and paid the Pensions awarded to them, at their own homes, thus enabling them to take care that the money was given to persons of a deserving character, and preventing any fraud or abuse of the Funds entrusted to them to distribute. The cases of the applicants for relief from the Samaritan Fund, numbering 406, were all carefully investigated, and your Committee believe that the most deserving cases were selected as recipients of the Charity, they being all, as in the case of the aged Parishioners Grant, personally visited and carefully inquired into by the Distributors in whose District the cases were situated, and your Committee are enabled to congratulate the Vestry on the fact that the system adopted by the Vestry for the last two years has been attended by an improved mode of the distribution of the Funds, and has conferred great benefit on many poor and deserving persons in the parish. In conclusion your Committee beg to inform the Vestry, that the Register of Recipients of the Charity under the different heads is completed to the end of the year, and is now laid on the table, or it can be inspected at the Vestry Clerk's Office, by any Member of the Vestry, or by the Ratepayers during the usual hours of business. All which is respectfully submitted to the Vestry. The foregoing Accounts have been examined and found correct by us. W. F. Carey, Auditors of Wm. Hy.
