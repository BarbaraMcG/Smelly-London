I have pleasure in. presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1969, which includes the Annual Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector, This Report is compiled in accordance with the Public Health Regulations 1959. There were no significant changes or- developments affecting the work of the Public Health Department during the year, but two matters of general topical interest are worthy of mention. First is the concern which has been felt thaT everything possible is not being done to prevent the spread of tuberculosis other infectious diseases among and by immigrants from countries where infections are more prevalent and housing standards and other preventive measures less satisfactory, than in this country., Some members of the Council may recall that , as long ago as 1956, when Hungarian refugees were brought from London Airport to Grange Farm in large numbers I tried to establish routine health checks as they arrived, but. Government approval was withheld,, Notwithstanding the upsurge of immigration since that time, there is still no routine X-ray, testing or immunisation on arrival in this country, and of the 2 .,000 annual deaths in the United Kingdom from tuberculosis, as many as 20% are diagnosed for the first time at Coroners' postmortem examinationsÂ® Only one X-ray unit has been installed (at London Airport). Some immigrants are advised at the airports to report for a health check after reaching their final destination, but this is not often done,, Although this District is not much affected at present, a number of students from overseas do enrol at Loughton College of Further Education, and efforts are made to ensure that they, as well as other new arrivals from abroad, are notified to the Local Health Authority and visited, The Mass X-ray surveys of the general public, as shown elsewhere in this report, are no longer producing worthwhile resuIts, and more cases of tuberculosis are likely to be discovered ana brought to treatment, by concentrating attention on the special groups such as the immigrant population. The second matter of general interest is the official action taken by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Circular 80/69) to ensure that any asbestos waste disposed of does not present a danger to public health. It has been known for many years that inhaling of asbestos dust or fibres can cause scarring of the lungs leading to cancer many years later, and great care is taken to protect workers in the industry from this hazard. The growth in the uses ol this unique material over the past fifty years has resulted in its becoming a fairly common pollutant of man's environment, Although the quantities and risks of inhalation by the general public are exceedingly small, /it -3- it is clearly prudent to reduce to an absolute minimum the existence of stray fibres. The establishment of a Research Council and an agreed code of practice to ensure that no dust is emitted during transport and tipping of asbestos is therefore to be welcomed. VITAL STATISTICS The birth-rate continues to fall, and is now only 11.0 per thousand of the population (adjusted) as compared with the average rate of 16.3 for England and Wales. The death rate (adjusted) at 11.7 per thousand remains unchanged, and very close to the average for England and Wales which was 11.9; there were however some changes in distribution of the causes of death-more from diseases of the lungs being balanced by small but welcome reductions in deaths from heart disease and from accidents. Although the number of live births (554) exceeded the number of deaths (52.0) by 34, the estimated mid-year resident population of the District fell from the previous year's figure of 56,350 to 56,030, indicating a small excess of residents moving out of the District over the numbers of those moving in. CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES There were no major outbreale during the year, and no deaths from the notifiable infectious diseases. The number of immunisations performed was generally lower than in the previous year, but this was anticipated and due largely to a recent change of policy whereby immunisation of infants has been deliberately postponed to provide greater safety and better results, SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 AND 1962 No formal action was considered necessary during the year. 14 cases in possible need of care and attention were investigated and kept under observation with the services of the district nurse, health visitor, home help, meals-on-wheels, as necessary. Subsequently, 2 cases were voluntarily removed to hospital. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF I examined 35 officers and staff of the Council on appointment for duties in the District; also 9 employees were assessed and reported on for sick-pay and superannuation purposes, following prolonged periods of sick-leave or retirement. RE-HOUSING -4- RE-HOUSING PRIORITY ON MEDICAL GROUNDS 127 requests for priority for re-housing on medical grounds wen referred to me for assessment, usually supported by a doctor's written certificate. Each case was fully investigated and my recommendations were as follows:- Diseases or Conditions Total Applicants Priority Recommended Priority Not recommended Asthma, bronchitis, catarrhal diseases etc. 33 14 19 Blood pressure 5 4 1 Heart disease 8 7 1 Nervous disease (Anxiety states, neurasthenia, neurosis etc.) 35 10 25 Rheumatism 17 10 7 Tuberculosis 1 1 0 Other diseases 4 3 1 Other conditions 24 13 11 127 62 65 Figures for 1965 were 89 46 43 " " 1966 " 90 46 44 " " 1967 " 111 61 50 " " 1968 " 105 65 40 The 65 applicants not recommended for medical priority include (1) Illness not aggravated by housing conditions5; (2) Temporary indispositions; (3) Those pleading the discomforts of" overcrowding and structural defects (i8e. grounds other than medical); (4) Repeated requests already assessed. Finally, I would again like to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. To all who have provided me with statistical and other information for inclusion in this report, my grateful acknowledgements are also made. H. FRANKS,M.B.,B.S.,B.Hy.,D.P.H.

In addition to the above, child health clinics are also held at the following:- CHIGWELL: St. Winifred's Hallj, Manor Road. All. Saints House. Chigwell Row. LOUGHTON: St. Michael's Church Hall, Roding Road, /SCHOOL -14- SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE: The following extracts from the Annual Report of the Divisional School Medical Officer for the West Essex Division are of interest:- "Handicapped Pupils; A welcome new trend during the past year has been the decision of the Education Committee to extend the powers granted under the Education Act 1944 to pay the fees of a number of children, under 5 years of age who on medical grounds, have been recommended for admission to selected privately run playgroups, registered in accordance with the requirements of the Nurseries and Child Minders Regulations Act 1948 (as amended by Section 60 of the Health Services and Publir Health Act 19681). The children so recommended are those that are considered to be mentally or physically retarded and would benefit from association with other children in a group setting to prepare them for entry to ordinary school at the age of 5 years. During the year, 24 children were recommended for placement in nursery playgroups. Special Schools: There are 3 Countv Council special schools in the West Essex Division, all of which are residential. Hassobury, near Bishop's Stortford and Chigwell High View provide places for educationally subnormal girls and boys Nazeing Park has places for maladjusted children. St. Lukes School, a day school for slow learners, was opened early in 1969. By the end of the year there were 86 pupils aged between 7 and 13 years in attendance. Some children living in West Essex attend day special schools in neighbouring area:- Specialist Services: The North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board continued to provide orthopaedic, physiotherapy, orthoptic and ophthalmic services at the clinic at Loughton Hall, and ophthalmic services at Epping Clinic. School Dental Service: Mr. French, Area Dental Officer, reports- "The staffing situation has benefited from the appointment of a dental auxiliary based at Loughton Hall Clinic, and since this is a new appointment it might be helpful if I outlined the duties -15- /of of such a person. A dental auxiliary is a lady who has had a 2 year training in performing simple types of treatment for children. She has to pass a qualifying examination at the end of her training and is then able to work only in the hospital services or the Local Authority dental services. The work she can perform is strictly defined, and she must work under the direction of a dental officer. The dental officer has to examine each patient, and will instruct the dental auxiliary to perform simple aspects of treatment. The dental officer will also check each patient after the dental auxiliary has completed her work. It can therefore be seen that the dental officer is always responsible for the patient's treatment, and that a dental auxiliary by carrying out the simpler types of treatment can leave the dental officer more time for the more complicated types of treatment. The dental auxiliary at Loughton Hall clinic is a popular member of the staff and well liked by the patients. As mentioned in last year's report, the Dental Health Education prograrrme has been continued and expanded during 1969. Follow-up talks, which are so important in keeping the rules of dental health in children's minds, have taken place in all the primary schools in the Chigwell Urban District,, and the full Dental Health Exhibition has been taken to primary schools in the Waltham Abbey and Ongar areas. At the requests of teachers, talks and film shows have also been given to some secondary school children at Dunmow Secondary School, Fyfield Residential School, and West Hatch Technical High School." Infectious Diseases: Apart from respiratory afflictions there are now only 2 well recognised infections which still cause troublesome epidemics in schools. These are dysentery and infective jaundice. The organisms of both conditions are found in the bowel, and spread from child to child by transference of infection to the mouth from contaminated hands. Theoretically., good hand washing should prevent both diseases but even, in the best equipped school such a degree of hygiene is difficult to achieve. In spite of this it is always possible to put a speedy end to dysentry by using additional measures. Jaundice is more difficult to control. Health Educations: Until 1969 only 2 secondary schools made regular requests for health education. In recent months however there has been an increasing awareness of the need for health education and help is being sought by both secondary and primary schools. I gave a brief review of the situation in my report for 1968. There is /little -16- little to add to this except to mention that while the value of this teaching is recognised there is little prospect that either medical officers or health visitors will be able to devote more time to it than they do at presento School Nursing Service; Mrs. Reading, Superintendent Health Visitor, has kindly prepared the following report "A year has now passed since the re-organisation of the School Health Service. A re-organisation which included the introduction of audiometer tests for all school entrantsyearly vision testing of all school children, colour vision testing for 10 year old boys and selective school medicals for the 8-9 year and 12-13 year old age groups-all of which has involved the School Nursing Service in a considerable amount of additional work. It is I feel to the nursing staff's credit that returns of work show much of this work to have been undertaken-without any additional staff increase. Child Guidance Service: Dr. Waldman. Consultant Psychiatrist-Loughton, writes 'As regards Loughton Child Guidance Clinic, the following are the salient features of our activities over the past year:- (1) As regards 2 major developments-(a) being regarded as an autonomous clinic and (b) moving to new premises, we have been largely marking time, awaiting developments on administration and planning levels. (2) Clinically we have continued to benefit by having a full clinic team including a psychotherapist. This has enabled us better to handle the matter of training students who continue to be sent to us from Barking and Stevenage Colleges of Education (Certificate of Social Work Course and Child Care Course). (3)There are 2 particular areas which have received special attention-(a) co-ordination with other Services, particularly Child Care, Probation Service and other County Social Agencies, partly with a view to improving our communication structure and partly with a view to the setting up of a multi-disciplinary group with the particular dynamic slant which our therapist would be capable of bringing to such a /group,-17- group, and (b) assist in the development of a youth consultation service, partly in association with a voluntary group which has been engaged for some years in the setting up of such a service. In the light of how this develops, it may be that various Authoritiesthe North East Regional Hospital Board and the local Education and Health Authorities, would be approached with a view to such a service being formally staffed. As regards our day to day functioning, the growing awareness of the service which we have to offer to the community and the decreasing stigma on attendance, has meant a corresponding demand on the services over the past year.' School Psychological Service: Miss Piper, Educational Psychologist reports as follows:"Special Schools and Units. The number on the roll at St. Lukes day E.S.N. school has risen from 42 in January 1969 to 86 in January 1970. A fortnightly case conference has been established, attended by the teaching staff, the School Medical Officer and the Psychologist. New entrants are admitted at the beginning of each term, the order of priority being decided by an admissions committee convened by the Divisional Education Officer. The Hereward Special Class continues to take emotionally disturbed children of junior school age. At the secondary stage there is no day provision for children leaving the Hereward Special Class. Woodcroft School is now officially recognised by the Department of Education and Science as an independent day school for 24 educationally subnormal children with additional handicaps, of nursery or infant age. At present there are 10 children between the ages of 5 and 7 attending full-time and 2 attending part-time, from West Essex. In the absence of a Local Authority special class for emotionally disturbed children of infant age, the number of referrals to Woodcroft is increasing. It is hoped that 2 more classes, 1 for infants and 1 for children over 11, may eventually be established to complete the provision started by the opening of the Hereward Special Class. High View School, for senior E.S.N. boys, continues to take a high proportion of disturbed boys, and there is clearly a need for psychiatric time to be made available to the school. It is hoped that a move in this direction can be made during 1970." /HOME -18- HOWE NURSES: BUCKHURST HILL: Mrs. J. Turner, 55 Walnut Way (01-504-7689) Mr. H.

Windle Taylor, the Director of the Water Examination Department of the Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly supplied the following information regarding the water supply for the district:- â1. (a) The supply was satisfactory both as to (i) quality, and (ii) quantity throughout 1969. (b) All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine; after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilled; samples of water are then collected from these treated mains; and the mains are returned to service only after results are found to be satisfactory. The quality control from these laboratories is carried out by means of daily sampling from sourcea of supply, from the treatment works or well stations, from the distribution system, and through to the consumer. Any sign of contamination or any other abnormality is immediately investigated. (c) (i) The Board has no record of the number of structurally separate dwellings supplied in your area, but the population supplied direct according to the Registrar-Generalâs estimates at 30th June, 1969 was 56,030. (ii) No houses were permanently supplied by standpipe. (d) No artificial fluoride was added, and where the fluoride content is indicated in the analyses it represents the naturally occurring fluoride in the water. 2. (a) The supply was derived from the following works and pumping stations- Lee Bridge works and between May and September from Coppermills works. Well water from Chingford Mill, Ferry Lane and Waltham Abbey pumping stations. No new sources of supply were instituted and there were no changes to the general scheme of supply In your area. /The -22- The number of samples collected and the bacteriological and chemical analyses of the supply from the above sources after treatment are shown on the attached sheets. (b) On account of their hardness content and alkaline reaction the Boardâs river and well water supplies are not considered to be plumbo-solvent. It should, however, be appreciated that all types of water pick up varying amounts of metal from the material of water piping particularly when it is newly installed; this applies to copper, zinc, iron and also to lead. Surveys carried out between 1966 and 1968 on analyses or water from consumers' premises confirmed this statement, "Water Samples: (a) Average results of Chemical Examination.

DRANAGE, SEWERAGE AND PUBLIC CLEANSING. Mr. R.W. Edwards, C.Eng.M.I.C.E. ,M.I.Mun. E. ,A.M.B.I.M., Engineer and Surveyor , has kindly supplied the following information - (a) Drainage and Sewerages: The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough which was improved in 1938, was extended after the war and recently has been further improved with the addition of final effluent and storm water treatment lagoons. A scheme for a further extension has now been submitted to the Ministry consisting of more filters and humus tanks. A smaller part of th- District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works from whence the Council has now decided to lay a trunk sewer to take the flow to the Luxborough Lane Works, thereby eliminating the need for a second Disposal Works at Millers Lane. The completion of these improvements is expected to result in a continued high standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the Riving Roding. As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing foul flows from the new development, but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers which contribute to the flooding difficulties referred to below. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. These combined sewers have caused flooding at various points in the District and work has started on the laying of new surface water sewers to remove part of the flow from the combined sewers in South Loughton and Buckhurst Hill and thus from the Sewage Treatment Works. Schemes costing a total of Â£250,000 have been completed but there is still more work to be done. A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of the London Borough of Redbridge at Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme. Part of Clugwell Row drains to the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking. There are 5 outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. (b) Public Cleansing: Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of 7 compressing /type -25- type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a FREE service for removing bulky domestic articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. THIS FREE SERVICE CANNOT BE PUBLICISED TOO MUCH as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses, etc. into ditches or onto forest land or roadside verges. The new Civic Amenities Act will also be of help in combatting this problem and a trial refuse container has been installed in Borders Lane. Trade refuse also is collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse, the character of which is clearly not domestic. Until now, refuse has been disposed of by controlled tipping in Chigwell at a site leased to the Council. The refuse was covered with spoil, hardcore or other innocuous filling, and during tipping, only a very small surface of refuse remained uncovered. Measures were taken against flies etc., as necessary from time to time, but this rarely happened. As this tip is now full, further and more long term arrangements for refuse disposal have been made at great cost to the ratepayers because other possible controlled tip sites are not available within the District. Transportation of refuse in bulk to tips in outer Essex started in April, 1969 using 3 large bulk transporter vehicles and from the new Transfer Depot in Luxborough Lane. Salvage of paper continued to produce sales during the year. Trailers have been purchased for attachment to the refuse vehicles so that salvage can be better pre-separated before tipping. Nearly 5,000 road gullies in County and District roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine regularly during the year by contract. (c) Swimming Pool: The Council's new covered swimming pool was finished in the summer of .1968, and has had a very successful year, It is a real asset to the District, particularly for children and clubs, and the total number of users was 300,960 for the year's operation. /3. -26- a3. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1964. The riding establishments in the area have been inspected and Mr. H.E. Bywater,M.R.C.V.S.F.R.S.H reports as follows:- 'It is my pleasurable duty to present my annual report of the inspections made on the riding establishments in your area during the past year.
