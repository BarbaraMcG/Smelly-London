Public Health Department, Town Hall, Ealing, W. March 15th, 1915. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report (the fortieth) of the Sanitary and Health conditions of this Borough during the year 1914, with the usual vital statistics appertaining thereto, and I trust a consideration of these will prove that, on the whole, the general health state of the Borough during the year will be considered quite satisfactory. The general death rate remains at a favourable level, there is a greatly diminished infantile rate of mortality, but the birth rate is slightly lower. It will be seen that the Borough, with its acreage of 2,947 acres (with a density of population of about 24.1 to the acre) and a rateable value of £526,454, continues to make a steady increase of population, and to meet this increase a considerable addition has been made to the number of dwellings. At the middle of last year, it is calculated that 14,339 houses were in occupation. During the year 280 new houses have been passed for occupation, and of this number one was constructed as a flat, to accommodate six families, one for three families, and three were constructed to accommodate two families. This shows a reduction of new buildings of thirty-two compared with the previous 6 year. No building of large size has been erected, and the northern and western parts of the district received the larger proportion of the newly-erected dwellings. In former reports I have alluded to the question as to whether there is any marked deficiency of suitable residences for the working classes, and, on the whole, I am still of the opinion that there is no actual dearth of such, although, in a large number of instances, rents are considerably higher than the tenants are able to meet, without more or less difficulty. The municipal dwelling houses already existing are greatly appreciated, and afford satisfactory accommodation at reasonable rentals. The physical conditions of this Borough continue little unaltered, and I think no detailed remarks on this point are necessary. The main drainage, water supply, etc., continue as efficient as usual. Population* (71,300). I have estimated the population of this Borough for the past year at 71,300, and on this number the various vital statistics are calculated. The natural increase of population, viz., the excess of births over deaths, registered, was 581. Deaths. The total number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1914 was 566, and to this number must be added 123 residents whose deaths were registered outside the district, making a total of 689, but from this number must be deducted seventeen deaths of non-residents (transferred to their respective districts), making the actual total of deaths upon which to calculate the death rate, 672. This affords a death rate of 9.42 per 1,000, or one death in every 106.1 of the population compared with 111.2 for 1913. The same rate for England and Wales was 13.9 per 1,000, and for the ninety-seven large towns, including 7 London, of which we form a unit, was 14.6 per 1,000, and 145 smaller towns 12.8 per 1,000, while the death rate of London was 14.4, so that our own general death rate affords much satisfaction. The distribution of the deaths are as follows, for the separate wards, viz.:— In the Borough. Outside the Borough. Manor Ward 139 38 Lammas Ward 118 20 Grange Ward 86 25 Castlebar Ward 80 19 Mount Park Ward 68 8 Drayton Ward 58 13 Total 549 123 The causes and ages at death of our fatal cases are fully set forth in the official Table No. 3. In Table 1, it will be seen that fifty-six more deaths occurred than in the previous year, raising our death rate .5 above 1913. Cancer claimed eighty deaths, being seven more than in 1913, and giving a death rate of 1.12 per 1,000 of the population compared with 1.06 in 1913. Diarrhoea and Enteritis caused twelve deaths, being nine less than in 1913. Of the total number of these fatal cases, ten were of infants under one year of age. The occurrence of this class of disorder was favourably affected by the generally temperate climatic conditions of the summer season. Heart and lung diseases claimed many victims, especially among those in advanced life or of very early ages. Phthisis. There were thirty-six deaths recorded from Phthisis. This affords a death rate of .50 per 1,000 of the population, being .12 less in comparison with 1913. Visits are paid following notification when deemed expedient, and advice is tendered in the majority of cases, including those of contacts. 8 I have more than once mentioned that Ealing had been selected by the County as one of the areas for the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary. Good progress has been made, and ere long the establishment will be organised and in working order under the Tuberculosis Officer, Dr. F. R. B. Atkinson. There has been no difficulty or delay in obtaining the needful treatment for each patient when referred to this official, and there is no question that the earlier attention each patient receives and the precautionary measures adopted by patient and contacts will show beneficial results. Births. One thousand two hundred and thirty-four births (males, 593; females, 641) were registered in the Borough during the year, including twenty-nine illegitimate births, and to this number must be added nineteen outside births, making a total of 1,253 births (males, 603; and females, 650). This affords a birth rate of 17.5 per 1,000 of the population. In England and Wales the rate was 23.6, and in London 24.6. Our local birth rate for the past three years has declined from 20.6 in 1912, 18.3 in 1913, to 17.5 in 1914. A total of forty-five illegitimate births were recorded. recorded. The births are distributed in the various Wards as follows, viz. :— Males. Females. Total. Lammas 177 189 366 Manor 135 141 276 Drayton 70 83 153 Grange 89 77 166 Castlebar 77 97 174 Mount Park 45 54 99 Inward Transfers 10 9 19 Totals 603 650 1,253 No. of illegitimate births, 1914, 29 (males, 11; females, 18). 9 Marriages. Four hundred and sixty-nine marriages were celebrated in the Borough during the year. Notification of Infectious Diseases. There has been a considerable increase in the number of notifications received compared with 1913. Seven hundred and sixty-four were received, being an increase of 153 over the year 1913, and additional Scarlatina attacks were mainly responsible for this. Scarlatina has been prevalent more or less throughout the past year, but during the last four months of the year it became more rife, reaching, indeed, the proportions and character of an epidemic. The disease has been usually of a benign type, and only two deaths arose from it and its complications among our patients. The number of each class of infectious notifiable disease is clearly shown on Official Form. is clearly shown on Official Form, Table No. 2, and the cases are distributed in the various Wards as follows, viz. :— Disease.

Our Zymotic death rate equalled .43 per 1,000. The increase of knowledge, among certain classes, relative to the seriousness of Measles, has, I consider, led to much more care and attention being paid to the children attacked by this disorder, and its frequent dangerous complications are better recognised and treated. In all cases of Measles early medical attention should be sought. Of the total number of 765 notifiable cases, 475 were removed to the Isolation Hospital. Infantile Death Rate. Owing to favourable climatic conditions, there was a marked absence of epidemic summer Diarrhoea and allied disorders among young children, and we have the satisfactory low infantile death rate of 59.0. Much is being done to educate the mothers of infants with reference to the proper bringing-up of their little ones, and the good work accomplished by Mrs. Copeland the Sanitary Inspector, in connection with this important work, deserves great praise, and is, I feel sure, no mean factor in the preservation of infant life. It is gratifying to learn that, on the health visitor's re-visits, she finds her instructions and advice have been carefully attended to and acted upon. Isolation Hospital. This institution continues to be of valuable service for the reception of the majority of the notifiable infectious disorders, such as Scarlatina, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever. During the year 459 cases of Scarlatina (including forty-seven from Hanwell) and seventynine cases of Diphtheria (inclusive of nineteen from Hanwell, and one from Chiswick) received treatment, 11 and, in addition, four Enteric Fever patients were admitted. There were two deaths from Scarlatina, three from Diphtheria, and no fatal cases of Enteric Fever. Owing to the extensive outbreak of Scarlatina during the last quarter of the year, the resources of the Hospital were, for several weeks, severely tried, and the Contact Huts at Perivale proved very serviceable for the accommodation of Convalescents. This is the first occasion since the existence of the Hospital that the accommodation has not proved equal to the demands on it. During the year five additional bedrooms were added for nurses, who look for separate sleeping accommodation. The administration of the Hospital during a period of much difficulty reflected great credit on the Matron and staff. House to House Inspection. The Chief Sanitary Inspector's report on this important work gives such full details that it is unnecessary for me to do more than add a few comments. It will be shown by Mr. Hill's report that, although the full standard of efficient inspection was, as usual, carried out, it was impossible to attain the number of visits desired. This result was largely due to the exceptional number of visits which had to be paid to dwellings in connection with the occurrence of infectious disorders, more particularly during the last quarter of the year. The fact must not be overlooked that these visits comprise much more than mere inquiries concerning the cases of infection, but include inquiries and inspection regarding the sanitary arrangements of the dwellings, and where defects and nuisances are detected, these are immediately ordered to be remedied, so that a great deal of useful, if informal, sanitary work is accomplished. Notwithstanding certain delay in the work, a large portion of the older class of houses has been carefully visited, and improved. No house has had to be con- 12 demned, and no compulsory powers have been sought to enforce our sanitary requirements, so that it will be seen by reference to the Inspector's appended Returns, that a very large amount of useful and important work has been performed by the Public Health staff during the year. One hundred and ninety-five houses were inspected under the " Housing and Town Planning Act." Special inspection of premises were made on 882 occasions, and the re-inspections necessary to ascertain that the defects discovered were being remedied numbered 6,163, making a total of 7,045 visits. In addition to these must be added visits to premises where meat, fish, etc., are purveyed, to places under the Factory and Workshops Act, and to dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, making a total of 11,658 visits and inspections completed during the year. The following Table affords information of the sanitary defects discovered in the course of House- toHouse inspections:— STREETS. No. of Houses Inspected. Defective or Obstructed Drains.

The places included under this heading are fully set out in Mr. Hill's report. There are no factories of large size, but several dressmakers' workrooms in connection with large establishments exist, and are generally found in proper condition for their purpose. All defects or insanitary matters are at once remedied, and, generally, all these shops, workrooms, etc., are in a satisfactory condition. Regular supervision is continually exercised. When female labour alone is employed, the places are put in charge of the female Sanitary Inspector, who reports to me and the Chief Inspector. Mrs. Copeland's report on her duties connected with this work is appended. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. Very careful and systematic inspection of these places has been given throughout the year, and with one or two important alterations and improvements in certain dairies, their condition can be generally stated as quite adequate and suitable for their retail purposes. The greater portion of our milk supply is, of course, imported from country farms and dairies, and no fault has been discovered reflecting in any way upon the supply. It can safely be assumed that the business premises which are associated with the distribution of milk are all in a fit and proper condition. I reiterate my advice, that it is a prudent and reasonable prevention to bring all milk intended for drinking purposes, especially, to the boiling point for a single moment before it is consumed. When " Pasteurisation " is practicable that, of course, is a still more desirable practice. I may add that in no single instance have I been able to trace milk as a cause of disease. General Sanitary Administration. The Sanitary Inspector's report and appended Tables prove that, in the Public Health Department, 14 much activity has been shown in inspectorial work and the remedying of nuisances and sanitary defects. The general health conditions of the Borough throughout the year have not been unsatisfactory, as evidenced by a low death rate and greatly decreased infantile mortality. The School Clinic continues to carry out excellent work, which is reflected in an improved condition of health in many children, and must be widely evidenced as time goes on. Dr. Arthur, School Medical Inspector, speaks in very encouraging terms of the good results of the Clinic treatment. The Ealing Creche deserves support for useful work in its special direction. On the subject of matters coming under the Borough Surveyor's Department, so far as they may be said to concern the Public Health, nothing but praise can be given, and it is always pleasant to acknowledge this. The system of collection of house refuse is in itself a large undertaking most, satisfactorily carried out, and the ultimate destruction of this refuse in the Southern Works Destructor to the amount of 13,747 tons, in addition to 4,878 tons of pressed sludge last year, is evidence of the great call upon this department. At the Northern Works, 900 tons of pressed sludge were dealt with. It is contemplated, owing to the increase in the bulk of both house refuse and sludge, which tries the capacity of the works to their utmost, to add additional cells to the destructor. The sewage effluents from both North and South Works have maintained their high standard, as certified by Professor Kennood, but, in addition, samples of the effluent from the Northern Works are daily examined in the small laboratory attached to the Borough Surveyor's Department. Another improvement which should be noted, is the extension of the policy of laying 15 the carriageways of the Borough with an impervious surface. This practice mitigates to a very great extent the " dust nuisance," and tends to a decrease in the amount of slop and other detritus removed from the roads. This is a very important point when it is remembered that sites for shoots for road sweepings in this neighbourhood are becoming more difficult to obtain year by year. The flushing and ventilation of the sewerage systems have been well maintained. It now only remains for me to express my thanks to the Public Health Committee and the Council and its staff for their invariable help and support, and to acknowledge with much pleasure the energetic way in which the members of my department have carried out their important duties, and given me ready assistance at all times.

Patten, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of my work to December 31st, 1914. The number of my visits make a total of 2,124, namely :— To homes where births have occurred 1,859 To Workshops, Laundries (Factory and Workshop Act) where women are employed, and homes of outworkers 106 Visits, Public Health (Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908 and 1911) 103 Miscellaneous visits, and periodical visits to Women's Conveniences 56 Total 2,124 The visiting of the homes where births have occurred has been continued. The visits are well received and looked forward to, and the advice given is much appreciated. 22 Of the babies visited :— 80.0 per cent. were breast-fed; 14.3 per cent. were bottle-fed; 5.7 per cent. were partly breast-fed and partly bottle-fed. When visiting it was found that in sixty-four cases it was necessary to advise that the child should be taken to a doctor. On the whole, however, the babies were found to be in a healthy condition. Only a few mothers were found giving boiled bread and biscuits to very young babies. I am glad to say that I found fewer fathers out of work than in the previous year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum became compulsorily notifiable on April 1st, 1914. Since then, nine cases have been reported. These I have immediately visited. In February, 1914, one hundred mothers, with their babies, were invited to a tea held in the Longfield Hall. A very enjoyable time was spent, and the mothers very much appreciated the interest taken in them. Dr. Patten, the Medical Officer of Health, briefly addressed a few encouraging words to the mothers, and remarked upon the fine and healthy appearance of the babies. In April, the Victoria Hall Trustees increased the grant for milk for necessitous mothers from £5 to £10. This has enabled me to supply a larger number with milk. Forty-two mothers have been supplied with milk for varying periods, from two weeks to four months. This supply of milk has proved very beneficial ; for example, a mother with twins, who had three other children, and whose husband earned only £1 weekly, was allowed the milk for four months, and 23 was thus enabled to breast-feed both children satisfactorily. The mothers appear to be taking a far greater and more intelligent interest in the feeding, clothing, and care of their babies. I have also to thank Mrs. Dunnett, M.B., for the kindly interest which she takes in the welfare of the babies of Ealing. I have continued to visit the women and children under the Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908 and 1911. One hundred and three visits were made to the patients. On October 17th, the Tuberculosis Medical Officer of Health examined at the Town Hall twentyfive of the contacts; this necessitated a large number of visits being made. Overcrowding was found in two of the homes visited. In connection with the workshop inspection twentyeight defects were found. The workshops generally were found to be in a good condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, MABEL COPELAND, Sanitary Inspector. 24 CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. To His Worship the Mayor, the Aldermen, and Councillors of the Borough of Ealing. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting for your consideration my Annual Report of the work carried out in this department, in conjunction with the Medical Officer of Health, during the year ending December, 1914. As in previous years, I have tabulated a list of the sanitary defects remedied and other nuisances abated as the result of an inspection of premises, following either a verbal or written complaint, some of which were found to be somewhat of a minor character, and are sometimes considered trivial from a health point of view, although, in a large majority of cases, they constituted a nuisance under the Public Health Acts, hence the reason for immediate action to enforce a remedy. At times, owners and others regard them as being of no importance, and that no action, either of the Sanitary Inspector, or that of the Town Council, was necessary; in consequence, there is occasionally some delay in the execution of the work usually specified by an intimation notice. It is, however, somewhat encouraging to note that some owners appreciate the timely warning of minor matters in connection with their property, in preference to waiting the more serious developments; such persons recognise the true principle associated with the old saying, " Prevention is better than cure." During the year there were 168 complaints of various nuisances, of which thirty-nine were in respect 25 of non-removal of house refuse, which, together with all complaints of smells emanating from sewer ventilators, etc., were referred to the Borough Surveyor, whose department has control of all such ventilators and removal of house refuse. Each complaint was immediately and carefully investigated, and, where necessary, an intimation notice was sent to the person responsible for the abatement of the nuisance, and, in the event of non-compliance, the matter was reported to the Public Health Committee, and authority obtained to serve statutory notice, and which has had the desired effect. The works and matters attended to under this heading are classified as follows :— Storage water cisterns cleansed and covered 3 Draw taps fixed to main 6 Choked drains cleared and cleansed 31 Drains re-constructed 5 Drains repaired 6 Access chambers constructed 13 Disconnecting traps fixed to drains 7 Ventilating pipes fixed to drains 20 Rain water pipes disconnected from drains 4 New soil pipes fixed 4 New iron covers fixed to drains 13 Eaves gutters and down pipes renewed or repaired 15 New sinks and waste pipes 12 New w.c. pans fixed 17 Foul w.c. pans cleansed 6 New w.c. constructed 1 Light and ventilation provided to w.c. 1 W.C. supplied with water 1 Flush cisterns to w.c.'s renewed or repaired 26 Damp proof courses to house walls 13 Ventilation under floors provided 5 Surface of yards paved and drained 37 Floors repaired 12 Roofs repaired 11 Walls and ceilings repaired, stripped and cleansed 120 Dustbins supplied 22 Accumulations of refuse removed 21 Animals so kept as to be a nuisance 19 Windows made to open 3 Overcrowding abated 9 Bad smells from sewers attended to 3 Miscellaneous nuisances abated 45 Total 511 26 Inspections. The total number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 11,613 as compared with 13,246 in 1913, the decrease being largely due to the diversion of work of your Inspectors in connection with the outbreak of Scarlet Fever during the autumn part of the year, and the additional supervision necessary in connection with the sanitary works carried out, following the House-to-House and other inspections of the property dealt with during the year. The necessity for more frequent visits to premises during the progress of the works has been more marked than heretofore, in order to ensure that the works are carried out in such a manner as will prevent, for some time to come, a recurrence of the nuisance dealt with. The appended Table shows the number of inspections and re-inspections, made up as follows :— House-to-House Inspections 195 Inspections on Complaints 129 ,, following cases of Infectious Disease 753 under Daries, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order 165 „ under Factories and Workshops Act 261 „ Meat, Fish. Fruit, etc 3,539 „ (quarterly) Slaughter-houses 20 Premises inspected periodically 433 Re-inspections of premises during progress of works 6,163 11,658 House-to-House Inspections under the Housing and Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. The following tabular statement shows the particulars of the various nuisances dealt with in connection with this important part of the Public Health work. 27 It will be seen that, in a large majority of houses inspected, there was the absence of an efficient horizontal damp-proof course in the external walls of the house, also a vertical damp-proof course to the external surface of the walls, which, in consequence, has been the cause of a considerable amount of damp showing on the internal surface of the said walls, and as I have pointed out previously, such work entails a great amount of expense, therefore, very careful consideration is gives to this branch of work, not only in giving special attention to the work while in progress, but in every decision when ordering such work to be carried out, as in some instanoes we have found the damp due to other causes than the want of a damp-proof course. The most regrettable part of this business is that the property is often in the hands of persons of rather poor circumstances, who have very little means of a livelihood other than the rent of a house, or perhaps two. In this respect, local authorities have to consider one important point, and that is, whether the house is in every respect reasonably fit for human habitation ; if the answer is in the negative, then it is the duty of the local authority to see that it is put into a condition, in all respects, reasonably fit, for it has often been said, " It is not the prosperity of the owner that must receive first consideration, but the health of the inhabitants." During the year, and under the above heading, there were 195 houses inspected, and 1,613 nuisances discovered. Of the number of houses so inspected four have been demolished, also two other houses, which were left in abeyance since 1913. There were no closing orders issued for this purpose; the owners voluntarily pulled them down following the service of statutory notices to carry out, in three instances, very extensive structural repairs. The houses were let at a weekly rent of five shillings, and one at four shillings and sixpence. 28 Ispections and RE-inspections following Notifications of Infectious Diseases. In consequence of the increased number of cases of Infectious Diseases, 1,910 visits and re-visits were paid to premises in conjunction with the Medical Officer of Health, where one or other of the notifiable diseases occurred. Much time and attention was required in dealing with the epidemic of Scarlet Fever during the autumn, in order, as far as practicable, to prevent the spread of the disease. For some time, inspections in other directions were impracticable in consequence. It may not be considered out of place to briefly mention here the work in dealing with a case of Infectious Disease. On the receipt of an intimation of a case, either by telephone, notification form sent by post, or delivered by hand, the particulars of the notification, if the patient is recommended for removal to the Isolation Hospital, are at once telephoned to the Matron, and instructions are given to the ambulance driver to proceed to the Hospital forthwith. An Inspector visits the home of the patient and obtains, as far as they can be ascertained, the particulars as to the date of attack, last at work or school, the school attended or place of work, list of other inmates in the house, schools attended, occupations and places of work, milk and water supply, library books, laundry, dates of recent visits to other houses, suspected source of infection. Arrangements are made for the disinfection of the room or rooms, bedding, clothing, etc. Intimations are sent to the dairymen, laundry, schools, library, employers of contacts, and to the owner of the house in respect of any nuisance he may be responsible for. Where there are proper means of isolation of the patient at home, and it has been decided and arranged for by the medical attendant, instructions are given in respect of the precautions to be taken, the use of 29 all utensils, waste food, infected linen, etc., books and papers, the use of disinfectants, and a disinfected wet sheet hung over the outsde of the door of the patient's room, although such instructions are usually given by the doctor attending the patient. Disinfection of bedding, clothing, etc., is carried out by this department at intervals during the patient's illness, when requested to do so, and, finally, on the receipt of an intimation from the medical attendant, stating that, in his opinion, the patient is free from infection. The Table showing the sanitary defects discovered and other matters attended to in connection with infectious disease, I herewith append :— Walls and ceilings stripped and cleansed 274 Drains reconstructed 12 Drains repaired 6 Access chambers constructed 17 New iron eovers to access chambers 7 New ventilating pipes to drains 31 Intercepting traps fixed to drains 6 New soil pipes fixed 8 Eaves, gutters, and down pipes renewed or paired ... 10 New sinks and waste pipes 18 Drains cleared and cleansed . 9 Rain-water pipes disconnected from drains 3 New w.c. pans fixed 27 New flush cisterns to w.c.'s 14 Flush cisterns repaired 18 New w.c.'s constructed 6 W C. pans cleansed 1 Draw taps fixed to main 22 Covers to storage water cisterns 2 Yards paved and drained 62 Floors repaired ... 10 Damp-proof courses inserted in house walls 31 Ventilation under floors 12 Roofs repaired 14 New galvanized iron dustbins supplied 24 Animals so kept as to be a nuisance... ... ... 4 Accumulations of refuse removed 2 Windows made to open 2 Miscellaneous nuisances abated 47 Total number of rooms fumigated 740 Articles disinfected or destroyed 6,001 30 Improvements effected to Houses, including Sanitary Arrangements. The summary of the general sanitary work is given on Form III., which gives a fair idea of the matters that have engaged the attention of your Inspectors. During the year, sixty-eight obstructions were removed from the house drains, after which they were thoroughly flushed and cleansed. The smoke test was applied to twenty-two house drains, and six were exposed, under Section 41 of the Public Health Act, 1875. In all these cases special reports were made to the Public Health Committee, and instructions obtained in respect of same. The number of house drains reconstructed during the year was sixty-seven, and those repaired, or partially reconstructed, were fifty-one. Of these, nineteen were in respect of the combined system. In some instances, the drainage works were carried out following exposure of the original drain, with a view to carrying out some minor repairs, when it was found necessary to reconstruct the whole. In conjunction with these works, sixty-five intercepting traps were fixed, and 151 water-tight access chambers constructed, 218 soil pipes and ventilating pipes fixed, 163 new w.c. pans, and 113 flush cisterns to same either renewed or put into proper working order. Paving of Yards and other Causes of Damp. The paving and drainage of yards, passages, and areas, the want of efficent or repairs to eaves, gutters, and rain-water pipes, leaky roofs, and the damp walls of houses have, as heretofore, received special attention, as a nuisance arising from either of the above causes cannot fail to be an important factor in the cause of the insanitary condition of some of the dwelling-houses, and which may have an injurious effect on the health of the occupants. A properly paved and drained surface in connection with the dwelling-house is conducive to cleanliness, since there is less dirt and filth conveyed into the house, it encourages the housewife, and lessens the risk of contaminaton of foods bv 31 dust and flies. The old excuse for finding a heap of sludge or other offensive matter, swept off the unpaved surface into one corner of the yard, or against the back wall of the house, is no longer to be tolerated. The number of yards, passages, and areas paved during the year was 221. There were 171 eaves, gutters, and rain-water pipes partially renewed, eightyeight repairs to roofs, and 211 damp walls attended to. In some instances, it was found necessary to place both horizontal and vertical damp-proof courses to the walls, also re-point down the external surface of the house walls, as the jointing of the brick work was extremely bad. Factories and Workshops Act, 1901. The number of workshops on the Register, including bakehouses, is 216. These, on the whole, have been kept in a satisfactory condition. The usual visits have been paid, and a'l sanitary matters and cleansing were attended to without service of statutory .notices. The homes of all out-workers have been visited by the female Sanitary Inspector, and found to be kept in a satisfactory condition. The number of bakehouses on the Register is twenty-eight as against twenty-nine last year ; two bakehouses have been closed voluntarily, and one new one was opened during the year. The six underground bakehouses are still in use and have been kept in a satisfactory condition. The matters attended to during the year are as follows :— Walls and ceilings cleansed .. 22 New w.c. pan fixed ... ... ... ... ... 1 W.C. pans cleansed ... ... ... ... ... 20 Accumulations 2 Cover to storage water cisterns 1 Draw tap to main 1 New dustbin supplied ... ... ... ... ... 1 Floors repaired 3 Flush cisterns to w.c's. repaired 9 Stagnant water removed 1 Other nuisances 5 66 32 Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops. During the year four persons applied for registration in connection with the transferring of dairy businesses. The number of cowsheds in the Borough remain as heretofore, namely, five. These have been kept in good condition throughout the year. The number of cows kept during the year has been at times below 150, and these, to all external appearance, are in good condition. During the year, one large cowshed, the interior of which was re-mode'led and brought up to as near a model cowshed as was practicable to do so. The number of milkshops on the Register is fortyeight. These have been visited as usual. In connection with one milkshop, this was closed the greater part of the year; the last person applying for registration to carry on the trade as a purveyor of milk was a phthisical patient. Needless to say, the application was refused. The plea put forward on behalf of the' patient was that it was light work, and it would keep the patient out in the air. The following are the matters attended to during the year as the result of inspections :— Drains re-constructed ... 1 Drains repaired ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Access chambers constructed ••• ... ... ... 2 New soil and ventilating pipes fixed 2 Premises limewashed ... ... ... ... ...

There is no alteration under this heading. The offensive trade carried on is in respect of fish-frying only, twelve shops, and from which there has been nocomplaint. Lime-washing, and other matters, have been attended to when required without service of notice. With regard to fish offal, nearly the whole of this is removed daily by contract. Special galvanised iron tins are supplied by the contractor to the fishmonger, a clean tin being left each morning. Manufacture of Ice-cream. The conditions under which this commodity was prepared were found to be well maintained. At the premises of one confectioner's, where ice-cream is made and sold in the shop during the summer months, it was found necessary to reconstruct the drains in conjunction with other sanitary improvements. The street barrows from which this article was sold were also visited, and the water used for washing the glasses was occasionally requested to be changed. Slaughter-houses and Food Inspections. Of the thirty-seven butcher's shops in the Borough five have private slaughter-houses attached. These, as in previous years, have been kept under observation, frequent visits were paid while slaughtering was in progress, and in connection with the slaughtering of cattle and pigs no case of tuberculosis was detected. During the year I frequently received an intimation from the butchers that slaughtering would be carried out at a certain time, and would like the carcases inspected before being removed to the shop. 34 In respect of two other butchers, who slaughter in private slaughter-houses outside the Borough, I received similar intimations, and that the carcases would be brought home at a stated time, although the meat is inspected where slaughtered. The premises where the various foodstuffs are sold, whether cooked or uncooked, have received my attention, and it is satisfactory to record that no case was reported to the Public Health Committee for proceedings to be taken in respect of diseased or unsound food. The list of unsound food voluntarily surrendered for destruction during the year I herewith append, and I have continued my usual practice when dealing with unsound foods surrendered, by issuing a certificate stating the article had been destroyed. This, I may repeat, enables the tradesman to get the money he paid for the article destroyed refunded. Table of Unsound Food Surrendered. No. Particulars of Surrender. Weight, lbs. Condition.

I would also like to express my appreciation of the very valuable assistance I received during the past year from the Medical Officer of Health and the staff of this department, from the Town Clerk's department, and that of the Borough Surveyor, who are ever willing to give every possible assistance.
