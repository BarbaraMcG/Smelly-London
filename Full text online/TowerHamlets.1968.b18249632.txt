Aldermen and Councillors of The London Borough of Tower Hamlets Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present the Annual Report on the health of the Borough for 1968 COMMUNICABLE DISEASES A campaign for vaccination against measles was initiated on a national scale in the mid-year. A reasonable response from the recommended age group of 1 year ensued in the area By the end of the year there was some evidence of a reduction over the expected notification rate for a "measles' year. With the threatened extension of Asiatic influenza to this country at the latter part of the year, key personnel in the Council's employ in touch with the public, and the staff of residential homes, were offered and largely accepted vaccination against the new mutant strain. Fortunately, the forecast of a large outbreak did not materialise Tuberculosis notifications showed little change over the year at rates of 0.53 per 1,000 for pulmonary, and 0,098 per 1000 for non-pulmonary cases However, the death rate for cancer of the lung in the borough is now about one per thousand of the population A total of 190, comprising 160 males and 30 females died from this disease in 1968. an increase again on last year's total HOUSING In 1964-65 it was estimated that there were approximately 13,800 properties, in the constituent boroughs, to be dealt with as 'Unfit' Considerable progress has been made in the intervening five years, including almost four years as the new borough of Tower Hamlets The backlog of 3 500 of the 1960-65 quinquennium has been dealt with, and another 6,300 are being dealt with in the 1965-70 programme Additional tenement blocks have been included too It is estimated that about a further 4,000 unfit properties can be incorporated in the 1970-75 programme After this the bulk of slum property will have been covered for representation Thus a total of 9,000 properties, up to and inclusive of the current quinquennial programme, will have been declared/represented within a six year period in the combined Greater London Council and Tower Hamlets housing programmes If confirmation, clearance, and redevelopment proceed apace the demise of all large areas of unfit properties within the borough is in sight in the very near future. -3- FAMILY PLANNING Population control is one of the most important problems of public health today. It has been calculated that for the United Kingdom the annual increase of population is, on average over recent years, more than a quarter of a million persons. Within this borough live births exceeded deaths by an average of 1,167 in each of the last 4 years. Fortunately, the local increase in past years has been cushioned by an annual outward migration of population, consequent on redevelopment and rehousing. Nevertheless, as charity begins at home so does the responsibility of all of us for endeavouring to equate, as far as humanly possible, birth rate with death rate if life is to be lived with dignity and grace in the world of the future. Consent for the implementation, in full, of the provisions of the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act 1967, by the Council, has enabled an expansion in the local Family Planning Association clinics now run on an agency basis for the borough council. Family planning advice and help by local health authority staff, in the setting of routine welfare clinics, is also in operation. In addition our domiciliary family planning service continued over the last year under the guidance of amedical officer and health visitor. The aim must be, in conjunction with the hospital and general practitioner services, to provide ultimately a comprehensive service to all seeking assistance. CRUDE SPIRIT DRINKING The report of the Working Party on Habitual Drunken Offenders, for which the Council gave evidence, was still awaited at the end of the year. As an earnest of the good intentions of the local authority, further means are being sought to alleviate the problem of crude spirit drinking within its area. Towards the latter part of the year discussions were held with the Salvation Army - an organisation founded in the borough 100 years ago, and still represented with 3 hostels including the new centenary building extension, Booth House, opened by H.M. the Queen in March 1968. A special medical unit forms part of the new building. In conjunction with the Medical Adviser, Salvation Army, a pilot scheme seeking to rehabilitate selected persons in the category of crude spirit drinkers was planned by the Council to come into operation as from April 1969. Financial support is to be given to the unit at Booth House where assessment of cases will be made. Suitable cases will be sent for rehabilitation to a Salvation Army home in the country, with financial support by the Council under its 'prevention, care and after-care' powers. The co-operation of all agencies within the borough working with this needy group is to be sought in the venture. It is difficult to please everybody all the time, particularly perhaps in local government, so it was not surprising to read in the correspondence column of a local paper, on this proposal, an indignant letter demanding why the body of ratepayers should have to pay for such 'do gooding'? Not with standing, for some years a larger and more vociferous group has been demanding why the Council did not do something in this field! MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Links between the department's mental health section and the local hospital psychiatric services continued to be strengthened. In-service seminars at both the London and St.Clement's Hospitals, are attended by our field staff. Towards the end of the year, it was agreed to employ the Head Social Worker of the London Hospital, also responsible for psychiatric social work, half-time in the Health Department. It is hoped this will facilitate further integration of -4- social work at all levels, whether that of the health department's community work or the hospitals' in-patient service. For the mentally ill, a really comprehensive community care service is the first priority to establish The work of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association, supported finaneially by the Council, increased during the year when it was possible for them to take over larger premises, vacated by the Council, for use as an additional occupation centre for the mentally ill. Some expansion in the provision of psycho-geriatric care was possible such that our Pritchard's Road Centre, operated in conjunction with the day hospital at St, Clement's, was increasingly utilised Work with the mental ly subâ€”normal has not been forgotten Construction of the purpose built junior training centre for 115 persons, with special care unit places, is up to schedule and should be open in November, 1969 Meanwhile, activities at our three existing centres have progressed Opportunity has been taken under the secondment for training courses to increase the number of centre staff holding a recognised qualification, usually the Diploma for Teachers of the Mentally Handicapped Acceptance of the local proposals for the upgrading of salary scales of teachers and workers in the centres will enhance the service given by the section, albeit some of this work may soon be taken over by the Education Authority In the face of, or despite continuing theoretical deliberations on the future of the personal health and social services in local government. I am pleased to report that good liaison and working relationships with all the other likely to be affected departments were enjoyed throughout the year On behalf of the department, I express my gratitude to the Chairmen and Members of Committees for support and encouragement, and to the Town Clerk and other Chief Officer colleagues for the same To the staff of the department I give my thanks for another good year of service. I am, Yours faithfully, R.I.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA The Borough of Tower Hamlets is bounded on the west side by the City of London, on the east by the Borough of Newham, on the north by the Borough of Hackney and on the south by the River Thames. The river boundary is some seven miles in length along which exist numerous wharves engaged in trans-shipping activities. The area of the borough is 4,876 acres, being approximately four miles long, and four miles wide at the most distant points. Some 266 acres cover canals and enclosed docks including St. Katharine's and London Docks, East and West India Docks, and the Millwall Docks. The St. Katharine's Dock comprising 10 acres of water, has ceased being used as for dock purposes and has been purchased by the Greater London Council, together with adjacent land, for redevelopment inconjunction with this Council. Mileage of roads covered is 178.5. The predominant geological stratum is dark blue London clay found at a depth of between 20-30 feet from the surface; above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, with brown and yellow clays found nearer the surface. In some parts of the borough there are layers of 'made' ground, the result of earlier habitation, and as is to be expected the flow of subsoil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the borough with light industry tending to concentrate in the western end, and heavy industry in the east. One of the chief industries of the borough is the manufacture of clothing of all kinds and it is estimated that one-third of the tailoring industry of London is carried on in this area. Other major industries include brewing, engineering, the manufacture of furniture and ship repairing. Tower Hamlets is also one of the most important wholesaling districts in London. Spitalfields wholesale fruit and vegetable market and the London Fruit Exchange are situated in the borough, and there are many wholesale food depots from which goods are distributed throughout the country. Notable landmarks in the borough include the Tower of London and the Royal Mint. POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimated mid-year populatidnof the borough was 192,250, adecrease of 5,980 from last year's figure. This is a continuation of the downward trend which has occurred since 1947. The 1966 1055 sample census showed the population to be 196,830, although the Registrar-General commented that in Greater London the population was understated by from 2Â½ to 3 per cent. Live births exceeded deaths by 493 so that as the estimated population decrease was 5,980, the net estimated movement of residents out of the borough amounted to 6,473 persons. The density of population is 39.43 persons per acre. The estimated child population is as follows:- Under 5 years 5-14 years Total under 15 years 15,800 27,400 43,200 -9- FIFTY YEARS AGO In 1918 the population of the Boroughs of Bethnal Green, Poplar and Stepney, which now form the Borough of Tower Hamlets, was 510,640. Referring to the number of births during the year(4,622) the Medical Officer of Health of Stepney stated that they had been declining for years and were only a little over half the number in 1910 and 1912. Deaths of children under 1 in Stepney numbered 536, and in reporting the advent of the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, the Medical Officer of Health said there was still an enormous wastage of child life which proper measures might abolish. Deaths from measles in Poplar and Stepney totalled 296, and 880 children died under the age of one, 101 being due to diarrhoea. In the Stepney area smallpox accounted for 23 deaths. In his Annual Report for 1918 the Medical Officer of Health for Stepney reported:- "The Public Health Committee have on many occasions called the attention of the Borough Council and of the Local Government Board to the fraud perpetrated with impunity by dishonest tradesmen under the cloak of the Warranty Clause. One glaring instance of the abuse of the Warranty Clause is worth repeating. It is that of a milkman residing in our district who was convicted 17 times- 11 summonses were for adulteration,5 for refusing to serve the Inspector with milk, and 1 summons was for obstructing the Inspector, On the latter occasion, the Inspector actually saw him adding water to the milk, and when the Inspector demanded a sample from the mixture, the milkman tried to upset the can. A struggle ensued and most of the milk was spilt, but sufficient remained in the can to be analysed. This was divided into three parts in the ordinary way, and it showed 22 per cent of added water. He was prosecuted on several occasions after' this occurrence, and, although convicted several times, the summonses were dismissed on a Warranty on 6 occasions, once when the milk showed 21 per cent of added water. I am glad to state that this milkman will not defraud the public in our district in a similar way again. He was caught red-handed on 28th and 30th January, 1918, deliberately adding water to Milk. I reported the matter to the Local Food Committee and was instructed to prosecute him under the Milk (Amendment) Order, 1917, No. 1317. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, and his brother, who was assisting him in the transaction to three months, and his name was removed from the Register of milk sellers.'* The Minutes of the Stepney Council's Meeting of 8th October 1918 record the following:- ''We have had this question (as to whether any steps have been taken to impress upon H.M. Government the need for a Ministry of Health without delay) under consideration, and would direct the Council's attention to the fact that under present circumstances there are in addition to the Council's Health Visitors, Inspectors appointed by various bodies and institutions in the Borough, all working more or less with differing standards and all associated with the administration of the public health, resulting in a great deal of over-lapping, and we are, therefore, strongly of opinion that it would be in the interests of the public if a Ministry of Health were created to co-ordinate the administration of these and similar agencies and to bring them under one control." -10- The report of the Public Health Committee dated 27th November 1918 to Bethnal Green Borough Council relating to a 'flu epidemic and the difficulty experienced by local undertakers in respect of removal and burial of fatal cases, stated that the Sanitary Inspectors had visited all the undertakers on 4th November and ascertained there were 14 bodies in their premises, that they had 174 funerals in hand and had refused some hundreds of orders during the past weeks and that they could do with 17 additional coffin makers, and were in need of upwards of 6,000 ft. of timber. The Medical Officers of Health reported 713 deaths from influenza in Stepney and 524 in Poplar during the 6 weeks of the epidemic. Another report of the Bethnal Green Health Committee stated that during the 5 weeks ending the 2nd February, 1918, five persons were fined under Food Control Orders for sel1ing bread less than 12 hours old. The Minutes of the Poplar Council stated that the net estimate of expenditure of the Health Committee for the year 1917/1918 was Â£9,331. It is also recorded that in 1918 four prosecutions were taken against publicans for selling Spanish brandy as Scotch whisky. LIVE BIRTHS There were 4,445 live births registered in the borough during the year. After correction for place of residence (inward transfers 144, outward transfers 1,693), the number allocated to the borough was 2,875 comprising 1,486 boys and 1,389 girls, a decrease of 387 from 1967, giving a crude birth rate of 14.95 per 1,000 population compared with 16.45 last year. When adjusted by the Registrar-General's area comparability factor for the borough, which makes allowances for differences in the age and sex distribution of the population throughout the country, the rate is 13.75 compared with 16.9 (estimated) for England and Wales, a ratio of 0.82 to the national rate. The crude rate for Inner London is 16.9. ILLEGITIMATE LIVE BIRTHS The number of illegitimate live births during the year was 359 equivalent to 12.48% of the total live births, compared with 13.52% last year. The comparable figure for Inner London was 15.5%. STILLBIRTHS This year stillbirths numbered 52 equivalent to a rate of 18.08 per 1,000 total births compared with 16.58 in 1967. The rate for England and Wales was 14.3 (estimated) and for Inner London 13.1. DEATHS The number of deaths registered - 2,382, shows an increase of 252 over the figure of last year. The death rate was 12.39 and when adjusted by the comparability factor becomes 14.62 as compared with 11.9 for the country as a whole. The crude death rate for Inner London is 11.9. The largest single cause of death was heart disease, 28% of total deaths, followed by cancer 23% and respiratory conditions 21%. Last year cancer accounted for 25% of deaths. -11- The various causes of death and distribution by age groups are set out in Table l,on page 85 INFANT MORTALITY Deaths during the first year of life numbered 69 equivalent to a rate of 24.00 per 1,000 live births. The rate for the previous year was 17.16 and 16.74 for 1966. Fluctuations occur in years in the same decade but generally the downward trend continues: in 1931 the comparable rate for the area was 77 per 1,000 live births and in 1921 almost 1 in 10 babies died before their first birthday. The rate for England and Wales was 18.0 for 1968 and for Inner London 19.8. . Details of causes of death at various ages under 1 year will be found in the Appendix on page 86 MATERNAL MORTALITY There were no maternal deaths this year. NEO-NATAL MORTALITY During the year there were 51 deaths of infants under 4 weeks representing a neo-natal mortality rate of 17.74, the rate for England and Wales being 12.3 and for Inner London 14.0. Last year there were 37 deaths giving a rate of 11.34 per 1,000 live births. PERI-NATAL MORTALITY This term is used to describe the combination of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life expressed as a rate per 1,000 total live and still births. The rate for this year was 31.09 the rate for England and Wales being 25.0, and for Inner London 25.3. ACCIDENTAL DEATHS Deaths due to accidents numbered 50, motor vehicles being the cause of 18 deaths. Statistics supplied by the Road Safety Officer will be found on page 85 EXPECTATION OF LIFE On the basis of the mortality experience for the years 1965-7, the expectation of life of a boy at birth is 68.7, and of a girl 74.9 years, stated the Registrar-General. Ten years ago life expectations were 67.6 and 73.1 years respectively. Sixty years ago the expectation of life of a boy at birth was 48.5 years and of a girl 52.4 years. MORBIDITY The number of first claims for sickness benefit are obtained from local offices of the Ministry of Social Security and are included for information in a weekly bulletin circulated by the department to all hospitals and general practitioners in the area. The Ministry's offices are not coterminous with the borough boundaries but rather with postal districts, so that these claims do not relate entirely to borough residents; they cover the E.l, E.2, E.3 and E.14 -12- postal districts. (Monthly figures are to be found on page 90 MARRIAGES The number of marriages solemnised in the borough during the year was 1,557, made up as follows:- Register Office 715 Church of England 552 Authorised persons and other denominations 290 The marriage rate per 1,000 population was 16.2 compared with 15.4 last year. PUBLIC RELATIONS Health Department activities are publicised in ''Tower Hamlets News'' a publication issued by the Council to the public after each Council Meeting. Topics included in the publication during the year related to Measles Vaccination, Child Minders, Dental Health Campaign, Mental Health Week and Exhibition, Loan of Nursing Equipment, Services available for the care of handicapped children and young persons, the Domiciliary Midwifery Service, Laundry Service for incontinent patients, Vaccination and Immunisation, and publicity for the Mass Radiography Unit's weekly service in the Borough. In addition, a bulletin is circulated to general practitioners and hospitals in the borough giving information on infectious disease, morbidity, and relevant topical matters. This bulletin, formerly issued monthly, is now circul ated each week. UNEMPLOYMENT The number of wholly unemployed adult persons registered at the Poplar, Shoreditch and Stepney Employment Exchanges at 9th December, totalled 2,964 men and 247 women, or 956 less than last year. It must be borne in mind that the above figures do not apply solely to Tower Hamlets residents as one does not need to be a resident to register with an employment exchange of a particular area. Further more, the Shoreditch Exchange figures include the Shoreditch area of the London Borough of Hackney. Information supplied by the Youth Employment Officers shows that unemployed young persons (under 18), numbered 77 boys and 22 girls, compared with 1967 figures of 81 and 16 respectively;. OPEN SPACES There are 326 acres of parks and open spaces within the borough, representing 1.7 acres for every 1,000 population, some 10 acres being added this year. The County of London plan provides for 4 acres within the county per 1,000 population, with an interim standard of 2!4 acres. A list of the sites is given on pages 107 and 108 -13- COMPARATIVE STATISTICS A table showing vital statistics for the area covered by the borough at various years from 1901 is on page 87 HEALTH DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHMENTS A list of all Health Department Establishments showing clinic sessions held and other services provided is given in the Appendix on pages 138 to 140 -14- PART II PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES 1 PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES WEATHER CONDITIONS In the month of January very variable temperatures were experienced, snow falling on 11 days, with heavy falls on the 9th. February was the coldest for 5 years, March being dry windy and unsettled. There were snowfalls in early April, Kew having its coldest April night on the 8th for 30 years, whilst the 21st was the warmest April day since 1952, May was dull and cool, and June mostly dry, with normal mean temperature. July was mainly dry and warm, apart from scattered thunderstorms, Kew having its dullest August since 1912 and its dullest summer for 80 years. Unsettled and thundery with heavy rain and floods mid-month was recorded for September, whilst it was the mildest October since records began in 1871. November was dull and very cold during the first half, but had little fog. It was the coldest December recorded at the London Weather Centre since 1963. LEGISLATION The Public Health (Infective Jaundice) Regulations 1968 made this disease notifiable from 15th June. On the 1st October, the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1968, made under Section 56 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, came into operation, consolidating with amendments all previous Regulations relating to the notification and prevention of infectious disease except the Tuberculosis Regulations of 1925. The principal changes were to make acute primary pneumonia, acute influenzal pneumonia, acute rheumatism and puerperal pyrexia no longer notifiable, whilst tetanus, yellow fever and 1eptospirosis became notifiable for the first time. Additionally the powers of a Medical Officer of Health to vaccinate contacts of persons suffering from smallpox have been extended to other diseases, and the power of a local authority to require a person to stop work in order to prevent spread of infection are extended to permit action in cases of food poisoning. The Medical Officer of Health has been authorised to serve notices required under the Regulations with regard to measures to be taken by a local authority if and when cases occur of typhus, relapsing fever, food poisoning, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. INFECTIOUS DISEASES - NOTIFICATIONS The number of notified cases of infectious disease, corrected for revised diagnoses and duplicate notifications, was 1,197, compared with 2,265 during the previous year. Liaison is maintained with general practitioners and hospitals in the area by a weekly bulletin which is circulated giving them information on the number of infectious diseases occurring intheborough during the week, the number of new claims for sickness benefit received at local offices of the Ministry of Social Security in the area, and other relevant information from time to time. A summary of notifications of infectious diseases received during the year will be found on page 90 and a list of diseases notifiable in the borough on page 89 -15- ANTHRAX No case of anthrax was reported during the year. CANCER Of a total of 539 deaths from cancer occurring this year 190 were due to cancer of the lung. The death rate of lung cancer was 0.98 per 1,000 population, an increase of more than 7% over last year. DIPHTHERIA No cases of diphtheria came to the notice of the department during the year. Particulars relating to children immunised against diphtheria will be found on page 91. DYSENTERY Notified cases of dysentery totalled 40, compared with 50 during the previous year. FOOD POISONING Fifty-three cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, compared with 78 in 1967. Organisms of Salmonella typhi-murium were isolated in 17 cases. Ten of these were connected with an outbreak at a local hospital, four being patients and six home contacts. Organisms of Salmonella panama were discovered in two instances as was Salmonella oranienberg. Salmonella Stanley was found in one case and Salmonella enteritides in another. Clostridium welchii was found in one case during investigation of contacts of an incidence of dysentery. Twenty-four cases of suspected food poisoning were reported in an outbreak at an office canteen in the borough. The investigations led to the conclusion that this outbreak was attributable to twice cooking meat into which an organism had been introduced during the chain of distribution. From the material available it was not possible to prove the presence of the organism, and all faecal samples were negative. Two general outbreaks and one family outbreak were reported to the Ministry of Health as required by Memorandum 188/Med. INFECTIVE JAUNDICE During investigation of the 61 notifications received from 15th June, it became apparent that some of these cases were drug addicts. The cases between the ages of 15 and 30 years numbered 20, and of these, six were known addicts, attending a local clinic. LEPROSY One notification of leprosy was received during the year in a person who had lived many -16- years in the Far East. MALARIA A case of malaria, contracted abroad, was notified by a hospital in the borough. MEASLES Notified cases of measles totalled 616 during 1968, and there was one death from the disease. In the previous year 1,690 notifications were received. Children vaccinated against the disease during the year numbered 2 ,82.7. ACUTE MENINGITIS This disease became notifiable on 1st October, two notifications being received during the last quarter of the year. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM No cases were notified this year. POLIOMYELITIS It is gratifying once again to report that no cases of poliomyelitis occurred in the borough during the year. Details of vaccination against poliomyelitis will be found on page 91. PUERPERAL PYREXIA Notifications of puerperal pyrexia numbered 25 of which 9 related to residents of the Borough. The condition ceased to be notifiable after the 30th September. SCABIES Cases of scabies which came to notice during the year totalled 374, compared wi th 450 in 1967. Patients and contacts were given medicinal baths and their clothing disinfected at the Council's cleansing station. The number of baths given was 632. Although scabies ceased to be a notifiable disease on 1st April, 1965, by the co-operation of the general practitioners and hospitals information is forwarded to the Health Department of persons suffering from the condition, and arrangements made for follow-up by home visits to ensure that the patients and their contacts receive treatment at the Council's cleansing stations. SCARLET FEVER There were 83 confirmed cases notified, 8 less than in 1967. -17- SMALLPOX No cases of smallpox were notified during the year although the advice of the Medical Officer of Health was sought by general practitioners in some instances where the disease was suspected. Notifications are occasionally received from port and airport authorities of persons coming into the borough who may have been in contact with smal lpox. Observation is kept on such persons by officers of the Health Department for the necessary period. The number of persons successfully vaccinated or revaccinated against smallpox at the Council's clinics and by general practitioners during the year was 2,679. TYPHOID During the year three incidents involving typhoid occurred. One, a native of Pakistan recently returned from that country, developed symptoms 10 days after arrival here, and was found to be suffering from typhoid fever which, unfortunately, appears not to have been typed. This case was regarded as having been contracted abroad. Another, an old lady with a history of bowel symptoms, living alone, developed typhoid fever, indentified as phage type D.l (of Mediterranean origin). She had not been out of the country and, in spite of exhaustive investigations, no source could be found, neither were there any other cases of this type reported in the country at the time. The third incident, involving two fatal cases, which were not notified, is a matter of some concern. Mr. R.B. (65 years) was admitted to a general hospital as an emergency, deeply unconscious from coal gas poisoning (blood level 76% saturated with carbon monoxide). He was resuscitated and because of his mental attitude, was removed after some 18 days to a psychiatric hospital for assessment. He developed pyrexia and was incontinent, and was returned to the original hospital after 11 days with a fluctuating temperature. The P.U.O. continued and some 12 days later a Widal test was positive but no action was taken. The man continued to be nursed in an open ward in the general hospital. Five days later the Widal test repeated, was also positive; one day later he died unexpectedly, 50 days after his initial admission. All signs pointed to his having died of typhoid which had been contracted in the hospital. The man was under a variety of antibiotics so that the typhoid organism was not, in fact, grown. Two wards of the hospital were immediately closed, all contacts screened, and case papers of patients who had been in the ward for three weeks before his admission were scrutinized. On investigation of suspicious deaths in this period it was disclosed that another man, 78 years old, had had an illness involving abdominal pain and diarrhoea for one week, and who had collapsed and was brought in from the street. He died 10 days later, two days before the admission of R.B. A Widal which had been taken was interpreted as positive but no action had been taken. As the result of screening patients and staff still in the ward one other case was -18- isolated with a positive Widal but at no time was the diagnosis confirmed by growth of the S. typhi organism. He was transferred to a fever hospital but as he developed no symptoms he was discharged. The general hospital and the psychiatric hospital both use a contract laundry service operating from an adjoining borough and the incidents called for very extensive examination of contacts, which involved active seamen engaged on short trips between this country and the Mediterranean, but nothing further was found. WHOOPING COUGH Cases notified during the year numbered 66, compared with 89 during 1967. Statistics relating to immunisation are on page 91 TUBERCULOSIS The number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received during the year was 102, giving a notification rate of 0.53 per 1,000 population compared with 0.51 last year. Non-pulmonary cases notified numberedl9. The mortality rate for pulmonary tuberculosis was 6.2 per 100,000 population compared with 8.1 last year. The number of cases on the register fell during the year by 62. Statistical data relating to new cases, deaths and variations in the register will be found on page 92 Mass Radiography Chest X-ray by mass miniature radiography is carried out in the borough by two mobile units of the Northâ€”East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. Unit 6A, whose headquarters are at the Connaught Hospital, Walthamstow, covers mainly the Stepney area of the borough whilst Unit 6B, sited at First Avenue, Plaistow, is responsible for the Bethnal Green and Poplar areas. I am indebted to the Medical Directors and Organising Secretaries for the information on visits to the borough by the mobile units and on the work of the static unit during 1968 which will be found on page 94.(Details of abnormalities ascertained are not yet available in respect of this year's survey and those figures given relate to 1967). Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925 These regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary to take action under the Regulations during the year. B. C. G. Vaccination The numbers of children vaccinated during the year, under the Council's scheme for the -19- B.C.G. vaccination of susceptible (tuberculin negative) child contacts of known tuberculous patients, diabetic children, thirteen-year old school children, students at further educationestablishments and mentally subnormal persons at training centres, are shown in Table 15 on page 94 Other Preventive Measures In addition to the B.C.G. vaccination scheme, other preventive measures include the chest X-ray of all newly appointed staff and a triennial X-ray of those who are likely to work in close and frequent contact with children, staff at the Council's training centres for mentally subnormal persons and tuberculin reactors discovered among thirteen-year old schoolchildren, students and others tested with a view to B.C.G. vaccination. Epidemiological investigations are made among the contacts of cases of tuberculosis notified in children, staff or residents in the Council's establishments. Similar investigations are carried out at secondary schools where the reactor rates disclosed by tuberculin surveys are significantly higher than the average for secondary schools in the area. Chest CIinics In conjunction with the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board and the Brompton Hospital, and in accordance with proposals under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act 1946, tuberculosis prevention, care and after-care services for patients living at home are provided at three chest clinics in the borough staffed by chest physicians, tuberculosis visitors, welfare officers and clerks. Services include:- i) B.C.G. vaccination of persons who have been in contact with tuberculous patients; ii) Home visiting by health visitors; iii) Social work by welfare officers; iv) Assistance in cash or kind not available from official sources by chest clinic voluntary committees from their voluntary funds. The Welfare Officers act as secretaries to these voluntary committees; v) Boarding-out of child tuberculous contacts; vi) Home nursing including the loan of bedding and nursing equipment; vii) Home helps; viii) Extra nourishment; ix) Rehousing of selected tuberculous families; x) Recuperative holidays; xi) Maintenance during industrial rehabilitation at voluntary village settlements; xii) Admission to hostels for homeless tuberculous men. Statistics relating to these services are on page 93 Chest Diseases Care Committees Three such committees operate in the borough and I append the reports of the consultant -20- chest physicians on the work of the committees and clinics during the year. Dr. M. Caplin, Consultant Chest Physician to the Chest Clinic at the London Chest Hospital reports: "The work of the Chest Clinic at the London Chest Hospital showed little change in 1968. The shift in emphasis in the type of new case from tuberculosis to other respiratory disease such as chronic bronchitis and lung cancer has continued. Tuberculosis is now largely a disease of the elderly indigenous male inhabitants of the United Kingdom, a proportion of whom are homeless and alcoholic, and of the younger male immigrants. Cases occur, however, in all sections of the community. Chronic bronchitis and lung cancer are seen to occur predominantly in the indigenous population, and the incidence for both conditions is high. A survey of chronic bronchitis involving the close co-operation of many of the local general practitioners in Bethnal Green has been under way at this clinic since January 1963. Useful information on the medical and social aspects of this disease has resulted. Lung cancer is rapidly taking the place of tuberculosis as an important cause of death. Its causal relationship to cigarette smoking is now generally accepted. Bronchitis and lung cancer are not commonly met with in the immigrant population at present. It is interesting to speculate on the future incidence of these conditions in immigrants as they adopt the local smoking and working habits and live longer in the climate which has been accused of playing a part in the aetiology of bronchit is. No Doubt, however, improved working conditions and cleaner air will reduce the risk of bronchitis in all local inhabitants. Extension of the facilities originally created for the care of tuberculous patients to those suffering from other chest diseases continues through the function of the Care Committee. Unfortunately the income of the Care Committee from whose funds extra help is distributed to patients in need is now falling. The main source of income in the past has always been the sale of Christmas Seals from the Chest and Heart Association. With the decline of tuberculosis, and the resulting fall in its interest to the pub1ic,,coup1ed with the large number of rival groups appealing at Christmas in the same way, sales of the Association seals have fallen. However, the need remains, not only for tuberculous patients but for those suffering from other forms of chest disease.'' Dr. R.M. Orpwood, Chest Physician at the Poplar and Stepney Chest Clinics, reports: ''The work of the Chest Clinics at Stepney and Poplar has followed similar lines to 1967 and there have been no major developments to report. Applications for help from the Care Committee funds were fewer than in previous years, probably as a result of a higher standard of living and increased statutory allowances. Patients with a short-term illness were able to manage on their allowances, but grants were made from the voluntary fund to meet the specific needs of patients who -121- had been ill a considerable time. Elderly housebound patients were also assisted with extra fuel in the winter. The Stepney Care Committee again provided a coach outing to Brighton during the summer, and at Christmas time gifts to provide extra comforts were taken to the more needy patients at home. The Future of the Chest Services In July, the Ministry of Health issued a report on the future of the chest services by a sub-committee of the Standing Medical Advisory Committee. The terms of reference of the subcommittee were to consider the general organisation of chest clinics in relation to the rest of the hospital services and to make recommendations. Generally the recommendations were still being discussed at the end of the year with the Regional Hospital Board. A financial recommendation is being put into operation as from 1st April next year, namely, that relating to the cessation of payment by the Council of part of the salaries of the Chest Physicians. Removal to Hospital of Infectious Person Section 69 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 repealed Section 172 of the Public Health Act 1936 regarding removal to hospital ofaperson suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract. By regulation the provisions of Sect ions 169 and 170 of the 1936 Act now apply in such circumstances. Health Control of Immigrants In March the Minister of Health issued a circular which referred to new powers to control immigration from the Commonwealth provided in the Commonwealth Immigration Act 1968. Under these new powers any immigrant may be medically examined at the port of entry and may be required as a condition of entry to report to a Medical Officer of Health with a view to further examination and any necessary treatment. However, there is no power to apply measures of compulsion to immigrants who refuse to accept treatment any more than exists to apply such measures to the indigenous population. During the year, 544 advice notes, of immigrant arrivals, were received in the department from various ports of entry and successful contact was made in 366 instances. Of the remaining 178 some had moved to addresses outside the borough and details were forwarded to the authority concerned but the majority were either not known or had never arrived at the address given. Two immigrants were admitted on condition that they reported to the Medical Officer of Health for examination. One was suffering from a minor skin complaint, the other person having had trachoma. Swabs were taken in the latter case with negative results. VENEREAL DISEASE The annual return received from the Venereal Disease CIinic at the London Hospital shows that new cases attending the clinic during the year were as follows:- -22- Area of Residence Syphi1 is Gonorrhoea Other Conditions Total (1967) Tower Hamlets 95 548 2,125 2,768 (2,951) Other London Boroughs 114 917 4,177 5,208 (4,502) Other Areas 19 135 984 1,138 (924) 228 1,600 7,286 9,114 (8,377) Two welfare officers appointed by the Council work from the Whitechapel Clinic under the direction of Dr. E.M.C. Dunlop, M.D..M.R.C.P., Medical Director of the Clinic, for tracing contacts and following up defaulters. Dr. Dunlop reports as follows:- ''We dealt with 228 new cases of syphilis in 1968 compared with 172 in 1967, with 1,600 new cases of gonorrhoea compared with 1,671 and with 7,286 cases of other conditions compared with 6,486. The highest total for new cases (2,768) was for Tower Hamlets but this total has decreased from that for 1967 which was 2,951. The figures for Tower Hamlets included 95 cases of syphilis, compared with 86 for 1967. There were 548 cases of gonorrhoea compared with 722. It is gratifying that the number of cases of gonorrhoea has declined in this year. An important factor in this decline must be the activity of our Welfare Officers in tracing contacts of infectious disease. A summary of the results of contact tracing in early syphilis is given in Table A. TABLE A Alleged Sources of Infection - EARLY SYPHILIS Year Total A11ended Infected 1966 55 10 (18.2%) 9 (90.0%) 1967 27 4 (14.8%) 4 (100% ) 1968 27 8 (29.6%) 8 (100% ) Other contacts: 1966 - 2. 1967 - 3. 1968 - 20. Of 27 alleged sources of infection with early syphilis eight (29.6%) attended and all were found to be infected. Of 20 other contacts of early syphilis who attended six (30%) were found to be infected A summary of the results of contact tracing in gonorrhoea is given in Table B. -23- TABLE B Alleged Sources of Infection - GONORRHOEA Year Total At tended Infected 1966 1,162 321 (27.6%) 295 (91.9%) 1967 1,160 344 (29.7%) 304 (88.4%) 1968 1,064 375 (35.2%) 350 (93.3%) Other contacts: 1966-124. 1967-135. 1968-147. Thus of 1,064 alleged sources of infection 375 (35.2%) were persuaded to attend compared with 29.7% in the previous year. Of the number attending 350 (93.3%) were found to be infected. 147 other contacts of gonorrhoea attended and 99 (67.3%) were found to be infected This increase in the effectivity of contact tracing in gonorrhoea results from a continued co-operative endeavour by the staff of the department and in particular from the valuable contribution made by the Social Workers." COMPENSATION FOR STOPPING EMPLOYMENT Section 41 of the Public Health Act 1961 makes provision for a Medical Officer of Health to request any person to discontinue work with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease, such person to be compensated for any loss suffered as a consequence. It was not found necessary to take action this year in this respect. Food handlers excluded from work on account of suffering from infectious disease and for which certificates were issued for the purpose of claiming National Insurance benefit numbered 11 during the year -24- PART III PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES III. PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The Principal Nursing Officer, Mrs. D.E. Marrin, reports as follows:- ''Staff recruitment in the Health Visiting and School/Clinic Nurse services remained steady, although turnover was rapid Six Student Health Visitors were sponsored during the year and training places were provided for six additional Health Visitors by arrangements with the various Colleges. One Health Visitor who left the service has joined Voluntary Services Overseas and has been appointed to a post in Kenya; it is hoped to publish a short article on her experiences there in due course. Day Nurseries It has been difficult to recruit staff of a suitable calibre for the Day Nurseries, especially the trained Nursery Nurse grade, of which there is a continuing shortage. As a result of a routine inspection at two of the Council's Day Nurseries by Inspectors from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education, the Christian Street Day Nursery has been upgraded as a Training Nursery, This should result in a better ratio of trained Nursery Nurses in our Borough. The places in the Special Unit for handicapped children, which is attached to Queen Mary Day Nursery, have been increased to ten to meet the increased demand, CIinic Centre Activities Health Visitors continue to carry out combined school nursing/health visiting duties and all School/Clinic Nurses continue to take part in the Maternity and Child Welfare Services, Cytology The Supervisor of Midwives assisted in a project aimed at taking the cytology test to women working in factories in the Borough, but response to this facility was rather disappointing The cytology sessions in the two Borough Clinics continue to thrive. Family Planning One Health Visitor assisted a doctor in starting a project to provide family planning facilities for mothers in their own home, who were unable, for various reasons, to avail themselves of the clinic facilities Some degree of success has been reported The Health Visitor withdrew after initiating this project and the Supervisor of Midwives is continuing supervision of mothers in the group, A number of nursing staff have attended the Family Planning Association's Two-Day Lecture Course and it is to be hoped that arrangements will be made for them to attend the eight practical sessions necessary to complete the training and obtain the recognised Cert if icate. -25- Prophylaxis During a period of shortage of doctors in the Clinics, some Health Visitors have carried out immunisations, under medical coverage, in order to keep the children adequately protected. It is hoped to extend the use of health visiting staff in this sphere of work. Creche Sessions These have been increased in number to accommodate young children of mothers attending the educational activities in the Clinics, e.g. sewing classes. Mothers' Clubs have continued in the Clinics and Psychoprophylactic (preparation for childbirth) sessions have been given by Health Visitors to mothers in clinics and in Bethnal Green Hospital. Pre SchooI Play Groups The number of these groups in the Borough is increasing steadily and all of them require regular supervision and advice from the Health Visitors and occasional visits by a Nursing Officer. ChiId Mi nders At the end of October, 1968 there were 6 statutory minders in addition to 42 minders voluntarily registered with the Council and who received a fee from the Council. On 1st November, the amendments to the Nurseries and Child Minders Regulation Act, 1948, came into force with a period of 3 months ''grace'' to make the necessary arrangements to comply with the very stringent new regulations. This involves detailed inspection of the premises, together with full enquiries into the health of the entire household and obtaining personal references with the result that many reliable minders refused to apply for registration. It will be appreciated that this has placed an unprecedented extra burden on Nursing Officers and Health Visitors alike, due to the short time available in which to inaugurate the scheme. Liaison with General Practitioners and Hospitals A good liaison between al1 the nursing and health visiting staff has been maintained with the local hospitals Liaison with general practitioners in their surgeries has made a promising start. Four general practitioners in the Borough now receive weekly visits from their local Health Visitor to facilitate constructive action and follow up of cases where necessary. Health Education Health Visitors continue to take part in health education programmes carried on in the schools. -26- Occasional evening meetings are arranged to which fathers are also invited to participate Training Certain Health Visitors acted as Field work Instructors to student Health Visitors Facilities were made available during the year for practical work and for experience in the public health field to Health Visitor students from the Royal College of Nursing. North Western Polytechnic and Barking and Chiswick Colleges Observation visits were also arranged for medical students and nurses from local hospitals and for post graduate social studies students and others-some from overseas Observation visits totalled 329 Management Course One Centre Superintendent attended a First-Line Management Course Teaching The Senior Nursing Officers have lectured on the Public Health services to Home Helps, Student Nurses in hospital and at Cheviot House The Principal Nursing Officer has assisted with lectures in hospital to obstetric nurse students and in the hospital examination of pupil midwives preparing for their Part 1 Examination of the Central Midwives Board. In addition, small groups of pupil midwives undertaking training for the qualification of State Certified Midwife attended the Health Department for discussion The Principal Nursing Officer attended various committees in hospitals and organisations in the Borough regularly and family case conferences at intervals These conferences and committees afford an opportunity to strengthen the liaison between the Local Authority and allied services A steady and profitable liaison was maintained between the Senior Nursing Officers at Cheviot House and the staff of the District Nurses' Home at Stainsby Road, all the more important in view of the pending integration of the District Nurse services in the Health Department in April, 1969. School Health Service The normal sessions have been held in the various Treatment Centres, but in view of the incidence of verminous conditions due to the type of families being re-housed in the Wapping area, the Health Visitor and School Nurse have been actively engaged in head cleansing for a considerable period. Due to constant observation and selective hygiene inspect ions at frequent intervals, infestation generally is being kept under control in all the schools in the Borough -27- In the autumn of 1967 there was a serious outbreak of ringworm in one of the schools, which was eliminated, due to the vigilance and work of the school nurses concerned,early in 1968, Research and Surveys Health Visitors and School Nursing Sisters assisted in the following studies at the request of hospitals and research organisations:- a) National Survey of Health and Development. b) Survey of Childhood Cancers c) Measles vaccination follow-up. d) Spina Bifida surveys (2). Supervisor of Midwives Miss Clarke states that the Domici 1 iary Midwifery service has continued its work as usual during the past year. An innovation, which involves the hospital and domiciliary idwives, together with the Health Visitors, has been the introduction of the Guthrie Test for the early detection of Phenylketonuria in babies, which replaces the Phenistix or ''napkin'' test. This has the advantage that it can be done at an earlier age, is more accurate and enables the appropriate treatment to be started promptly. Mental Health, Emergency Night Rota Health Visitors have continued to assist with the duties in respect of the mental health emergency service for covering nights, weekends and public holidays." ANTE - AND POST-NATAL CLINICS Passions are conducted in Council clinics by midwives and medical officers for ante- and post-natal examinations. In addition four general practitioners undertake ante-natal work for their own patients in Council clinics which are made available to them free of charge, and with a domiciliary midwife in attendance (Statistics on page 95 ) ANTE-NATAL MOTHER CRAFT AND RELAXATION CLASSES These classes are held by domiciliary midwives and health visitors in Council clinics for both institutional and domiciliary booked cases. (Statistics on page 95) ADOPTION AND BOARDING-OUT Children are medically examined by Health Department Medical Officers prior to admission to children's homes or private foster homes on request from the Children's Department. Reports are also made to the Children's Officer as to the suitability of persons wishing to adopt or foster children, and advice provided on children being considered for adoption or boarding out. During the year 71 children were examined and reports were made on 37 prospective adopters. -28- CERVICAL CYTOLOGY In 1966 the Minister of Health approved the Council's proposals to extend the services provided under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act by the provision of a service for the collection of cervical smears for cytology investigation by hospital authorities. This service continued during the year with sessions in the Council's clinics. In addition a general practitioner continued holding regular sessions in his surgery, assisted by a member of the staff of the Health Department, and the Family Planning Association continued taking smears at sessions held in Council clinics. From these 1,347 examinations were carried out In addition, hospitals in the area read 11,084 slides and although all the latter did not refer to borough residents it can be assumed that the majority did. Details will be found on page 97 of the Appendix. CONGENITAL DEFECTS Notifications of congenital abnormalities under the national scheme recommended by the Ministry of Health in 1963 continued throughout the year Defects found in stillborn and liveborn children within 36 hours of birth were made on birth notification forms by hospital or domiciliary staff, details of which are as follows:- Number of babies notified as having one or more congenital defects 43 Number of stillbirths and livebirths notified over the same period 2,927 The rate of notifications per 1,000 total births was 14.7 compared with 15.6 last year There are obvious difficul ties in assessing the real incidence of congenital defects under such a voluntary scheme, but some help does flow in maintaining observation registers and in follow-up to assess any handicap CHILD MINDERS Section 60 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 which came into operation on 1st November amended the Nurseries and Child-Minders Regulation Act 1948 in order to remove various deficiencies which have become evident in its operation regarding the registration and supervision of child-minders and premises used for the purpose. Registration is now required of persons who look after one or more children under age of five for reward (not less than 3 children as previously) for two or more hours in the day. Formerly a ''substantial part of the day'' was the requirement for registration. Other provisions extended the existing powers enabling local authorities to refuse to register a person or premises and gave power to make various requirements in registering a person. Because the scope of the 1948 Act was so extended and the maximum penalties for failure to register were substantially increased, wide publicity to the new provisions was given by press, poster and leaflet campaigns. -29- A period of grace was allowed of three months from the date on which Section 60 came into operation before an offence against the amended provision was committed, consequently few persons now brought within its scope were registered this year. Details of registrations are given on page 96. CLINIC CENTRES There are 6 clinic centres in the borough, 3 school treatment centres and 7 combined clinic and school treatment centres. In connection with this year's programme of improvements to premises, solid fuel boilers for space and domestic heating were converted to or replaced by gas fired boilers in four clinic centres, and in the four day nurseries. To facilitate mothers living on the Isle of Dogs inattending child welfare sessions, with the co-operation of the Baths Committee and with the assistance of the Baths Manager, a branch of the Island Clinic Centre was opened at the Tiller Road Baths where child welfare clinic sessions are held now on alternate weeks. Additional toddlers sessions arranged this year numbered four per month. Following an offer made by the Education Officer of the Inner London Education Authority an English language class for immigrant mothers was inaugurated in June at one of the Clinic Centres, acreche session being held simultaneously to care for the children whilst the mothers received instruction. An average attendance of four mothers at each session can hardly be rated as very successful, although it is considered somewhat of an achievement to persuade Indian and Pakistani women to attend at all, since the majority seldom venture out of their homes other than to purchase food. Section 6 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 enables Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals, subject to the Minister's approval, to make arrangements with a local health authority to provide specialist services at clinic centres. Regional Hospital Boards have had this power since 1948. CRECHES Children can be placed in creches for an afternoon at many of the clinic centres by mothers who wish to attend the mothers' club or sewing class at the centre or who have hospital appointments Creches also provide facilities for mothers to be relieved of their children for 2 or 3 hours during the day; they also provide an opportunity for an only child to associate with other children of the same age, No charge is made where the mother is attending a centre activity, but a charge of l/9d. per session is made if the mother wishes to leave her child there whilst she attends to shopping or other domestic duties. Creches are provided at nine clinic centres, six additional sessions per month being provided at two centres. Attendances numbered 6,788 compared with 5,860 last year. -30- A recommendation was made under the Urban Expenditure Programme for additional creche sessions to be held at the Island Clinic Centre, which is situate in an area lacking in such facilities, so that sessions would be available morning and afternoon, each weekday. CHARGES AND ASSESSMENT SCALES FOR THE SOCIAL SERVICES In 1967 the London Boroughs Association considered the report of a Working Party set up to consider the calculation of charges levied for certain Health, Children's and Welfare Services and the abatement of these charges where appropriate by means of assessment scales. The Association after making certain amendments commended the report to the London Boroughs as a memorandum of advice and guidance. Following consideration of the matter by the Council's Co-ordinating Committee for Social Services and the other relevant Committees, certain amendments were made to the proposals and the amended scheme was adopted by the Council, the consequent revised charges and assessment scales coming into operation on 1st Apri1 1968. The general principle of the revised scheme is that the standard charge for any particular service for which a charge is required to be made should be the full unsubsidised cost, and if the applicant cannot afford to pay the standard charge the contribution made by him should be computed on his means. DAY NURSERIES There are four non-residential day nurseries in the borough operated by the Council, providing places for a maximum of 210 children under 5 years of age. In one of the nurseries there is a special unit for the care of mentally handicapped infants for whom transport is provided. The aim of this unit is to provide relief for the parents, particularly the mother rather than to afford her the opportunity of going out to work. Three of the day nurseries are classified as training nurseries and provide practical training facilities for student nursery nurses undertaking courses for the examination of the Nursery Nurses Examination Board In addition the Council has a claim on 25 places at a voluntary day nursery in respect of which an annual grant is made to the voluntary body concerned. The Council's nurseries are staffed by 69 persons, which include matrons and nursing and domestic staff, Children are admitted to the nurseries in the following circumstances: First priority is given to cases where the mother is in ill-health and cannot adequately care for the children, or during a mother's confinement; where living conditions are detrimental to health or where it is considered desirable for the health of the child that it should be admitted to a nursery; where mothers are required to work because they are widows, unmarried, separated or divorced, or whose husbands are totally disabledorin prison, provided the mother works at least 35 hours a week. In addition there are the second and third priority categories, for children whose mothers are compelled to go to work as an economic necessity, and where vacancies are not required in the other priority classes, for children whose parents are both working, provided that the mother is employed at least 35 hours a week. Staffing problems of day nurseries still remain acute, particularly with regard to the categories of nursery assistants and students. As will be seen on page 137 the turnover of staff for the year was 29. In connection with the Government's Urban programme of expenditure in areas of special social need, mentioned elsewhere in this Report, one of the recommendations made by the Council was that higher salaries than those prescribed by the Nurses and Midwives Council be paid to day nursery staff in special areas. The Nurses and Midwives Council stated that they could not agree to this course of action. The Council's Heal th and Welfare Service Development Programme provides for the construction of a purpose-built Day Nursery in 1970/1971, at an estimated cost of Â£93,660, to replace a pre-fabricated nursery the lease of which expires in 1971. Private day nurseries and pre-school playgroups of which there are 12 in the borough (maximum capacity 235 children), are subject to registration and inspection by the Council under the provisions of the Nurseries and Child Minders Regulation Act 1948. Four additional playgroups were registered during the year providing accommodation for 67 children, (Statistics on page 96). FAMILY PLANNING Family planning sessions are conducted on behalf of the Council by the Family Planning Association at three of the Council's Clinic Centres, 460 sessions being held during the year. In addition, commencing this year, a weekly session staffed by one of the Council's Sessional Assistant Medical Officers and a Health Visitor is operated at another clinic centre. Also commencing this year, the Council now provides a domiciliary service particularly for families with multiple, social, or other handicaps. This year new patients numbered 950, an increase of 52% over 1966 and nearly 200% over 1965. (Statistics on page 99). FEEDING DIFFICULTIES Facilities are provided at acentre outside the borough for in-patient treatment of mothers and babies when breast feeding difficulties are experienced or of babies with dietary problems. No children were accommodated at the centre during the year. HEALTH EDUCATION Two interesting factors emerged last year while following the pattern of health education originally laid down. Firstly, the long-term contact and good personal relationships established through school discussion groups have added a new facet of prevention which can be fulfilled by the work of the section, i.e. that young persons who have left school have come back to health education assistants for social work referral when in need. Secondly, the many invitations to speak on the uses of health education work rather than how to do it, to teachers, social workers and others, have shown that the image of health education as a systematic technique of communication has finally been accepted, and that it -32- has become recognised in the form in which it is practised in this Borough has been shown by the number of students from other areas and disciplines who have visited the Health Education Officer during the year. The Mental Health Section having been the first to recognise the potential has increased its use of the health education services,including requests for a highly successful and well attended exhibition and regular attendances at training centres and clubs. The new Degree Course students from the London Hospital have visited the department for district ''orientation'' and discussion. The Health Education Council, which was set up by the Government to plan and promote national programmes of health education and to assist in the development of local programmes in co-operation with local authorities, professional organisations, voluntary bodies, industry and commerce, took over on lst April the health education promotional activities of the previous Ministry of Health and the work of the Central Council for Health Education. The Council's Welfare Committee expressed concern at the increasing number of applications received for admittance to part III accommodation for the homeless as a result of fires arising from use of oil heaters, and following a recommendation to the Health Committee appropriate action was taken to ensure the widest publicity being given to the matter, including house to house visits to immigrants to instruct them on the dangers of misuse of these appliances. Statistics on the work of the section are given on page 98. HEALTH VISITING Health visitors maintain close liaison with the staffs of statutory and voluntary bodies, general practitioners and hospitals in the borough. Their visits to expectant mothers and to children under five years of age are shown with other statistics on page 99 . Health education work is carried out by means of personal contact as well as in group sessions held at the clinics. At the request of the paediatricians concerned health visitors attended the outpatients departments at hospitals to provide a link between hospital and home. The numbers of health visitors and tuberculosis visitors employed at the beginning and end of the year were 37 and 39 respectively, there being 9 resignations and 11 new appointments during the year. Command Paper 1973 recommended an establishment for the year 1967 of 36 health and tuberculosis visitors, based on a proportion of 0.18 visitors per 1,000 population. HOME NURSING The home nursing service for the borough is carried out on an agency basis by the East London District Nursing Society and the Nursing Sisters of St. John the Divine. The Council adopted a recommendation that having regard to the wide range of health services now provided directly by the Council in pursuance of its statutory powers, it would be in the interest of the borough and its inhabitants for the home nursing service to be brought under the Council's direct control and directed that discussions be commenced with the East London District Nursing Society and the Nursing Sisters of St. John the Divine with a -33- view to formulation of proposals which would enable such arrangement to be brought into operation on 1st April, 1969, In the event, arrangements were made for the Nursing Staff of the East London Nursing Society to come under the direct control of the Council in 1969, following amending proposals made to the Department of Health and Social Security under Section 25 of the National Health Service Act 1946 f Statistics relating to the home nursing service are on page 101. LAUNDRY SERVICE Soiled personal clothing, bed linen, etc is collected at least twice weekly from the homes of persons who are incontinent, and cleansed and laundered in the laundry at Branch Road cleansing station. Increased demands led to an expansion of the service necessitating the purchase of an additional hydro-extractor (Statistics on page 101> INCONTINENCE PADS Special commercially prepared disposable pads and/or knickers are supplied free in suitable cases for use by incontinent and chronically ill aged persons Over 25,000 pads plus knickers and linings were purchased during the year and issued to 128 persons, almost doubling the service given last year LOAN OF NURSING EQUIPMENT Articles of nursing and sick room equipment are loaned at the request of the general practitioner, district nurse or hospital medico-social worker, etc free of charge for an indefinite period to persons being nursed in their own homes The Council purchased many items of additional equipment required to meet requests for loans. In addition equipment is loaned by the British Red Cross Society and by the Council's Welfare Department to handicapped persons. (Statistics on page 102) DOMICILIARY MIDWIFERY SERVICE The Council operates a domiciliary midwifery service under Section 23 of the National Health Service Act 1946, by an arrangement for utilising the services of midwives employed by the Nursing Sisters of St John the Divine and the London Hospital In addition the Council directly employs a non-medical supervisor of midwives. Section 10 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 consolidated earlier provisions relating to midwifery services and extends the scope of these services in a number of ways. No reference is made to the ''lying in period'' which removes any doubts as to the ability of a local health authority sending inahealth visitor or home nurse rather than a midwife if the latter is not required The joint scheme for training midwives by the Nursing Sisters of St. John the Divine and the Mile End Hospital, continued during the year Pupils who completed the course numbered 12 with 4 pupils under training at the end of the year, The Council pays to the hospital 40 per cent of the expenditure involved under the provisions of the Ministry of Health Circular 8/56, There were 270 home confinements attended by the Midwives Four general practitioners from -34- practices in the borough provided ante-natal care, with midwives, at four of the Council's clinics.( Statistics on page 103) MIDWIVES ACT, 1951 The Council is a local supervising authority under the Midwives Act 1951, supervising functions being carried out by the Council's non-medical supervisor of midwives. The number of midwives who notified their intention to practice as midwives within the borough, including those in hospitals, and who were practising at the end of the year was 139. MATERNITY LIAISON COMMITTEES The department is represented on local maternity liaison committees by the medical officer of health or deputy medical officer of health and the non-medical supervisor of midwives or the principal nursing officer. Meetings were attended during the year when common problems were discussed. As the borough is served by two hospital management committees, there are separate maternity liaison committees for each group catchment area. VACCINATION AGAINST MEASLES Following approval given by the Minister of Health in 1967 for the Council to include vaccination against measles in its arrangements under Section 26 of the National Health Service Act 1946, general practitioners were invited to participate invaccinating children between the ages of 10 months and 2 years. By the end of the year notifications were received from general practitioners that they had vaccinated 664 children, the Council's staff vaccinating 2,163 children at Cl inic Centres. OBSERVATION REGISTER At the end of the year, the Observation Register totalled 5,800 persons, comprising:- Children under 5 ''at risk'' 2,912 -do- handicapped 295 Young persons aged 5-21 years handicapped 2,276 Children non-resident but attending schools in the borough 317 The senior medical officer keeps the register under constant review. Further details relating to the register will be found on page 88. A booklet is produced by the department setting out details of the services available for the care of handicapped children and young persons provided by the Council, the Inner London Education Authority and by other statutory and voluntary bodies. PHENYLKETONURIA Following the recommendations of the Department of Health and Social Security arrangements were made for the testing of infants for phenylketonuria to be carried out by the Guthrie -35- method to replace the Phenistix test. Co-operation was readily given by the hospitals in the borough having maternity wards, both in regard to taking the specimens and the pathological examination. The necessary arrangements were made with regard to domiciliary births by attending midwives and for health visitors to deal with other babies found not to have been tested. During 1968 babies numbering 1,688 were tested either in clinics or in their homes at about the fourth week of life. No cases of phenylketonuria were detected. PREMATURE BABIES Any child weighing 5Â½ lbs. (2,500 grammes) or less when born is regarded as premature, and necessary advice and assistance is afforded to mothers with premature babies. Statistics relating to premature births occurring during the year will be found on page 99. RECUPERATIVE HOLIDAYS Recuperative holidays for mothers and young children are provided under Section 22 of the National Health Service Act, and for the prevention of illness, care and after-care of other persons under section 28 of the Act. Medical recommendations for holidays are submitted by general practitioners, hospitals, health visitors and social workers in respect of persons who are recovering from a recent acute physical or mental illness and who do not need nursing care. A total of 355 adults and children were placed in recuperative holiday homes during the year, including 181 school children for whom the Inner London Education Authority made arrangements. One Inner London Borough is responsible for the inspection of holiday homes on behalf of other boroughs included in the scheme which share the costs involved. During the year reports were received of 37 homes inspected 31 of which were recommended for continued use. (Statistics on page 101). CARE OF THE UNMARRIED MOTHER AND HER CHILD Mother and Baby Homes.: Voluntary organisations provide accommodation in mother and baby homes for those in need. Such organisations are supported by grants from the Council via the Health and Welfare Committees. Expectant and nursing mothers admitted to such homes during the year numbered 21. Moral Welfare Associations: Financial assistance is also given to Moral Welfare Associations providing service for residents of the borough. RESIDENTIAL ESTABLISHMENTS FOR CHILDREN IN CARE The Health Department's visiting medical officers regularly attend at the Children's Department's residential establishments to examine the children, treat any cases of illness occurring and advise on medical aspects of child welfare, hygiene and the prevention of infection. The department is also responsible for the provision of relief nursing staff as -36- required at these establishments. SERIOUSLY DISTURBED ADOLESCENTS In 1966 the London Boroughs Association set up a Working Party to study the problem of provision for seriously disturbed adolescents with a view to ascertaining what could be done to alleviate the difficulties existing in placing these young people in accordance with their needs. This Council approved of the Working Party's proposal to establish a pilot project, aimed at the statistical assessment of the needs of disturbed adolescents and the provision of co-ordinating services for them, in an area comprising the London Boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets. An East London Pilot Project Committee was formed, the Committee meeting several times during the year, and a conference sponsored by the London Boroughs Association was held at County Hall on 3rd July SURVEYS The Department has taken part in a number of surveys during the year in association with various research studies being carried out by the following bodies/authorities:- Department of Social Medicine, Oxford University: Survey of childhood cancers Greater London Council: Research and Intelligence Unit Physical handicaps in young people Medical Research Council: Measles. DENTAL CARE FOR THE PRIORITY CLASSES Section 22 of the National Health Service Act 1946 puts Local Authorities under an obligation to provide dental care for expectant and nursing mothers and children not yet at school This service is provided for in the same clinics and by the same dental officers who treat school children in the school health service. Previously separate sessions were devoted to the priority classes but mothers and their young children are now seen at any of the sessions in the clinics. It has been found that this arrangement makes it very much easier for mothers and young children to attend clinics and to receive dental inspections and treatment on the same day. The personal dental health of mothers during and after pregnancy and the protection and proper care of their children's developing and erupting teeth is of paramount importance; it is equally important for all concerned to understand the need for the toddler to be taken to the dentist regularly from before their second birthday. In establishing a pattern at this early age, the young child can easily accept the dentist and his environment, and fear never need develop. Far better that the child's first visit should merely include simple rides in a dental chair and the polishing of teeth, than wait until dental decay has brought pain and discomfort which will always be associated with the dentist. Advice on measures which can be used to prevent dental disease and applications which can be made to the teeth to strengthen them against decay will be made available at the same time. -37- The simple rules which clinic staff and parents can follow to help reduce dental disease are as follows: (i) Avoid eating sweet and sticky drinks and foods, especially between meals. (ii) Never give children undiluted black currant, orange or similar vitamin syrups. These are exceedingly harmful to teeth if taken from a spoon or miniature feeder. (iii) Clean teeth immediately after breakfast and supper. (iv) Finish meals with a fibrous food such as apples, carrots and nuts, and then rinse mouth with water. (v) Eat full meals at regular intervals throughout the day, but avoid between-meal snacks and sweets whenever possible. (vi) Eliminate sticky toffees and long lasting sweets from the diet. It is not unreasonable to allow children the occasional sweet but reasonable restrictions can make a big difference. (vii) Above all regular attendance at the dentist from two years on to obtain advice, establish a pattern, achieve minimal treatment as soon as it is necessary and to obtain topical application of solutions which will strengthen the teeth against potential future decay. The service meets the small demands made upon it. This year 361 children and 13 mothers were treated, a total of 598 fillings being provided and 5 teeth extracted. It is obvious that greater stimulation of demand for treatment from the pre-school child must be established. Now that we have a staff of three dental auxiliaries who are particularly trained to treat children in this age bracket, it is hoped that a considerable improvement will be seen in next year's report. During the year talks were given to mothers'clubs and to clinic personnel by all three dental auxiliaries. Details of dental treatment provided for expectant and nursing mothers and pre-school children will be found on page 97. -38- PART IV COMMUNITY CARE SERVICES IV COMMUNITY CARE SERVICES GREEN PAPER, MAUD AND SEEBOHM REPORTS Following the issue of the Report of the Committee on the Management of Local Government (Maud Report) in 1967 and in this year those of the Committee on Local Authority and Allied Personal Social Services (Seebohm Report) and of the Minister of Health on the Administrative Structure of Medical and Related Services (Green Paper) a Special (ad hoc) Committee of the Council was appointed in the latter part of the year to consider these reports together with that of the London Boroughs' Management Service Unit on the Reorganisation of aLondon Borough. MENTAL HEALTH The Principal Social Worker (Mental Health) Miss A.M. Joseph reports as follows: ''Ten years ago social workers were aware that in a few months the 1959 Mental Health Act would be in operation; an Act which would give a new look at Mental illness in particular. Until April 1965, Inner London was dealt with as a whole, but then came the transfer of the responsibility to the Boroughs. The emphasis on Community Care in the Act was probably the most difficult for people, whether relatives, neighbours or indeed other social workers to understand and accept. The patients must be willing to accept visiting, they may not be compelled to attend Day Centres or Clubs. It is still surprising to find how frequently mental health social workers are expected to be able to exercise power and remove people to hospital or indeed to enter their homes and to ignore the fact that the General Practitioner is the pivot. It is also strange how many still think that there must be a psychiatric problem when someone does not conform. It is not appreciated how different is working in and with the community, from treating people in hospitals whether general or psychiatric. Tower Hamlets is fortunate in having St. Clement's Hospital in its boundaries and now that the London Hospital has absorbed St. Clement's and Mile End Hospitals it is expected that the services for the patient will expand further. Much is talked of joint appointments but I think it is appropriate to point out that Tower Hamlets has provided 5 social workers for St. Clement's referrals and the number dealth with was over 756 in addition to other work done by these officers; the great difference is that the Borough pays all the salaries and expenses involved. It is also seemingly often forgotten that it is the Borough Mental Health Section that takes referrals from ''anywhere'' when the patient comes to live in it's area. In the future it is hoped that there will be joint appointments with hospital staff coming out into the community and that salaries and other expenses will be shared. This has been expected for a long time. It would mean staff would be doubled, visiting lists lessened for al1 and the emergency duties would come round less frequently. The department works well with the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association but I think few realise that the Council gives an annual grant to the Association and recently has provided much improved premises for a Day Centre, making no charge for rent. Working with the Day Hospital for the Elderly, Pritchards Road Day Centre now opens (for Psychiatric -39- patients) on 3 days weekly. An Occupational Therapist continues to pay domiciliary visits to some who are unable to attend a Day Centre. The Borough continues to support the Day Centre at Trinity Congregational Church At Pritchards Road, the Disablement Resettlement Officer has continued to be helpful in finding work for those ready to resume work. It is also worth noting that 2 boys left a Training Centre at 16 years and went to work. They had been excluded from school at about 8 years of age The Special Care Units, Training Centres and Diagnostic Clinic have continued to do good work and the Borough is fortunate in having such enthusiastic staff to run them The new premises at Whitehorse Road for the Industrial Centre have made possible expansion in work and insocial activities Recently a Club has been opened at the Centre which welcomes both sexes and it is gratifying to note how many fathers come along as well as the ever supporting mothers Everyone is looking forward to the opening of the new Junior Training School and naturally hope that a new adult Centre will be provided for both sexes in the near future The Borough adopted the modern methods in their Centres as soon as all came under their wing, and there is no doubt that those attending have benefitted All Centres had happy parties, open days and outings during the year- Temporary care and recuperative holidays have been provided whenever necessary, the Centres sharing in the Dymchurch holiday with other London Boroughs I would like to pay tribute to Dr Jessie Edwards who opened the first Diagnostic clinic for subnormal children in East London as an experiment. She retired at Christmas this year. Hundreds of children have come to the Clinic in the past 11 years and many parents have been helped by her. I think the Clinic was able to help so many because Dr. Edwards and Miss E James, the Health Visitor were with me from the beginning. Although continuity is now not thought to be necessary, I think it will be a sad day when it goes as people with such stress in their families need continuity This does not mean emotional involvement. Changes are upon us once again and it must be hoped that in whatever way social workers are affected, the people, children and adults, mentally ill, maladjusted and mentally handicapped will in no way suffer. I also wish to thank the Parents Association for their help and finally my staff who work so hard to provide a service.'' Referrals Persons referred to the department showed a decrease of 50 per cent from last year, and the number under community care decreased by 14 per cent. Admissions to Hospital In addition to community care for patients and their families the mental health social workers are responsible for the statutory admission where necessary of patients to hospital. Informal and compulsory admissions for the year numbered 197 a decrease of 20 per cent from last year. Emergency Night and Weekend Service A designated mental health officer must, statutorily, be available at all times to deal -40- with emergency calls for the mental health service, This means providing a 24-hour service, seven days a week, including bank holidays The mental health social workers augmented by some nursing staff provide a night and weekend duty service on a rota basis. This emergency service operates from 5 p.m, each evening to 8.45 am the following morning and at weekends from 5 p,m. on Fridays to 8.45 a.m, on Mondays, during which period all requests are directed to the duty doctor at St. Clement's Hospital, Bow Road, E.3, who contacts the mental health officer on duty as required. Approval of Doctors under Mental Health Act 1959 The Mental Health Act 1959 provides that one of the two medical recommendations required for the compulsory removal of mentally disordered persons to hospital shall be made by a doctor approved for this purpose by the local health authority as having special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders. No applications were received this year for approval, Short-Term Care Temporary care is arranged in homes and hospitals for mentally subnormal patients to give relatives a welcome relief and to allow them to take a holiday Residential Hostel Accommodation The Council accepts financial responsibility for the care of mentally disordered persons in residential hostel accommodation provided in the Borough by a voluntary organisation, and in hostels provided by other local authorities and voluntary associations Where patients are in employment or have other incomes, an assessment is made to determine their contribution towards their maintenance. Apart from those under guardianship. 35 other persons were in hostels at the end of the year. By reason of the large amount of accommodation existing in the Borough for transients e.g common lodging houses, seamen's lodging houses and other lodging houses and houses in multiple occupation, an inordinate burden is thrown upon the Council by requests from hospital and other authorities for it to accept full responsibility for the care of mentally disordered persons in residential homes, on the grounds that the person had a Tower Hamlets residence prior to admission to hospital. The Ministry of Health Circular which governs the responsibility of local health authorities for providing such accommodation, is capable of varying interpretations, Accordingly, steps were taken in 1967 to have this matter brought before the London Boroughs Association with a view to obtaining agreement as to which authority should accept responsibility in the various categories of circumstances likely to arise The Council adopted the recommendations of the London Boroughs Association in the matter which were made known at the end of the year, namely, where the need for residential accommodation arises immediately upon discharge from a National Health Service hospital the test shall be ordinary residence prior to the date of admission; where the need arises immediately on a child ceasing to be in the care of a local authority the financial responsibility shall attach to the local authority which was responsible for the person whilst in care; where it cannot be established that the person had any settled residence within a reasonable time prior to the need arising, he shal1 be deemed to have been ordinarily resident in the place where he slept on the night before - 41 the day upon which the need arose. Special Care Units The special care unit for juniors which caters for those trainees who are too severely handicapped to be able to be taught and trained with other juniors, was transferred in June from the Junior Training Centre at Cornwall Avenue to more capacious accommodation at University House Day Nursery. In addition the special unit in the Council's Day Nursery for severely handicapped chi ldren under 5 years of age increased its intake from 6 to 10 children. Transport Transport is provided by coach and minibus to take trainees from their homes and training centres each day. Transport covers trainees attending the junior centres, adult female centres, the special care unit, the day nursery special unit and psycho-geriatric patients attending the Day Centre, whilst those attending the men's industrial training centre hitherto make their own way. Some trainees attending the industrial training centre who are unable to travel on public transport unaccompanied were escorted by guides employed for the purpose. At the request of the Parents' Association the Council agreed as an alternative to provide coach transport. A purpose built coach provided with a lift at the rear for handling persons in wheelchairs is used for transporting children to and from the special care unit (Photograph facing this page) Holidays Many trainees from the training centres take part in a holiday at the holiday camp at Dymchurch, Kent, joining groups of trainees from other London Boroughs. Recuperative holidays are arranged for mentally ill persons under community care. Parents Association Effective liaison with the Tower Hamlets Society continued throughout the year. This Society comprising mentally handicapped children and young persons receiving community care and their parents, relatives and friends is a very active organisation in the Borough and arranges many activities, social and cultural, for its charges Quarterly meetings of the Society are attended by an officer of the department to further the liaison between the Society and the Council, and to discuss common problems The Chairman of the Health Committee attended a quarterly meeting to discuss suggestions to improve the services and facilities provided by the Council, The Council make available the use of its day centre premises to the Society one evening a week, and on a Saturday evening each month for social and sports activities The junior training centre premises are also made available one evening each week for experimental reading and writing classes for mentally sub-normal children, at which the supervisor of the training - 42 - A purpose built coach with lift at rear for transporting mentally and physically handicapped children to and from the Special Care Unit of the Junior Training School. MENTAL HEALTH Junior Training School Activities centre gives her services. Day Centres There is a Council day centre for the mentally ill and two others administered by a voluntary organisation in the borough. Their aim and purpose is to provide a meeting place where patients who live at home can obtain occupational and educational therapy. Patients are able to discuss with mental health social workers their personal problems and difficulties. An incidental object of the day centres is to provide some relief to relatives from the care of mentally ill persons. The patients attend for the whole day on five days a week and are provided with a midday meal and light refreshments. The day centre for psycho-geriatrics is now open on three days a week, an extra day being arranged this year. The Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association operate two day centres for the mentally ill. During this year, one of their centres transferred to premises leased by the Council and which became vacant following curtailment of Civil Defence activities. In addition to the grant made by the Council these premises have been made available free of rent and maintenance costs to the Association. Junior Training School Construction of the new junior training school began mid-year and completion is expected by the end of 1969. The centre will provide training places for 95 mentally severely sub-normal children of school age, plus a special unit for 20 children suffering from physical as well as mental handicap. The accommodation to be provided will include assembly hall, 7 class rooms, 3 rooms for the special care unit, a nursery, handicraft room and domestic science room. There will also be recreational facilities including playground, grassed area and children's flower garden. During the year the Government made known i ts intent ion to transfer the responsibility for the education and training of mentally sub-normal children from the Department of Health and Social Security to the Department of Education and Science. Photographs of junior trainees activities are facing this page. Adult Training Centres There are two centres in the borough for training sub-normal adults, one being an industrial centre for males and the other comprising a senior group for females aged 16 and and over with an adolescent group of both sexes aged 13 plus. At these centres social and work training are given. The majority are so handicapped as not to be able to take up outside employment, but the introduction to working conditions and routine gives sufficient support and self-confidence to enable some of the less severely handicapped to take up open employment. - 43 Industrial Work at Training and Day Centres Industrial work undertaken during the year included such tasks as assembling cardboard boxes, sets of darts, skipping ropes, paint boxes; packing curtain rails, toys, pencil cases, cardboard boxes; sorting chess-sets, pocket games, plastic egg-cups, whips and tops; making playing-bricks, toy ironing boards, tidy boxes, sorting trays , easels, test-tube racks, basketry bases, cots; trimming and bundling plastic mouldings, thumb-holing medical boxes, and repairs to furniture. Amounts received for work executed by the trainees amounted to Â£3,440, against which has to be offset the cost of materials. Payment is made to trainees, based on attendance, and is regarded as incentive pocket-money to supplement state benefits which they receive. Â£1,995 was paid out as incentive pocket-money during the year. Guardianship Three severely sub-normal patients remained under guardianship of the Council at the end of the year. These patients for whom the Council is financially responsible are placed with the Guardianship Society and are cared for by being boarded-out with specially chosen families in the Sussex area. Provision of Services for City of London This Council undertakes all mental health functions for the City of London on an agency basis as provided for in Section 5(2) of the London Government Act 1963. St. Clement's Hospital The Medical Director of St. Clement's Hospital, Dr. John Denham M.D.,D.P.M., has kindly supplied the following report on the year's work of the hospital:- "In 1968 St. Clement's Hospital finally took on the responsibility for the psychiatric treatment and care of the residentsof the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, Four years ago the Regional Hospital Board accepted a plan for the provision of a comprehensive psychiatric service in East London based on St. Clement's Hospital. This could only be achieved by close co-operation with the Mental Welfare Department and the assistance of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association. The essential steps towards a comprehensive service were provision of:- 1. Emergency service 2. Early treatment 3. Community care 1. The Emergency Services for the newly created London Borough of Tower Hamlets were based on St. Clement's Hospital since 1st April 1965. During the day the duty doctor has examined, treated and accepted patients at their own request or from general practitioners or other social agencies. At night and during week-ends the duty doctor deals with all requests from the community in the hospital or in appropriate cases at home. - 44 - Within three months the provision of this Emergency Service during dayandnight had reduced the emergency admissionsduring the night and weekends from fourteen to four per month. The majority of urgent cases were treated and followed up in the Emergency Unit - Coborn Ward- The effect of this service can be illustrated in the reduction of compulsory admissions under Section 29 of the Mental Health Act 1959.

Community care has been provided by the Mental Welfare Department and the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association. Mental Welfare Officers attend the hospital to receive referrals of cases for after-care and visit their patients during their treatment and after their return home. Each one covers one of the four postal districts in Tower Hamlets with an annual referral rate of between 40 to 65 per social worker. One Day-Centre at Pritchards Road has been provided by the Local Authority and twoothersin Shandy Stree t and Kiteat Terrace by the Psychiatric Rehabil i tat ion Association. They provide occupation for the patients who require further treatment at home or who need a period of training before returning to full employment, or who live alone or under stress, and finally those handicapped who are unable to work but able to live at home. Five evening centres provide for the social rehabilitation of the patients.A hostel for 23 psychiatric patients recently discharged from hospital has been provided by the Cheshire Foundation and the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association at Nicholas House, Old Nichol Street. On the same premises an Industrial Education Unit was opened in 1967 by the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association assisted by the Inner London Education - 45 - Authority, to provide training and education for patients in new and old skills before their return to work. With the assistance of these community services it was possible to avoid the need of long-term hospitalisation at Long Grove Hospital and to reduce the rate of relapse in an area of above average prevalence of psychiatric disorder. On 1st April 1965 St. Clement's Hospital accepted the statutory responsibility for the eastern half of Tower Hamlets, i.e. the postal districts E.3, and E.14; and on 1st November 1967 for the remainder For the first time a small psychiatric hospital or unit has been given full statutory obligation and provided a comprehensive psychiatric service. Further developments include the designation as a teaching hospital in April 1968 and the administrative transfer to the London Hospital, and the opening of a drug addiction centre in February 1968. A new unit was built which currently houses a Day Hospital and Treatment Centre for 100 heroin addicts ' St, Clement's Psychogeriatric In-Patient Unit and Day Hospital I am indebted to Dr. K. Hemsi, M.R.C.P D.P.M., the Consultant Psychiatrist to St, Clement's Hospital for the statistics given on page 104 relating to the work during 1968 of the In-Patient Unit and Day Hospital and for the following - The Unit is staffed on the medical side by one Consultant for three sessions a week and one full time P.egistrar There are twenty-eight beds in the In-patient Unit, eighteen female and ten male, while the Day Unit is able to accommodate about 25 patients per day and has about fifty-five patients on the books.'' Mental Health Week An exhibition in one of the Council's Libraries to show the very considerable work done by the mental health section towards the training and rehabilitation of the mentally ill and sub-normal in this area, was held in connection with Mental Health Week from 9th-15th June. The exhibition was staged by the health education and mental health sections of the department, and during the week over 600 members of the genera] public were interested visitors. It is felt that the personal attention they were given both at the exhibition and in the subsequent visits to training centres and the open days, will have made a lasting impression of the efficiency and adequacy of the service provided which, because of the method by which it was done, they will pass on to an ever widening circle of the public. A photograph showing part of the exhibition faces this page. Stat ist ics Statistics relating to the Mental Health Services appear on pages 104 to 106. - 46 - MENTAL HEALTH WEEK EXHIBITION HEROIN ADDICTS The Council approved in principle the recommendation of the London Boroughs Association that a Joint Board be set up for the purpose of providing and maintaining hostels for the rehabilitation and after-care of heroin addicts. Each borough would be represented on the Board and all London Boroughs would contribute to the costs. BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED PERSONS For the purpose of the Council's scheme for providing welfare services under the National Assistance Act 1948 for the blind and partially sighted, it is necessary to arrange medical examinations in connection with the certification of such persons. The department arranged 158 examinations by a consultant ophthalmologist during the year and certificates accepted from other local authorities, hospitals and private ophthalmologists numbered 75. Transport to the clinic for examination is arranged for these persons where necessary. CHIROPODY Foot clinics are held at 7 of the Health Department's establishments and at 3 other premises. Treatment is provided for corns, callosities and malformed nails; advice is given on shoe fitting, foot hygiene and exercises. A total of 38 sessions are held each week by one full-time and nine part-time chiropodists. For those unable to attend clinics, six of the chiropodists visit their homes to give treatment: Treatment is free to old persons, to those on retirement pensions, expectant mothers, schoolchildren and the physically handicapped. When such patients can be taken to clinics arrangements were begun this year to provide transport for them, a total of 81 patients being transported during the year. The average time between clinic appointments is 8 weeks and 9 weeks between domiciliary treatments. In addition a chiropody service is provided by the Welfare Department of the Council for residents of old people's homes, and I am indebted to the Chief Welfare Officer for the information on this service provided by him and included in the statistics on page 97. HOME BATHING Aged persons who are bedfast or homebound are given bed baths and, where the person is sufficiently agile, complete baths in their own homes by the Council's bathing attendants. If the dwelling is without a bath, a 'bungalow' bath is taken to the premises, together with hot water in insulated containers. This expanding service necessitated the engagement of additional bathing attendants this year. (Statistics on page 100). HOME HELP SERVICE Home helps are provided under Section 29, National Health Service Act 1946, to undertake domestic work in homes during emergencies such as illness or confinements, and to assist aged persons who are unable to fend unaided for themselves. Increasingly the service is attending to the demands of the latter category (87%) understandably because of the growing number of 47 aged persons in the community, earlier discharge from hospital as the community care service expands, and the policy of keeping the aged in their own homes as long as possible rather than admitting them to a hospital or welfare home. At the end of the year 280 home helps were employed by the Council. The present standard charge for home help service is 5/8d. an hour which is reduced according to the financial circumstances. The service is free to certain classes, e.g. those persons in receipt of supplementary benefit or families where the mothers, suffering from toxaemia of pregnancy, have submitted a medical certificate. Specially trained helps are utilised to provide assistance to problem families. An in-service course of 8 lectures designed to assist helps in their work was attended by 30 home helps. Households numbering 3,643 were provided with the service during the year compared with 3,585 last year. Section 13 of the Health Service and Public Health Act 1968 confers on local health author ities power to provide laundry facilities for households where home help is being provided,but the Minister deferred bringing this section into operation for the present in the light of the present economic situation. (Statistics on page 100). DAY CARE SERVICE The day care service continued to function satisfactorily. This service which is additional to the normal home help service, is given to selected aged persons by neighbours or persons living in the immediate vicinity, and is intended to cater for those persons chronically ill or bedridden and living alone who require visiting or attention several times a day. The service is however, limited to the availability of the neighbours willing to undertake this paid work. REMOVAL OF PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951, to make application to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to hospital or institution of any aged, infirm or physically incapacitated person living in insanitary conditions, and who is in need of care and attention. It was found necessary this year to apply for Removal Orders under this enactment in respect of 14 persons, 13 of whom were removed to hospital and one to a Welfare Home. BURIALS Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1947 places a duty on the Council to arrange for the burial ofanyperson found dead within the borough where no private arrangements have been made. Burials undertaken during the year numbered 52. (Statistics on page 108). - 48 - PART V ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES V ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The Chief Public Health Inspector reports as follows:- Street Trading in Food "The Food Hygiene (Markets, Stalls and Delivery Vehicles) Regulations, 1966 have been in operation for two years and it would have been reasonable to assume that after this time a satisfactory overall improvement would have been achieved. This is not the case, for only certain stalls here and there are seen to be fully complying with the Regulations. A half-hearted effort has been made by others. To say the least, this is certainly not a reflection on the time and trouble which Public Health Inspectors have spent explaining the requirements verbally, and in writing to traders, and after these painstaking efforts have failed, taking numerous prosecutions to the Magistrates' Court where heavy penalties have been imposed, With most sections of the community the law is respected and co-operation in implementing it is forthcoming, but street traders are, in some cases, stubborn and unco-operative. This could be attributed to their inability to appreciate that cleanliness is of paramount importance where the handling of food is concerned, and their reluctance to change habits which have been practised for years. However, when a trader states that "You can't have fish without flies", then Food Hygiene Regulations are obviously not the complete answer neither is "Petticoat Lane" on a Sunday morning the place to try to preach Health Education. These are just some of the many difficulties encountered in trying to improve street trading conditions With the licensed trader, hope is held high that common sense and persuasion will prevail eventually, but with the unlicensed trader we are fighting a losing battle for the moment. These "pirates" appear in this and other areas knowing that, even if they are prosecuted for illegal trading, the fine will probably be less than a genuine trader would pay for a licence over a period. Invariably they are abusive and belligerent when approached and in cases where a name and address is given it is often false so that summonses cannot be served. Hot dog and ice cream trollies are the chief offenders in the streets, and fruit and vegetable vendors on vacant land. Much heavier penalties for illegal trading would certainly help in this direction. Street trading is not likely to disappear, so what for the future? Two street markets are about to be absorbed in redevelopment schemes and alternative facilities to be provided in the new development. Here are chances which must not be missed. Consideration should be given to Council owned stalls and awnings being hired out to traders in the new market and to storage facilities, refuse disposal and hot water points being provided in the development. This will not only give the Public Health Inspectors a sound basis to work from but will prevent worn out stalls with bedraggled awnings being incorporated in a new development. It is foreseeable that most street markets could eventually be transformed in this way. - 49 - In 1965, this Council, in its wisdom, resolved that new licences would not be granted for the sale in the open air of Meat, Poultry, Fish, Bread, Confectionery and Sweets i.e. as open food. Ultimately, this will result in all these commodities being sold only if pre-packed, albeit progress will be slow, A joint consultative committee comprising Street Traders' representatives and members of the Health Committee has been formed and meetings are held from time to time, when traders discuss their problems. Imported Food Inspection On the 1st August, 1968, the Imported Food Regulations, 1968 came into operation; the first complete change in the laws concerned with the supervision of imported food for 20 years. The new Regulations have taken into account the remarkable change that has recently occurred in the transport of imported food by means of containers, which has revolutionised the whole system of food imports and exports, also resulting in inland authorities having a responsibility for the inspection and supervision of imported food, The number of forms and letters required under the 1968 Regulations has increased considerably, but it is generally agreed that, whilst not perfect, the Regulations are a great improvement on the 1937 - 1948 Regulations which they have superseded. In preparation for the operation of the new Regulations, new forms were devised and a review of the Regulations in comparison with the old Regulations was undertaken after considerable discussion and consideration by officers of the Port of London Health Authority and the London Riparian Authorities Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 Although few complaints have been made by employees, numbers of anonymous queries are received from staff reluctant to disciose their identities or the addresses of their places of work. Evidently many employees in offices and shops are now aware of the protection afforded them by the Act, but, unfortunately, they hesitate to report bad conditions, because, being members of small staffs, they fear incurring their employers' displeasure. An interesting difficulty frequently occurs in enforcing Section 16 of the Act. It was found that numbers of premises situated on, or entered from, roads designated "Clearways" had their internal passageways obstructed by cartons, cases, packages, etc. stacked ready for dispatch. When occupiers of such premises were informed of the contravention of the Act, they pointed out that they had no alternative but to stack goods in the vicinity of the door, because it was essential for goods to be transferred to and from vehicles as speedily as possible. Vehicles on "Clearways" are legally permitted a period of only 20 minutes a day to load or unload, so that occupiers of premises adjoining a "Clearway" experience great difficulty in not contravening one or other of the laws If they stack goods as described, the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 is contravened; if they stack elsewhere on the premises, loading or - 50 unloading may exceed 20 minutes and the Road Traffic Act is contravened; and the stacking of goods on the footway is forbidden by the Highways Acts 1959 and 1965 which is enforced by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. Altogether, it is difficult for occupiers to comply with Section 16 in some parts of the Borough, though much improvement is achieved by advice on replanning the storing and loading of goods A list of premises in the Borough subject to the Hoists and Lifts Regulations 1968 is being compiled. When premises are added to the list, occupiers are sent a letter outlining the purpose of the Regulations, and requesting them to make suitable arrangements for regular inspection after the commencement date. During August and September letters were sent to all occupiers of registered premises pointing out their responsibilities under Section 48 of the Act relating to accidents. As a result of this letter, many telephone enquiries were received which clearly indicated that many employers were ignorant of these provisions, and consequently the number of accidents reported during the second half of the year rose by nearly 100% over those reported during the first six months, so that by the end of the year 63 accidents were reported, as against 45 in 1967. The response to the letter was therefore encouraging, and, in future, a copy will be sent to each new occupier as his registration is received. There was one fatal accident reported during the year. Poultry Inspection The majority of birds slaughtered are for the Jewish trade and all birds are inspected by the officers of the Beth Din at the time of slaughter. Prior to this they are culled out at the farms and a further live inspection takes place before slaughter birds which are not considered top quality being returned or sold elsewhere alive. This is done to ensure that the number of birds rejected ritually is kept to an absolute minimum. Of the birds that are rejected a very small percentage are unfit, the main reason for rejection being bruising, damaged legs, wings and breasts. It is estimated that 1,838,500 birds are slaughtered for the Kosher trade in borough poultry slaughterhouses. About 170,000 birds are slaughtered annually for the Muslim trade. The pattern of business is unique inasmuch as the customer picks and buys a live bird, it is slaughtered for him, and if he so desires it is plucked, eviscerated and chopped. This method of trading makes inspection a practical impossibility. The slaughter-houses are visited regularly to see that proper standards of hygiene are maintained. Health Education Requests for assistance in this field remain popular. Senior Girls' Schools, a Mothers' Club and many overseas students were given instruction which included practical - 51 visits and the use of film strips. The work is undertaken by the Public Health Inspectors in conjunction with the Health Education Officer, The Health Department entered a decorated float in the Tower Hamlets Carnival based on the theme "Wash Your Hands" and were awarded second prize in the Civic Publicity Section, with a cash award of six guineas, which was donated to the Tower Hamlets Health Amenities Fund Slum Clearance In addition to the present quinquennial programme which is nearing completion, other additional areas have been represented which formed part of the Council's 10 year housing programme These properties would have been included in the next slum clearance programme at present under preparation. Lorry Drivers If necessity is the mother of invention then it is high time that proper provision, checked by statutory controls, was made to accommodate long distance transport drivers and their vehicles. It is important that all such premises should be required to be registered with the Local Authority and that standards to control overcrowding and the provision of amenities be legally enforceable. The Council has adopted a standard for overcrowding and amenities, but although it is being enforced where applicable it still has yet to withstand the test of the Courts. Drainage and Water Closet dyelaws New drainage work and alteration to existing drainage is supervised by the Public Health Inspectors, who also observe on all plans submitted to the Council. During the year 238 plans were examined and 5,539 visits made to work in progress. With the trend to use new materials for drainage work, both above and below ground, supervision of the work on site is of paramount importance to ensure that only approved materials are used. There is a tendency to drift from the provisions of the bye-laws, particularly where enclosed water closets are installed, It is difficult to appreciate what is to be gained by not siting a water closet and bathroom on an externa] wall when the inconvenience of absence of natural lighting and ventilation also necessitates the expense of installing and maintaining a system of mechanical ventilation. Where mechanical ventilation is installed, on this account, the balance of the system is checked by the Public Health Inspector using an anemometer. Staff The position regarding technical staff has remained numerically static. The Department has at present six Student Public Health Inspectors including three students in their fourth and final year. During the year two students who sat the final examination succeeded in passing and were appointed to the Inspectorial staff. 52 - Apart from visits arranged by the Technical Colleges, further visits of interest were arranged by the Inspectorial Staff in the Department, These included visits to new building projects, licensed and unlicensed caravan sites in Kent, prefabricated building factories, salmon curing plant, an egg processing plant, common and seamen's lodging houses (day and night visits), practical meat inspection and handling, inspection of fish at Billingsgate Market (early morning). Many more visits were made in the company of Public Health Inspectors during the normal course of their work," CLEAN AIR Two smoke control orders became operative during the year, namely the Tower Hamlets No. 3 Order made on 11th May 1967, and Tower Hamlets No, 4 Order made on 28th September 1967. The orders came into operation on the 1st July 1968 and the whole of the Borough is now covered by Smoke Control Orders; As the result of schemes of modernisation, amendment of development programmes and or additions to the slum clearance programme, six variation orders to exempt premises not previously exempted from smoke control orders became operative during the year. The proposed installation of 1,004 heating appliances was approved for the purpose of grant during the year, the estimated grants totalling Â£9,100 Discretionary grants in respect of the 30 per cent balance of cost of works of adaptation to heating appliances in dwellings were approved by the Committee in two cases, on grounds of hardship Under the provisions of Sect ion 3(3) of the Clean Air Act 1956 furnaces may not be installed in buildings unless notice of proposal to install has been given to the Council, Notices were given to the Council of proposals to install furnaces in two premises, applications for prior approval under Section 3(2) being submitted and approved in two instances. DISEASES OF ANIMALS The Corporation of London, through its veterinary officers and inspectors, carried out on an agency basis duties imposed on the Council under the Diseases of Animals Act 1959 and associated acts, Pet Animals Act 1951, Performing Animals Act 1925 and the Animal Boarding Establishments Act 1965. . Visits were paid during the year to the 18 poultry slaughterhouses and 12 live poultry dealers in the borough. Each of 14 pet shops received quarterly visits and a routine inspection regarding renewal of licence was made of an animal boarding establishment. Close attention has been paid to the animal market held on Sunday mornings in Club Row, and visits of inspection made at frequent intervals On several occasions investigations were carried out following complaints by individual members of the public and on one occasion by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Following a suspected case of psittacosis in a man who had previously purchased four budgerigars from pet shops in the area, all such shops were visited and information obtained as to the numbers of imported birds on their premises. - 53 - Statistics will be found on page 109). FOOD AND DRUGS Analysis of Food and Drugs Samples During the year 961 samples of food and drugs were submitted for analysis by the Public Analyst, 2 being purchased formally, 939 informally, and 20 were private samples. Irregular samples ascertained numbered 82, Action taken with respect to the irregular samples was as follows:- Legal proceedings were instituted in respect of five samples, namely an almond cake which contained a piece of jute string, grapenuts which were infested with biscuit beetle, a meat pie embedded in which was a bacon beetle, a wrapped sliced white loaf containing a cigarette end, and minced meat which contained added sulphur dioxide preservative. The total fines and costs awarded amounted to Â£74 and Â£29.8. respectively.' Matters taken up with manufacturers or importers included an almond cake which contained jute string, bread containing a baked-in end of filter tipped cigarette, butter and raisin bran contaminated with mould growth, canned braised kidneys containing sodium nitrite, canned aubergines containing excess tinwith considerable discolouration, canned blackberries containing dogwood berry, canned red plums containing added colouring matter, soft drink which contained 56 per cent rum, currants containing excess mineral hydrocarbons, kippers containing nitrite and nitrate, lemon juice and minced meat containing added sulphur dioxide preservative, pasteurised milk containing fragments of potato, sterilised milk containing two per cent added water, amilk bottle which contained red coloured plaster of paris, apple turnover, dried fish, bubble gum, coloured sweets, confectionery eggs and smokers' cough pastilles containing prohibited colouring matter, pork sausage deficient in total meat content, soft drink containing mould growth and a splinter of wood, and white bread containing wholemeal dough, grape-nuts, meat pie and whole nutmeg infested with insects. The absence, inadequacy or improper declaration of ingredients on labels were ascertained in 44 samples and were the subject of correspondence with manufacturers or importers A summary of the samples analysed and included in quarterly reports submitted by the Public analyst in compliance with Section 99 of the Food andDrugs Act, 1955. will be found on page 110. Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs Samples submitted for bacteriological examination numbered 146 comprising: 19 Spray dried hen egg albumen. pasteurised (American) 1 Canned pork luncheon meat (Dutch) 4 Dried hen egg albumen crystals (Chinese) 1 Canned mussels (Dutch) 23 Egg noodles, pasta, macaroni (Italian) 1 Canned stringless green beans (Chinese) 1 Canned tomato Paste (Portuguese) 1 Corned beef 2 Canned corned beef (Argentine) 1 Canned pork 1 Canned corned beef (Paraguayan) 1 Prawns - 54 - 1 Cooking butter 6 Frozen Prawns 1 Canned cooked chicken skins (Dutch) 1 Canned cleaned prawns (American) 1 Canned whole chicken without giblets 6 Frozen cooked peeled prawns (Japanese) 1 Cooked chicken 2 Fresh egg Rusks (Dutch) 3 King crab meat 1 Sardines 1 Artificial cream 3 Sauces, ketchup 1 Canned Jersey cream 6 Canned shrimps (Pakistan) 3 Jellied eels 1 Shrimp spawn noodles 1 Salted duck eggs (Chinese) 2 Canned Kangaroo tail soup 2 Sweetwater assorted dried fish (Pakistan) 1 Real turtle soup 2 Canned turtle meat 3 Ham 1 Turtle meat in wine 24 Ice cream 1 Canned ox tongue (Brazilian) 4 Ice lollies 1 Bulk lard (Dutch) 1 Canned poultry liver 1 Canned lychees in syrup 8 Meat pies Unsatisfactory results were obtained from 2 of the samples, of egg noodles , Salmonella montevideo and Salmonella braenderup being isolated. The consignments were destroyed under supervision. Ice Cream There are 22 premises in the borough registered for the manufacture of ice cream. Inspections were made from time to time under the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959 and no contraventions were found. 24 samples of ice cream submitted to the methylene blue reduction test gave the following results: Manufactured Grade In Borough Outside Borough Total I 5 7 12 II 5 3 8 III 1 1 2 IV - - - "Parev" Ice Cream: Satisfactory 2 - 2 In the case of the unsatisfactory sample (Grade III) manufactured in the Borough, an investigation was carried out and recommendations made. Details of the sample manufactured in another area were referred for action to the Borough concerned. - 55 - Catering Premises Catering premises in the borough numbered 1,322 at the end of the year. Consideration was given last year to the suggestion for the introduction of legislation requiring that catering establishments register with local authorities. The Council agreed that there was a need for registration and supported the proposal of the London Boroughs Association to seek inclusion of suitable provisions in a Greater London Council (General Powers) Bill. Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960 Food Hygiene (Markets, Stalls and Delivery Vehicles) Regulations 1966 Food premises in the borough are subject to frequent inspection by the public health inspectors to ensure that the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations are being observed and a public health inspector visits the borough's Sunday markets each week. There are over 4,000 food premises, including stalls, in the area. Notices of requirements served numbered 628 and 280 summonses involving 58 premises/stalls were heard during the year. Details of action taken under Regulations 16 and 19 of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960, are contained in the Appendix, page 111, Food Export Certificates Certificates numbering 89 were issued in respect of a variety of foodstuffs exported to Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Canary Islands, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, South Africa, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Zambia. Before certificates are issued the foodstuffs destined for export are examined and where necessary samples taken for analysis. Relevant investigation is also made into the methods of product ion. Imported Food During the year 17 samples of imported food were found not to comply with the Labelling of Food Order and importers and manufacturers were notified so that labels could be amended. Non-permitted colours were found in samples from two consignments of imported confectionery. One of the consignments was dealt with by the Local Authority to which it had been sent; the other is still detained at the wharf. At the request of the Customs, a sample of Absinthe was submitted for analysis. One of the constituents, thujone or absinol, is of such potency that it is important that it should be controlled. In the U.S.A. the recommended limit is 10 p.p.m. in alcoholic drinks flavoured with wormwood oil. Thujone in the sample submitted was approximately 3 p.p.m. Samples of Pakistani sweetwater dried fish were found to be affected by insect contamination and were released for sorting before distribution. Insect attack was also responsible for the condemnation of a consignment of Sudanese groundnuts in shell which were subsequently released for use as bird food. A number of consignments of groundnuts in shell were sampled for the presence of aflatoxin, but were - 56 - found to be negative. Indonesian nutmegs, heavily affected by insect contamination were released for essential oil extraction, and, in a lesser attack, for screening and cleaning before use for human consumption. Turkish dried apricots containing Sulphur dioxide preservative, marginally in excess of the permitted limit, were released only for catering purposes where cooking was required before use. Another consignment, packed for retail sale, where the amount of Sulphur dioxide was much in excess of the permitted limit, was detained and is being exported. There are regular arrivals of bulk lard in tanker ships, and in each case, the requisite official certificates are scrutinised for compliance with the Regulations. Such Certificates are now required to indicate the position in the ship of the tanks, to state the quantity of lard in the tanks, and to state that the tanks were inspected and found to be clean before the lard was loaded: Samples of the lard are periodically taken for analysis. Samples of imported dried egg and frozen prawns and shrimps, periodically submitted for bacteriological examination during the year, were all found to be satisfactory. Detention notices numbering 143 and 114 release notices were served under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations 1937-48 and the Imported Food Regulations 1968. These notices affected a variety of foodstuffs including; animal casings, cocoa, coffee, confectionery cocoa butter, dried apricots, dried egg and dried fish, fruit juice, groundnut kernels, groundnuts in shell, meats, nutmegs, salami, sausages, shrimps, spaghetti, sugar, tea, tomato paste and walnut kernels. Section 62 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 brought hovercraft within the scope of the Food and Drugs Act 1950 and the Public Health Act 1936 by construing the words "Vessel" and ''Ship" as including hover vehicles. Liquid Egg Pasteurisation There are two plants in the borough where liquid egg is pasteurised. The high level of hygiene at the larger of the two establishments was well maintained during the year. At the smaller premises difficulties are still experienced because of cramped conditions in an old building due for demolition in the future. Pasteurising occurs there intermittently and all 15 samples taken proved satisfactory when submitted to the alpha amylase test. Milk Supply-Samples Milk samples submitted for chemical analysis numbered 30, including 8 taken at hospitals, schools and day nurseries. The average fat and solids-not-fat content of ordinary milk samples analysed was 3.88 and 8.54 per cent respectively, and of the superfatted variety 4.55 and 8.85 per cent. No raw milk is sold or processed in the Borough. Consequently no samples were taken for examination for the presence of brucella abortus, One sample of milk, purchased at a retail shop, was found to contain, surprisingly, at least 2 per cent of extraneous water, Additional samples obtained from the same source of production were satisfactory, and investigation at the dairy failed to reveal the reason for the discrepancy. - 57 Unsound Food The following quantities of unsound foodstuffs were disposed of under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations and the Public Health Acts: Wharves 77 tons London Fruit Exchange and Spitalfields Market 89 tons Other Premises 126 tons TOTAL 292 tons About 12 tons of unsound food was allowed to be used for chemical or animal feeding purposes or for manufacturing purposes other than for human consumption, the remainder being delivered to, or collected by, the Cleansing Department at whose riverside depot it wa6 mixed with household refuse, under supervision, and removed by barge to a controlled tipping site in Essex. Condemnation certificates numbering 1,053 were issued in respect of unsound food in 1968. Unsound Food etc. - Complaints Complaints made by members of the public as to the alleged unsound condition, etc.' of foods, and which were investigated during the year, numbered 31. The complaints referred to - A11eged unsound condition: Apple pies 2, corned beef 1, butter 1, cheese 1, chicken 2, jam 1, lemons 1, minced meat 1, mushrooms 1, pancake roll 1, pies 2, raisin bran 1, sausages 1, canned tomatoes 1, canned mixed vegetables 1, yoghourt 1. Alleged dirty condition and/or foreign body or deposit: Baby Food 1, corned beef 1, bread rolls 1, bread 2, cake 1, cheese 1, chicken 1, chocolate eclair 1, grapenuts 1, peanuts 1, sausage 1. HOUSING The number of commonwealth immigrants coming into the borough continues to demand vigilance to be exercised by all sections of the department not least the environmental health section, particularly in respect of overcrowding and houses in multiple occupation. - 58 - Slum Clearance During the year 10 Clearance Areas were represented involving 339 houses. There were 13 Public Inquiries and 9 Orders have been confirmed to date. Overcrowding Principally, this arises from two main causes; natural increases in families and deliberate over-occupation. The latter occurs in many cases of immigrants who are ignorant of the existence of standards. This is difficult to condone, however, when a person applies to his Government for an assisted passage which is refused on the grounds that the accommodation he has provided for his family is not adequate and promptly proceeds to arrange for his wife and eight children to come here on full fare and occupy ONE ROOM. The problems caused thereby for various Council Departments need no mention here. To control this type of overcrowding is difficult. A general requirement that adequate accommodation was available for immigrants would only lead to the establishment of ''Clearing Houses'* without there being control also over further movement from the original approved address. The standard for overcrowding has remained the same for the past 34 years and whilst it is a very poor standard there is no point in raising it whilst there are far too many overcrowded conditions by definition of the existing standard. Underground Rooms There is a considerable number of underground rooms in the Borough used for living and sleeping purposes. When it is known that an occupier of an underground room is likely to be rehoused closing order prpcedure under the Housing Act, 1957, is implemented. During the year Closing Orders were made in respect of eight such rooms. Applicat ions for Rehousing At the end of the year, there were 7,616 applications for rehousing on the Council's waiting list, 410 less than last year. Tenants of Council dwellings who have applied for transfer to larger or smaller accommodation number 1,122, an increase of 82 on 1967. Preferential Housing on Health Grounds Applications for preferential housing on heal thgrounds investigated during the year numbered 558. An 'urgent' assessment was granted in 39 cases and balancing points were awarded in a further 168. Tenant transfer was supported in the case of 112 tenants of Council dwellings. Houses in Multiple Occupation The multiple-occupation of houses is increasing and spreading to two storey houses, where it is not unusual to find three or four families in occupation. Houses occupied in this way become known to the Department by routine inspection, complaints and newsagents advertisements. - 59 - At the end of the year some 920 houses were under surveillance, 231 being registered in accordance with the registration scheme affecting four wards of the Borough. Due to the mode of occupation and the use of paraffin heaters the fire risk in these dwellings is high. During the year 170 premises were found to be deficient in the means of escape in the case of fire and it was necessary to serve 101 notices to remedy the deficiency. One person was fined Â£25 and two persons Â£10 each for failing to comply with notices. Management Orders were made in respect of 27 premises following the service of 70 notices of intention to make such orders. Representations, received from owners of three premises, for the revocation of Management Orders were not accepted as it was considered that the houses were likely to fall into disrepair. Necessary works to remedy conditions caused by neglect of management were completed in 47 houses, 119 summonses were served for contraventions of the Management Regulations, fines amounting to Â£464 being imposed." Notices, in respect of overcrowding, under the provisions of Section 90 of the Housing Act, 1957, were served in 58 instances. Visits in the late evening and early morning are necessary to check that the notices are being complied with. Thirty five summonses were issued in respect of contraventions, resulting in fines amounting to Â£248, Twenty directions to prevent or reduce overcrowding were served under Section 19 of the Housing Act, 1961. Summonses were issued in twelve instances for contravention of the directions, resulting in fines amounting to Â£210. Standard Grants and Improvements In conjunction with officers of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, the Housing Inspector inspected four premises regarding which applications had been made to the Council for standard or improvement grants. New Housing During the year 2,123 new permanent dwellings were completed in the borough: 943 by the Borough Council, 1,178 by the Greater London Council and 2 by other persons. Details are given on page 112 , some new dwellings completed this year being illustrated opposite this page. Although the Borough offers many at tract ions for tourists, they will not find for their cameras' shutters conditions as depicted in the photograph facing page 61. At the end of the year units of accommodation owned by the Borough Council numbered 14,018 comprising 11,851 erected by the Council, 164 prefabricated bungalows and 2,003 properties acquired. Dwellings in the borough owned by the Greater Lpndon Council totalled 23,902 at the endof the year. Local Authority owned dwellings now comprise 61% of the total dwellings in the Borough.

The mortuary has accommodation for 15 bodies and serves the Poplar and Stepney areas. Improvements were carried out to the premises this year including the provision of new refrigerating plant and cabinets and laying of terrazzo floor. Prior to the formation of the borough, Bethnal Green Council had an arrangement with Hackney Council for the use of the letter's mortuary, which arrangement continues in respect of mortuary accommodation for that part of the borough, the cost being shared on a population basis. -62- A total of 564 bodies was received during the year (456 in the Council's mortuary and 108 in Hackney mortuary) including the bodies of 116 persons who were resident in other areas Other statistics will be found on page 108.

MISCELLANEOUS REPORTS BY DISTRICT AND SPECIALIST PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS Some 585 reports were submitted to the Borough Architect and Planning Officer in respect of applications for planning permission under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1962,for redevelopment or change of use. In connection with applications under the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1963, 15 reports in respect of betting offices were submitted to the Chief Officer, Public Control. 142 reports in respect of the transfer of publicans' licences under the Licensing Act, 1964, were submitted to the Licensing Justices.

Where the outworker resides in another area, the Council is required to forward details to the local authority for that area. It is an offence to fail to submit lists of outworkers or to give outwork to be done in a place which is considered to be injurious to the health of the persons employed therein. The number of outworkers included in the August list was 659, compared with 872 in the corresponding list last year. It is significant to note that there were 1,586 outworkers included in the August lists for 1966. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 There are 72 licensed pet shops in the borough including stalls in markets. A contravention was discovered in one case of a condition(absence of adequate heating for animals exposed for sale)subject to which an annual licence is granted by the Council, which resulted in legal proceedings being instituted and a fine of Â£15, with costs of Â£44,being imposed. (See also page 53 Diseases of Animals). PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 The sale of certain poisons (chiefly those used for sanitary, domestic and horticultural purposes) by persons other than pharmacists is subject to the provisions of this Act and of the Rules made thereunder, A person selling such poisons must have his name entered on a list kept by the Council, and must make application annually for re-entry and pay a prescribed fee. Compliance must be made with the requirements relating to storage, transport, labelling and containers. There are 86 names on the list, 23 being removed from and 3 added to the list during the year. POULTRY PROCESSING AND PACKING There are 18 poultry processing premises in the Borough at which 2,008,500 chickens and a small seasonal number of turkeys, geese and ducks, were slaughtered during the year. The weight of poultry condemned as unfit for human consumption totalled approximately 13 tons, birds rejected amounting to 0.3%. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 This Act, designed to secure the use of clean filling materials in articles which are upholstered, stuffed or lined, requires the licensing or registration, as the case may be, of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored or filling materials used. Regulations made under the Act prescribe standards of cleanliness for filling materials. Premises registered for the use of filling materials number 38, there being no licensed premises. Eight samples of filling materials were obtained from registered premises during the year and all were reported as satisfactory, -64- REFRESHMENT HOUSES In connection with the provisions of Section 89 of the Public Health Act, 1936 and Section 80 of the Public Health Act, 1961 relating to sanitary conveniences in refreshment houses. 34 notices were served during the year requiring the provision of sanitary accommodation to comply with the Council's standards REFUSE DISPOSAL The Cleansing Officer of the Council has kindly supplied some statistics relating to refuse disposal for the year, given on page 122. RENT ACT, 1957 Two applications under the Rent Act 1957 were received from tenants for certificates of disrepair, one certificate being issued RODENT CONTROL In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, statistics on rodent control work for surface infestations carried out by the department during the year were submitted to the Ministry In this period, out of 3,829 dwellings and other premises requiring inspection 3,275 were found to be infested with mice or rats. Treatments were carried out by the department's rodent control staff, in 3,760 properties the charges for servicing business premises amounting to Â£4,250 Business premises under regular servicing contract with the Council numbered 244 at the end of the year. Continuous baiting of the sewers, using fluoracetamide, is carried out throughout the year by gangs of men consisting of one rodent operative and two sewermen from the Borough Engineer's Department acting under the supervision of the Health Department's officers. Statistics are given on page 119. SANITARY CONVENIENCES IN LONDON TRANSPORT RAILWAY STATIONS Coincidental with the receipt of a notification from the London Transport Executive that the lavatories at Stepney Green Underground Station would close on 1st September, a complaint was received concerning the condition of the Mile End Station, allegedly due to there being no lavatory available on the station. The Health Committee of the Council after consideration of the matter instructed that a request be made to the London Transport Executive for the construction of sanitary conveniences at railway and omnibus stations where such facilities do not exist, and for those which have been closed to be reopened The London Transport Executive's reply indicated that they were unable to accede to the request. SEWERAGE The arrangement in the area for sewerage and sewage disposal are satisfactory The planned -65- programme of reconstruction of defective sewers is proceeding. SWIMMING BATHS The water in the seven public swimming baths in the borough and in the bath at the Council'Â£ Hornchurch Children's Home is sampled at monthly intervals by the Scientific Department of the Greater London Council on this Council's behalf. A total of 110 samples were taken during the year. One sample was found to be in an unsatisfactory condition, due to low free chlorine content and high bacteriological count. In addition 49 samples were taken from nine school swimming baths in the borough, 8 samples being unsatisfactory, TRADE DESCRIPTIONS ACT 1968 The above Act came into force on 30th November and repealed the Merchandise Marks Acts 1887-1953, Since the Act places a duty on Weights and Measures authorities to enforce the Act the Council delegated its powers and duties under the Act to the Public Control Committee. Enforcement of the Merchandise Marks Acts as they related to foodstuffs was formerly del egated to the Health Committee and measures were taken to achieve close liaison between public health and weights and measures inspectors to avoid overlapping of functions anent action with regard to misdescription of foods and drugs. VACANT SITES Two years ago vacant sites in the Borough presented not only an amenity problem but were, in many cases, a serious public health nuisance providing harbourage for rats, due to the dumping of rubbish This rubbish emanates principally from three sources, discarded household chattels, trade refuse and fly tipping. In an effort to discourage the dumping of household discards the Cleansing Department have a free, well advertised service whereby rubbish of this nature is removed on notification, Despite this, the obsession to dump on vacant sites continues, and the determination to do so requires some understanding when the corrugated iron sheeting round a cleared site is either bent or removed in order to dump a bedstead or mattress and other unwanted articles. Fly tipping, which was a very live problem twelve months ago is apparently decreasing. A concentrated effort to get sites cleared of rubbish and fenced has shown a marked improvement. There are 292 known vacant sites, 223 of which have been cleared of rubbish and fenced This year in 26 cases where the owners were not traced or who defaulted the work was carried out by the Council's contractor and the cost made a charge on the land. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply in the borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. The supply to the area is a mixture of filtered water derived from the River Lea in varying -66- proportions and is not plumbo-solvent. Samples of the water are subjected for quality control to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories. The water supply to the borough has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity during 1968 No fluoride was added, there being a small amount of fluoride naturally present in the supply. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination revealed by inspection or analysis. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine and the water subsequently checked as to quality, before the structures are restored to service. No houses are permanently supplied by standpipe. There are 16 deep wells in the borough. Bacteriological and chemical analyses of water from these wells are made periodically and the results reported to this department. The Metropolitan Water Board was notified on 49 occasions where wastage of water was taking place. Notifications were received from the Board on 17 occasions of intention to withdraw the supply from premises because of non-payment of rates. In October 1965 the Council resolved in favour of fluoridation of the water supply. However, in this respect councils in the Greater London area do not have overall control of the water supplies to their boroughs which are provided by the Metropolitan and other water boards. Section 23 of the Greater London Council (General Purposes) Act 1967 empowers the Council to carry out work and recover the reasonable expenses incurred thereby to secure that the supply of water to a building is restored by the statutory water undertakers where such supply has been disconnected by reason of the defective state of the supply pipe etc. The Medical Officer of Health is authprised by the Council to exercise its powers under this enactment in appropriate cases. WORKS IN DEFAULT Works were carried out by the Council on 79 occasions duringthe year in default of persons on whom notices were served requiring the execution of works. They comprised one instance of failure to abate nuisances under Section 93 of the Public Health Act, 55 instances of failure to comply with notices served under Section 17, Public Health Act, 1961 regarding choked drains, 11 instances of failure to comply with notices served under Section 75 of the Public Health Act, 1936 with respect to the provision of dustbins, and 12 instances of failure to comply with notices served under Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 for clearance of refuse from sites and erection of corrugated steel fencing. STATISTICS Tables 52 to 54 of the Appendix give additional statistical information of the environ* mental health services. -67- -68- PART VI MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES ETC. VI MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES, ETC. ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME Inquests were held during the year on 7 fatalities in the borough arising from accidents which occurred in the home. The powers and duties of the Council under the Home Safety Act 1961, relating to the dissemination of information and advice for promoting safety in the home and encouraging proper precautions against accidents, are exercisable by the Health Committee. Health Education for the prevention of home accidents has continued throughout the year, with particular reference both to those groups at greatest risk and to the most prevalent causes. Re-emphasis of the campaign to show the dangers of oil heaters which commenced last year has been continued this year with the inclusion of the filmstrip in school programmes, the loan of the filmstrip to Mothers' Groups and by means of house to house visiting in the mainly immigrant areas during the Christmas holidays. It is felt that points missed for one reason or another during home visits will have been finally assimilated by families by the issue of leaflets in the vernacular or by talks in schools. Talks to groups of senior citizens accompanied by a small film have also been given during the year and particularly during the winter months. Advantage was taken of the greater impact of personal contact in prevention of accidents through more group discussions and films on the subject, with a consequent saving on posters and leaflets, the value of which in the field of preventive work is still regarded by some as doubtful in relation to the cost involved. AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Greater London Council is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act 1946 for the provision of ambulance transport in the area: AUTHENTICATION OF INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION Persons proceeding abroad are required in certain countries to produce a certificate of recent successful vaccination and/or inoculation, and in addition the signature of the vaccinating doctor must be verified by the medical officer of health of the district. During the year 4,170 signatures on certificates were verified as those of medical practitioners practising in the borough and the certificates endorsed accordingly. CONFERENCES Conferences and courses attended by members of the Council and/or officers of the department are summarised on pages 123 to 131. DECEASED PERSONS Inquests Inquests were held on 80 residents of the borough during the year, the verdicts being 14 -69- deaths due to road accidents, 28 other accidents, 26 suicide, 1 misadventure, 2 manslaughter, 1 acute alcoholism, 5 open verdicts, 1 asbestosis, 1 unascertainable and 1 natural causes. Transport of bodies abroad From time to time certificates are issued regarding bodies being transported abroad to the effect that the deceased had not died from an infectious disease and that the coffin was hermetically sealed. Three such certificates were issued this year, relating to bodies flown to Iraq. Italy and Pakistan. HOSPITAL FACILITIES The undermentioned hospitals are situated within the borough: No. of Beds. Bethnal Green Hospital, Bethnal Green Road, E.2. 308 The London Hospital, Whitechapel Road, E.l. 719 London Chest Hospital, Victoria Park, E.2. 143 London Jewish Hospital, Stepney Green, E.l. 128 Mildmay Mission Hospital, Austin Street, E.2. 72 Mile End Hospital, 275 Bancroft Road, E.l. 410 Poplar Hospital, East India Dock Road, E.14. 107 Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, Hackney Road, E.2. 146 St. Andrew's Hospital, Devons Road, E.3. 365 St. Clement's Hospital, 2a Bow Road, E.3. 128 On the 1st April the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children transferred from the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board to the administration of the Board of Governors of the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, and the Mile End and St. Clement's Hospitals to the administration of the Board of Governors of the London Hospital. The East End Maternity Hospital, Commercial Road was closed, on 30th September-the first patient was admitted on 22nd December 1884 to the "Mothers Lying in Hospital" then in Glamis Road, which transferred to premises in Commercial Road in 1889, extended in 1896 and again in 1926. Factors which influenced the closure were that the maternity departments of five hospitals within the area hadasurplus capacity in 1967 for 1,510 patients, and in recent years in Tower Hamlets 87% of confinements took place in hospital as against 72% for the country as a whole; the excess of beds in the area was in spite of the high proportion of mothers in the locality having their babies delivered in hospital. LABORATORY FACILITIES Bacteriological investigations for infectious diseases are carried out on behalf of the health department by the Regional Hospital Board's Group Laboratory at Mile End Hospital and for infection of food samples are carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Department of Health and Social Security)at County Hall, S.E.1. Investigations carried out by the Group Laboratory on specimens submitted by the health department totalled 356, comprising 336 faeces, 4 throat swabs, 10 urine, 4 blood, 1 eye swab and 1 vomit. Bacteriological investigation on 146 food samples was carried out during the year. -70- LEGISLATION The Government decided to merge in one comprehensive department the former functions of the Ministries of Health and Social Security which, from the 1st November, were transferred to the newly created Department of Health and Social Security.

REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER ON THE SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE As is shown in the statistics for the year, routine work of the school health service continued on an even course. In previous years attention has been drawn to the incidence of scabies - this showed a decrease for 1968 compared with 1967. Vigilance on the part of staff at school inspections, treatment centres and the bathing centre has doubtless been a factor in this reduction. However, as the results of both routine and special inspections show, the division has a high incidence of head infestations. The top of the league is not an enviable position in this respect. Whether the higher yield compared with other divisions is a result of better diagnostic acumen by our school nursing staff as a result of hard won experience, or more detailed reporting, nevertheless there is no room for complacency. Slum clearance and redevelopment will provide a better environment but unless the children and parents are motivated towards hygiene standards in a personal acceptance of responsibility what is gained on the one side may be lost on the other. Here lies an opportunity for health education in its widest sense for this and other similar problems affecting the public and private health. Programmes of health education in schools have expanded during the year. In addition to the Authority's workers, the borough's health education team now numbering three officers has undertaken a major part of the work in the schools. The school dental service has also increased its work in dental health education. It is a pleasure to thank the Medical Adviser, and his central staff for ready help throughout the year- Our links with Mr. Peirce, Divisional EducationOfficer and his staff locally remain strong and cordial I would also thank my deputy Dr. C. Gourlay particularly for her endeavours in the school health section which is largely run under her day to day direction. SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL ROLLS Pupils on school rolls numbered 33,020 at the end of the year, attending 101 maintained schools in the borough which include three schools for the educationally subnormal, two for the maladjusted, one for delicate children, and one for the physically handicapped. There are no direct grant or independent schools included in the School Health Service. At the end of the year the school registers were as follows:- Type of School No. of Schools Pupils Primary 68 19,291 Secondary 21 12,331 Nursery 5 509 Special 7 889 MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLCHILDREN Routine medical examinations These are carried out by medical officers of the department assisted by school nurses. -75- Where further examinations are found to be required children are referred to special clinics e.g., vision, hearing, dental, ear nose and throat, special investigation clinics, etc. This year 12,663 examinations were carried out. Non-routine medical examinations These examinations are carried out for various reasons e.g. prior to departure on school journeys; for ascertainment of suitability for ordinary school; at the request of the head teacher, school nurse, parent, medical officer, etc. Non-routine examinations carried out during the year totalled 8,163. CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS SCHOOLCHILDREN This year the number of treatments for 'vermin and nits' increased from 817 to 844. The schools principally affected are those with high ratios of immigrant children on their rolls, some of whom move on before adequate treatment can be completed.' Attendances for treatment of scabies at the bathing centres decreased from 308 last year to 175 in 1968. Acombined approach with the co-operation of local schools, general practitioners and the borough cleansing station staff continued during the year to ensure where possible that all known cases, and their family and other contacts, are given a complete course of treatment. HANDICAPPED PUPILS Tower Hamlets children placed in special schools are as follows:- Handicap No. at Day Schools No. at Boarding Schools Blind - 4 Partially sighted 22 2 Deaf 24 4 Partially hearing 29 3 Educationally subnormal 385 134 Epileptic - 1 Maladjusted 62 94 Physically Handicapped 85 19 Delicate 135 39 Multiple Handicaps - 1 TOTALS 742 301 DEAF AND PARTIALLY-HEARING CHILDREN Children suspected of hearing loss are tested by health visitors at health centres. Where such loss is confirmed or there is any doubt, the child is referred to an audiology clinic and seen by a specialist and a teacher of the deaf. Action taken includes referral to hospital for treatment or for the issue of a hearing-aid, to school for the deaf and partially-hearing, or to a health centre for further observation where loss is slight. There are no special schools for this defect in the borough, children having to go to school either in Hackney or Islington. -76- Sixteen new cases were added to the deaf register during the year, the register now totalling 192. EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL CHILDREN The Education Act 1944 makes provision (a) for the statutory examination of children who may require special educational treatment and (b) as amended by the Mental Health Act 1959 for the examination of children who are deemed to be unsuitable for education at school, and for review examinations of such children. Children examined for these purposes during the year by specially qualified medical officers numbered 150. There are three schools in the borough for the education of these children who are medically examined each year. VISION During the year vision tests were carried out on 10,350 schoolchildren. HEALTH EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS At the beginning of this year an overall health education syllabus was drawn up and later offered firstly to schools in which invitations to work had been accepted, and then to all others who made enquiries for information, visual aids, etc. In these schools also, health education has been included as a subject in its own right on the timetables during the year, and the health education team can now work to achieve the wider and more even spread of information on health education topics which would appear to be socially necessary and justifiable from the point of view of prevention of disease in this area. It is felt that a greater interest in health education in schools which draw from catchment are as already visited by individual staff members would pay dividends towards the success of their future preventive work and it is hoped that this may yet receive consideration as a valuable aspect. The following subjects were dealt with at schools during the year:- Subject Occasions No. Participating General Health Topics 1,410 22,676 Mothercraft and Mental Health Sex Education and Veneral Disease 46 993 INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN SCHOOLS Notification is made by head teachers of pupils absent from school on account of infectious and other illnesses. Where the notifications from any particular school warrant further -77- investigation special visits are made and any necessary investigations carried out, including the taking of specimens for bacteriological examination, to ascertain the sources of,and contain, the outbreak. Notifications were received of 1,051 children so absent, german measles being the reason for the largest number viz. 275. ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE IN SCHOOLS Each school in the Borough is visited annually by public health inspectors for environmental hygiene inspection and results of their findings are reported to the Medical Adviser of the Inner London Education Authority. Visits were also made to schools by public health inspectors in connection with enquiries and investigations concerning infectious diseases. MINOR AILMENTS CLINICS Children suffering from minor ailments may be referred to minor ailments clinics where they are seen by a nurse and/or doctor and the appropriate treatment given. There are 8 such clinics situated in school treatment centres in the borough. Use of these clinics is gradually declining, although attendances this year totalled 20,967 compared with 19,246 last year. VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION RECORDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN, The percentage of school-children on school rolls immunised and vaccinated is as follows:Diphtheria Tetanus Poliomyelitis Smallpox 82.8 *58.4 82.2 54.1 *Children generally speaking only given opportunity during late 1950's. B.C.G. VACCINATION The arrangements continued during the year for vaccinating 13-year old schoolchildren against tuberculosis using B.C.G. 1,681 children being vaccinated. PART TIME EMPLOYMENT OF SCHOOLCHILDREN It is a requirement of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933/Education Act 1944, where children wish to take up part-time employment such as delivering newspapers, etc., that they be medically examined to ensure they are fit for the proposed employment. Children numbering 220 were examined for this purpose during the year, all being found fit for the employment proposed. SCHOOL DENTAL SERVICE The Principal School Dental Officer, Mr. D.F. Waller reports as follows:"The expansion and rational development of the dental services provided for the -78- Area's 34,000 school children have continued during 1968. The greatly improved image which was achieved during 1967 has been maintained and the confidence shown by the children, parents, teachers, administrators and professional colleagues working within and without the Borough's Health Services augurs well for the future. The progress which has been made towards achieving an efficient and comprehensive dental service stems from the combination of a young, happy and enthusiastic professional staff with the atmosphere which the modernization of clinics and their equipment produces. A review of most aspects of the dental service was contained in the 1967 report and this will not be repeated here. The principles and methods described therein continue to apply and it is hoped that the following remarks under similar headings will be read in conjunction with that report. Prevention The complete prevention of dental disease whilst a very practical possibi1ity in individual and enthusiastic cases where dental personnel, parents and children are willing to co-operate and to devote time and money on the procedures involved is still a rather remote objective when considered on a community basis. The chairside time involved counselling each child and their parents in the preventive oral hygiene procedures (including the use of a fluoride containing toothpaste) which can be carried out at home the analysis and control of the cariogenic features of our modern diet, and the strengthening of erupted teeth by the topical application of solutions which will reduce the amount of dental decay, is considerable and cannot be given to more than a small proportion of our potential patients. This essential part of our dental service is therefore only available to those parents and children who really care and come regularly to our clinics for treatment and advice. Prevention on a mass community can only be achieved by community measures and the most effective measure-the fluoridation of our water supplies is still not available to the Borough's children. The Council has been on record since 1965 as being in favour of fluoridation wi th the overwhelming majority of all the Local Authorities in the Metropolitan Water Board's area also being in favour. Perhaps 1969 may see an increase in the vociferous demand which will influence the Board to accede to the will of the majority of parents and the dental needs of all the children in the Board's area. During the year, in conjunction with the London Hospital Medical Col lege Dental School, a clinical trial of a fluoride containing mouthwash was commenced in two of the Area's secondary schools. Whilst the anticipated reduction in dental disease may not be as high as that which would be obtained from the fluoridation of water it may be found that this administratively difficult but attractive method of getting fluoride to children's teeth is a second best measure which could be used in other schools in the Borough. The effect of dental health education procedures and school dental inspections, particularly where they are combined with the use of dental health stamps and school dental counselling several times a term by dental auxiliaries in each class in all our primary schools, results in a vastly increased demand for treatment and attendance "at the dentist'. It is reasonable to assume that the most effective preventive measure available -79- to us at the moment is this type of stimulation of children to attend their own dentist i.e. general dental practitioner, school dental officer or the staff at the London Hospital Dental Department and thus achieving early treatment of small dental lesions and preventive therapy and advice. Inspection Regular school dental inspections continue and the object of inspecting primary schools every other term and secondary schools once each year has been achieved in almost every case. The percentage of children found to require treatment in all age groups examined has remained fairly constant at approximately 68%. The system of examination described in last year's report has been continued and the details of each child's dental treatment needs are sufficient to show each individual child's progress of disease and treatment pattern. It is therefore possible to inform parents, teachers and the dental personnel involved of the dental neglect or achievement of each child and thus stimulate the attention which each case deserves. Treatment The treatment provided in our clinics continues to be of a gratifyingly conservative nature. The number of fillings completed totalled 15,807 (9,119 in permanent and 6,688 in temporary teeth) whilst extractions were only 263 permanent and 799 temporary teeth. The ratios of permanent teeth filled to extracted being 38.5:1 (national average 5.3:1) and temporary teeth filled to temporary teeth extracted 8.3:1 (national average 0.6:1) which must be considered very satisfactory. The number of broken appointments at our clinics has been reduced to 39.6% which is a reasonable improvement during one year. The figure is still far too high and a system of informing both school and parent of each child's dental appointment will it is hoped reduce the broken appointment rate still further. As has been mentioned in previous reports the solution to the problem of broken appointments and of the dentally deprived child whose parents will never co-operate and take him/her to adental surgery for treatment can only be met in the long term by taking -80- TOWER HAMLETS CARNIVAL 1968 Dental Health Education dentistry to the child in school. Mobile dental caravans, very large schools equipped with dental surgeries or the provision of mobile dental equipment which can be taken into a school and set up on a temporary basis are the means by which such a policy can be implemented. Dentistry which is available in or alongside schools has been available in rural areas for many years. In urban areas this principle is only now being investigated. In Tower Hamlets we have been taking dentistry to our special schools in one of the ILEA mobile dental caravans during 1968 and this has proved very successful. There are no broken appointments, dentistry and dental equipment and dental personnel become part of everyday school life and apprehension is almost completely eliminated. The parents responsibility is perhaps regrettably somewhat reduced but equated against this disadvantage must be the fact that these schools are now on average more dentally fit than any other of the schools in the area. Dental Health Education Dental Health Educat ion activities have expanded considerably with the increase in the establishment of dental auxiliaries from one to three Each auxiliary spends one half of her total working time on dental health education activities. The primary schools in the area are divided into three sectors, each dental auxiliary being responsible for her own schools. The basic primary school programme includes a remit to visit each class in each school at least once each term, to follow up each school dental inspection with an individual approach to each child related to the result of their own dental inspection and to act in all ways as the school's link with dentistry. A theme is determined each term so that a similar programme may be followed throughout the Borough in each school. With the return of our dental health stamps in 1969 the administration of this scheme will also be carried out by the dental auxiliaries and the results of the use of dental health stamps will be integrated so that they form part of our programme of 'dental health in action'. Dental health education activities at the chairside are of course a routine part of normal dental treatment and the opportunity is taken to indoctrinate mothers in the need for and the ways of dental preventive procedures. During 1969 routine dental health education activities will become the responsibility of the dental officer to whom each of the secondary schools is attached. The demands on the time of all the professional dental staff has been such that this section of dental health education has had to be postponed to allow the more urgent needs of the younger children to be met. Teaching material is still supplied to science departments of local secondary schools and a project of 'Careers in Dentistry' is being evolved. A carnival float was again entered in the Borough Carnival this year by the dental staff (see photograph facing page 80). - 81 - Staff At December 31, 1968 the professional full time dental staff consisted of one Principal School Dental Officer, four full time and ten part time dental officers together providing a whole time equivalent of 8.9 (compared with 8.6 at December 1967). These Dental Officers are assisted by three full time dental auxiliaries who devote half their time to clinical dentistry and half to dental health education. The professional staff were assisted by ten full time dental surgery assistants and one full time clerk. It must be realized that the number of professional officers cannot possibly meet in full the examination and treatment needs of the children in the Borough particularly owing to the stimulation of the dental health education. Again attention must be drawn to a difficulty in recruiting dental surgery assistants because here again their unrealistic scale of pay particularly in the younger age groups can only attract those school leavers who wish to take up dental nursing to work in a general dental practice rather than the local authority service, Dealing as our service does almost exclusively with young children we need a particularly high calibre of dental surgery assistant and this person can only be attracted if we see fit to offer a salary at least comparable with that which can be obtained elsewhere in dentistry. Premises and Equipment The final stages of the modernization and redecoration programme which achieved so much in 1967 were reached this year with the provision of new dental units in both surgeries at Ida Samuel Dental Clinic at Underwood Road, X-ray developing machines and other items of minor dental equipment were provided where necessary together with new waiting room furniture. (See photographs facing this page). There remain only two surgeries in the Borough which require new modern dental units and it is hoped that these will be achieved next year. In the summer the new double surgery clinic at Leopold Street was opened. The dental suite comprises two dental surgeries, waiting room and office, the recovery room at present being used as temporary accommodation for the chiropody service. When the recovery room becomes available it is hoped that a day stay service will be developed for those children who cannot accept dental treatment any other way to achieve dental fitness by conservation under general anaesthesia. This service together with projects for handicapped and 'difficult' children will be commenced as soon as possible during 1969. Future plans include provision of a third (orthodontic) dental surgery at Ida Samuel - 82 - Re-equipped dental surgery at Wellington Way Centre Re-equipped dental surgery at Ruston Street Centre Clinic and the building of a three surgery preventive dental clinic at Watney Street (to replace Prunella Clinic), as mentioned last year but still awaiting achievement. The long waiting lists for treatment at Bromley and Wellington Way make the provision of a second surgery at each of these clinics highly desirable and the particular needs of patients in the Wapping area must be met. The new building which is being carried out in the Wapping area makes this a potentially more urgent problem as time passes. Special Services All the remarks and observations related to treatment of mentally and physically handicapped children, orthodontic treatment and treatment for children in residential homes made in the 1967 report still apply. It is hoped that a full orthodontic service will materialize in the new surgery at Ida Samuel Clinic during 1969, whilst the dental surgery at St. Leonards, Hornchurch is scheduled for re-equipment. Liaison with the London Hospital The unique relationship between the School Dental Department and the London Hospital Dental Institute andDental School and Dental Health Study Unit continued during the year. Groups of fifth year students have again been taken into the borough and have experienced at first hand the needs and demands of the school population for dentistry and how the school dental service fits into the community dental pattern of this area of London. An unexpected but gratifying result of this liaison with the clinical students has been the large increase in applications from newly qualified graduates for posts in this Borough and in the Inner London Education Authority's area.''
