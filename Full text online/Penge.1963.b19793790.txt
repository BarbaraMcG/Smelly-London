To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my annual report for the year 1963, and in doing so I must admit to having rather mixed feelings, because this is likely to prove the last Annual Report presented to the Council of Penge Urban District, as by the time the necessary statistics are available for 1964 Penge will have become part of the new Greater London Borough of Bromley. Looking back I feel that one of the most satisfying events was, as a result of an immunisation campaign, the elimination of diphtheria, and today I can report that for sixteen years there has not been a case of this disease in Penge. It can, however, still occur and the need for immunisation remains as important as ever. Turning to the Vital Statistics, it will be noted that the birth rate has again risen and so, unfortunately, the percentage of illegitimate births. There has been a rise in the death rate but this can be accounted for by the increasing proportion of elderly people among those who have died. In a district such as this there are always a number of old people living alone, and one must acknowledge the valuable work done by the various voluntary bodies on their behalf. A considerable amount of the Department's time has been occupied with inspections of houses with a view to my making representations for the declaration of clearance areas, and in spite of pressure of other work we have succeeded in keeping ahead of the schedule planned in 1960. Apart from a large number of cases of measles and an outbreak of Sonne Dysentery, the number of cases of infectious disease notified remained low, and there were no deaths among them. As this will be the last Annual Report that I shall present I would like to place on record my appreciation of the kindness and consideration I have received from members of the Council and the willing help given me bv the Officers and Staff, especially those of this Department. Also, I would wish to acknowledge the ready co-operation I have always received from my professional colleagues both in Public Health services and general practice. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 25,012 Population (Census 1961) 25,743 Home Population, Mid-year 1963 (estimated by Registrar-General) 26,120 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1963 £968,585 Sum represented by 1d. rate £3,928 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33.8, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the Old Crystal Palace, the greater part of which is in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools in the districts and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 263 men, 14 boys, 33 women and 7 girls, totalling 317, in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Live births 682 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 25.9 Stillbirths 11 Stillbirth rate per 1,000 live and still births 15.9 Total live and still births 693 Total infant deaths 17 Infant mortality rates (1) Total infant deaths per 1,000 live births 24.9 (2) Total infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 28.2 Neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 16.1 Early neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 14.6 Peri-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 30.3 Illegitimate live births per cent of the total live births 11.7 Maternal deaths (including abortion) Nil Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 total live and still births Nil There were no illegitimate infant deaths during the year. 5 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 682 compared with 644 in 1962. This gives a crude birth rate of 25.9 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 24.75 for 1962. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of comparability between local births is .87. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 23.4 compared with 22.5 for 1962. Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 11, equal to a rate of 15.9 of 1,000 total births, compared with 16.8 for 1962. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 358, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 13.7 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.2 for 1962. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local deaths is 1.09. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 14.9 compared with 11.1 for the year 1962. The death rate for England and Wales was 12.2 compared with 11.9 recorded for 1962. Deaths among the inmates of an institution for men numbered 32. A large proportion of deaths was of elderly people, and of the total deaths 261 or 72.9% were of persons 65 years of age and over compared with 69.5% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 45.9% of the deaths compared with 44.3% for 1962. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 61 giving a death rate for Home Population of 2.3, the same as for 1962. Fourteen males and 4 females died of cancer of the lungs. Tuberculosis There were two deaths from tuberculosis in Penge, giving a death rate of .076. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year. 6 Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 17, corresponding to a rate of 24.9 per 1,000 births, compared with rate of 21.7 for 1962. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 20.9. Ten of these infants died under one week and there were 4 deaths from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1963:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Total Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 25.9 15.9 13.7 24.9 England and Wales 18.2 17.3 12.2 20.9 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Board regularly carry out bacteriological examination and chemical analysis. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. 7 Public Cleansing House refuse is collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse is taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I desire to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1963, in which is set out the work of the Public Health Inspectors. During the year further houses in the Groves Area were surveyed and as a result were dealt with under the Clearance Procedure. Objections were taken in respect of some of the properties and a public inquiry was held. The Minister of Housing and Local Government, following the report of his inspector, upheld the Medical Officer of Health's representations made in respect of the properties in the various areas. No further action under the Housing Act 1961 was taken in respect of Houses in Multiple Occupation, action being suspended pending new legislation which it is anticipated will give more effective powers to local authorities to deal with this class of dwelling. Whilst marked progress has been made during the past four years to deal with unfit properties by clearance procedure, it is evident that the multiple occupancy of large Victorian type dwellings is increasing, the new occupants being in the greater part immigrants. The overcrowding situation both as regards to legal standards and amenity standards, appears to have intensified, but the extent thereof cannot be assessed without a complete survey of the district. Such a survey could only be carried out provided there was increased staff. No. 2 Smoke Control Order came into operation during the autumn. The area comprises 736 dwellings. The creation of a smoke control area entails much administrative work, and it will be noted that 1,293 visits were made during the year, many after official hours. It has been found that householders in general welcome smokeless zones and are anxious to co-operate. This will probably be the last report made by me, and will end the series of Chief Public Health inspectors' reports which commenced with the year 1901. Since that date the district has changed radically, as also has the work. In 1901 most of the work was concerned with infectious disease control; this year "Slum Clearance" and "Clean Air" made the greatest demands on the department. Finally, I would like to place on record the unfailing support I have received from the Members of the Council during my years of office, and my thanks to the Staff who have met all demands made of them.

As a result of this survey a further 47 houses were scheduled for clearance. Two dwellings were reported for closing orders. A closing order was made on one basement, and one closing order made on a basement was determined. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION Following survey the condition of several houses let in Multiple Occupation was reported to the Committee. The Council decided to defer taking action under the Housing Act 1961 and Regulations made thereunder, having regard to the experience gained in this matter. It will be noted that amending legislation to eradicate the difficulties experienced by local authorities has been brought before Parliament by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and it is anticipated this will be on the statute book in the near future. 18 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out. The classification of the various food businesses by type is as follows:— I. (a) Retail food shops (excluding cafes and restaurants and licensed premises) 224 (b) Cafes and restaurants 20 (c) Licensed premises 22 (d) Food manufacturers 23 (e) Bakehouses 4 (f) Food stalls 21 II.

Samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the methylene blue test with the following result:— Grade 1—16 Grade II—3 Grade III—3 Grade IV—1 Slaughterhouses There are no slaughterhouses in the district. Adulteration Kent County Council Sampling Officers took 118 samples of various foods and drugs in the district as follows:— 20 B/fwd. 44 Anti-Rheumatic Balm (Massage Cream) 1 Jardox 1 Jelly 1 Batter Mix 1 Junior C Prin 1 Beetroot 1 Lambs' Livers 1 Best Bitter Beer 1 Lemskin 1 Bitter Beer 1 Liquafruta 1 Blackcurrant Drink 1 Malt Vinegar 4 Borax and Honey 2 Margarine 1 Braising Steak 1 Milk 30 Broth Mixture 1 Minced Beef 2 Cheese Sauce 1 Oranges 2 Cherry Jam 1 Orange Drink 1 Chocolate Sponge Mix 1 Pancake Mix 1 Chopped Pork 1 Piccalilli 1 Corn Oil 1 Pine and Honey Syrup 1 Cough Linctus 1 Plain Flour 1 Creamed Horseradish 1 Radian B 1 Crunchie 1 Red Cabbage 1 Custard Powder 2 Rice 1 Dristan 1 Rum 1 First Step Haliborange 1 Scotch Cheddar 1 Friars Balsam 1 Self Raising Flour 2 Fruit Cake Mix 1 Semolina 1 Fruit Salad in Heavy Syrup 1 Soft Cream Cheese 1 Frying Steak 1 Sultanas 1 Gherkins 1 Sunny Spread 1 Gin 6 Sweet Pickle 1 Glinteel Pastilles 1 Tartare Sauce 1 Grapefruit 2 Tea 1 Ground Cinnamon 1 Throat and Catarrh Pastilles 1 Hamburger with Gravy 1 Tobasco Pepper Sauce 1 Home Bread Mix 1 Tomato Ketchup 2 Honey, Glycerine and Blackcurrant 1 Vitaminised Iron Tonic Tablets (with yeast) 1 Instant Coffee 1 Vitorange 1 Irish Stew 1 Whisky 3 Jaffa Orange Crush 1 Yeast Vite 1 C/fwd. 44 Total 118 Summary Milks 30 Drugs 18 Spirits 10 Other samples 60 118 21 All the above samples were satisfactory with the exception of the following:— Sample of Gin Analysis 61.7% Proof Spirit 11.9% added water Incorrectly labelled Action taken Written caution issued Makers agreed to required amendments The following contravention of the Food and Drugs Act was dealt with:— Offence Sale of sour milk from machine Result of Legal Proceedings Fined £5 and £5 5s. 0d. costs RENT ACT, 1957 The following is a summary of applications received under the provisions of the Act and subsequent action arising therefrom:— Certificates of Disrepair applications under 1957 Act 6 Notices of proposal to issue certificates served 4 Number of Certificates of Disrepair issued 1 Number of copies of Undertakings to carry out repairs received 3 FACTORIES ACT, 1961 Visits paid to factories totalled 263, and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, three written notices were served and complied with. These dealt mainly with insufficient and defective sanitary conveniences and want of cleanliness. Notices were received in respect of 11 residents who were employed in certain trades in their own homes, but working for occupiers of factories in other districts. In no case was it found that work was being done in unwholesome premises. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 No. 2 Smoke Control Order has, after a public inquiry which was held following an objection, been confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and came into operation on the 1st October, 1963. By reason of technological changes in the gas industry necessitating alteration in the above Act relative to grant for work of adaptation the survey of the third area has been temporarily postponed. It is hoped that this may be carried but during 1964. CANAL, BETTS PARK During the year fountains were installed to induce movement into the water. This resulted in the mitigation of the nuisance caused over a number of years during the summer from the offensive odour arising from decomposing vegetable matter, and from water breeding insects. 22 DESTRUCTION OF FERAL PIGEONS 24 During the year the Council engaged a contractor to destroy feral pigeons, the number of which has increased greatly during recent years. Work of destruction was commenced in May, and up to the end of the year the contractor reports that 1,290 birds were killed, 79 eggs taken and 52 nests destroyed. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 193 regarding rats and 70 mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. No major rat infestations were found. As in previous years the foul water sewers were treated on two occasions. In April 142 manholes and side entrances were baited and takes recorded in 13. The figures for October treatment were 96 manholes baited and takes recorded in 4.
