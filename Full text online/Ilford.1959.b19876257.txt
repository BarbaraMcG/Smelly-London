HUBERT HAMENCE, M.Sc., Ph.D. 7 Preface Phone PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES, VALentine 3401 ILFORD. July, 1960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Ilford. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I submit herewith the Annual Report of the Health Services for the year 1959. In this report I intend to make my preface brief, dealing mainly with the difficulties of the water supply in the eastern part of the borough. A feature that has led to this brevity is my policy of trying to make individual officers express their own opinions as to various developments. The Chief Public Health Inspector has some interesting ideas on the relationship of the Public Health Inspectorate to the Police; Miss Copping, Welfare Worker for the Aged, has as usual some most decided and personal views. A newcomer is Dr. Taylor, Assistant County Medical Officer, appointed to devote an appreciable portion of his time to health education. His views on the success and failure of different forms of such education are interesting and provocative. Officers are appointed to do their jobs properly, not to write entertainingly about them, so it cannot be expected that all have equal facility with the pen, therefore I hope that it will not be taken as a slur that I do not mention each one individually. In particular one group have not been asked to write at all, the administrative staff. This is because although the maintenance of the public health depends to an enormous extent on their efficiency the general public cannot be said to be much interested in the internal workings of the department. A FEW STATISTICS In 1958 the infant mortality rate of 16. 6 deaths per 1,000 births caused me to comment that it would be 8 cult to conceive that that extraordinarily low rate could be reduced much further. Well, it has been, to a new record of 14.9. Thirty three infants under one year of age died in 1959, 27 of them in the first month, leaving six deaths only that could not be described as neo-natal. Only ten years ago in 1949 for example, of the 53 infant deaths 33 were in the first month and 20 later. This comparison of 6 with 20 shows the success we are having in preventing and curing infectious disease, and the comparison of 27 and 33 neo-natal deaths the relative lack of success in dealing with that group where congenital defects and prematurity are so prominent a feature. Otherwise there is not much change in the statistics from the previous year. This unexciting statement conceals the fact that no mother died in childbirth, and there were no deaths from diphtheria, whooping cough, meningococcal infection, scarlet fever, enteric, infantile diarrhoea and measles. There was however, one death from poliomyelitis. However, problems of our modern times that are not so easily controlled are shown by 104 deaths from lung cancer (1958 - 88), coronary disease 326 (1958 - 310), suicide 28 (1958 - 20). These three groups of figures show the direction in which the future activities of the Medical Officer of Health must lie and that there is still much for him to do. MATTERS OF INTEREST I will briefly indicate here a few new features of the past year. A chiropody service has been introduced, B.C.G. vaccination (for tuberculosis) and poliomyelitis vaccination extended. Demand for day nursery accommodation is increasing and so is the domestic help service, which in addition has taken over the invalid night attendance service from the Ilford Social Service Association. One new clinic (Kenwood Gardens) has been opened and another (Heathcote) will probably be functioning by the time this report is read. Our midwives are now assisting in the training of pupils. Health education is being actively pursued with the appointment of an Assistant County Medical Officer who spends an appreciable portion of his time in such activities. Further details on all these matters will be found in the body of the report. Early in the year when the clinics in Valentines Mansion moved to Kenwood Gardens the opportunity was 9 taken to expand the accommodation available to the overcrowded health office staff. Some adaptations were also carried out and working conditions have greatly improved. WATER, WATER, EVERWHERE- But not a drop from your garden hose until 1965 at the earliest, if you live in that part of Ilford served by the South Essex Waterworks Company. (S.E.W.C. ) It is difficult to believe in this very wet first half of July 1960 that last summer was phenomenally dry. School kitchens on occasions were without adequate supplies for the provision of meals, toilets in schools and a cinema were without flushing facilities and the local hospital found itself in great difficulties. The S.E.W.C. attributed much of the trouble to excessive use of hosepipes for watering private gardens and on the 8th July "temporarily" prohibited their use. The western part of the borough is served by the Metropolitan Water Board (M.W.B. ) who can supply all the water required in their section, although even the Board noted a drop in water pressure in the evenings in the Clayhall area during that period due to abnormal garden watering. They anticipate no future difficulties. The future outlook in the S.E.W.C. section is however very different. Although the Hanningfield Reservoir has been recently completed, a new boosting station about to come into operation and a new main to be constructed from the Heaton Grange Reservoir (Romford) commencing this November, in order to meet the demand for domestic and industrial purposes up to 1965 garden watering must be suspended. To meet the demand in 1965 the S.E.W.C. are negotiating for a supply from the only river now available to them in the County (the name of the river is not disclosed to me). If, however, the Order from the Ministry for the abstraction of this water is not granted the situation will become serious until 1968, involving the strictest economy in the use of water for domestic and trade purposes. Why 1968? The M.W.B. now endeavour but cannot guarantee to let the S.E.W.C. have 3Â½ million gallons daily from their Lee Bridge Works and some deep wells. There is no hope of improvement from this source for the River 10 Lee is used to capacity. It is one of the miracles of modern water engineering that the M.W.B. water from the River Lee is pure and wholesome, although a quarter of its daily flow is treated sewage and industrial effluent from places like Luton, Harpenden, Wheathampstead, Hatfield and others. The real change will come when the M.W.B. can make Thames water available when present works are completed. A main of 102" diameter in a tunnel will lead ample supplies of this water from Hampton to Walthamstow. This work should soon be completed but enormous engineering development will still be required to ensure this water is adequately stored, filtered, sterilized and delivered. When this is completed in 1968 at the earliest, and if satisfactory arrangements are made between the M.W.B. and S.E.W.C. (no doubt the Ministry will ensure they will be made) our troubles will be over. At least, say the S.E.W.C. , until 1981. Who is to blame for all this? Obviously we cannot blame the S.E.W.C. for the shortage of water sources in Essex, but could they have foreseen this shortage and persuaded the M.W. B. to provide adequate quantities of Thames water years earlier. The S.E.W.C. seem very satisfied that 25 gallons of water per head per day is provided, locally for domestic purposes. This amount has been satisfactory in the past for the average Englishman* but in the sixties when we have never before had it so good with better houses and more baths, and vastly increased numbers of motor cars that have to be washed, and industry expanding, could it not have been foreseen that the individual demand would rocket towards quantities that may seem excessive to the S.E.W.C. but not to American water engineers? The present negotiations of the S.E.W.C. and M.W.B. began in 1956, should they not have started in 1950? Perhaps also the S.E.W.C. feel that they were not sufficiently consulted about the export of population from London to Essex, if so, did they make their difficulties sufficiently well known? We can hardly blame the M.W.B. for not planning sufficiently well aheadfor other supplying authorities. They obviously manage their own area of supply efficiently. Can we blame the local authorities? They are represented on the M.W.B. with which organisation we have no quarrel. The S.E.W.C. is a statutory water company and thus has no local authority representation on its board, it 11 provides us with no annual report and there is no method of liaison except by correspondence in times of trouble. Surely public relations, actively pursued, should be even more a policy of a water company than it is of some of our leading industrial concerns, who have made of public relations a foremost feature (even though such a company tries to increase the demand for its product, whereas the S.E.W.C. would only be too happy if the demand were less. ) Is there not food for thought in the fact that at the end of this decade the west portion of the town will be supplied by M.W.B. water directly and the east portion by M.W.B. water that has been sold to the S.E.W.C. ? ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS In conclusion I must again thank the staff in the Public Health Department, both borough and county, for their unstinted co-operation. The voluntary societies who help us in our daily tasks and blaze the trail with new ventures that statutory bodies cannot at first undertake, but are apt to take over when they prove successful; once more I thank them. I would also like to record my appreciation of the friendly assistance of fellow Chief Officers. I would like to express my thanks to the members of the Council, especially to the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Members of the Committees of the Ilford Borough Council and Essex County Council with whom I work. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, I. GORDON, Medical Officer of Health. *The Chief Public Health Inspector draws my attention to the second report of J.Simon, M.D., M.O.H. ,City of London, 1850, wherein he states that the Water Companies claimed then that they were supplying 21 gallons per head per day for domestic use.

RAINFALL Total rainfall registered in the district during the year was 16. 62 inches; the greatest fall in 24 hours was registered on 21st May, 1. 30 of an inch. December was the wettest month. 2. COMPARABILITY FACTOR - BIRTHS AND DEATHS. The Registrar-General supplies each town with figures known as the "area comparability factor" in connection with the birth and death rates. These factors make allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole. The death rate area comparability factors are also adjusted specifically to take account of the presence of any residential institutions in each area, and the birth rate area comparability factors are adjusted specifically to take account of the presence of sterile population in institutions for the mentally ill or mentally deficient in each area. The figures for Ilford are 1.00 for the birth rate and .99 for the death rate, and these are used in calculating these rates in Table 1A. When local crude birth and death rates have been adjusted (by multiplication by the appropriate area comparability factors) they are comparable with the crude rate for England and Wales or with the corresponding adjusted rate for any other area. 3. BIRTHS. The number ofbirths registered (adjusted for inward and outward transfers) during the year was 2,216. Males Females Legitimate 1,087 1,047 Illegitimate 40 42 i.e., 3.7 per cent. of the births registered were illegitimate. The percentage of illegitimate births registered in the previous 10 years was 3. 3 (1958), 2.7, 2.8, 2.6, 2.2, 3. 0, 3. 9, 2. 9, 3. 1, 2.4. 14 The adjusted birth rate, calculated on the estimated population of 178,600 is 12.41 per 1,000. 4. DEATHS. The total number of deaths of Ilford residents was 2,037. This is obtained by taking the total number of deaths registered in the district (1,682), subtracting the deaths of non-residents, occurring in the district (257), and adding the deaths of Ilford residents registered as having died in other districts (612). The number of deaths of non-residents registered in the district was as follows:- King George Hospital 86 Chadwell Heath Hospital 44 Claybury Hospital 67 Goodmayes Hospital 22 Other Non-residents 38 Total 257 The number of deaths of Ilford residents registered as having died in other districts during the year was as follows, and includes deaths at the following Institutions:- Oldchurch Hospital, Romford 82 Wanstead Hospital 38 Langthorne Hospital 69 London Hospital and Brentwood Annexe 74 St. Bartholomew's Hospital- 8 Rush Green Hospital 19 St. Joseph's Hospice, Hackney 15 London Chest Hospital 10 St. George's, Hornchurch 49 East Ham Memorial Hospital 8 Harold Wood Hospital 8 Whipps Cross Hospital 57 In other Hospitals, ions and residences outside the Ilford district 175 Total 612 15 The adjusted death rate, calculated on the estimated population of 178,600 is 11.29 per 1,000. Inquests.- During the year, 94 inquests were held on deaths occurring in Ilford, 65 on Ilford residents, and 29 on non-residents. The ages at death were as follows:- Under 1-2 2-5 5-15 15-25 25-45 45-65 65 years and 1 year years years years years years years upwards 1 2 3 10 30 48 DEATH RATES FROM CANCER, 1959.

The Medical Officer of Health and Deputy are authorised under Section 3(2) to enter and inspect any such licensed premises in the Borough. 21 No application for a licence was received during 1959. (viii) NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948.- The County Welfare Officer has kindly supplied me with the following information. "The County Welfare Committee is responsible to the County Council for functions under Part III of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the main aspects being:- (a) the provision of residential and temporary accommodation, and (b) welfare arrangements for blind and other handicapped persons. The following statistics show the extent to which the main services provided by the County Welfare Committee under the National Assistance Act, 1948, have been afforded to persons residing within the Borough of Ilford during the year 1959:- (1) Residential and Temporary Accommodation. (a) Aged persons admitted to hostels and other residential establishments:- 65 (b) Other persons admitted to residential accommodation:- 1 (c) Persons admitted to temporary accommodation:- Adults, 2; Children, 6;- 8. The County Council now have two Old Peoples' Homes in Ilford-Pegram House, Longhayes Avenue, Marks Gate, accommodating 47 residents and Heath Gate, Chadwell Heath Lane, Chadwell Heath which accommodates 60 residents. Additionally, financial grant is made by the County Council towards the cost of Welfare Services and amenities provided by the Borough in their special accommodation for old people at Stoneleigh Court. (2) Blind Persons The numbers of registered blind, partially sighted and defective sighted persons resident in the Borough as at 31st December, 1959, were as follows:- 22 (i) Registered as blind 323 (ii) Partially sighted 63 (iii) Defective sighted 14 all of whom were under the supervision of the County Council's Home Teachers. During the year 3 blind residents participated in the Home Workers' Scheme operated through the agency of the Royal London Society for the Blind, and I was employed in aWorkshopfor the Blind. In addition, 30 blind and 7 partially sighted residents were employed in open industry. During 1959, 2 blind residents from the Borough were admitted to homes for the blind. (3) Deaf or Dumb and other Handicapped Classes. The Welfare Committee of the County Council has continued to develop its activities in respect of welfare services for permanently and substantially handicapped persons (other than blind, as mentioned above) as provided for under Section 29 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and in addition to direct provision such as special equipment on loan, grants towards the cost, of structural adaptations to meet special needs, etc. the fullest co-operation has been maintained with specialised organisations in this field of welfare services, many of these bodies actting as the Council's agents in this connection. An Occupational Centre for the physically handicapped has been opened at Barking and this is used, amongst others, by suitable handicapped persons from the Borough of Ilford. In addition, Visiting Officers have been appointed to assist in the work amongst handicapped persons and they will be instrumental in the ascertainment of individual needs, giving advice and also instruction in handicrafts, especially to the home-bound." In Ilford the scheme for other handicapped persons, sofar as voluntary action is concerned, has been delegated to a Sub-Committee of the Ilford Social Service Association of which the Medical Officer of Health is Chairman. 23 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. (a) Section 47 provides for the removal of persons to hospital who are unable to devote to themselves proper care and attention. Two persons were dealt with during the year. They were a male aged 76 years and a female aged 86 years. Both were admitted to hospital. (b) Section 50 requires a Local Authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of a person who has died or been found dead, and where it appears to the Local Authority no suitable arrangements are being made for the disposal of the body. The burial of one person was dealt with during the year, a male, aged 83 years, who died at home. Miss M.J. Copping, Welfare Officer for Old Folk, reports as follows:- "During the year 1959, 679 visits were paid to elderly people, and 300 interviews conducted at the Public Health Offices, and elsewhere with relatives of the old people, other case workers, Almoners, Clergy and various persons with an interest in the cases. Many of the visits and interviews must, to meet the convenience of relatives, take place in the evenings or occasionally on Saturday afternoon or even on Sundays. The above visits exclude 699 visits to the elderly made by the Essex County Council Health Visitors and friendly visits made by voluntary persons which, I believe, have increased since last year. Certainly the number of visitors has increased, and I would like to record my thanks and appreciation of the efforts of those who so generously spare a little time from what are without exception very busy lives, to brighten the lives of the elderly and physically handicapped and incidentally assist me too by so doing. I am doubly grateful to those who have come to my aid immediately in some emergency and those who have provided transport to and from stations for old persons proceeding on convalescent holidays. Many 24 find walking to the public transport or mounting bus steps very difficult. The visits paid by me were almost identical in character to those paid last year. Approximately half were to persons awaiting admission to, or recently discharged from, the Geriatric Unit. This Unit is a tremendous blessing. No longer do we have cases referred to us by worried general practitione rs who cannot obtain beds. There are times when there is a waiting period of a week or two, but I think it is correct to say that no urgent case had to wait during 1959- My once weekly visits to the Unit continued throughout the year and I always look forward to them with pleasure. As for the old persons themselves, the majority of those admitted to the Unit thoroughly enjoyed their stay, and I find them full of praise for the medical and nursing staffs, and that sometimes forgotten, but exceptionally cheerful and compassionate section, the ambulance personnel. We do occasionally have a few grousers but these are invariably persons who by reason of their disabilities or their temperaments would not be happy and comfortable in any place. There are also those who, as the result of senile changes, are mentally incapable of settling down in Hospital or of understanding and appreciating what is done for them. My experience is that such persons become more confused when removed from their own familiar surroundings and unless there is some physical condition which necessitates Hospital care, they are better in their own homes with the help of domiciliary services. On the other hand, relatives and friends very understandably seek, and indeed require, a breakfrom them, but admission toHospital could sometimes be avoided if all the members of a family would pull their weight, and pool their resources. I do not agree with a current idea that families grow more inclined year by year to depend upon the Welfare State and to leave their old people to the care of the authorities, but I do find that there is a tendency to take it for granted that one particular member should take the entire responsibility, sometimes the eldest is thought to be the one whose duty is the greater; some men insist that they are exempt because "nursing is a woman's job". It does not seem to occur to them that the actual nursing is not 25 the only factor to be considered and that they could help by sitting with the patient occasionally or by arranging an outing by car, by pushing the invalid chair, or giving a little financial help which would lighten the task in some way. I am glad to say that this attitude more frequently arises out of sheer thoughtlessness than from deliberate unkindness or callousness, and when it is pointed out to a large family that one member has been carrying more than the fair share of a burden, the remainder generally respond. The most difficult type of visiting is that which results from complaints from members of the same household or neighbours about the old persons antisocial behaviour or dirty habits. These too usually arise from senility but the average citizen knows little about it unless they experience it within their own family circle. Many sons and daughters come to me in great distress labouring under an impression that their parentis suffe ring some very rare changes and is mental. They begin to fear mental instability in the family and to look for it within themselves. When I explain that these changes are common among persons of advanced years, they are much relieved. Of the 300 persons interviewed, about one third were relatives who came to discuss difficulties arising out of senility. In many cases the old persons themselves came to have a chat about their seriously failing memory or their inability to rise to the standards of cleanliness which were formerly their habit. The remaining interviews were mainly concerned with housing problems. There were persons whose landlords wish to gain possession of the property to sell it, persons living with younger generations of their family who find the noise of teenagers, or the lack of privacy, unbearable; others living alone who find the extreme silence insupportable, or who worry about the expenses, the uncultivated garden, etc. They all think that they want a little old age pensioners flat. For many it would be the ideal thing but as the demand is so much greater than the supply, in most instances I advise and encourage them to make the best of their present accommodation. 26 There have been many publications of late entitled "Preparing for Old Age" etc. , and a definite effort is being made in the field of social case work to encourage those in middle life to look ahead and plan for their retirement. This I think is a good thing. I would like to see the utmost effort made to encourage persons to take a long and thoughtful look at their accommodation in early middle life and to ask themselves "will I be able to climb those stairs, descend that rear doorstep, get into that particular bath, afford the repairs and maintenance, and either till or find someone else to till that particular garden when I am elderly?". Then while still earning and able to afford it, an extra handrail can be added to the staircase, perhaps two shallow door steps take the place of one steep one, a shallower bath be installed, the money be put aside to thoroughly repair and redecorate the premises a year or so before retirement, or perhaps an annuity purchased to help with rates. Or even better, it might be possible to make a move to a bungalow or to a smaller property, or a move nearer to transport, shops, and other amenities. The percentage of aged among our population increases year by year. We cannot allow people to take it for granted that they can go blithely on without giving a thought to such things until the day after retirement and then expect the local authority to be able to arrange rehousing. Some of those to whom we were obliged to explain that there is little hope of Ilford Borough Council ever being in a position to offer them housing accommodation decided to apply to Essex County Council for Part 3 accommodation. Sixty-six persons were referred by either Dr. Dunn or myself to the Welfare Department of the County. A few have been admitted but the average waiting period for any but extremely urgent cases seems to be about 18 months. A few persons with a little capital to spend, or with relatives able to give them financial assistance for a limited period, go to Private Homes pending an offer of accommodation. A very considerable proportion of my time is spent in seeking this accommodation, and in replying to letters and telephone enquiries relating to persons on the Part 3 waiting 27 list. These are from people who expect the Medical Officer of Health or myself to be in a position to expedite admission. I also interview a large number of callers making enquiries about the accommodation or complaining that they or their relatives have waited so long that they have given up hope. Unfortunately for me, but conveniently for himself, the Essex County Council's Area Welfare Officer is sufficiently remote inhis office at Romford to escape much of the work involved in dealing with these callers. Old people either cannot travel so far because of a disability or because they cannot afford the fare and their relatives find it inconvenient because of their hours of employment or domestic ties. The finding of holiday accommodation for the elderly is now becoming a regular part of my day to day duties. It is not difficult to find accommodation for the physically and mentally sound but unfortunately I am frequently expected to be able to arrange it free of charge. There is in fact a growing tendency throughout the country to expect the State to provide free holidays, free outings and free travel in public transport to every old age pensioner. It is necessary to maintain a sense of proportion about such appeals. With the ever increasing percentage of elderly among the population, we must take a long term view, and consider not only whether we can afford these concessions now but whether there may be twice as many persons requiring them in ten years time, and half as many persons in the wage earning age group of the population to pay the rates, taxes and contributions which pay for the concessions, bearing in mind that once such concessions are made withdrawal is almost impossible. People are inclined to overlook the fact that many a person in receipt of a state retirement pension, commonly called "an Old Age Pensioner" has another income, such as superannuation or an annuity, and is not a needy person. He may even have considerable capital in addition to his incomes. We are, I believe, in danger throughout the whole of this country of having a multiplicity of theoretical schemes or services for the elderly to create an impression, rather than a few well run reliable 28 services to satisfy proven demands. I would like to seethe existing services, especially the domiciliary ones, brought to perfection before we embark upon new schemes. The domiciliary services are understaffed and therefore inadequate. This seems to be due to poor remuneration or reliance upon unpaid volunteers. Each year I become more convinced that the best place for an old person to live in is his or her own home, and in order to make this possible we need to increase the scope and quality of the existing domiciliary services which are in themselves good practical services. Other activities in which I took part during the year were discussions and informative visits with overseas students on Health Education Courses, attendance at a Home Safety Session at CentralHall, Westminster, a visit to a Day Centre at Romford, and attendance at various local committee meetings as in former years. Some of my off duty time is spent serving on Committees at Canning Town Settlement, where I am the present Chairman of the Citizens Advice Bureau Committee. These contacts are useful in many ways. Among other things the Settlement has a Home for the Elderly where several people from Ilford are at present in residence. Before terminating my report I would like to make mention of the various organisations who invited me to talk to their members during the year. Evening addresses were given to The League of Jewish Women, the Toc H Womens Association (ilford and Barkingside Branches) and afternoon addresses to the Cradle Roll Fellowship of the Presbyterian Church. The questions asked and the knowledge revealed by these appreciative audiences left me in no doubt that there is a very considerable amount of sympathy and interest among the people of Ilford for the very large number of elderly persons residing in the town and for those who are engaged in trying to make their remaining years a time of contentment and happiness." The laundry service for cleansing of soiled bed linen and personal clothing continued to operate throughout the year, proving of invaluable assistance in very difficult cases. 29 During the year 80 persons were assisted and 13,307 articles were laundered.

(x) AMBULANCE FACILITIES: COUNTY AMBULANCE SERVICE. The County Ambulance Service is provided and administered centrally by the Essex County Council. An Ambulance Control at Ilford deals with all requests for ambulance transport arising in the whole of the Metropolitan Area of Essex. The Control is manned continuously, is in direct contact with all Ambulance Stations in the Metropolitan Area of the County and with the Divisional Control at Chelmsford. The Control which is equipped with two-way radio, is also in direct communication with ambulance vehicles operating in the area. In cases of emergency it is only necessary to dial 999. All other requests for ambulance transport should be made, preferably in writing, to the Controller, Ilford Ambulance Control, Aldborough Road, Ilford, or in cases of urgency by telephone (Valentine 8822). 31 Requests for ambulance transport, other than emergency requests, are only accepted from Doctors, Midwives, Duly Authorised Officers and the medical staff of hospitals. General medical practitioners, when arranging a patient's admission or first appointment at a hospital, inform the hospital concerned that ambulance transport is necessary and the hospital is then responsible for ordering the ambulance transport. If any difficulty should arise in obtaining an ambulance, a call may be made direct to the Controller, Ilford Ambulance Control, Valentine 8822, or to the County Medical Officer of Health, County Hall, Chelmsford, Chelmsford 3231.

The Chief Public Health Inspector reports as follows:"HOUSING ACT 1957 The Council's five year programme has been in large measure implemented. The deterrent to full fruition lies in the lack of available rehousing sites. Though Ilford has not got a major slum clearance problem, there yet remain areas of poor property which will have to be dealt with under housing legislation. An ameliorative procedure might be secured if private speculative developers were to construct dwellings vertically rather than horizontally. It is appreciated that most families prefer a garden site with a separate dwelling, but if they wish to reside within close proximity to the Metropolis, open space must be sacrificed for living space. The department will investigate the possibilities of the making of a Re-development Area in order to provide some space for re-housing purposes, yet retaining those properties which are not sub-standard. CLEAN AIR ACT 1956 The Council have decided to formulate a proposed Smokeless Zone and to this end a detailed inspection has been made of the Padnall Road, Billet Road and Marks Gate area. Should this proposal fructify, earnest consideration will be given to its extension across Eastern Avenue to the area south thereof. The complaints regarding general emissions of smoke were not so numerous as in previous years. Industry is obviously viewing its responsibility under the Act with some care. 37 THE LITTER ACT 1958 This new piece of legislation is to provide not only an amenity by keeping the country litter-free and tidy, but also to afford a reduction in the high cost of refuse collecttion and road sweeping. It enables any person, not merely the local authority, to institute proceedings against persons depositing litter in any street, road or other place to which the public have access. I have not yet heard of a private individual taking proceedings for an offence though the Council have successfully summoned offenders against the Statute. It would seem that the best means of securing the object of the Act is to take legal proceedings for breachesa step not generally acceptable, but efficacious when the public refuse to accept their responsibilities. The purpose of the Public Health Inspectors will be to educate if possible, and recommend prosecutions on non-acceptance of this proposal. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS (DUTIES) The modern conception of the work of these officers is markedly different from that in the nineteenth century. He is not now a strict sanitarian dealing only with the "filth nuisances" which produced the primary public health statutes; he is a person who executes legislation under the direction of the local authority, to secure normal comfort in the environment of the public. The task is now rather more protective than preventive. For some years there has been a shortage of qualified inspectors with the result that there has been an infiltration of partially trained personnel into the service. Happily this trend is disappearing, due no doubt to the splendid response by local authorities to the Government's studentship campaign. It has also been noted with some concern that there is a grave shortage of policemen to afford proper public protection against crime. Some mitigation of this defect might be secured if these officers were to be relieved of such local government administration functions relating to- 38 (a) Weights and measures; (b) Diseases of Animals Acts; (c) Petroleum inspection and licensing; (d) Sampling officers' duties under the Food and Drugs Act; (e) Licensing and inspection of hackney carriages; (f) The Welfare and Health work under the Shops Act; all of which could be expeditiously performed by the officers of a local authority, particularly the Public Health Inspector. This anomaly of utilising police officers for local authorities is the direct result of the transfer of the truly local authority functions from the Justices of the Peace who had previously dealt with local affairs both judicial and local. Many Royal Commissions and Parliamentary Committees have stated that the police should not be used for health purposes- neither for that matter ought they to be used in the modern systems of health and social welfare, especially as they are in such short supply. It may be suggested that the police form a local authority service, but strictly speaking it is a national service which ought to be paid for by the nation to safeguard the general public against breaches of the criminal law. All other duties ought to be transferred from the "Watch Committees" to the "Sanitary Authorities", with of course a grant increase equal to that formerly paid for the police officer, e.g. fifty per cent of the cost. " (i) WATER SUPPLY.- The district is served by the Metropolitan Water Board and South Essex Waterworks Co. The subject of the water supply of the Borough was dealt with at length in the Report for 1945. Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination of the Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly supplied me with the following information. "Samples of the water at all stages of purification are submitted to chemical and bacteriological examination daily in the Laboratories. The part of Ilford in the area of the Board is supplied with water derived from the River Lee, filtered and 39 chlorinated at the Lee Bridge works and Ferry Lane works and then pumped into supply. An additional amount of water is supplied to the Ilford area from Ferry Lane and Wanstead wells. Contact tajiks are in operation at these works in which the dose of chlorine is able to exert its full effect before the water passes into the distribution system. During 1959 a total of 1,528 samples were examined. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to supply water to consumers and samples of water from them are tested to confirm that the quality of the water is up to that normally supplied. The length of main laid by the Metropolitan Water Board in Ilford during 1959 was 1,209 yards of 4 inch and 1 yard of 3 inch. " The water provided to the remainder of the Ilford district by the South Essex Waterworks Co. is obtained from the River Stour and from deep wells at Mill Road, Grove Road and Roding Lane. Mr. Hugh G. Ramsey, Engineer to South Essex Waterworks Co. , has kindly supplied me with the following information. "During 1959 over 4,130 chemical, bacteriological and biological examinations were made at the Langham Laboratory, and all water going into supply was reported as wholesome. In addition samples were examined for radioactivity. Samples taken from the wells situated in the Company's statutory area were analysed weekly and all were likewise reported on as above; in addition samples were taken weekly from houses in various parts of the supply area for bacteriological examination and they were invariably perfectly satisfactory. A supplementary supply of water was obtained from the Metropolitan Water Board during the months of June, July, August, October, November and December, the total quantity supplied being 165 million gallons. 40 The water supply of the area and of its several parts has been satisfactory as to quality and quantity, but, owing to the exceptionally high demand during the extreme drought period, the pressures were at times less than normal. The following mains were laid inllford during 1959:- 3" 4" 6" 9" 12" 15" 18" 21" Yards 86 84 28 72 5 12 32 1459" There are now no public wells in existence. There are a few private wells for domestic and commercial purposes. Four samples of piped water supply (l South Essex Waterworks Co., and 3 Metropolitan Water Board) were taken by the Department and submitted for Chemical and Bacteriological examination, and all gave satisfactory analyses. (ii) PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS.- There are three public swimming baths in the Borough. Two indoor, 120,000 gallons and 66,000 gallons respectively and one open-air, of 250,000 gallons approximately. Mains water supply is used in all cases and the method of treatment is by breakpoint chlorination. The water is normally changed once annually in the case of the larger indoor bath and the openair bath, which are closed during the winter months. The smaller indoor bath is, however, in ope ration throughout the whole of the year, and as is the case with all the baths, is "topped up" as necessary. Five samples of water for examination were taken from the open-air swimming bath from April to September. The samples were satisfactory. Twelve samples were also taken from the two indoor baths during January, March, April, May, June, July, August, September and November: all the samples were satisfactory and of a high standard of bacterial purity. (iii) DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.- The Borough Engineer has kindly supplied me with the following:- 41 Main Drainage Progress continued on the relief of flooding in the Borough. The following schemes were completed during the year, viz: (a) Vicarage Lane Soil and Surface Water Sewer Â£300,000 (b) Roding Lane South Surface Water Sewer Â£3 , 963 (c) Grove Road, Roxy Avenue and rose Avenue Surface Water Sewer Â£26,655 with resulting relief of flooding in these areas. Considerable progress has been effected on the following schemes which commenced during the year, viz:- (a) Roding Valley Mid-Level Soil Sewer - Stage 1 Â£99,787 (b) Ley Street/Horns Road Soil and face Water Sewers Â£161,524 In addition to the above, works on the following schemes have recently commenced:- (a) High Road, Chadwe 11 Heath Â£48,779 (b) Hainauit - Trelawney Road Surface Water Sewer - Stage 1 Â£200,500 RIVERS AND STREAMS Flooding.- A number of cases of flooding due to surcharge of sewers and watercourses in times of heavy rain were reported. Pollution of Streams.- There was no pollution of consequence reported during the year. (iv) COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF REFUSE.The Borough Engineer also kindly supplied the following information:- 42 Tons Total amount of refuse collected and disposed of 51,134 Collection of Salvage:â€” Tons Income Wastepaper 1,069 Â£7,904 Raps and Scrap Metal 119 Â£1,149 (v) SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.- The following is a summary of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year:- Ilouses and premises inspected 30,512 Houses and premises reinspectcd (work in progress) 24,560 Visits during disinfection 405 Houses in which nuisances were detected 769 Mouses in which nuisances were abated 785* Premises disinfected 24 Premises from which articles only disinfected 26 Articles disinfected 334 Premises disinfested for verminous conditions 28 ^Includes 135 nuisances detected before 1st January, 1959.

Complaints. - During the year 3,008 complaints of nuisances were received and investigated. The following is a summary:- Accumulation of manure and refuse 57 Animals improperly kept 30 Bad smells 76 Dampness of premises 83 Defective drains, w.c.s and fittings 604 Defective roofs, gutters, downpipes, etc. 53 Defective water fittings 53 Dirty and verminous houses 29 Dirty condition of rearway 14 Flooding of premises 15 Overcrowding 24 Smoke nuisances 96 Defective or no provision of dustbin 593 Hats and mice 565 Miscellaneous 716 Total 3,008 43 (vi) SHOPS ACT, 1950 (Section 38).- Since this Act came into operation the Public Health Inspectors have made inspections in accordance with Section 38. During the year 90 inspections were made, 2 Statutory Notices and 3 Preliminary Notices were served. 1 Statutory and 3 Preliminary Notices (l served prior to 1959) were complied with. No Certificates of Exemption from the provisions of Section 38 were granted in 1959. (vii) SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS ACT, 1933 to 1954.No licence to act as slaughterman was granted during the year. (viii) RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951.- Registration has been granted in respect of 15 premises, where filling materials, as specified in the Act, are used. The occupier of registered premises may only obtain "rag flock" from premises licensed under the Act, either for the manufacture of rag flock or as a rag flock store. No licence was issued in 1959 in respect of premises used as a rag flock store. (ix) LAND CHARGES ACT, 1925,- During the year 4,467 enquiries were dealt with under this Act. (x) ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.- Complaints were received of alleged smoke nuisance from 14 factories in the Grove Road, Redbridge Lane, Newbury Park, Green Lane and Ilford Lane areas. In 10 instances no emission was noted which would have enabled action to be taken under the Public Health Act, 1936, or Clean Air Act, 1956. Four informal notices were served in other instances. Three stations for measurement of atmospheric pollution have been installed in the Borough as follows:- No. 1 - Gantshill Library No. 2 - John Bramston School No. 3 - Ilford Town Hall. Each stationhas a deposit gauge a lead-peroxide instrument and a volumetric apparatus.

The Chairman of the Public Health Committee also made reference at a number of Council meetings to health subjects. Poster displays regarding Diphtheria immunisation, Poliomyelitis vaccination and health topics were also given prominence. EXAMINATION OF OFFICERS AND SERVANTS. The following medical examinations were carried out during 1959:- Officers Servants New Appointments 30 44 Under Sickness Regulations - 17 On behalf of othe r Authorities 5 - Total 35 61 In addition enquiries were made of General Practitioners and Hospitals in respect of numerous cases, referred under Sickness Regulations, which were not subsequently medically examined at the Public Health Offices. 69 MASS RADIOGRAPHY. A mass radiography survey was conducted in Ilford from October 19th to December 15th 1959 (8 weeks and 2 days). The Unit was located at the Thompson Rooms, Fullwell Cross, at hotel car parks in Eastern Avenue, High Road, Seven Kings, Ilford Lane, Redbridge Lane and Gantshill, and at two factories. Dr. H.

BIRTHS. - In accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, all live births and all stillbirths of twenty-eight weeks gestation and over must be notified within 36 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which the birth took place. The number of live births notified in Ilford under this Act during 1959 was 1,802 (911 males and 891 females), of which there were 108 (57 males and 51 females) where the ordinary place of residence of the parents was outside Ilford. In addition 529 notifications of live births (275 males and 254 females) which took place outside the district, although the ordinary residence of the parents was in Ilford, were transferred to this district. There were also 41 stillbirths (26 males and 15 females) .notified in Ilford including 4 (3 males and 1 female) where the home address of the parents was outside the district, and notifications of 11 stillbirths (5 males and 6 females) which took place outside the district, although the ordinary residence of the parents was in Ilford, were transferred to this district. This represents a total of 48 where the home address was in Ilford, whereas the RegistrarGeneral has allocated 49 stillbirths to Ilford. The following table shows the causes of the 48 stillbirths notified where the usual residence of the parents was in Ilford:- 74 STILLBIRTHS 1959 Cause of Stillbirth Delivery in Nursing Home Delivery at Home Delivery in Hospital TOTAL Anencephaly - - 6 6 Asphyxia - 1 6 7 Atelectasis - - 1 1 Calcified Placenta - - 1 1 Cerebral Haemorrhage - - 1 1 Displacement of Heart - 1 - 1 Foetal Abnormalities - - 3 3 Hydrocephalus: Spina Bifida - - 1 1 Intra- and Ante-Partum Haemorrhage - - 3 3 Intra-Uterine Death - - 1 1 Maceration - 1 2 3 Placental Insufficiency - - 4 4 Post-Maturity - - 1 1 Prolapsed Cord - - 1 1 Prolonged Labour - - 2 2 Rhesus Incompatibility - - 2 2 Ruptured Uterus - - 1 1 Toxaemia - - 6 6 Unknown - 2 1 3 Totals - 5 43 48 CARE OF PREMATURE INFANTS.- Of the 1,802 live births occurring in Ilford during 1959, 77 weighed 5Â½ lb. or less at birth; 11 of these babies were born on the district and 66 in Hospital (including 11 where the home address of the parents was outside Ilford). 75 Of the 11 babies born at home:- 7 were nursed entirely at home; 4 were transferred to hospital; All survived at the end of one month. Of the 66 babies born in hospital:- 1 died during the first 24 hours; 3 died between the ages of one day and one month (including 1 where the home address was outside Ilford); 62 survived at the end of one month (including 10 where the home address was outside Ilford). In addition, 40 notifications were received of births outside the district where the ordinary residence of the parents was in Ilford and the weight of the infant at birth was 5j lb. or less. Of these there were:- 7 who died within the first 24 hours (in hospital); 1 who died between the age of one day and one month (in hospital); 32 who survived at the end of one month. INFANT MORTALITY.-The number of infants dying within the first year of life was 33, the total number born being 2,216. The latter figure is supplied by the Registrar-General for calculating infant and maternal mortality rates. The infant mortality, or rate of deaths per 1,000 live births, was therefore 14. 9, the lowest on record for Ilford. The following table gives the deaths of infants under one year of age, classified according to age:- 76 INFANT DEATHS 1959.

The following table shows the comparison for Ilford, England and Wales and London for the past 10 years:- Year Ilford England and Wales London 1959 14.9 22 22 1958 16.6 23 23 1957 17.1 23 22 1956 15.6 24 21 1955 20.0 25 23 1954 18.7 25 21 1953 20.2 27 25 1952 18.9 28 24 1951 21.0 30 26 1950 18.7 30 26 NEONATAL MORTALITY.- The death-rate of infants under four weeks of age is known as the Neonatal Mortality. There were 27 deaths of infants under four weeks of age during 1959 and the rate for the year was 12.2 per 1,000 live births. The figures for the past 10 years are as follows:- Year Number Rate 1959 27 12.2 1958 29 13.0 1957 30 13.5 1956 25 11.8 1955 30 14.3 1954 29 13.2 1953 34 15.2 1952 32 13.8 1951 40 16.8 1950 32 13.3 ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS AND DEATHS. - 82 of the live births registered (40 males and 42 females) were illegitimate, that is 3. 7% of the births registered. 78 One illegitimate child died under one year of age. The following table shows the birth and death rates of legitimate and illegitimate infants for the past ten years:- Year Legitimate infants Illegitimate Infants Live Births Percentage of Registered Births Deaths Rate per 1,000 Legitimate Live Births Live Births Percentage of Registered Births Deaths Rate per 1, 000 Illegitimate Live Births 1959 2.. 134 96.3 32 15.0 82 3.7 1 12.2 1958 2, 155 96.7 36 16.7 73 3.3 1 13.7 1957 2, 158 97.3 38 17.6 61 2.7 - - 1956 2,056 97.2 30 14.6 59 2.8 3 50.8 1955 2,045 97.4 40 19.6 55 2.6 2 36.4 1954 2, 145 97.8 40 18.6 48 2.2 1 20.8 1953 2, 164 97.0 43 19.9 67 3.0 2 29.9 1952 2,232 96.1 44 19.7 91 3.9 - - 1951 2,306 97.1 49 21.2 70 2.9 1 14.3 1950 2,332 96.9 41 17.6 74 3.1 4 54.0 The Chelmsford Diocesan Moral Welfare Association continued to undertake the care of the unmarried mother and her child on behalf of the County Council and there has been direct co-operation through their Moral Welfare Workers for this district. In addition, all cases are followed up by the Health Visitors. HEALTH VISITORS AND SCHOOL NURSES.- Miss J.M. Oliver, Superintendent Health Visitor, reports:- "Having made my debut last year it would be a pleasant taskto be able to announce something spectacular about the Health Visitors' work for 1959. Happily the service continues, although we are still not fully staffed. 79 I should like to pay tribute to the Health Visitors who are carrying on prepared to tackle any problem, visiting the homes in all weathers, either by cycling or on foot. To the Clinic Nurses who attend the routine clinics relieving the Health Visitors for more important jobs. Also to the Tuberculosis Visitors who by tact and persuasion bring the people to the Chest Clinic. What we achieve can never be evaluated in print, our main aim being to assist everyone, where possible, to attain complete mental and physical fitness. Our Mothercraft and Relaxation Classes continue to run successfully. The Mothers' Club at Manford Way continues to be very popular, and added to this is an additional one at Cecil Hall. Many requests for the Health Visitors to talk were received from Boy Scouts, St. John's Cadets, Young Wives' and Mothers' Unions, and the talks were on many varied subjects. Sixty-seven homes were visited this year to enquire how patients were after hospitalisation due to home accidents. It is unfortunate that people should be so badly incapacitated, needing hospital care, very often as the result of some simple misfortune or folly in the home. It is here too that we meet many elderly folk needing considerable assistance. Our work has increased amongst the physically handicapped people, and aids, though sometimes small, assist towards greater independence. The link with Voluntary Agencies continues and much helpful assistance on both sides comes from my being invited to be a member of the Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Physically Handicapped Committee held locally. Various students continue to visit us, usually to broaden their knowledge of Public Health Services. Two Student Health Visitors came for their practical training in October 1959. As new clinics are built it is hoped to extend our teaching activities." 80 At the end of the year there were 18 full-time and 3 part-time qualified Health Visitors and School Nurses in addition to the Superintendent Health Visitor, and 5 Clinic Nurses. The following is a summary of the home visits made by the Health Visitors and Clinic Nurses during 1959 as far as Part III Services are concerned:- First visits to newly-born infants 2,309 Subsequent visits to children under 1 year of age 6, 106 Subsequent visits to children over 1 year of age and under 5 15, 521 Visits to expectant mothers 1, 131 Home visits for other reasons (inc. 699 visits to old folk) 3,613 Total visits paid 28,680 In addition there were 6,581 visits paid where no reply was received. The arrangements made in 1957 for the Health Visitor serving in the area in which his practice is situated to assist at the baby clinic held by one of the general practitioners once a month, have continued and have proved most satisfactory. As was reported last year, with a view to increasing the degree of co-operation between the Department, Hospitals and the Doctors, a meeting at which medical and nursing staff from the Hospitals and the Health Areas and also general practitioners from both Ilford and Barking attended was held at the Chadwell Heath Hospital on the 27th January, 1959. To continue our policy of decentralising the health visitors so far as is practicable, a room on the first floor at Newbury Hall has been rented from the Borough Council from the 1st April, 1959 as an office for the two health visitors working in that area. 81 The following is a table showing the attendances, etc., at the Day Nurseries during 1959:- Situation Date of Opening Accommodation (Children) Average Daily Attendance during 1959 No. of Days "in Quarantine" Reasons far Quarantine with Number of Cases No. on Waiting List at 31 st Dec.

(a) The hours of opening at the two Nurseries during 1959 continued to be 7.30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Friday only. (b) The standard charge for accommodation at the Day Nurseries remains at 10/6 per child per day. Provision is made for this charge to be reduced according to scale when the means of the parents do not justify the full fee. Accommodation has continued to be made available to neighbouring Areas for children who can more conveniently attend an Ilford Nursery than one in their own Area. (c) The training of Students at the Nurseries for the Certificate of the National Nursery Examination Board continued. Six Students (3 from the Ley Street Nursery and 3 from the Goodmayes Lane Nursery) entered for the examination during the year, 3 of whom obtained the Certificate. (d) The table on the previous page shows the attendances, etc., at the Day Nurseries during 1959. NURSERIES AND CHILD-MINDERS REGULATION ACT, 1948. - This Act requires, inter alia, that every local health authority shall keep registers - (a) of premises in their area, other than premises wholly or mainly used as private dwellings, where children are received to be looked after for the day or a substantial part thereof or for any longer period not exceeding six days; (b) of persons in their area who for reward receive into their homes children under the age of five to be looked after as aforesaid. 83 The following shows the position regarding registrations under the Act: (a) Premises (b) Child-minders Number on register at 31/12/58 7 5 Number registered during 1959 3 _ Number removed from register during 1959 3 1 Number on register at 31/12/59 7 4 Number of children provided for at 31/12/59 158 24 Of the premises referred to in (a) above as removed from the register, one was closed on the removal of the nursery to other premises (included in the number registered during 1958), another because the person holding the registration could not continue to rent the building and the third as the occupier no longer wished to receive children therein to be looked after during the day. The child-minder whose name was removed from the register (see (b) above) no longer wished to act in that capacity. CLINIC PREMISES. Manford Way Health Services Clinic. - The Family Planning Association continued to use these clinic premises for their sessions on the first and third Monday evenings in each month and on every Monday evening from August, 1959, a charge being made to them to cover the cost of heating, lighting, cleaning and caretaking. Kenwood Gardens Health Services Clinic. - The building of this new clinic was completed in December 1959. The premises were equipped and ready for full occupation from 1st February I960 when the clinic services previously carried on at Valentines Mansion and Newbury Hall, with the exception of the infant welfare centres, were transferred over, the health visitors for the area having taken up occupation early in January. 84 On Saturday afternoon, 5th March 1960, the clinic was officially opened by the Worshipful the Mayor of Ilford who was accompanied by the Mayoress. The Chairman of the Health Area Sub-Committee presided and amongst the guests were the Chairman of the Health Committee, members of the County Council, the Ilford Borough Council and the Ilford Health Area Sub-Committee and the County Medical Officer of Health. The services provided at the new clinic, with its modern facilities, include an infant welfare centre (replacing the Woodford Avenue Centre which had been held at the Woodford Avenue Congregational Church Hall), mothercraft classes, midwives' ante-natal clinics, immunisation and vaccination, routine and special examinations of school children, minor ailments, dental and chiropody clinics, and certain specialist clinics (orthopaedic, ear, nose and throat, paediatric and ophthalmic). There are also greatly improved facilities for health education. The two rooms which had been used for clinic purposes at Valentines Mansion have now been taken over for additional office accommodation which was so urgently needed. Heathcote Avenue Health Services Clinic.- At the time this report is going to press this building is not yet quite ready for occupation, but it is anticipated that it will be opening shortly. As was mentioned last year, the premises are much smaller than the Kenwood Gardens Clinic and the services provided will be more limited. These will, however, include an infant welfare centre (which replaces the Barkingside Centre held at the Parish Hall, Barkingside), mothercraft classes, midwives'ante-natal clinic, chiropody, immunisation and vaccination, routine and special examinations of school children and health education. In addition the health visitors for the area will have their office in the Clinic. INFANT WELFARE CENTRES.- 99 voluntary lady helpers were engaged in the work at the Infant Welfare Centres at the end of December 1959. During the year the following attendances were recorded:- 85 Total number of attendances of infants 35,961 First attendances 2,043 Attendances of children from 1 to 5 years 9,796 Total number of children on roll on 31/12/59 after omission of all those who had not attended for six months 3,859 The following is a comparison of the attendances at the Infant Welfare Centres for the past five years:- Total No. of attendances of Infants First attendances Total No. of children on roll on 31st December 1959 35,961 2,043 3,859 1958 35,756 1,946 3,802 1957 37,948 1,916 3,976 1956 36,902 1,895 3,916 1955 36,196 1,855 3,687 762 sessions were held during the year, the average attendance at each session being 47 mothers with their infants.

The figures for records received of combined diphtheria/pertussis courses of injections are as follows. Inoculations 514 Re-inoculations 200 VACCINATION AGAINST POLIOMYELITIS.- The programme of vaccination of the eligible groups, i.e. children and young persons from the age of six months to 25 years, expectant mothers, doctors, nurses, ambulance staff and their families proceeded during 1959, sufficient vaccine being made available to cover all those who registered. Since early in I960 this vaccination has been made available to all persons up to the age of 40 years at the time 91 of their application, and other special groups of the population, including practising dentists and also certain public health staff, together with their families. Registration of the older age group, although not high, has been steady and has been comparable with the "young adult" group. The general practitioners have continued to play an important part in the scheme and most of those practising in the Area are participating. During 1959 in addition to holding sessions at the various clinics, many of which were combined with school clinic or infant welfare centre sessions, our medical and nursing staff visited the Village Homes, Barkingside to vaccinate children resident there. We were also fortunate in gaining excellent co-operation from many of the larger firms in the Area in the registration of their "young adult" personnel who were prepared to accept the offer of vaccination and several of these firms made accommodation available to enable our staff to hold sessions at the factories during working hours. The statistics given below show the vaccinations carried out by our medical staff:- Premises No. of Sessions Injections given First Second Third Public Health Offices 81 2,009 2,138 4,056 Mayesbrook Clinic 49 1,393 1,441 2,156 Manford Way Clinic 30 480 490 913 Newbury Hall 15 244 247 551 Marks Gate Clinic 8 23 24 29 Village Homes 2 51 57 151 Factories 24 964 894 316 Totals 209 5, 164 5,291 8, 172 The medical staff at the Village Homes, Barkingside also held five sessions there, carrying out a total of 306 second and 74 third injections, and the Honorary Medical Officer of the Ilford Football Club vaccinated 12 members of the Club (primary course of two injections). 92 Record cards received in 1959 from general practitioners were as under:- Completed primary courses (two injections) 12,685 Third injections ("boosters") given 14,671 At the 3 1 st December, 1959a total of 40, 380 primarycourses had been completed in Ilford (30, 861 children under 16 years, 7,281 persons aged 16 to 25 years, 1,920 expectant mothers and 318 general practitioners, ambulance staff, etc. ). SMALLPOX VACCINATION.- During 1959 record cards were received from general practitioners and various hospitals as follows:- Ages up to 14 - No. of children primarily. vaccinated 1,289 No. of children revaccinated 84 Age 15 and over - No. of adults primarily vaccinated 193 No. of adults revaccinated 478 In addition 47 children were primarily vaccinated at the Manford Way Clinic.

Facilities are, however, available at the sessions held for school children at Kenwood Gardens 93 and Mayesbrook Clinics for children under school age to receive treatment for minor ailments, although in practice very few so attend. MIDWIVES.- There were 12 State certified midwives (including the Non-Medical Supervisor of Midwives, 9 domiciliary midwives and 1 part-time midwife employed by the County Council), resident and practising in the district at the end of the year. In addition there were 25 State certified midwives at the Ilford Maternity Hospital. Supervision of the midwives practising on the district, including regular inspections by the Medical Supervisor of Midwives, was carried out as in previous years, and general supervision, in accordance with the Rules of the Central Midwives Board, was exercised over the midwives practising at the Ilford Maternity Hospital. Suspension from Practice.- No Midwives were suspended from practice during the year. Medical Aid.- Medical aid was sought in one instance where the infant was found to have a discharging eye. The condition of the eye cleared satisfactorily. Domiciliary Midwifery Service.- At the end of the year there were 9 Domiciliary Midwives employed by the County Council whole-time and 1 part-time, in addition to the Non-Medical Supervisor. During the year 431 cases were attended. In 397 cases the midwives were engaged to attend as midwives and in 34 cases as maternity nurses. A Doctor was called in to 56 of the 397 cases in which a midwife had been engaged. Of the infants born there were 3 stillbirths. In 2 of these cases the midwife was engaged as a midwife and in the other as a maternity nurse. One death occurred of an infant during the first year of life where the birth had been attended by a Domiciliary Midwife. Notices we re received from the Domiciliary Midwives stating that artificial feeding had been substituted in respect of 28 infants attended by them during 1959. 94 During 1959 Ante-Natal Clinics conducted by the Domiciliary Midwives were held weekly at Valentines Mansion and fortnightly at Mayesbrook Clinic and Manford Way Clinic. The following is a summary of the attendances at these Clinics during the year:- Valentines Clinic Mayesbrook Clinic Manford Way Clinic First attendances 408 131 95 Subsequent attendances 945 346 335 Totals 1,353 477 430 Number of sessions 49 25 32 Average attendance at each session 27 19 13 In addition 1,789 home ante-natal visits were made during the year. The scheme continues whereby the doctor and the midwife have a consultation about their patient on three occasions (at specified intervals)during the pregnancy. The examinations take place at the patient's home, the doctor's surgery or at the Local Health Authority's Clinic, as mutually agreed, but in practice the joint consultation is held in the majority of cases in the doctor's surgery. The Ilford Borough Council continued to provide housing accommodation, where necessary, for midwives employed in the service of the Ilford Health Area Sub-Committee. At the 3 1st December, 1959, one maisonette and two flats were being rented by the County Council from the Borough Council under this arrangement. Arrangements were made in 1959 for the Domiciliary Midwives to assist, as from the 1st January, I960, in the training of pupil midwives from the Thorpe Coombe Maternity Hospital, Walthamstow. Five of the whole-time midwives were approved by the Central Midwives Board as teaching district midwives and the arrangements provide for four pupil midwives, who are accommodated at the Chadwell Heath Hospital and remain for a period of three months, to be received at a time. 95 Salvation Army Midwifery Service.- One Salvation Army midwife, with a further midwife assisting her as required, served in Ilford during the year and in view of the shortage of County Council midwives the governing body, the Mothers' Hospital, Clapton, agreed to their undertaking certain cases outside their normal area to relieve the position to a degree. 164 cases were attended by them, 160 as a midwife and 4 as a maternity nurse. A Doctor was called in to 43 of these cases. Of the infants born there was one stillbirth. Notifications were received from the Salvation Army Midwives that it was proposed to substitute artificial feeding in respect of 26 infants. Gas and Air Analgesia.- During 1959 gas and air analgesia was administered in 515 cases, of which 376 were attended by the Domiciliary Midwives (348 when acting as midwives and 28 when acting as maternity nurses) and 139 were attended by the Salvation Army midwives (135 when acting as midwives and 4 as maternity nurses). All the domiciliary midwives employed at the end of the year were qualified to administer gas and air analgesia and the Salvation Army midwives were also so qualified. Arrangements continued in operation for each of the midwives using cars in the course of their duties to hold a machine at their respective homes to take with them to their own cases and there are also machines stored at the Ambulance Station for the use of the remaining midwives. With regard to the latter, the relatives of the patient are requested to collect a machine, where possible, but when they cannot do this, arrangements are made for a machine to be transported from the Ambulance Station to the house by a hired car. The Salvation Army midwives also have two machines which are kept at their Branch Home and taken or sent to the home of the patient when required. The service is freely available to al! living home confinements, provided there are no medicalcontra-indications, and each expectant mother on booking the midwife is supplied with a leaflet explaining the nature and the availability of the service. 96 ANTE-NATAL CLINICS.- The following is a summary of the attendances at the Ante-Natal Clinics during 1959 for patients booked for confinement in hospital:- Maternity Hospital Mayesbrook Clinic Manford Way Clinic Doctors Midwives First attendances 947 - 278 131 Subsequent attendances 4,608 3,510 2,629 875 Totals 5,555 3,510 2,907 1,006 Number of sessions 307 239* 130 65 Average attendance at each session 18 14 22 15 *Includes 188 running concurrently with Doctors' Clinics. All patients booked for admission to the Maternity Hospital are medically examined at the Ante-Natal Clinics. The first examination takes place at the 10th week of pregnancy, or as soon as possible after that time if the booking for hospital admission is not made until after the 10th week. Further, arrangements are made for all hospital booked patients to see the Obstetric Registrar at either the Ilford Maternity Hospital or the Mayesbrook Ante-Natal Clinic at about the 35th week of pregnancy. In conjunction with the Ante-Natal Clinics at the Manford Way and Mayesbrook Clinics the Health Visitors hold classes for relaxation exercises. During 1959 there were 100 sessions at the Mayesbrook Clinic, with 975 attendances, and 102 sessions at Manford Way Clinic, with 1,039 attendances. A weekly session was also run byHealth Visitors at Valentines Mansion, 46 sessions being held in the year, with 248 attendances. Relaxation exercises classes are in addition held by the staff of the Ilford Maternity Hospital for patients attending the Ante-Natal Clinic there. 97 POST-NATAL CLINICS.- All patients confined in the Ilford Maternity Hospital and other patients on request are invited to attend the Post-Natal Clinics for the first time approximately six weeks after confinement. During 1959 clinics were held at the Maternity Hospital weekly, at Mayesbrook Clinic fortnightly, and at Manford Way Clinic monthly. The following attendances were recorded:- Maternity Hospital Mayesbrook Clinic Manford Way Clinic First attendances 722 203 68 Subsequent attendances 139 76 7 Totals 861 279 75 Number of sessions 52 27 12 Average attendance at each session 16 10 6 CONSULTANT CLINIC.- There were two Consulting Obstetricians in 1959 who each held a weekly Clinic for ante-natal and post-natal cases.

MATERNAL MORTALITY.- During 1959 there were no deaths of Ilford mothers recorded by the RegistrarGeneral as due to or in consequence of pregnancy or childbirth. DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE.- During 1959 the heavy demand for this service continued. The service was controlled by two full-time Organisers, under the general direction of the Area Medical Officer, and at the end of the year there were 6 full-time, 116 regularly-employed parttime and 24 casual Helps employed. The following is a summary of the cases dealt with in 1959:- 98 Number of applications received for assistance 1,548 Number of cases where Domestic Helps were provided (including 674 who were having service at the commencement of the year) 1,772 Number of cases which on investigation were either not eligible for assistance or did not require the service 147 Cases booked but subsequently cancelled 206 Number of cases where, at the end of the year, a domestic help was booked to attend in future months (maternity cases) 71 Other cases awaiting help at end of year 17 Enquiries incomplete at end of year 9 Cases being served at 31st December, 1959 727 Two training courses, each of two weeks' duration, were held by the County Council at Chelmsford in 1959. Three domestic helps from Ilford attended and all were found to be entirely satisfactory. PREVENTION OF BREAK-UP OF FAMILIESâ€” HEALTH OF CHILDREN.- Supervision of the few problem families in the Area continues, the Health Visitors taking the leading role and discussing the problems with interested persons, e.g., General Practitioners, Teachers, Housing Manager and Psychiatric Social Workers.

Such proposals were submitted by the County Council and approved by the Minister, including the setting up of a service in those Areas, of which Ilford was one, where none was already operating. It was decided that treatment would be given so far as practicable only in premises owned or hired by the County Council and by salaried officers, and that initially priority would be given to the provision of comprehensive facilities for the elderly, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers, although these would be extended to other categories when circumstances permitted. Authority was given to appoint two full-time chiropodists for Ilford in the first instance. The posts were advertised in December 1959 and two appointments were made, the successful candidates taking up duty in March and April I960 respectively. A third post is now in process of being filled. With the removal of most of the clinic services from Newbury Hall to the new Kenwood Gardens Health Services Clinic it was possible to rent part of the ground floor accommodation at that Hall as our main chiropody clinic, with two chairs. In addition sessions are held at the health services clinics. Arrangements have now been made for the chiropodists to visit regularly the two Welfare Committee residential establishments in the Area and to undertake domiciliary chiropody in the case of patients who are unable to travel even by ambulance vehicle to the chiropody clinics.

EXAMINATION OF OFFICERS AND SERVANTS.The following medical examinations by Essex County Council staff were carried out during 1959:- Entrants to County Council Service 30 Other purposes 9 For other Authorities 6 INVALID NIGHT ATTENDANCE SERVICE.- The experimental scheme operating in conjunction with the Ilford Social Service Association for the provision of night attendants to provide some relief for those people called upon to sit up constantly all night with sick relatives or friends, or to help sick persons with no one to whom to turn for such assistance, continued until the 30th November 1959, the County Council making agreed payments to the Association in respect of approved cases where need in meeting the cost of the service provided by the Associationâ€™s night attendants was proved. The following are the details of the cases dealt with under this scheme during 1959:- No. of cases being attended at 31.12.58 Nil No. of new cases attended during 1959 12 No. of cases discontinued during 1959 10 Total number of attendances given 201 The County Council decided that as from 1st December 1959 a directly-provided night attendant service should be operated throughout the whole of the Administrative County as part of the Health Area Services. As it was not practicable to take over from that date from the Ilford Social Service Association who had been running this service for many years, the Association agreed to continue to provide on behalf of the County Council the necessary attendance during the month of December 1959; in that month attendance was continued for a total of 26 nights at the two cases who were already having a night attendant at the 30th November, no new cases arising; service was discontinued in these two cases before the end of December 1959. 104 Since 1st January 1960 a directly-provided service has been operating, this being integrated with the Domestic Help Service and controlled by the two full-time Organisers under the general direction of the Area Medical Officer. The six night attendants employed by the Ilford Social Service Association were offered appointments, three of whom accepted. INVALID DAY ATTENDANCE SERVICE.- The arrangement with the Ilford Social Service Association for providing day attendants in approved cases to sit with sick and infirm persons who cannot afford to meet the charge made by the Ilford Social Service Association, the County Council making agreed payments to the Association, has continued. Details of the cases dealt with under this arrangement are as follows:- No. of cases being attended at 31.12.58 1 No. of new cases attended during 1959 11 No. of cases discontinued during 1959 12 No. of cases being attended at 31.12.59 Nil Total number of attendances given:- (a) whole days 149 (b) half days 76 HOME NURSING.- The Home Nursing Service in Ilford is undertaken by Nurses under the supervision of the Superintendent of the Lady Rayleigh Training Home at Leytonstone but operating from the Branch Home "Abury House" in Aldborough Road, Ilford. The work undertaken by Home Nurses in the Ilford area in 1959 was as follows:- Cases attended 2,089 Visits paid 59,815 HEALTH EDUCATION.- Dr. G.B. Taylor, Assistant County Medical Officer, reports:- "Health Education is constantly going on in the ante-natal clinics, post-natal clinics, infant welfare centres. In these clinics individual advice is given and it is this personal advice which is the most effective means of conveying medical information. These centres therefore are of primary importance 105 in the teaching of health education. However, there are certain aspects of health education which cannot be carried out through these clinics because they affect the public in general. During the last three months of 1959 a "Check that Fall" campaign was carried out. The reason for this campaign was that the fatality figures from falls in the home in England and Wales were roughly 6,000 a year, and on analysing them, over 90% of these fatalities occurred in people over 65 years of age. I felt that it would be of little use directing the campaign to the public in general, and I therefore convened a meeting at the Town Hall, inviting 20 people who were leaders of Old People's Organisations. After the illustrated lecture I was surprised at the enthusiasm shown. The leaders suggested that I should visit each of their clubs and give a lecture on the prevention of falls. Fifteen lectures were given and the attendance at each lecture was between 80 and 100. This was most gratifying, because these people belonged to the particular age group in which fatalities from falls occurred. They were a very stimulating audience and asked many practical questions after each lecture. Posters were displayed in different parts of the Town and the Clergy helped us in bringing to the notice of their congregations the fatalities from falls in the home. Although the campaign itself was directed to the over 65's, children under the age of five also suffer fatal accidents from falls in the home. Talks were given in the infant welfare centres about falls and posters were also displayed, drawing attention to the dangers to children of falls in the home. The poliomyelitis immunisation figures in Ilford for the ages 15 - 25 are very poor. They amount to roughly 33% of the population. In an effort to improve these figures I decided to have a short intensive campaign with heavy publicity. Before the campaign began I personally saw all the managers of the shops in the High Road and most of them in the Cranbrook Road. I explained to them the position about the poor response to poliomyelitis immunisation and the majority of the managers were willing to co-operate. At a pre-determined time all these shopkeepers were 106 sent the same poliomyelitis posters which were displayed at the beginning of a week's campaign. In addition posters were sent to youth clubs, post offices, council notice boards, council vans, schools and evening institutes. The three main cinemas in Ilford displayed poliomyelitis posters and also showed screen flashes. A recorded appeal by the well-known radio personality, Eamonn Andrews, was sent to jazz clubs, dance band leaders, and to the local football ground. Small leaflets were sent to factories to enclose in pay packets. We also hired a broadcasting van which toured the streets of Ilford and advertised the campaign in the press. Since I did not know what the response would be to this campaign I asked all the chemists in Ilford if they would act as registration centres, sending them at the same time request forms. The idea in this was that people would merely have to go into the chemists to ask for a request form. They were told by broadcast that the chemists were acting as registration centres. After this campaign there was no increase in requests for poliomyelitis immunisation and there can be only three possible reasons for this:- 1. That the campaign was inefficiently run. 2. That the figures we have are incorrect. 3. That the people are apathetic. To comment on the first, that the campaign was inefficiently run. We made use of all the modern means of publicising and I do not think we could have improved upon our efforts. The second point, that the figures we have are incorrect, is not without moment because some of the Ilford residents have been immunised by the London County Council. However, we have now made allowance for this and there are still 60% of people between the ages 15 and 25 who are not immunised. The third point, that the public are apathetic, seems to be the correct one. Apathy of the general public is not novel, and health educators can only 107 continue their efforts, hoping that over the years, there will be a gradual reorientation of custom and habit. Although the immunisation figures for the under 15's are quite good I gave an illustrated lecture to youth leaders at the Town Hall and gave them information and advice on poliomyelitis immunisation which they conveyed to their boys and girls. Most of the youth leaders wrote to me saying that the majority of their youths had been immunised but the few who had not they were able to influence. Sex Education is fraught with danger because it has such a high emotional content. It seems that the best way of teaching sex education is to include it in a general course and I was asked to participate in such a course. This particular course included talks to youths on the many aspects of marriage, such as getting a mortgage, buying the right type of furniture, investment of money and the spiritual and physical side of marriage. I gave an illustrated talk on the physical side of marriage to an audience of about 50. I was helped in this by one of our health visitors. The arrangements were that she spoke to the girls separately and then I spoke to the boys, after which they were grouped together and shown a film. Some of the boys asked personal questions about intimate matters arising from the lecture. The leaders of this group seemed to think that the lecture was very worth while. Many fathers want factual information about pregnancy and labour and a film entitled "The Birth of a Baby" was shown at the Manford Way Clinic. This was well attended and several of the audience asked whether they could have some more films on subjects such as Child Development. Many Health Workers from abroadnOw visit this country to learn about health education. I was asked to write a paper to be read before an international seminar of health workers convened by the Central Council for Health Education. The paper was entitled "The Demands for Health Education". I based the lecture upon my experience in Ilford over the 108 past 12 months, illustrating the lecture with slides and a recorded interview I had with two headmasters. The lecture, which lasted about two hours, is shortly being published in the Health Education Journal. It is interesting to note that of the four lecturers at this seminar, 50%, that is Mrs. Gordon and myself, were from Ilford. Finally, a course of lectures was given to the British Red Cross Society in preparation for an examination. These lectures covered a wide aspect of health varying from dietetics to the structure of the National Health Scheme. Most of the students reaped the reward of their and our labours in passing the examination." Posters covering various aspects of Health were displayed at the Public Health Offices and the Mayesbrook, Manford Way and Newbury Hall Clinics throughout the year and a display unit, loaned by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, on the subject of burns and scalds, was installed in the entrance hall at Valentines Mansion for three weeks from the 21st August, 1959. During the year a total of 85 lectures on varied Health subjects were given by members of the medical staff, health visitors and domestic help organisers to various organisations and children. In addition 252 lectures on Mothercraft were given by the Health Visitors at their ante-natal relaxation classes at the Mayesbrook and Manford Way Clinics, a series of 12 lectures constituting each course. DENTAL TREATMENT.- Mr. E.V. Haigh, the Senior Dental Officer, has submitted the following report:- "During 1959 Dental facilities continued to be provided at Mayesbrook Clinic for expectant and nursing mothers and for children under five years of age. The total number of sessions devoted to these patients was 95; this giving an average of two sessions per week-one during the day and one evening session. The evening session is continuing to be very popular with many of the expectant and nursing 109 mothers. This is due to the fact that many find it difficult to attend during the day because either they are working or they are unable to find anyone to look after their children. It has been most noticeable that the evening patients are much more at ease and therefore less troublesome to treat. The total number of patients treated under this service during 1959 was 288, an increase of 78 over the previous year. The reason that more patients were treated in the same number of sessions was due in my opinion to the fact that mothers are becoming more dentally conscious and are receiving dental treatment from the time of leaving school. Many came for an examination, not because they had pain. These mothers usually require only a small amount of treatment to make them dentally fit. It is not so common to see mothers with grossly neglected mouths as a few years ago. The choice of local or general anaesthesia was available to the patient when extractions were required. Most were performed under a general anaesthetic, this being given always to children under five. All anaesthetics were administered by a Medical Officer. The dentures supplied were made by a local dental laboratory, an arrangement which has been in operation for many years and is satisfactory. Dental X-Ray facilities which are important in the diagnosis of many dental abnormalities continue to be available at Mayesbrook Clinic. " The number of cases treated at the Clinic during 1959 was as follows:- Examined Needing Treatment Treated Made Dentally Fit Expectant and nursing mothers (a) Day Sessions 62 61 65 53 (b) Evening Sessions 112 112 119 96 Children under 5 105 104 104 91 110 The forms of dental treatment provided were:- Extractions Anaesthetics Fillings Scaling or Scaling and Gum treatment Silver Nitrate treatment Dressings Radiographs Dentures provided, repaired and remade Local General Complete Partial Expectant and nursing mothers (a) Day Sessions 179 26 47 144 62 - 68 2 12 6 (b) Evening Sessions 78 56 - 226 180 5 137 2 6 8 Children under 5 130 - 58 218 - - 47 - - - In addition there were 116 prophylactic treatments and other operations carried out in the case of expectant and nursing mothers at day sessions and 276 at evening sessions. The total number of sessions held for expectant and nursing mothers and children under five years of age was 95, 46 during the day and 49 in the evenings. DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL WELFARE FOODS. The distribution of national welfare foods (National Dried Milk, orange juice, cod liver oil and vitamin tablets) to beneficiaries has continued to be the responsibility of the local health authorities under the National Health Service. On the 28th December, 1959, the food store and office were moved from the former ambulance station at ClarksRoad to the accommodation provided for this service at the new Kenwood Gardens Health Services Clinic and the main distribution centre which had been operating at the Public Health Offices, Valentines Mansion, was transferred there as from the 11th January, I960. The distribution centre which had been held on one day a week at the Methodist Church Hall, Fremantle Road, was closed on the 5th January, I960, as the main distribution centre is now in the catchment area it was formerly serving. The following shows the present distribution centres, with the days and times they are open:- Ill (a) Main Centre Kenwood Gardens Clinic, Monday to 9.30 a.m. - 5 p.m. Kenwood Gardens, Friday Ilford. Saturday 9.30a.m. - 12noon (b) Branch Centres Methodist Church Hall, Tuesday and (9.15 a.m. - 1 p.m. High Road (entrance Friday (2 p.m. - 3.15 p.m. in Cleveland Road), Ilford.

Friday Mrs. Peacock, 15, Culpeper Close, Hainault. Evenings and Weekends only 112 With a view to effecting economy and cohesion in the service, the work with regard to the national welfare foods has been fully integrated with that of the distribution of nutrients and medicaments which has been in operation in the maternity and child welfare service for many years. 113 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE SCHOOL ROLL AND PREMISES.- There are 39 schools with 65 departments. The number of children on the school roll of Primary and Secondary Schools in Ilford on 18th December, 1959, was 23,481 which figure includes Barking Abbey (450). In addition there were 112 children attending the special schools. MEDICAL INSPECTION AND FOLLOWING UP.During the year 8,335 periodic medical inspections were carried out and in addition, 817 special inspections and2,403 re-inspections were undertaken. 5,550 parents or 66. 5 per cent, attended the full medical inspections. As in previous years the Elmbridge and Kennylands Boarding Schools remained under this authority for the purpose of medical supervision and Dr. Gross visited each school once a term to undertake routine medical inspections and follow-up cases. During the early part of the year there were rather extensive outbreaks of influenza at both schools and owing to the number of children affected at Kennylands School the Ilford Division had to provide additional nursing help which was rendered by the Superintendent Health Visitor and two Health Visitors, the Resident School Nurse having herself gone sick with the complaint. At Elmbridge School the position was a little more difficult as following the influenza epidemic there was a considerable outbreak of Haemolytic Streptococcal sore throat. Consequent upon this all the children were swabbed and some 120 were found to be positive, several of them developing scarlet fever. The infection did not completely abate until after the Easter recess. We acknowledge the considerable assistance and co-operation rendered by the Hambledon Rural District Council in supervising the swabbing and the advice given during this period. The existing arrangements, however, whereby Surrey County Council undertook dental inspection and treatment of pupils at Elmbridge School were continued. STAFF.- Dr. G. B. Taylor was appointed to the staff as an Assistant County Medical Officer and School Medical Officer and commenced duties in a full-time capacity on 13th july. 1959. 114 Owing to the continued shortage of part-time Dental Officers it was only possible to carry out a limited number of inspections of pupils at school. VISITS.- (a) The Public Health Inspectors made 1, 190 visits to maintained schools, (l) to enquire as to the milk supplies and (Z) to inspect the sanitary arrangements. (b) School nurses made (i) 137 visits to schools (118 for general hygiene and 19 for head inspections) when 15,766 individual children were examined and 18, 138 actual examinations were made, (ii) 3,313 home visits in regard to treatment recommended, and (iii) 994 home visits to cases of minor infectious diseases. (c) Dr. O'Connor Wilson visited all primary schools during the latter part of the year with a view to testing the views of Head Teachers on carrying out a Posture and Foot Survey in all schools with an age group of 9 to 11 years. This suggestion was well received and we are to commence this survey early in the year I960. I have continued my own regular visit to schools in an endeavour to become more fully acquainted with schools and Head Teachers and have set myself the target of conducting one routine medical inspection in each school. I am now just over half-way through this programme which must depend on the time I have available. A further innovation during 1959 was the regular attendance of Health Visitors at Case Conferences held at the Child Guidance Clinic and there is now a good liaison with that service and the Health Visitors. In some instances the General Practitioner is also able to attend the Child Guidance Case Conferences. (d) A separate report is furnished by the Chief Public Health Inspector on the general subject of hygiene conditions in schools. DEFECTIVE HEARING.- An Amplivox audiometer was purchased in January 1959 and Dr. Gross attended a three-day course on the use of this machine and the testing of hearing. As a result, the majority of children found to have defective hearing were tested-the more complex cases being referred to the Ear Nose and Throat Surgeon. This has saved much unnecessary referral to London hospitals for this purpose. 115 INFECTIOUS DISEASES.- In the Ilford schools there was also rather an extensive outbreak of measles and influenza lasting from January to March 1959 and at one time the absence in most schools was as much as 50%. At one of the Ilford schools there was a mild outbreak of food poisoning due to C. Welchii which was traced to meat pies supplied for school meals - the apparent cause being the slow cooling of large pies. Some 60 children and 5 members of the staff were affected. As a result of investigation the Public Health Laboratory suggested smaller pies which should not be cooked overnight. This recommendation was passed to the Education Department for action. MINOR AILMENT CLINICS.- The Minor Ailment clinics functioned as amended on 1st December 1958, a full session weekly being operated at both the Mayesbrook and Newbury Hall Clinics. In addition facilities were afforded forany urgent cases to consult the doctor at the immunisation clinics held weekly at Mayesbrook Clinic and the Public Health Offices. NEW OR ORIGINAL WORK.- Upon his appointment to the staff Dr. G. B. Taylor took over Health Education with particular reference to lectures and films in schools. He has commenced interviewing individual Headmasters with a view to introducing talks in schools about the association of lung cancer and cigarette smoking. The majority view so far is that most Headmasters will welcome a lecture on cancer and smoking, giving the facts as they are known to date. It is appreciated, however, that schools do differ in their needs for general health education, but it is hoped to overcome any problems by good liaison between the medical authorities and the teaching profession. SPECIALIST SERVICES.- The various specialist clinics functioned as in previous years and these are the subject of separate reports by the Consultants included under the particular Clinic details. STATISTICS.- The Ministry of Education Annual Returns and the summary of heights and weights over a period of 10 years are printed at the end of this Report. 116 MEDICAL TREATMENT. (a) Minor Ailments Clinics.- The attendances during 1959 were as follows:- Newbury Hall Mayesbrook Number of individual children seen 275 434 Number of attendances of children 464 689 Number of exclusion certificates granted 8 19 Number of certificates of fitness to attend school granted 4 18 The following table shows the conditions dealt with at both the Clinics during the year:- Subnormal Nutrition 188 Debility 55 Uncleanliness:- Head 21 Body Skin: - Ringworm: - Head Body 1 Scabies Impetigo 7 Dermatitis 3 Urticaria - Furunculosis 6 Eczema 3 Athletes Foot 21 Warts 88 Other Skin Diseases (Non-Tuberculosis) 34 Eye:- Blepharitis 5 Conjunctivitis 5 Defective Vision (excluding Squint) 64 Squint 6 Other conditions 39 117 Ear:- Defective Hearing 5 Otitis Media 1 Other Ear Diseases 12 Nose and Throat: - Chronic Tonsilitis only 17 Adenoids only 2 Chronic Tonsilitis and Adenoids 8 Nasal Catarrh 10 Nasal Obstruction 4 Other conditions 7 Enlarged Cervical Glands (Non-Tuberculous) 5 Defective Speech 16 Teeth - Dental Diseases 35 Heart and Circulation:- Functional - Organic Anaemia 2 Infectious Diseases:- Chicken Pox 1 German Measles - Whooping Cough Colds and Coughs 15 Influenza 2 Lungs:- Asthma 6 Bronchitis 2 Pulmonary Catarrh 8 Other Non-Tubercular Diseases 9 Psychological: - Development 1 Stability 9 Nervous System: - Nervous Debility 1 Habit Spasm 1 Chorea - Petit Mal Enuresis 6 Other Conditions 14 118 Deformities: - Genu Valgum 2 Posture 2 Pigeon Chest - Flat Feet 17 Valgus Ankles 3 Other Forms 19 Minor Injuries 10 Rheumatism 5 Other Defects and Diseases 34 Total number of ailments 837 RECUPERATIVE HOLIDAYS. During 1959, 20 children were recommended for recuperative holidays and were placed by the Borough Education Officer. 119 SPECIAL CLINICS OPHTHALMIC CLINIC. The following table summarises the attendances of school children:- Clinic Sessions New Cases Old Cases Attendances Valentines Mansion 103 289 854 1,642 Mayesbrook 92 196 454 1,012 Manford Way 12 36 69 203 Totals . . . 207 521 1,377 2,857 984 complete pairs of spectacles were provided, some of these being renewals after breakages. In addition, in 269 ' cases the lenses of spectacles were replaced or repairs of frames were carried out. Dr. H.J.R. Thorne, M.B. , B.S. , D.O., D.O.M.S., the Ophthalmologist, reports as follows: - "The School Eye Clinic at Valentines Mansion, Ilford, has continued to function smoothly and satisfactorily and the clinic has been well attended. The cases seen callfor no special comment - the usual school eye clinic "mixture" with refractive errors and squints predominating. Good co-ope ration has been obtained from London Eye Hospitals to which cases requiring further investigation and/or operation have been referred as necessary. The Orthoptic Department (at Mayesbrook) and the arrangements for fitting and supply of spectacles (by attending Optician) have been quite satisfactory. " ORTHOPTIC CLINIC. Miss C.M. Hazel, D. B.O. , makes the following report on the Orthoptic Clinic held at Mayesbrook Health Services Clinic for the year ended 31st December, 1959. 120 "273 sessions were held throughout the year and 91 new cases were referred for treatment. In addition 87 old cases were under treatment. Total attendances amounted to 604 and 47 patients were discharged. The Orthoptic Clinic functioned efficiently as an indispensable adjunct to the School Eye Clinic in the treatment and observation ofgquint cases - both true and latent and pre- and post-operative." Miss Hazel attends at the Clinic for three days a week. ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC. Mr. H.G. Korvin, F.R.C.S., the Orthopaedic Surgeon, makes the following report:- "No major changes took place at the orthopaedic school clinics during 1959, but there are some minor improvements to report. A telephone was installed at Newbury Hall Clinic which obviated the necessity for incoming calls to be taken at the neighbouring school, and made the surgeon more get-at-able for his hospitals. The electric fan in the Newbury Hall consulting room was a great blessing in the exceptionally hot summer months. Attendances were at a reasonable level. Arrangements for X-ray and laboratory examinations, hospital admissions, and provision of appliances were the same as in the past. Plans were made, during the year, for the equipment of the new clinic at Kenwood Gardens and it is hoped that the transfer there of the Newbury Hall Clinic will take place early in I960. I wish to thank all those taking part in the work at the clinics for their valuable help and co-operation.

MINOR ORTHOPAEDIC DEFECTS. Dr. F.E. O'Connor Wilson, one of the school medical officers, has under supervision and attends periodically one of the following Clinics conducted by the Physiotherapist:- Exercises Massage Sunlight and she reports as follows "REMEDIAL EXERCISES The clinics for remedial exercises were large and well attended during 1959, as will be seen from the following numbers:- Newbury Hall No. of new cases = 303 " " attendances = 1,533 Mayesbrook No. of new cases = 251 11 " attendances = 1,202 Total No. of new cases = 554 11 " " attendances = 2,735 123 360 cases were referred from school medical Inspections and these made 544 attendances. These clinics show a marked increase in numbers and attendances over those of 1958. Classes were held to demonstrate the exercises for the particular defect. Mothers were present at these classes and were encouraged to assist their children to do the exercises daily at home. Where children could not attend the classes regularly, the mothers were given lists of exercises to do at home and the children were seen at intervals by the physiotherapist to supervise progress. Children from the Open Air School who attend for treatment of deformities are taken direct to the clinic from the school by motor coach and in the care of a lady assistant. They return to the school in the coach following treatment. A number of children have regular swimming therapy of one hour sessions each week at the Public Baths and this treatment is found to be of great benefit in certain cases. The visiting doctor examines the children periodically and discharges them from treatment when the deformity is corrected. Strapping and plaster splints for correction of some deformities are carried out at two sessions each week. Massage and electrical treatment are given at one session each week. Printed forms are issued to mothers of growing girls and boys advising them about the correct type of footwear to be purchased. Printed forms are also issued to teenage girls whoare referredfor chest deformities, advising them about the correct type of brassiere to be worn. Children are referred to the clinic by the Orthopaedic Specialist, by private practitioners, and by the Assistant County Medical Officers of Health." 124 PHYSIOTHERAPY CLINICS. These were held at Newbury Hall on Monday and Thursday mornings and at Mayesbrook Clinic on Tuesday and Friday mornings. Cases are also seen at the Manford Way Clinic as required.

Mason, F.R.C.S. , Ear,Nose and Throat Consultant, reports as follows:- "The Clinic maintains a steady flow of work - 182 new patients, 16 of them under 5, were seen this year, as against 177 in 1958. Attendances totalled 502 altogether. 101 tonsil and adenoid ope rations were performed at King George Hospital and Chadwell Heath Hospital, 7 of them on under-5 children, and 24 of these also had sinus disease which was treated at the same time. 14 cases of suspected deafness were investigated at the Clinic by pure-tone audiometry, and a further 7 referred to Special Deafness Units. Of these, 2 school children and 1 toddler have since been issued with hearing aids and are receiving auditory training. There was a decline in the incidence of rhinitis and ear disease during the year, and it seems likely that this was related to the exceptionally hot and dry summer. " The following table shows the work of the Clinic:- No. Diagnosed Tonsils and Adenoids Infection 97 Deafness 4 Otitis Media 11 Mastoid disease - Rhinitis 6 Other defects or diseases 28 146 During 1959 94 children were operated on for the removal of enlarged tonsils and adenoids as follows:- King George Hospital 62 Chadwell Heath Hospital 32 126 SPEECH CLINICS. Mrs. M. Walker, the Senior Speech Therapist, reports on the work of the Speech Clinics during 1959 as follows "The Speech Therapists working in the Ilford area during 1959 were as follows:- Mrs. Walker - full-time Valentines Clinic and schools Mrs. McGill - 6 sessions Mayesbrook Clinic per week and schools Mrs. Pretious - full-time Manford Way and Valentines Clinics, Cerebral Palsy Unit and schools. This has been a 'bumper year' for attendances at the Speech Therapy clinics exceptforthe recurrent fall-off during school holidays. In spite of this, however, discharge numbers are lower than usual. This is partly due to the late referral of so many stammerers, who, unless they are seen early while the stammer is still in the primary 'easy' phase tend to need years of treatment, and thus to occupy at least one treatment period per week, more or less permanently. On the brighter side retarded language cases are being referred earlier resulting on the whole in better prognoses, from the general educational as well as from the speech point of view. More clinics are being held in schools, where there are sufficient speech-defective children to carry a complete session, and although contact with parents cannot be so good, this is offset by the fact that very few treatments are mis sed by these children. We are sorry to be losing the services of Mrs. McGill, who has done such invaluable work in the Mayesbrook area and I trust we shall be receiving a replacement of an equally high standard." 127 The defects treated were as follows:- Stammer 62 Dyslalia 120 Retarded speech and language 8 Hearing losses 5 Cleft Palate 7 Dysarthria 4 Neurological 1 Treatment not needed 1 Others 4 104 children of school age were discharged from the Clinics during the year. In 70 cases the speech was normal. Of the remaining 34 cases, 5 left the district, 9 improved, 4 ceased to attend, 5 left school, 5 were referred elsewhere, 6 did not require treatment. SCHOOL DENTAL SERVICE. Mr. E.V. Haigh, Senior Dental Officer, reports as follows: - "Dental Clinics continued with little change during 1959 to give dental treatment to school children in Mayesbrook Clinic and Valentines Clinic with two surgeries each and one at Manford Way. As in the past years it has been impossible to obtain full-time Dental Officers to staff the Clinics and we can only continue by using part-time Officers, each one doing a few sessions per week. During 1959 several part-time Dental Officers had to reduce the number of sessions they worked for us owing to their private practice demanding more of their time. This shortage of staff is due to the difference in remuneration between private practice and school clinic work. The number of half days devoted to treatment dropped by 334 but even so the number of children actually treated was 3,339, only slightly less than in 1958. The number of attendances made by these children was 12,894. It has become impossible to inspect regularly the children at school; sufficient numbers apply for treatment to keep the Dental Surgeons fully occupied. 128 Emergency treatment and inspections on two mornings a week continued during 1959 at Mayesbrook Clinic when any child from any Ilford School without an appointment could attend and be seen by myself for the relief of pain if possible; appointments being made for extractions, conservative or orthodontic treatment. The number of patients attending on these mornings varies from 15 to over 30 per session. I continued with one evening session per week for school children, the time of these sessions being 5.15â€” 8.15 p.m. They have been most satisfactory for older children studying for examinations, who do not wish to attend during school time. I have a waiting list for these evening sessions and only patients who cannot possibly attend during the day may be given an after school appointment. At the beginning of 1959 an X-ray machine was installed at Valentines Clinic and a dark room for developing the films was fitted up and equipped. This means that X-ray facilities are now available at all dental clinics and patients do not have to travel from one Clinic to another should they require an X-ray. This can save time and pain, a quicker diagnosis being possible. Most extractions were performed under general Anaesthesia which was always given by a Medical Officer, the average number of children attending per session being between 20 and 25. Children usually prefer general Anaesthesia. Because there were less dental inspections^ at schools many children requiring extractions have not been seen. This accounts for the slight drop in Anaesthetics given during 1959. " Full details of the dental work are shown in Table V. BENTON SCHOOL. Dr. D.M.B. Gross, Medical Officer in charge, reports as follows:- 129 "During 1959 the number of children on roll varied, being 81 on the 31.12.58 and 76 on 31.12.59. There were 23 admissions and 28 discharges. Recommendations for admissions were received from the following sources:- School Medical Officer 6 Borough Education Officer 1 Head Teacher 6 Parent's request 3 Hospital 4 Re-admission 1 Others 2 23 The diagnoses were as follows:- Collapse right lung 1 Nephritis 1 Asthma 3 Slipped Epiphysis 1 Achondroplasia 2 Dislocated left hip 1 Congenital Heart 2 Haemophilia 1 Coeliac disease 1 Old Poliomyelitis 1 Spina bifida 1 Bronchitis 2 Multiple fractures 1 Osteomyelitis 1 Muscular Dystrophy 1 Paraplegia 1 Diabetes 1 Epilepsy 1 23 The 28 children discharged left for the following reasons:- Fit for ordinary school 14 Left school (over age) 4 Admission to Special School 4 Left district 6 28 130 Throughout the year periodic medical examinations took place at this school with the usual referral of suitable cases to the various specialist clinics when necessary. The close association with the C.P.U. has again proved most valuable and two cases were transferred after preliminary trial at the Unit. The work continues along the same lines as previously and the association with the Youth Employment Officer has been helpful in several cases. I should like to thank all the staff concerned for their continued help and co-operation. " CEREBRAL PALSY UNIT. (i) Dr. D. L. Woolf, Consultant in Physical Medicine to the Cerebral Palsy Unit, reports as follows:- "There have- been eight new admissions to the Unit during 1959 and six discharges. Three new admissions were not classified as Cerebral Palsy, but the Unit was considered the best placing for these children. 24 children are at present on roll. No waiting list exists except for children under five years of age. The Medical Auxiliaries and teaching staff continue to work in close liaison. Unfortunately, the Unit, during the latter part of 1959, experienced a shortage of physiotherapists. No improvement in the treatment rooms has taken place this year, but we look forward to the day when the Unit will be sited in a more accessible place and decorated for staff and children consistent with the requirements of modern rehabilitation. I would like to express my thanks to the medical auxiliaries and teaching staff for their co-operation and contribution to a cheerful atmosphere. 11 (ii) Dr. D.M.B. Gross, Medical Officer in charge, makes the following report: - "The Unit has been open since May 1955 and during the year 1959 the number of children on roll 131 varied, being 22 on 31st December 1958, and 24 on 31st December 1959. During the year under review 15 children were examined with a view to admission of these, 10 were accepted and came from the following areas:- 4 Ilford 3 Romford 2 Forest 1 South Essex (on waiting list) The five children rejected, with the reason for rejection and the responsible authority concerned, were:- South Essex: (a) Partially sighted pupil (b) Limited expectancy of life. mission to residential school for the physically handicapped more suitable (c) Suitable for admission to C.P.U. , but earlier placement requested at Elizabeth Fry School. (d) Mild Cerebral Palsy South East Considered suitable but distance Essex: too far to travel. During the year 6 children were discharged, as follows: - Ilford: (a) School leaving age: Section 57(5)Education Act 1944 (b) Removed from Area (c) Transferred to Benton School (d) Transferred to Benton School Forest: (a) To residential Special School (b) School leaving age Registered Disabled Person. Remedial work has been much hampered by the lack of physiotherapy. Both physiotherapists resigned in July and by the end of the year it had still been impossible to replace them. This has caused much 132 anxiety but is part of a nation-wide shortage. It is, however, hoped to remedy the position in the near future. In all other respects the work of theUnithas proceeded smoothly. The heating is now very much improved and a very close liaison has been maintained with the various hospitals. There is one child on the waiting list, aged 5 years." CHILD GUIDANCE CLINIC Dr. W. P. Gurassa, Consultant Psychiatrist, reports as follows:- "There have been a number of cnanges in staff during the past year principally in the appointment of myself as Medical Director in place of Dr. Davidson, and Miss Watt as Psychologist in place of Mr. Pickett, the latter appointment after a gap of several months. We have been fortunate in obtaining permission to appoint an additional Psychiatric Social Worker, who is very much needed to relieve the pressure on our two present Social Workers. These changes have necessitated the renewal of contact with various agencies concerned with children in the area, in particular the schools where the lack of a Psychologist was acutely felt. We have endeavoured to continue and extend Dr. Davidson's policy of integrating the Clinic1 s activities with those of other agencies concerned with the education and welfare of children, and the current year has seen a considerable increase of contact with such people as Head Teachers, Probation Officers, School Enquiry Officer s, etc., so that we are increasingly learning to understand each other's points of view, and to co-ordinate the help given to children and parents. Meetings were also arranged with School Medical Officers and Health Visitors, and it is pleasing to note that Health Visitors are regularly attending our Conferences and working closely with us. The diagnostic waiting list has been reduced considerably, and it is possible to see new referrals 133 much sooner than before; there is still a delay with regard to the provision of more intensive treatment, and it is intended to reduce this by providing group treatment. We have been considering ways in which we can extend our activities during the next year. It is hoped to provide at least one evening session for diagnosis and treatment. This will be of particular benefit to children who have left school and need to continue treatment here, and also to allow selected children to attend out of school time. Most of our cases are still referred from School Medical Officers, but we do have an increasing number from General Practitioners who, in some instances, are able to attend our Conferences. One disturbing note is the continued lack of facilities in the area for the admission of disturbed children and adolescents to suitable Units for observation and treatment. Many other areas have provided such Units, but they are only available to us in exceptional circumstances. Some interim measures are urgently required pending more permanent provisions in the remote future. In summing up I would say that while we are mainly occupied with the treatment and supervision of children referred to us we are increasingly concerned with improving our contact and communication with all people who are interested in the welfare of children with the particular aim of helping to prevent the development of established nervous disorders. " The following is a table showing the work undertaken at the Child Guidance Clinic during 1959: â€” 31st December Previous Year Present Year I- 1.

Miss B.S. Gascoyne, Educational Psychologist, reports as follows:- "During the year the work of the psychologist in the Ilford schools was necessarily rather restricted because Mr. Pickett's place was not filled until September, but since Miss Watt started to work in the area then, much of the leewayhas been made up. It was felt by the Clinic staff as a whole, and perhaps by the psychologists in particular, that the need for day classes for maladjusted children was becoming more and more essential. It is hoped that two maybe set up next September which will accommodate those children who are unable to fit into the normal school routine thus causing considerable difficulties not only to their teachers but also them* selves. It is envisaged that the classes will be very 136 small so that it will be possible for the children to have much individual attention and that they should be treated as a separate entity from any existing school in the same way as the Special Remedial Classes form Valentines School. Few day maladjusted classes exist so this type of work can still be considered to be in the pioneer stage but fortunately the L.C.C. have such a school near Hammersmith and one was started at Leyton last September, so we are hoping to profit by the experiences of our neighbours and have already been given very valuable information on the type of setting and personnel required. " ILFORD ENURESIS CLINIC. Dr. J. M. Pooley reports as follows "During the 12 months ended December 3 1st 1959, the clinic continued to be held at the Public Health Offices, Ilford, on Wednesday mornings. Attendances have, on the whole, been good and there has been a 50% increase in the number of new cases referred, as compared with last year. There are now 9 "Bed Buzzers" in use through the clinic and the results from their use have been very interesting and encouraging, as will be seen from the figures given below. I. Appointment List During the 12 months ended December 31 st 1959, there have been 68 new cases (as compared with 46 last year) made up as follows:- Recommended by Under 5 years Over 5 years Boys Girls Boys Girls Parents - 1 2 - General practitioners 2 1 - - Infant Welfare Officers 4 2 - - School Medical Officers - 33 17 Health Visitors - - 2 3 Hospital Specialist - - 1 - 6 4 38 20 137 Total = 68 cases Total attendances = 346 Number of sessions = 39 II. The Procedure adopted in previous years has been largely adhered to at each clinic. This includes Urinalysis, History of the Enuresis, physical examination; considerable time is devoted to talking to and gaining the confidence of the child, and finally advice is given to the parent, usually through the child by clear direction as to routine and charting and finally the taking of medicaments if indicated. As has been proved in previous years, suggestions made to the child, but in the presence of the mother, have always been acted upon more faithfully by the parents. III. Treatment. The treatment issued or prescribed has been made up as follows:- No. of Cases 1. Long acting (bonded) Dexampheta- mine (5mgm. taken at bedtime) 36 2. Plain Dexamphetamine ( 5 mgm. at bedtime 3 3. Amphetamine sulphate (2.5 - 5 mgm. ) 11 4. Phenobarbitone (either at night or in divided doses through the day) 13 5. Disipidin (posterior pituitary snuff) 6 6. Routine and Charting only 7 7. The Sentinel or Down's "Bedbuzzer" 13 8. A few cases vfrere referred to hospital or to the Child Guidance Clinic for further investigation or treatment. Some of the cases treated with Disipidin or the buzzer had previously been treated with the amphetamine series and had failed. 138 IV. Analysis and comparison of results 1959 1957 1956 1955 1. Completely dry = 38% 23% 46% 38% 2. Very marked im- 26 provement, (i.e. le s s than 10 wet in 28 nights) 3. Improved (more 10 than 10 wet in 28 nights) 4. No improvement 3 5. Self discharged 12 77 (this figure includes 9 cases who were referred backfrom 1956 for recommencement of treatment) Further Analysis of Results Of the 68 cases who were referred during 1959 it is interesting to note the numbers of boys compared with girls in the following analysis: Boys Girls New Cases 57% 43% Of the cases discharged dry 42% 58% Average age 8 yrs. 7yrs. Of the cases who were discharged dry the treatment used was as follows:- Treatment Number of Cases 1. Long acting dexamphetamine salt 7 ) 2. Short acting dexamphetamine ) 50% salt 6) 139 Treatment Number of Cases 3. Bed buzzer 6 ) ) 4. Phenobarbitone 3 ) ) 50% 5. Charting 3 ) ) 6. Disipidin Snuff 1 ) Although this is necessarily a limited survey, both the treatment indicated and the results obtained show an interesting preponderance ofenuretic children with deep sleeping habits , over enuretic children where other etiological factors are concerned. The Use of "Dexten" (Dexamphetamine-resinate) A number of these tablets was issued for use at the IlfordEnuresis Clinic as it was felt that it would be interesting to compare a series of cases treated with this long acting substance, with a comparable series treated with the short-acting, non-bonded amphetamine salt. This work is still continuing, but the number of cases treated is not yet sufficient to enable a true comparison to be made. During previous years, amphetamine sulphate (Benzedrine) has often been given in divided doses, e.g. at 7p.m. and 11 p.m. with encouraging results, so that the use of Dexten in avoiding the necessity of waking a child for the second dose is already obvious. It has been shown that the rate of release of dexamphetamine from Dexten (determined by in-vitro experiments) is as follows:- Time after ingestion % liberated (hr s.) 2 hours 26 4 41 6 51 8 62 10 75 12 85 14 85 (Sir Adolphe Abrahams, The Lancet, December 28th 1957). 140 Thus it can be seen that a probable optimal plasma concentration will occur between the hours of 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., from a dose given at 7 p.m. and this may in some cases answer the problem of having to lift an enuretic child at frequent intervals during the night. The bed-buzzer is again proving an extremely useful addition to the clinic resources. Some cases who have previously been very resistant to treatment have become dry in from 4 to 6 weeks, and have remained so after the buzzer has been removed, as long as the machine is not removed prematurely. I stillhope that more new cases may be referred from within the public health services, and that general practitioners will feel free to refer cases to the Enuresis Clinic should they wish to do so. " HANDICAPPED CHILDREN. Section 33 of the Education Act, 1944, and the regulations made thereunder have placed on the Local Education Authorities responsibilities for the provision of suitable education of children suffering from disability of mind or body. A record of all such children is revised annually from returns submitted by all Head Teachers, and any new cases attending local maintained schools are reported to me with a view to medical examination and ascertainment of their suitability or otherwise of attendance at an ordinary school. The several categories of pupils requiring special educational treatment as defined in the Handicapped Pupils (Certificate) Regulations, 1953, came into operation on l6th December, 1953 (amended by 1959 Regulations). The number of children coming within these categories and their disposition as on the 31st December, 1959, are tabulated in the following table in accordance with the Handicapped Pupils Regulations, 1953, and amended by the Handicapped Pupils and Special Schools Regulations, 1959, operative with effect from 1st April, 1959. 141 CATEGORY Number of children of school age on 31st December 1959, formerly ascertained as handicapped pupils and requiring special educational treatment (s.e.t.)

The Occupation Centre for Mentally Defective Children and Adult Female patients , was opened on 8th September, 1953, at the Methodist Church Hall, Bennett's Castle Lane, Becontreer. It is known as the Ilford Junior Occupation Centre. Full medical inspection is carried out once a year, by one of the School Medical Officers, also a survey visit is made quarterly. 142 GENERAL WELFARE Provision of Meals and Milk for School-children. The provision of meals in the schools commenced on 7th October, 1940. The total number of mid-day meals served during 1959 was 2,136,426 approximately. There are 26 kitchens in the Borough, established at the following schools:- Barking Abbey, Barley Lane, Beal Boys, Beal Girls, Becontree C.P. Unit, Benton, Caterham, County High Boys, County High Girls, Cleveland, Dane, Fairlop Boys, Fairlop Girls, Goodmayes, Gordon, Loxford, Mayfield Boys, Mayfield Girls, Mossford Green, Parkhill, Redbridge, The Gilbert Colvin, The Glade, The John Bramston, Uphall and Wm. Torbitt. As from 6th August, 1946, milk in school has been supplied free of charge in accordance with the Provision of Free Milk Regulations, 1946. In October, 1959, 19,882 children, were receiving milk in school. Provision of Baths. - Shower baths are installed at Beal, County High Boys, Barking Abbey Grammar, Caterham, Dane, Fairlop Boys and Loxford Secondary Schools. Work done by the N.S. P. C.C. - The following 41 cases were investigated:- (1) Neglect 21 (2) Ill-treatment cases 8 (3) Other cases 12 (Three cases were reported from the Public Health Department 56 were reported from other sources for general neglect). 108 children(60 boys and 48 girls)were involved, 71 being of school age. In addition to this work, 135 supervision visits were paid to different cases, some of which were made to those reported during the previous year. 143 The Invalid Children's Aid Association. - 1 child was placed in a convalescent home and her fees paid by voluntary finds. Others assisted were 1 loaned tricycle, 1 loaned T.V. set, 1 supplied with clothes wringer and 1 supplied with latex foam mattress. 4 new cases were referred during the year for casework and visiting and 23 old cases were given continued casework and after care visiting. THE HEALTH VISITOR AND THE SCHOOL NURSE. Cleanliness Inspections in Schools. - The Superintendent Health Visitor submits the following report:- "The present arrangements for liaison between health visitor and school follow the trend which commenced in the Summer term 1958. At the beginning of each term the health visitor visits the school and discusses any cases which the headmistress brings forward. The health visitor also brings forward any problems which she knows may arise especially if a child is just beginning school and has a difficult family background. In the summer term every child is seen by the health visitor and a complete hygiene inspection is carried out. In some schools the Head Teacher requested that the routine hygiene inspection took place as before, at the beginning of each term. The health visitor does this on request at the convenience of the school. Other schools ask for a few classes to be seen; one child may be causing some concern and rather than embarrass this child, classes round his or her age group are seen. Telephone calls to the department asking for the health visitor to visit a school to diagnose head infestation are received fairly frequently and the teacher's suspicions usually correct. After much discussion and recommendation from the health visitors it was decided to test the eyes of 144 all children at about the age of 8 years. We find a considerable number of eye defects in this age group and the results achieved make the extra work well worth while. All children with a defect found are followed up at home; the situation is explained to the mother and, if wished, referral form to the specialist is signed at this visit. " The above scheme has also been found to be of benefit in the follow-up of those cases found at routine medical inspection to be "unsatisfactory", for the Health Visitor has the opportunity of discussing the condition with Head Teachers and in many cases school meals are recommended. All "unsatisfactory" cases are re-examined by the school medical officer. In many cases nutriments are supplied or recommended and the case seen again at varying periods of one, three or six months or less frequently on the decision of the doctor. It will be appreciated that in quite a number of such cases, because of environmental factors, no treatment or action is likely to bring forth a completely "satisfactory" condition and only the assistance most suited to the needs can be offered. Chiropody. - In 1960 chiropody clinics will be established under Local Authority control in Ilford and when fully developed the necessity of referring cases privately or unnecessarily to hospitals should be deviated. Dental Health. - Once again Mrs. J.Thurston, Essex County Dental Hygienist, was seconded to the Ilford area and she reports on her visit as follows:- "During the months of March, April, May and June of this year I gave sixteen lectures on dental health in seven Ilford schools. They were well received on the whole, the response from staff and pupils being noticeably better in certain schools. The film 'Gateway to Health' an American production, was well received at all schools with one exception, where it was the considered opinion of the staff present, that the film shown on previous occasions 'Let's Keep our Teeth' was a more interesting and informative aid and had greater appeal since it was an English production and more easily understood 145 than the American accent and idiom. I am inclined to agree with this point of view but also feel that new presentation of health information is desirable for both children and staff, for obvious reasons. Pamphlets were in short supply which was a pity, since they are a means of reaching the parents and arousing their interest, however slight. In my opinion, to be really successful the subject of dental health should be presented, not in the form of isolated lectures with a film, which have little lasting effect, but should consist of a fairly lengthy programme in each school. This would include considerable class preparation beforehand, followed by a week with a demonstrable exhibition giving opportunities for active participation by the children themselves. Finally a further period of classroom work would help to assess the amount of knowledge assimilated and the interest shown. The above programme has been followed by the County Health Education Organiser in Health Weeks in which I have participated, with considerable success in arousing and maintaining interest in the subject. More might have been achieved in this series of talks if they had been incorporated in such a programme. " Hygienic Conditions in Schools in the Division. - The Chief Public Health Inspector reports on this matter as follows:- "Routine monthly visits are made by the Public Health Inspectors to the Schools in the Borough of Ilford, particular attention, of course, being paid to the provision of school milk and its condition and the standards of sanitation. The defects ascertained on these visits are reported to the Borough Education Officer and the County Medical Officer of Health in so far as sanitary defects arise from the School Meals Service. In the newer schools the sanitary accommodation is generally satisfactory but in the older schools the sanitary conveniences are situated at a point distant from the school entailing the crossing of the 146 ground for access. The conveniences themselves are generally old, difficult to keep clean and subject to freezing in cold weather. The only solution, of course, is to install sanitary conveniences at a point within the building of a modern standard and sufficient for the use of the number of students attending the schools. Another difficulty in the system appears to be the delay in carrying out work of renovation after notification from the Public Health Department. This is due to financial limitations over which we have no local control. The washing facilities available for the schools are in some cases situated remote from the sanitary conveniences, a factor which is not conducive to sound hygienic practice for school children, and in some cases there is no hot water available for hand washing. Insofar as the staff facilities are concerned, in many instances there is insufficient accommodation or it has to be shared with other people. Finally the system of providing drinking water in open fountains at the schools is somewhat antiquated; they are placed in open school playgrounds and thereby subject to freezing and contamination. It would be far better if a system of drinking water supply were installed with the washing facilities and other sanitary conveniences at a point within a building, thereby permitting strict supervision as to cleanliness, hygiene, maintenance and making them less prone to the effects of inclement weather. Generally speaking in the modern schools, the sanitary accommodation and conditions are satisfactory but the older schools should be considered for complete re-organisation and the system of maintenance and repair ought to be speeded up to prevent in some cases serious nuisance and even, so far as school canteens etc. are concerned, contraventions of the Food Hygiene Regulations.
