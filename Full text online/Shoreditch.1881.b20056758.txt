VESTRY of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, MIDDLESEX. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACTS. TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT for the YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1882. PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18th & 19th VIC., CAP. 120, LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co., Steam Printing Works, 5, Hackney Road. E. 1882. A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ending Lady-day, 1882. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Managements Acts." SHOREDITCH. The Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, is situate entirely within the County of Middlesex. It is bounded on the east by Bethnal Green, Spitalfields and Norton Folgate, on the north by Hackney, on the west by Islington and St. Luke's, while its southern boundary is immediately contiguous to that of the City of London; its length, from north to south, is about 1¾ miles, while its breadth, from east to west, is nearly 1½ miles, and its superficial area is about 640 acres. The Parish is classed Schedule A in the Metropolis Local Management Act, and consequently returns two representatives to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry consists of 120 elected Members, and meets on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays in each month for the transaction of its general business; other and Special Meetings are held as circumstances or occasion require. The Parish is divided for Vestry purposes into eight wards, the boundaries of which are as follows:— No. 1—Moorfields Ward.—All that part of the Parish lying South of a line commencing at the Bethnal Green Boundary in Bethnal Green Road (Church Street) ; and continuing through Church Street, New Inn Yard, and Leonard Street, to St. Luke's Boundary. No. 2—Church Ward.—North of the line above described. The Eastern Boundary commences at the corner of Boundary . Street, Bethnal Green Road, and continues by Boundary Street to Austin Street, Hackney Road, thence to Kingsland Road, and by that Road to Mary Street; crosses Hoxton Street to Great James Street, thence by St. John's Road and Pitfield Street to Old Street Road, thence westward through Old Street Road, and thence by the boundary of St. Luke's to Leonard Street. No. 3—Hoxton Ward.—West and North of the Boundary of Church Ward. The Northern Boundary of this ward commences at the St. John's Road end of Nicholas Street, through that street to the New North Road, Murray Street, 6 Shepherdess Walk and Edward Street to the St. Luke's Boundary, and thence by that boundary, near the City Road, until it intersects the Church Ward Boundary in Old Street Road. No. 4—Wenlock Ward. — North and West of the Hoxton Boundary. The Eastern Boundary commences at the New North Road, corner of Nicholas Street, thence by Mintern Street and Bridport Place, over the Rosemary Branch Bridge, and thence by the Islington and St. Luke's Boundaries, the Canal, Wharf Road, &c., to the Boundary of Hoxton Ward in Edward Street. No. 5—Whitmore Ward.—All that part North of Church Ward, and East of Wenlock Ward, and West of a line commencing at Kingsland Road, by the end of Mary Street, and continuing a few yards over the Bridge. The Parish of Hackney is the Northern Boundary. No. 6—Kingsland Ward.—The line commences at the point of Ivingsland and Hackney Roads, opposite Shoreditch Church, and continuing by Hackney Road to Brunswick Street, thence to the Regent's Canal, thence by the Canal to Kingsland Road, and by that Road to the point at Shoreditch Church. No. 7—Haggerstone Ward.—All that part of the Parish lying East of Brunswick Street and South of the Regent's Canal. The Boundary of the Parish is the Hackney Road, from Brunswick Street to Gloucester Place, and continues by an irregular line and crosses over the Goldsmith's Row Bridge. No. 8—Acton Ward.—All that part of the Parish lying on the Hackney side of the Regent's Canal aud East of the Kingsland Road. The Northern Boundary is the Parish of Hackney. Under the Reform Act of 1832 the Parish was united with others to form the Borough of the Tower Hamlets: but under the Representation of the People Act, 1867, Shoreditch, together with the adjoining Parishes of Hackney and Bethnal Green, was constituted as the Borough of Hackney, and returns two Members to serve in Parliament. 7 Under the Education Act of 1870 the Borough in which Shorcditch is included returns five Members to the London School Board. Under the Local Act (1858), six Overseers are appointed yearly, viz.:— One for the Liberty of Holywell Street. One for the Liberty of Moorfields. Two for the Liberty of Church End. Two for the Liberty of Hoxton. These Liberties are obsolete for all purposes excepting only the above, and for certain Charities. The Rates are made and collected quarterly. The Public Lighting of the Parish is carried out by the Vestry's own staff. The gas consumed is supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company—the system adopted is that of metering one lamp in twenty—and paying upon the average consumption as indicated by the metered lamps. The Parish is supplied with water by the New River and East London "Water Companies : about five sixths of the Parish is within the area supplied by the first-named Company. The lines of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company are laid in the main thoroughfares. The North London Railway Company and the Great Eastern Railway Company run through the Parish; while the London and North Western Railway Company have extensive goods yards and other appurtenances therein. The Regent's Canal Company intersects the Parish from west to east. The Population as shown by the last census was 126,560; the number of Assessments is 16,721, of which 15,624 are inhabited houses. . REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1882, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £66,358 8s. 9d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. 5d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 8d.; to Michaelmas, 7d.; to Christmas, 7d.; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 2d. The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1881, was £43,590; and for the last year, £51,500 ; and for the half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1882, is £32,000. The amount owiug to the Guardians at Lady-day. 1882, was nil. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rate will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last year were— s. d. General—in the £ 2 0 Sewers ditto 0 6 2 6 10 The total amount collectcd on the Vestry Rates for the year was £6S,351 18s. 10d., an increase upon the previous year of £1,981 15s. 8d. Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £51,500 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rates and Metropolitan Asylum Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £11,225 10s. 3d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £490 18s. 5d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £12,464 17s. 3d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £14,140 17s. 0d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £1,848 ls. lld. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, or for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes is as follows, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year- List in force—. April, 1881 ; April, 1882. Increase. Gross rental £721,167 £731,301 £10,134 Rateable value 580,411 588,989 8,578 The number of Assessments and the Rateable Value of each "Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assesments, which are included in several Wards, are as follows:— Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Moorfields Ward, including Great Eastern and London and North "Western Railway 1,613 90,166 Church Word, North 2,108 55,722 Church Ward, South 1,516 58,278 Hoxton Ward 2,516 73,743 11 Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Wenlock Ward 1,793 59,210 Whitmorc Ward 2,264 53,946 Kingsland Ward, including Kingsland Road Gas Works, but not mains. 1,772 49,703 Haggerstone, East and West, including Gas Works, but not mains 1,685 42,949 Acton Ward 1,759 39,220 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows— Railways £50,085 Gas Company 28,344 Water Companies 7,350 Tramway Company 2,500 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 5,412 Hoxton House Asylum 1,000 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 3,322 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 15,875 The Workhouse and Infirmary belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not Assessed. The total of the above is £115,626, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £473,363. The new Great Eastern Goods Station, in the Shoreditch High Street, has not been sufficiently advanced to be brought into Assessment this year, but is expected to be by Michaelmas next. In the meantime the Company pays upon the value of the old Passenger Station, and upon the property removed. 12 The London and North Western Railway Company's Heavy Goods Station, in Worship Street, was made the subject of appeal at the Assessment Sessions, in February last. The Parochial figure was £2,000 rateable value. The Company contended for about one-third of that amount. In the end the full Assessment of the Parish was confirmed, with oosts against the Company. LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. No local improvements have been made in the Parish during this year, but an important one has been projected. The taking by the London School Board of the site of Westby's Almshouses, in St. John's Road, as the site for a School has afforded a long desired opportunity to widen the roadway at that spot, and an agreement has been effected between the Vestry and the School Board by which eight feet of the entire frontage, and a small slip in Bacchus Walk, will bo purchased for that purpose at a cost of about £750, towards which the Metropolitan Board has consented to contribute one-half. PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT. Metropolitan Board's Acts. An Act promoted by the Metropolitan Board has been passed during this Session, which gives power to the Board to execute orders as to naming of streets which the Board may make in default of Vestries, &c., executing such orders after three months. Also to prevent eneroachments and obstructions in streets, &c., as to giving sanction for new streets or footways, as to erections beyond lino of building, and the removal of buildings so erected without the proper sanction. These enactments are to remedy defects or to remove difficulties connected with former Acts. Some important amendments have also been made to the Building Acts, but perhaps in a public sense the most important enactment is a section giving power to the Metropolitan Board to summon before a Magistrate the owner of any building or structure, which is 13 ruinous, or so far dilapidated as to be unfit for occupation, or is prejudical to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, and obtain an order to take down, re-build, fence in, or put in good condition such neglected building, and if necessary to do the work and recover the cost. This will enable the Board to deal with a class of property which the Sanitary Acts at present hardly embraces, and will doubtless be productive of good results. There are several Bills before Parliament which, if passed, will have an important bearing upon matters pertaining to Parochial duties. Liability of Occupiers. It had been decided that an outgoing occupier was liable for the whole of the current rate for the period for which it was made if not succeeded by an incoming tenant. By an Act just passed the occupier, whether going out or coming in, is to be liable only for the amount proportionate to the time of the occupation. This will be of considerable importance where the rates are made halfyearly. Bills of Sale. Hitherto much difficulty has been experienced (perhaps more in some other parishes than in Shoreditch) in recovering rates from persons whose goods were covered by Bills of Sale. The measure now before Parliament renders such Bills of Sale nugatory as against rates and taxes, and indeed makes it of importance for the grantee of a Bill of Sale to see that the rates are punctually paid, or otherwise his security would be affected. This clause was inserted at the instance of a number of experienced Parochial Officers, and will doubtless pass this Session. Electric Lighting. Whether the application of Electricity will ever be extended generally to public or private lighting can only be determined by future experience, but it is obvious that a great impetus has been given to it by the recent Exhibitions in Paris and the Crystal Palace, and other causes, so much so that a host of projectors have came 14 forward, each having a speciality real or pretended, and several of these applied to Parliament this Session for power to supply Electricity, for lighting and other purposes, in the same manner as gas and water are supplied: that is to break up roads, lay lines, and charge for the supply by meter or otherwise. To have granted these powers, except upon some uniform and well defined basis, would have either conferred objectionable monopolies or have led to confusion and public inconvenience. To obviate this the Government referred the whole question with the private Bills to a select committee. A considerable amount of valuable evidenoe was taken and a report made upon which a Bill was framed and introduced by the Board of Trade. This is on its way through Parliament,* and so far as it will affect the powers and duties of the Vestry it may be summarised as follows:— the word Local Authority means, in the City, the Commissioners of Sowers; on the Thames Embankment, &c., the Metropolitan Board, and in the rest of the Metropolis, the Vestries and District Boards. Any Local Authority, Company or person, may apply to the Board of Trade, after three months' notice by advertisement, for a license to supply Electricity within any defined area for public or private lighting. 'Public' means to Streets, Churches, Chapels,Vestry Halls, Theatres, &c. 'Private' means, of course, to private houses, shops, &c. No license can be applied for by any Company or person without the consent of the Local Authority, nor can the Local Authority itself apply for a license unless in pursuance of a resolution passed at a Special Meeting after one month's notice. The Local Authority may attach conditions to its consent, which may be approved or otherwise by the Board of Trade. A license will be for seven years, but may be renewed with consent. If the license is given to a Company or person the expense of opening and making good streets is to be part of the undertaking. No wires are to bo carried over streets or houses without the express consent of the Local Authority, who may, in case of infringement of this regulation, remove them, and even with such consent any person may complain of them as a public danger, and a Court of Summary Jurisdiction may order their removal. * Now passed. 15 There are a variety of other clauses which relate to general matters, but it will be seen from the above that the Vestry has considerable powers and jurisdiction. It may not only generate electricity and light its own streets, but it may supply it to private consumers, though the latter is hardly likely to happen or very seldom. It has an absolute veto against admitting electricity in a public sense at all; although if a person or firm choose to generate their own electricity and use it on their own premises they can do so without a license, but they must not break up the streets or sell the current. Any person or Company may, however, apply to Parliament over the heads of the Local Authority for powers, and, doubtless, should the Local Authority refuse its consent, or attach unreasonable conditions to such consent that would, if the district were worth securing, be the course adopted. It does not appear that there is any restriction of an area to a single license, but the propriety of granting more than one license in a certain area would be for the consideration of the Board of Trade. There is nothing to authorise the Vestry to sell its consent, which indeed would be a vicious proceeding, but if it obtains a license itself it may work it by contract. The undertakers are to be, under the license, bound to supply electricity upon equal terms to all private consumers, according to the license, but they are not permitted to prescribe the special form of lamp or burner. Thus, Company A may supply the current but the consumer may, if he chooses, use Company B's lamp, and if it is objected to by A as being unsuitable it can be settled by arbitration. It is obvious, therefore, that no hard and fast conditions for consent can bo determined a priori, but each application, when made, must be considered upon it merits. Artizans Dwellings, &c. The difficulties experienced by the Parochial Authorities in putting into execution Torrens's Acts, and the great expense and difficulty experienced by the Metropolitan Board in executing Sir Richard Cross's Acts led to the appointment of a Select Committee of the House of Commons to enquire into the causes of 16 these difficulties and to provide remedies. The Committee, presided over by Sir R. A. Cross, M.P., ex-Home Secretary, obtained a considerable amount of evidence from Medical Officers, Surveyors, Philanthropists, and a few provincial Town Clerks, but very little from Metropolitan Parochial Officers. The Committee has made a report suggesting certain means for avoiding preliminary expenses and removing certain restrictions as to the number of new dwellings to be provided in the place of those removed. The report suggests that small areas containing not more than fifteen houses should be dealt with by the Local Vestries, and the larger ones by the Metropolitan Board. The report also recommends that the Vestries should be urged to more vigorous action with regard to Torrens's Acts, implying of course that there has not been hitherto a due amount of vigilance displayed. A Bill has been introduced by the Government giving effect to some of these suggestions, but how far it will meet the requirements it would be perhaps unwise at present to say. It may give the Metropolitan Board more scope for action and lessen to a degree the expense. But even admitting that the principle of buying up worthless property at the public expense is a sound one (which is a very contentious point) it is quite certain that the expense of working the Acts by the Metropolitan Board must always be very great, and entail a heavy charge upon the ratepayers. As regards the Vestries and District Boards it is certain—and this is said not in a spirit of antagonism to the principle which is pro tantum accepted—the Acts must be practically a dead letter. The Act of 1879 provides that if the Vestry makes an order that an owner shall execute certain works upon his houses or demolish them, he may, within three months, require the Vestry to purchase the property at arbitration prices. This of course is just what nine out of ten owners would do, and it is also what in nine out of ten cases the Vestries would not do; the consequence is that the order will not be made. The attention of the Home Secretary has been called to this defect in the Act, but it is too much to hope that it will be remedied. A more minute criticism of the principles and details of the several Acts would hardly be in place in this report, but the 17 following summary of the powers and obligations conferred by Torrens's Acts, and by Sir Richard Cross's Acts, will suggest many points for consideration. As to Torrens's Acts, the Medical Officers may report to the Vestry or District Board that certain houses are unfit for human habitation. The Vestry or Board is to refer this report to a Surveyor, who is to report the cause of the condition of the houses, and what is the remedy—repair or demolition. Notice is to be given to the owner when the said reports are to be considered, when the owner may attend and make objections. If an order is made, the owner has two courses open. He may appeal to Quarter Sessions, or he may require the Vestry or Board to purchase the property. If he elects the latter course, and the parties cannot agree as to compensation, the matter is to be referred to arbitration, but the Arbitrator is to take into consideration the value of the property as it then is and not its prospective value, and if the premises be utterly uninhabitable and fit only for demolition, then only the value of the land and the actual materials is to be considered, and no allowance is to be made for compulsory purchase. If the Vestries neglect to execute the Act, the Metropolitan Board may, after three months' notice, execute the Act at the cost of the Vestries. By the Bill now before the House* the several Acts are amended as follows :—Torrens's Acts, and not Sir Richard Cross's Acts are to apply to all areas where not more than ten houses are included in the report. The Acts extend not only to houses which are in themselves unhealthy, but to obstructive buildings, so that a court or a cul de sac may be opened up, but in all such cases the Vestry may, unless the owner chooses to retain the land, purchase the premises at arbitration prices. The report complains that the Metropolitan Board has never exeroised its authority to compel the Vestries to put the Acts in force, and the Bill now provides that after an Officer of Health has reported any premises under the Act, and the Vestry or District Board has not proceeded, the Board of Guardians or * This Bill has now passed and is in force as an Act. 18 the owner of any property in the neighbourhood may complain to the Metropolitan Board, and the Board shall then proceed as though it were the Vestry, and of course at the cost of the Vestry. It will thus be seen that the Medical Officer is the pivot upon which all preliminary proceedings move, and that if he does not report, neither the Vestries nor the Metropolitan Board can take cognizance of the condition of the premises, except under the Nuisances Removal Acts; and it would seem further, that if the Medical Officer does report, and the further report of the Surveyor is obtained, and the owner objects to an order being made, the Vestries are not bound to make any such order, nor would the Metropolitan Board have any power to step in, either by its own volition or on complaint; but that may be open to doubt, as it depends upon what interpretation is to be put upon the words, "the local authority have failed to put in force the provisions of the said Acts." As to Sir Richard Cross's Acts, the Bill provides that if the Home Secretary should think fit, he may dispense with the obligation on the Metropolitan Board to provide accommodation on or near the site of the demolished house to an extent not exceeding one half of the persons so displaced, and this provision may apply to areas already acquired. After the Metropolitan Board has given notice by advertisement of its intention to acquire any area no subsequent improvement, or interest created, shall be taken into consideration in respect to compensation. There is to be but one arbitration in respect to compensation claimed, and no appeals unless the compensation awarded amounts to one thousand pounds or upwards, in which case the claimant or the Board may appeal to a jury under the Land Clauses Acts. Some of the difficulties which were presented to the Metropolitan Board in dealing with larger areas may be in a fair way of removal by the Bill, but the same cannot be said of the Vestries so long as the power of appeal to that most unsatisfactory of all tribunals, the Quarter Sessions, is retained on the one hand, and the power of the owner to require the Vestry to purchase his property on the other; but whatever may 19 be the merits or demands of the Bill it will of course receive a careful consideration by the Sanitary Authorities.* Metropolitan Local Government. The Queen's speech at the opening of the present Session intimated that the Government would introduce a Bill for improving the Local Government of the Metropolis. The state of public business before Parliament has prevented the introduction for this Session of any such measure, and although many conjectures have been made as to the nature of the promised Bill none are reliable. The only intimation that has been given upon which any opinion as to the character of the intended reform can be based is a remark by the Home Secretary, to a deputation, intimating that the Government would endeavour to utilise rather than destroy existing institutions, which would seem to point to a form of Local Government for purely Local affairs, and a Central Municipal * Since the above was written an Article from the pen of Sir Richard A. Cross, on the "Homes of the Poor in London," has appeared in the Nineteenth Century. As Sir Richard was also the author in the main of the Parliamentary Committee's Report, the one is, as might be expected, almost the echo of the other. It is only natural that the ex-Home Secretary should endeavour, by explanation and subsequent legislation, to rescue his special work from the discredit of utter failure, but so far as his article—which, from such a source, may be regarded as a semi-official utterance—is concerned it cannot be said that he has done so. If the article is not disingenuous it is certainly circumscribed in view, and misleading. In speaking of Torrens's Acts he makes no allusion to the fact that every Order made by the Vestry may be the subject of a vexatious and costly appeal, and that most Orders have been so appealed against. He treats the Compensation and Purchase clauses in the Amending Act as additional reasons why the Acts should be enforced, when in fact they arc still greater deterrents to its operation, and thinks that the want of action on the part of the Vestries is due to a misapprehension that his own Act obviated the necessity of the Vestries' interference. He admits that the putting into force of his Act, by the Metropolitan Board, has cost the Metropolis a nett sum of £1,115,500, but he does not say, which is a fact, that it has not resulted in the seven years since it passed in the supply of a single dwelling. He does admit that nearly all that has been done in this respect is by private enterprise. He urges " That no time should be lost by the authorities of the City of London, by the Metropolitan Board, by the Vestries and District Boards, each in their own special province, in giving full effect and without delay to all statutory powers for the removal of so much evil and for the accomplishing of so much good; " and one of the inducements to the Vestries to so exert themselves is the increased rating which new and better premises will bring, forgetting that in the first place the parishes where these improvements are most required are the poorest parishes and consequently unable to sustain the burden, secondly, that if increased rating is to be got from working class dwellings, the working classes must pay the increase or be overcrowded on the improved site, and thirdly, that much of the proceeds of rates, ordinary or increased, in any parish goes outside the Parish altogether, and is therefore not applicable for the payment of principal or interest on loans incurred for such local improvements. 20 Authority for larger and Metropolitan affairs. The Vestry of this Parish passed a resolution as follows:— "That this Vestry, whilst admitting the desirability of extending Municipal Government to the Metropolis at large, by a measure that shall embrace the duties, powers, and privileges of the City Corporation and the Metropolitan Board of Works, is of opinion that no system of Metropolitan Government will be satisfactory which does not provide for the administration of purely Local affairs by duly elected Local Councils; and that any system which ignores this principle must resolve itself into one of Centralization and Government by Paid Officials." This was forwarded to all the Metropolitan Vestries in Schedule A, and to the District Boards, and by many of these bodies was responded to in terms of approval, with promises of support in any effort which might be made towards the maintenance of the prinoiple embodied in the resolution. There is every probability that unless some unforeseen events should prevent it, the Government will, next Session, redeem its promise and introduce the measure. It must, if it should have any general scope, affect a variety of interests, and call forth much criticism and probably much opposition. It will doubtless be referred to a select Committee. When, however, it is remembered that so small a measure of local reform as the patching up of the Artizans and Laborer's Dwellings Act has occupied a Select Committee two Sessions, and has produced no result of any practical value, it can hardly be expected that a measure involving great and organic changes, as well as containing a large amount of detail, will in one Session make any progress beyond the Select Committee stage. It will be for the Vestries and local authorities generally, when the nature of the Government scheme becomes known, to take prompt and energetic steps to protect local rights and interests from being absorbed by a central and practically irresponsible Municipal Authority. Regent's Canal Railway. The most important Private Bill introduced this Session affecting this Parish is the Regent's Canal City and Docks Railway Bill. The object of this Bill is to obtain power to construct a railway for the most part by the side of the present Regent's Canal, 21 to extend from Paddington and a junction with the Great Western Railway, to the Albert Docks, near North Woolwich, with a City terminus in Barbican, and junctions with the Midland and Great Northern Railways. It will have local stations—one at Arlington Street, just upon the border of this Parish, one at Dunston Road, by the Kingsland Road Bridge, and one at Victoria Park. The Railway is projected to run on the north side of the Canal, outside the towing path, and for the most part at about the level of the waterway, and to pass under the roads by existing bridges which are to be re-constructed, or by separate bridges to be made adjacent to the existing bridges. The Bill, as introduced into Parliament, was singularly bare of every kind of provision necessary for the protection of the public interests, and may be said to have been a public appropriation Bill pure and simple. It became necessary for the Vestry to oppose the preamble of the Bill, with the object of obtaining from the promoters the necessary protection which could not have been obtained by an opposition on clauses alone. The result of the opposition was to obtain clauses for the reconstruction of five out of the seven bridges, which are to be made of the width of 40 feet and upwards, and the widening of one of the bridges to 40 feet. Only one bridge leading to or from the Parish is to be stopped or obstructed at one time, and in all cases a temporary foot bridge is to be provided during the reconstruction. There are other clauses for securing the execution of the works affecting roads and sewers, under the superintendance of the Vestry's Surveyor, and the making good all damage for the protection of the public against danger, as far as possible, from the noise and smoke of passing trains, and for the making good of local rates, dining construction, upon property to be taken. The most objectionable feature in the scheme is a power sought to appropriate the whole of Dunston Road, which is to be the site of a station, and in substitution thereof a 12 ft. footway from Clarissa Street to Kingsland Road, to be formed out of the forecourts of the houses on the north side of Dunston Road. This the Vestry opposed and endeavoured to obtain a footway of at least 20 feet, as was done in the case of Finsbury Avenue. The effort was however ineffectual and an 22 appeal to the Committee of the Lords was likewise without satisfactory result. An effort was also made to obtain a provision securing the Parish against any diminution of the rates by the removal of valuable property in case the railway assessment did not equal the former. This provision is included in the London and North "Western Acts as affecting this Parish, and is also inserted in several Railway Acts of this and former sessions. The promoters contended that these concessions were always the result of agreement and not of compulsion, and they successfully resisted them. Practically the question is one of little importance in this case, as the Railway Assessment is certain to be an increase upon the present; but the principle is of importance and might in future cases have a real and practical import. The Bill contained a clause exempting the Railway Company from the obligation to remove manure compost or other offensive matter, which would include household refuse and street sweepings, and seeing that the scheme will entirely appropriate one wharf in the Parish now used by a contractor for the purpose of scavenging and dusting, it was considered advisable to endeavour to expunge this exemption clause, and also to secure a yard and siding by the side of the railway. The promoters resisted the first demand on the ground that the projected line was to be a purely Metropolitan line, and the second that they had not land which they could give or even sell for the purpose required. This demand was reiterated in the House of Lords, but unsuccessfully. The Bill was stoutly opposed in the House of Lords by the Grand Junction Canal Company and other interests, and many clauses were given for the protection of private interests ; but the only alteration of public importance made in the Lords Committee, which can affect this Parish, was a widening of the general waterway of the Canal where there are no wharves, from 35 feet (the proposed width), to 40 feet. This may in some respects, and possibly in Regent's Row, require the taking of more property, but not to any serious extent. The period allowed for the construction of the railway and works is six years. 23 Great Eastern Railway. A Bill was introduced to empower the Company to widen the railway across Shoreditch High Street and Commercial Street. The Vestry opposed in order to obtain a provision that not more than one-half of the High Street should be stopped or obstructed at one time, and also to obtain a clause securing payment of present rates during the execution of the works, and until the new works were assessed to an equal or greater amount than the present value. This was an important clause as it is doubtful whether the additional assessment upon the extra lines of railway will equal that of property to be taken, and if not, the parish would sustain a permanent loss. The Company consented to the proviso as regards the keeping open of the High Street, but resisted the demand for a proviso as to future rating, so that after the works are completed the railway will be assessed at its then value, regardless of the value of property removed. London School Board. The School Board Schedided in their Provisional Order this Session a portion of the Wenlock Basin, adjoining the Wenlock Road School, probably for a playground, as the School itself is by no means full. Also some property in Napier Street and Cropley Street, and some in Brunswick Street, Hackney Road; likewise the old Burial Ground in the Hackney Road, and houses in the rear. The Yestry opposed the proposal relating to the Hackney Road site, on the ground of decency and sanitary considerations, and the promoters, after making several proposals and modifications of the scheme, which were not accepted by the Parliamentary Committee, withdrew the scheme altogether, and, considering that this was only an alternative with the Brunswick Street scheme, it is not likely to be repeated. 24 ASPHALTE v. TRAMWAYS. The agreement between the Vestry, the North Metropolitan Tramway Company, and the Val De Travers Asphalte Company, respecting the maintenance of the asphalte roadway in front of the Town Hall has been a constant cause of dispute between the two Companies. The Asphalte Company maintains that the 6d. per yard per year, the price for which the Company is bound to keep the roadway in repair, extends to ordinary wear and tear only, and that much injury is done to the asphalte, and expenses thrown upon the Company by the defective condition of the rails, and claims from the Tramway Company a larger sum, which claim the latter company resists. There has already been, some four years ago, one arbitration, at a great expense, upon the same point, but which, owing to some legal technicality, was practically abortive so far as the settlement of the question was involved, though nominally it went against the Tramway Company, which was condemned in damages and costs. The dispute is again renewed upon the old lines, and the Board of Trade has informed the Yestry that it has appointed Mr. C. Hutton Gregory, C.E., as the arbitrator. It is possible that the Yestry may have to appear nominally as a party in the case, but the issue is between the two Companies, and, except as to some trifling costs, the Vestry is not concerned. The Vestry will, as hitherto, insist upon the roadway being kept in repair by the Asphalte Company, leaving the question of costs to be contested by the Companies. SUN STREET (APPOLD STREET) IMPROVEMENT. The following tables are the most recent supplied by the Metropolitan Board. (See pages 30 & 31.) The Vestry has up to the 25th March last paid off the loans of £65,000; £4,365 in principal, and £8,792 in interest. Since then by the recoupment the principal has been further reduced by £10,752. The Yestry has also received a cash payment from rents, &c., of £2,200. It is expected that by another year the whole of 25 the property will be sold, or so far so as to admit of an accurate statement of the total cost to be made, and by which it is confidently expected that the result will show an actual profit to the Parish in respect to increased rating over and above the annual payments to be made, but of course the whole of the increased income from the rates will not be applicable for this purpose. Another statement supplied by the Accountant to the Metropolitan Board shows the interest allowed the Vestry by the bank on balances in hand, and charged as adverse balances. From August, 1877, to June, 1881, the interest allowed on the occasional balances was £510 0s. 7d., and from July, 1876, to the 20th of September, the charges by the Board, at the rate of £3 15s. per cent., amounted to £563 4s. 7d., leaving a balance against the Vestry on the interest account of £53 4s. Od. SALE OF FOOD ADULTERATION ACT. The appendix shows the result of the application of this Act during the past year. It may be remarked that adulteration of a character to bring it within the scope of the Act is confined almost to four articles—milk, butter, bread and alcoholic liquors, practically to the former two; occasionally a conviction is obtained in respeot to mustard, jams and drugs, but only seldom, as is shown by the reports of prosecutions in other localities, and by the reports of the Local Government Board. The adulteration of butter is mostly by the admixture of an article of American manufacture known as Oleomargarine, a preparation from animal fat, sent mostly to Holland and mixed with Dutch butter, and then sent to this country as genuine Dutch. The chemists do not regard this substance as injurious to the consumer, but the danger is that owing to the keenness of competition the adulterating ingredient may be adulterated, and so that pure Bosch may not be obtainable. To the present, however, no such case has been reported in this Parish. Milk adulteration partakes mainly of the form of added water or abstracted cream; no instance of the admixture of 26 deleterious substances has yet been reported in this Parish. The following information, regarding the milk supply, may not be without interest. A respectable cowkeeper and dairyman in the parish called upon the Vestry Clerk and handed him a sample of an article which somewhat resembled cream, though thicker and whiter than the real article. It had the taste of milk, and mixed fairly with tea, &o., similar to condensed milk. The dairyman said it was largely used in the trade, not only to mix with milk, but, when mixed with three times its bulk of water, was sold as milk, that the Analysts could not determine its composition, and that although it was represented as an imported article he believed it was manufactured in this country, and was not milk at all, and its use was a serious injury to the home-producing dairy interest. This and also a second sample were sent to the Analyst, Dr. Stevenson, with a request that he would make a complete analysis and report. He did so. The result of his analysis is given below. He stated that it was nothing but condensed milk with a small addition of boracic acid, probably as a preservative; that it yielded cream, but slowly, as is the case with condensed milk, but in other respects it was good and genuine milk. It was probably imported from Italy, as such an article had been in the market for some time. Dr. Stevenson's opinion has since been corroborated in a communication to the Vestry Clerk by another eminent Analyst, and by one of the largest dairy producers in the country. It is satisfaction therefore to know that this strange milk apparition is at least of a harmless character, 27 COMPARATIVE ANALYSES. Genuine average Milk.

(Signed) Thos. Stevenson. Bread.—The form of adulteration in bread is the admixture of alum. Convictions can hardly be obtained, because it is used only in small quantities, and is not certified when in the bread to be injurious to health, although as unmixed alum it might be. It is used to whiten and stiffen inferior flour. 28 Alcoholic Liquors.— The adulteration is when it occurs mostly by the addition of water beyond the permitted degree of dilution; but so keen is the competition in the trade that the vendor is obliged to keep up the quality to a reasonable degree to retain his custom. Where it is practised is in low houses where people resort not for drink alone but for bad company. The proper remedy in these cases is for the Police to report the character of the houses to the Licensing Magistrates who should withold the license. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 105 times; the Council Chamber 11 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charges. The receipts for letting were £673 7s. 0d. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS.

To the Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, 4,978 births—2,562 males and 2,416 females,—and 3,154 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1882. Deducting the deaths (298) which occurred in Holborn Infirmary, the mortality was 22.56 per 1,000 living, slightly above the average of the last five years which was 21.43 per 1,000. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggers tone District, in which is situate Shoreditch Infirmary. Population. Deaths. Average per 1,000.

There were 390 deaths from bronchitis, 296 from phthisis, and 192 from pneumonia. All lung affections are much Influenced by cold and wet. 945 deaths occurred under one year against 944 the year before; and the deaths under five years have increased; 1,552 against 1,358 in the previous year. 278 deaths occurred in persons at and over 65 years of age; 186 persons died from 75 to 85; 46 from 85 to 95; and one death was registered at 101; whilst in the previous year, tho woather being very cold and damp, 243 died at 65 to 75 ; 163 from 75 to 85; 45 from 85 to 96; and 7 from 95 and upwards. In infancy tho largest number of deaths was caused by lung disoase (224) comprising 95 from bronchitis; 54 from pneumonia; and 75 from other pulmonary affections. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility. 146 deaths; convulsions 76; whooping-cough 95; premature birth 63; and diarrhoea 83. In old age 151 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 59 by heart disease; and 45 by paralysis; but the largest number, 238, was registered under the term of " old age.''' During the winter and spring months (December, January, February, and March,) of the year ending 25th March, 1882, there were 955 deaths registered, whilst in the corresponding months of the previous year there were 1,013 deaths. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 549 deaths—199 by whooping cough; 123 by diarrhoea; 51 by scarlet fever; 89 by measles; 13 by diptheria; and 74 by other zymotic diseases. 95 of the 199 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under one year of age. 83 of the 123 deaths from Diarrhoea occurred under one year. The influence of age is much more manifest, 154 of the 199 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years, and 96 of the 123 deaths from diarrhœa occurred in infants under two years of age. There were 44 deaths from small pox. 81 DWELLINGS.—A large number have been much improved, cleansed, repaired, better ventilated and better drained. 895 dwellings have thus been rendered more beneficial for habitation. The houses of Ware street, Watson's place, and Louisa street, which have been brought so many times under the notice of your Vestry, have recently been greatly improved; but to secure this the Vestry was compelled to exercise its utmost power; authorizing a builder to enter a number of the premises and do the works required. The owner was summoned for the costs. 17 houses were thus entered, the yards were well paved, closets reconstructed, and new drains provided. The alterations made in the dwellings of the Parish, have involved better workmanship and the use of more enduring materials, has therefore conduced to a better state of health. It is encouraging to learn from Inspector Alexander that the people in the poorer parts of the parish have become more cleanly and take more care of their habitations since they have been altered and much improved. CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY has continued to work well. In some of the large dwellings (Model Lodging Houses) the unclean condition of the cisterns has rendered alterations necessary, to enable the inhabitants to obtain water for drinking purposes direct from the main. THE DISINFECTING OVEN has worked satisfactorily, and 6,655 articles have been disinfected in it, and dwellings have been disinfected by sulphur fumigation, exposure to the open air and by cleaning. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health, VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF SAINT LEONARD, SHOREDITCH.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following Report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ending 25th March, 1882, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. A special Report on the model dwellings known as Alexandra Buildings, Luke Street was made by order of the Sanitary Committee, setting forth the injurious conditions existing in 24 premises. Special Reports were also presented on the model dwellings situate in the Vinegar Ground, 64 premises ; and on the houses in Louisa Street, 15 premises; setting forth in detail the injurious conditions existing in those 79 premises. House to house visitation, and special inspection with reference to complaints made in 947 premises. Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 895 premises. 84.

A few instances are again mentioned in detail to show the mode of procedure and the nature of the work accomplished. ST. MARY'S LODGE, HAGGERSTONE CHURCH. —In the Report for the year, 1880, it was stated these premises were closed, in accordance with the Vestry's order, several cases of fever having occurred in the lodge, and there being reason to believe the ground under and around the premises to bo charged with human remains. In August of this year it was observed the premises were in preparation to be again occupied: copies of the Vestry's previous order and correspondence thereon wore therefore forwarded to the Minister in charge, which led to the exhumation of the remains of 81 persons from under and within the walls. The emanations from these remains were very offensive, and must have been dangerous to persons living in the house. The foundation of walls was carried down to virgin soil, a depth of lift. 6in., on which were built 14in. brick in cement walls, under-pinning the entire superstructure. The exterior of these lower walls was cased with impervious material to prevent the entry of gases from the adjacent graves. The interior was filled in with lime rubbish, covered with a layer of concrete, leaving a space of 2ft. under the floor which is thoroughly ventilated from three sides. 87 WATSON'S PLACE, WARE STREET and LOUISA STREET.— The condition of these houses has for many years been that of a constantly recurring- nuisance, arising largely from original defect of structures (including the use of improper materials, and the non-provision of proper foundations,) but mainly from defective drainage—closets unprovided with water and in an extreme state of filth and dilapidation—absence of dust bins— and from yards and wash-houses being defectively paved. Previous efforts to improve these houses have been defeated by the owners negligently permitting the work (ordered) to be done in the most superficial and unsubstantial manner. 1 to 17, WATSON'S PLACE. —The owner being called upon to abate the nuisances complained of, did, after much delay, begin the work, but carried it on so slowly as to seriously aggravate the original nuisance. This being reported to the Vestry, an order was made by resolution to enter the premises under the powers given by the "Metropolis Local Management Acts" and do the necessary works, charging the owner with costs thereon. The works, which were extensive, and occupied much of my time in supervision, included an entire re-construction of drains, re-building and part re-building of water closets, and provision of Water supply to same, construction of dust bins, and paving of yards, areas, and wash-houses. All which works have been executed in a satisfactory manner by the Vestry's builder. 22 to 35 WARE STREET.— These houses stand back to back with those of Watson's Place, and were equally filthy, dilapidated, and neglected. The owners being called upon to 88 abate the nuisance complained of, and observing the action taken by the Vestry in adjoining premises, they themselves executed similar works to those described, and in a satisfactory manner. 1 to 21 WARE STREET. —The course taken with the houses in Watson's Place was not practicable in this case, there being a great probability that many of the back additions would collapse if not taken down carefully before other works were commenced. Their condition was referred to the ''Metropolitan Board of Works" under whose orders most of the back additions have been demolished and re-constructed. A great improvement has been secured in these houses by the removal of wet earth from contact with back walls, and the formation of areas, and also by the provision of two public dust bins of improved construction. The works are not yet complete, and there is reason to fear that much of that which has been done will not prove durable. 1 to 15 LOUISA STREET. —The owner of these houses, after much delay, decided to regard the back additions as so much rubbish, which he threw down and has carted away, and replaced with substantial buildings of superior brick-work. A great improvement has been effected here by the removal of the water closets from the inside to the outside of the walls in the re-construction of the back additions. WENLOCK BASIN, REGENT'S CANAL.— In the beginning of the summer much attention was directed to the silting up of this water-way with foul deposits. Notices were therefore served on fourteen wharfingers requiring them to remove deposits adjacent to their respective wharfs. This being a work requiring united action on the part of the Wharfingers, also the co-operation of the "Regent's Canal Company," occasioned some delay in carrying out the Vestry's order, which was further increased to avoid disturbing the deposits during the warm weather. The work has now been successfully carried out. 89 PLOUGH YARD. —The vacant ground abutting on the Railway Arches in this yard not being- properly hoarded in, it had for some time been used by coster mongers and others as a place for depositing their trade refuse, the smell from which became very offensive. Notice was therefore served on the "North London Railway Company "requiring the removal of all the refuse, and the provision of a proper hoarding to prevent a recurrence of the nuisance. This, after some little difficulty, was done by the Company, and in a satisfactory manner. Police Court Summonses were taken out against the owner of Nos. 1 to 17 Watson's Place, with reference to dilapidated roofs, and the generally foul and dilapidated condition of walls, ceilings, and internal fittings. The magistrate made the orders applied for on behalf of the Vestry, in each case. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. ALEXANDER, Sanitary Inspector. 91 INSPECTOR FLETCHER'S REPORT. ST., LEONARD, SHOREDITCH, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to Report to you that during the year ending March 25th, 1882, the conditions named below have caused nuisances dangerous to health, and were inspected and remedied under my supervision :— Accumulations of dung, &c., removed from 7 premises. Obstructed closet drains repaired and cleansed in 15 „ Water closets cleansed and repaired in 1 ,, Water laid on or re-instated in 74 „ Yard paving re-laid and sinks provided in 21 „ Over-crowding abated in 3 „ Dirty rooms cleansed in 1 „ Smoke nuisances abated in 3 „ Pigs removed from 2 „ Corpses, decomposing, removed from 3 „ Minor nuisances (not referred to Inspector Alexander) little alteration needed in 3 „ NUISANCES DANGEROUS TO HEALTH, CONSEQUENT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES. —The following details show the Sanitary measures adopted where cases of contagious disease occurred:- Number of houses inspected and disinfected 820 Notices served requiring owners and occupiers to disinfect articles, &c., liable to retain infection in 820 premises. 92 826 cases of contagious diseases were reported to the Sanitary Department, of which 662 were cases of small-pox. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses, drains, &c. 520 of the above small-pox cases were removed to the Small-pox Hospital, 98 were not removed, and 44 died. Number of infected beds disinfected at the Vestry's disinfecting oven 551 Ditto pillows ditto 1,001 Ditto mattrasses ditto 307 Ditto bolsters ditto 334 Ditto other articles ditto 4,462 Making a total of 6,655 articles disinfected. ARTICLES OF FOOD, &c., condemned and destroyed by me as being unfit for human consumption:— 9 tins of potted meat 1 pig's head 96 pounds of pickled pork 35 pounds of meat SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. — See Analyst's Report. REMOVAL OF DUST.— During the year ending 25th March, 1882, the dust on the whole has been fairly removed from the Parish, and there has been a slight decrease in the number of applications for the removal of dust from private dwellings than in the previous year. The number of applications during the past year, compared with the number of applications during the previous three years, is shown below:— Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd 1881-2 1215 4 0 1242 3 0 In the previous three years the average number was— 1241 8 0 1279 7 0 93 The plan of exposing the letter D in the front window, when an inhabitant requires the dust removed, has answered fairly. The removal of dust during the year has been better attended to than in previous years, no doubt on account of the very mild season and fine weather prompted the inhabitants to have the dust removed more frequent than usual, consequently the accumulations were not so large. SCAVENGING.— The system adopted by the Vestry four years since, of accepting the proposals of two Contractors, viz.: one for the Eastern and one for the Western Division, has been found to work satisfactorily, and is the means of getting the work done in an efficient manner. I may state that during the year the weather has been very satisfactory for the Contractors, for scavenging, quite different to the extraordinary bad weather during the previous year. WATERING THE ROADS.— The system of hiring vans, carts, horses, men, &c., to water the roads and streets, under the immediate supervision of the Vestry's Officers, on the whole has worked satisfactorily, and the work done much better than in the previous year. I may further state that by giving the horse hire to a person who has the convenience of keeping his horses in the parish is a great boon to the inhabitants. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. R. FLETCHER, Inspector. 94 APPENDIX A. SITUATION OF THE URINALS IN THE PARISH. 1. King Johns Court, Holywell lane (Brick and Slate) 2. Hudsons Court, Kingsland Road (Iron) 3.
