IN accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts, the Vestry presents the following Annual Report for the twelve months ending 25th March, 1899. The following meetings have been held throughout the year. Vestry Meetings 25 Standing Committee Meetings 122 Special Committee ,, 35 Sub-Committee ,, 64 246 PERSONAL. At the first meeting of the newly-elected Vestry on the 24th May, 1898, before proceeding to the ordinary business of the evening, the Vestry passed a resolution expressing their profound regret at the death of the Eight. Hon. William Ewart Gladstone, recording their deep sense of the loss sustained by the nation in his decease, and at the same time expressing their sincere condolence with the widow and family of the deceased statesman in their bereavement. The flag was hung on the Vestry Hall half-mast high, and the offices were closed on Saturday, the 28th May, 1898, being the day of Mr, Gladstone's funeral. 12 Mr. Thomas Haynes was re-appointed Chairman of the Vestry for the year. On the 18th October, 1898, the Yestry passed a vote of condolence with the widow of the late Mr. J. Calver, who was for many years a Member of the Vestry. COMPOUNDING FOR RATES. In consequence of the Vestry having adopted a new scale for Compounding Bates, it became necessary to pass a resolution rescinding an Order of the Vestry of the 14th September, 1869, applying Section 4 of the Poor Bate Collection and Assessment Act, 1869, to this parish. The rescinding resolution was adopted at the meeting of the Vestry on the 5th April, 1898, and came into effect six months after that date. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES. Some little delay occurred at the commencement of the year in obtaining the sanction of the Local Government Board for the loan of £3,900, required to carry out the work of constructing the Underground Conveniences in Old Kent Boad and St. George's Circus and the Underground Urinal at the Newington Causeway end of the Borough Boad. The sanction was, however, received on the 5th April, and the Vestry's seal was ordered to be affixed to the mortgage to the Council on the 3rd May. At the meeting of the Vestry on the 7th June, it was determined to invite tenders for the construction of the Conveniences in St. George's Circus and Borough Boad, and, at the same meeting, the seal of the Vestry was affixed to Messrs. .Pinch's contract for the Old Kent Boad Convenience. That firm also obtained the contract for constructing the Convenience at St. George's Circus at the price of £1,659, and the Urinal at the Newington Causeway end of the Borough Boad for £879. No provision was made in the Convenience at St. George's Circus for Females; but on the 28th June the Yestry passed a resolution to the effect that a Women's Convenience be erected at the rear of the Library Buildings, in accordance with the plan then subminitted. An agreement was entered into with the Library ommissioners for the use of the site at the rental of £5 per annum, 13 and the Surveyor was instructed to obtain tenders for the work, The tender of Messrs. Smith & Sons, at the sum of £336, was subsequently accepted, and the work is now proceeding. The construction of the Old Kent Road Convenience was completed about the commencement of February, 1899, when the District Surveyor certified the structure. Attendants were appointed, and the Convenience was handed over to the Public Health Committee, and opened on the 27th February. The Conveniences in St. George's Circus and Borough Road were completed and handed over to the Public Health Committee on the 13th March, 1899. REMAINS IN ST GEORGES CHURCH CRYPT. At the meeting of the Public Health Committee on the 25th April, 1898, the Medical Officer of Health reported that, as desired by the Rector, he had made an examination of the Crypt of St. George's Church, and found that there were a large number of coffins and human remains in the Crypt. He also found the air was musty and unhealthy, particularly at the end of the Crypt, where he discovered cracks in the structure, about half-an-inch wide, which not only rendered the Church dangerous by allowing effluvia to escape into the building, but possibly rendered the Church a dangerous structure. He further stated that, in his opinion, as Medical Officer of Health, the condition of the Crypt was in a state dangerous to health. The question came before the Vestry on the 3rd May, when a resolution was adopted referring the question as to the condition of the Crypt being dangerous, to the Public Health Committee, with power to act. In accordance with this resolution the Committee on the 9th May, requested Dr. Pakes, the Assistant Bacteriologist of Guy's Hospital, to take a sample of the air in the Crypt, to be obtained in the centre transept at the westerly end of the nave, and also a sample of the air in the Church on a morning before the congregation had assembled, and to analyse the samples and report thereon to the Committee. On the 19th May, Dr. Hoffman of the Burial Acts Department of the Home Office attended at St. George's Church to inspect the 14 Crypt, when a letter was read from Dr. Pakes giving the chemical analyses of the air in the Crypt and in the Church, showing that these airs were purely normal. Dr Pakes's formal report was received and submitted to the Vestry on the 24th May, from which it appeared that Carbon dioxide was found to be present in the Church to the extent of only 0.404 parts per thousand parts of air, which would compare favourably with some of the best air in London. The air in the Crypt contained 1.206 parts of Carbon-dioxide per thousand parts of air. The bacteriological analyses showed that the number of organisms per cubic metre found in the Church was 22,000, but apart from a few moulds, a fair number of oidia, a considerable number of torn Ice, no organs resembling any of the common pathogenic ones could be discovered. In the Crypt 16,500 organisms per cubic metre were found. Four-fiths consisted of moulds, oidia, torulas and parcinse; the remaining one-fith consisted of bacteria, among which no pathogenic bacteria could be discovered. In the opinion of the Vestry this report showed that there was no cause for the interference of the Home Office, and a copy of the report was accordingly directed to be forwarded to the Home Secretary. On the 28th June, a letter was read to the Vestry from the Home Office, stating that the Home Secretary had decided to advise the Queen in Council, to make an Order for the removal of the human remains from the Crypt. A resolution was then adopted by the Yestry that, "as the elected Representatives of the Parishioners of St. George the Martyr, Southwark," they regretted the action taken by the Home Secretary with regard to the Crypt, without first giving the Sanitary Authority of the District, an opportunity of being heard, and requested that a Deputation from the Yestry on the subject should be received by the Secretary of State. A further letter was received from the Home Office, asking for the observations of the Vestry upon the question, before the Home Secretary decided whether he would or would not receive the Deputation. Tothis letter the "Vestry replied by a communication pointing out that in their opinion the length and period which had elapsed since 15 any bodies were buried precluded any danger to public health existing or likely to exist, and suggesting that the difficulty might be overcome by the whole surface of the Crypt being sealed with a layer of concrete ; also pointing out that as a large number of bodies are interred beneath the floor of the Crypt, and cracks have appeared in the walls of the Church, there was grave reason to fear that any excavation might tend to weaken the foundation of the building and threaten the stability of the superstructure, but that a layer of concrete would probably bind the structure together. The Home Secretary replied that after considering the representations contained in the letter, he did not find any sufficient grounds to alter his decision and did not think that any advantage would result from a Deputation. The Vestry replied to the communication, regretting the Home Secretary's action, and not only as a Sanitary Authority, but in their capacity as representatives of the ratepayers, again urged upon him the desirability of permitting them to place their arguments before him by deputation. On the 20th September the Home Secretary replied that he saw no reason to vary his decision. On the 25th January, 1899, the Churchwardens discovered a letter in one of the lower rooms of the New Alley premises, adjoining the Churchyard, addressed to them, and containing an Order in Council, made on the 9th August, 1898, directing the whole of the human remains lying in the Crypt to be removed and forthwith interred in some consecrated burial ground in which burials could be legally made—the work of removal to be carried out under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health of the district. The Under Secretary of State subsequently appointed the 24th February to receive a deputation from the Vestry to discuss the question. The deputation urged upon him the desirability of delaying the removal of the bodies till the proposed Long Lane Improvement is carried out, when other bodies buried in the Churchyard will have to be removed by the London County Council. The Yestry are now awaiting a communication on the matter. TELEPHONES. On the 24th May, 1898, a communication was received from the Clerk to the London County Council, stating that as the question of 16 the London Telephone Service had been referred by the House of Commons to a Select Committee for enquiry,'the Council proposed to hold a Conference of the Metropolitan Local Authorities, on the subject, so as to prepare evidence to lay before the Committee. The Conference was fixed for Tuesday, the 14th June, and delegates were accordingly appointed by the Vestry. Evidence was subsequently given before the Select Committee by representatives of the County Council Conference, and the question stood over to the ensuing Session of Parliament. With regard to the relationships between the National Telephone Company and this Vestry, it may be well to state the action taken by the two bodies:— On the 28th June, 1898, the Vestry passed a resolution directing that six months' notice be given to the National Telephone Company, Limited, to remove the cables laid in Marshalsea Road, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement with the Company; and notice was given accordingly. At the next meeting, the Vestry called the attention of the Company to the inconvenience caused, and the seriousness of the delay, in consequence of the Sanitary Officials being unable to communicate promptly by telephone with the Metropolitan Asylums Board, in cases of infectious disease requiring removal to hospital. At the request of the Telephone Company, the District Manager, had an interview with the Electric Lighting and Dust Disposal Committee of the Vestry, on the 23rd September, and requested that the notice with regard to the Marshalsea Road should be withdrawn, and that the Vestry would consent to the laying of telephone wires in Old Kent, Waterloo, Westminster Bridge, and Borough Roads. Atter volunteering certain information on behalf of the Company, he was requested to supply numerous other particulars, more especially as to the arrangements made between the Company and the other I arishes in the Metropolis. On the basis of the information thus supplied, the Committee recommended the Vestry to consider any offer from the Company, based upon the way-leave granted by the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields to the Company, for which £15 per annum and £1 per 100 feet is paid. The Company declined to accept the offer of the Vestry, but offered to pay 2s. per 17 100 yards of cable laid, and to be subject to certain other conditions laid down by the Vestry. It was, however, determined to adhere to the previous resolution, and at the end of the year no further action had been taken by the Company with reference to the matter. In September, 1898, a letter was received from the Wandsworth Board of Works, expressing the opiuiou that the Telephone Service should be exclusively undertaken by the Government, and that it was not desirable that the Service should be undertaken by the London County Council, or by other Local Authorities, and that the Post Office should not undertake the Service in competition with the National Telephone Company. After considering the matter, the Vestry adopted the following resolution:— " That in the opinion of this Vestry the Telephone Service should be undertaken by Government, in competition with the National Telephone Company." In the 1899 Session of Parliament, the National Telephone Company introduced three Bills— (a) Bill No. 1 for the re-constitution of the Company, and for granting them further powers. (b) Bill No. 2 containing simply the provisions for conferring further powers on the Company; and (c) Bill No. 3, an amendment of the Telegraph Act, 1892. The first two Bills failed to comply with the Standing Orders, and the latter—which contained a clause enabling the Company to appeal to the Railway and Canal Commissioners in the event of a Local Authority withholding its consent or attaching any terms and conditions, to which the Company objected, to the placing of wires within its district, either by means of poles along the public roads or underneath any public street—was subsequently withdrawn. The opposition to the measures was organised by means of a conference convened by the Corporation of London, to which the Vestry appointed Delegates. The Vestry also presented petitions against the three Bills. It is understood that the Government intend to introduce a measure dealing with the whole question of telephones in the present Session of Parliament. 18 metropolitan police. Notwithstanding the representations made in 1897 to the Home Office with regard to the inadequacy of the Police Force to deal with the serious crimes committed from time to time in this district, it was found that rowdyism still continued to prevail in South London. The Yestry, on the 26th July, 1898, accordingly passed the following resolutions "That application be made to Parliament to sanction an increased grant to the Police Force, so that adequate Police protection can be secured to persons and property in South London, which at present does not obtain." That this Authority is of opinion that this district is insufficiently provided with police protection and that the prevailing and increased rowdyism, ruffianism, intimidation and number of assaults call for immediate attention and suppression." The resolutions were forwarded to the Home Secretary and the Chief Commissioner of Police. While on the subject of the Police, it may be well to mention that in September, 1898, the Yestry received a communication from the Chief Commissioner, inviting the co-operation of Local Authorities in assisting the Police to devise means for lessening the traffic in busy thoroughfares, and suggesting that main thoroughfares should be watered during the night and the gutters during the day time so as to obviate the slipping of horses. To this communication the Yestry directed a reply to be sent to the effect that:— "(a) That the question of scavenging at night time is now receiving the attention of the Vestry; (b) That watering the streets during the night only is impracticable; (c) That so soon as the improvements at the Elephant and Castle and Long Lane are completed the traffic would be materially lessened at. these points; (d) That more Police are necessary to efficiently regulate the traffic at the Elephant and Castle; (e) That the Commissioner be recommended to approach the London County Council with a view of diverting some of the tramway traffic from London Eoad, down St. George's Ptoad and Lancaster Street; (f) That, in the opinion of the Vestry, the By-laws should be enforced respecting the distance to be maintained between each tramcar. rating of ground values. On the -29th November, 1898, the Vestry considered a letter from the Land Law Reform Association, inviting the Authority to 19 send delegates to a Conference on the question of the rating of ground values. Four Members of the Vestry were accordingly appointed to attend the Conference, which was held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, on the 8th December, 1898. The delegates subsequently reported that resolutions were adopted at the Conference in favour of the rating of ground values, and a Petition was presented to Parliament by the Vestry embodying the decisions of the Conference. london government. The question of the reform of London Government, so far as the various Local Authorities are concerned, having become ripe fur discussion by reason of the declaration of the intention of the Government to introduce a measure dealing with the question, in the succeeding Session of Parliament, a conference was convened by the Vestry of Islington in October, 1898, to consider the whole subject. Representatives of the Yestry were appointed and many of the recommendations agreed to by the Conference, have been subsequently adopted by the Government. On the 1st November, a letter was received from the St. Saviour's Vestry, stating that a Conference would be held on the 2nd inst., respecting the question of the full Incorporation of the Ward of Bridge Without. Delegates were appointed by the Vestry to the Conference with a view of watching the proceedings and to report the result to the Vestry. At the conference certain resolutions were drafted which it was agreed should be submitted by the Representatives of each Vestry to their respective Authorities. The resolutions were reported to the Vestry on the 15th November, 1898, when a Special Committee was appointed to consider and report on the whole subject of the Government of London so far as it affected this parish. The Committee, however, after carefully considering the proposals of the two Conferences above referred to, were unable to agree upon any suggestions laid before them and a Special Meeting of the Vestry in Committee was accordingly convened to further consider the matter for the 20th December, 1898, but in view of the fact that the 20 Government had not yet introduced their measure or indicated its character or scope, it was deemed imprudent to deal with the question till that event had taken place. The promised Bill was introduced by the Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour, M.P., First Lord of the Treasury, into the House of Commons on the 23rd February, 1899. Prints of the Bill were issued on the 1st March, and on the 3rd of that month, a Special Committee of the Vestry considered the measure, when a large number of recommendations were made to the Vestry. At the Vestry Meeting held on the 7th March, a resolution was passed strongly disapproving of the Bill on the grounds that it did not simplify the administration, that it did not provide for further relief of Local Taxation and that it destroyed many valuable Authorities at present doing excellent administrative work in all parts of London. The Vestry also adopted the following recommendations of the Committee:— 1.—"That in the opinion of the Vestry, the London Government Bill should not be passed into Law, unless the areas of the whole of the proposed Metropolitan Boroughs are included in the first Schedule to the Bill." 2.—"That as far as possible the areas of the new Boroughs should be fixed on the lines of the Poor Law Unions." 3.—"That in the opinion of the Vestry, the constitution of Aldermen as part of the new Councils is contrary to the principle of direct representation, and should be eliminated from the Bill." 4- "That the number of Councillors assigned to each of the Wards of the new Boroughs should be based upon the population, and not on the rateable value." That it should be made clear in the Bill that women are eligible to sit upon, and to hold any office upon the Council. 6.- That it should be provided in the Bill, that the jurisdiction of the City Coiporation and its officials over the ancient Borough of Southwark should be entirely abolished. 7.-Thatin the case of borrowing powers being transferred to the new Councils, the sanction of the London County Council should still be required instead of that of the Local Government Board as provided in the Bill. 8. That theVestry express its disapproval of the provisions contained in Clauses 5 and 8 of the Bill relating to the transfer by the Local Govern- 21 merit Board of the powers of the County Council to a Borough Council, on an agreement being arrived at between the two Councils. 9.—That the words "or of any of their other powers or duties "should be eliminated from Clause 9. 10.—That the words "by a body containing representatives elected by the Guardians "should be omitted from Clause 11, line 39. It remains to be seen how many of these recommendations will be adopted in the Bill. It was at the same meeting determined to invite the four Vestries contained in the St. Saviour's Union, to a Conference to be held on the 17th March, to consider the whole question as to the formation of a suitable area in this district. At that Conference it was found impossible for any other representatives than those of the Parishes of St. George and Christ Church to be present, and after expressing the opinion that the areas outside those mentioned in the Schedule to the Bill should be formed upon Poor Law Union limitations, the Conference adjourned. A further Conference was convened by the St.. Olave's Board of Works suggesting that the whole of the Parliamentary Borough of South'wark should form a Borough Council. This Conference, however, which was held at the Offices of the St. Olave's Board, adjourned without being able to come to any definite determination on the matter. A further amendment to the Bill was adopted by the Vestry at the meeting held on the 21st March, to the effect:— "That the Bill should provide for the powers and duties of Overseers to be transferred direct to the new Councils." The Bill passed the second reading on the 14th March. It is expected that it will be considerably amended in Committee. long lane improvement. Notice to Treat in respect of the portion of the Churchyard proposed to be included in the new road to be constructed by the County Council in extension of Tabard Street, was served on the Vestry on the 5th April, 1898. The Council subsequently applied to be permitted to take immediate possession of the premises in New Alley belonging to the 22 Vestry, and this request was agreed to on the 3rd May, 1898, subject to the Council making arrangements with the tenants now occupying the premises. The Council have not yet taken possession of the property. At the following meeting of the Vestry a resolution was adopted to the effect that, subject to the consent of the Home Secretary being obtained, the Vestry would offer no objection to the proposal to re-inter the human remains from the portion of the Churchyard required for the new road, in the Easterly portion of the Churchyard, provided the Rector and Churchwardens agreed thereto. The Vestry made a claim in respect of the portion of the Churchyard to be taken by the Council under the Notice to Treat, upon the principle of reinstatement instead of a monetary consideration. The claim includes, amongst other conditions, the provision of an open space of equal or greater area than the land taken, and the paving of the new roadway with wood. It was further determined, at the meeting of the Vestry on the 28th June, that the open space should not be used as a playground for children. At the request of the Council, Mr. Douglas Young was appointed as the Surveyor of the Vestry in respect of the two claims for the taking of the New Alley Premises and for the taking of a portion of the Churchyard, but it was deemed inexpedient by the Authority to unite the two claims either on the basis of reinstatement or a monetary consideration. vestry offices. On the 3rd May, 1898, the Yestry adopted a resolution, on the recommendation of a Special Committee, to the effect that in future the time of attendance at the office of all the clerks employed by the Vestry be from 9 in the morning. The time at which the clerks were required to attend at the office was previously 10 a.m., and three months notice was accordingly given to the clerks as to the change of hours. committees' reports. The method of reading the whole of the minutes of the Committees at the Vestry Meeting—a process which occupied a consider able length of time and otten failed to secure adequate consideration for important resolutions—was finally abandoned by the 23 Vestry at the commencement of the summer vacation in 1898, and at the succeeding meeting on the 6th September, Reports of the Committees were for the first time included in the Vestry's Agenda and brought up in printed form in accordance with a resolution adopted on the 28th June, 1898. The writing up of the minutes of the vestry in a minute book was also abandoned on the 18th October, 1898, and printed minutes kept in a binding file, each page being initialled by the Chairman, were substituted therefor. lost assessments. The attention of the vestry was, on the 10th January, 1899, called by the vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, to certain disclosures in the "City Press" of the 12th November, 1898, respecting certain "lost assessments" in the City, and a resolution was passed concurring with the latter Yestry in urging upon the London County Council to take immediate steps to remedy the alleged irregularities. At a subsequent meeting of the Vestry a letter was read from the Clerk of the Council, statiug that the Town Clerk of the City had replied to the Council that the errors were merely omissions from the rate books. labour bureaux. A communication was received from the Vestry of Islington, on the 21st February, 1899, stating that it was proposed to hold a Conference on the subject of Labour Bureaux, and inviting the Vestry to appoint representatives. Delegates were accordingly elected to attend the Conference, which was held on Wednesday, 22nd March, 1899. Reconstruction of Sewers in Friar Street Area. Public Health and Sewers Committee. In the early part of the year 1898, the Surveyor, in accordance with the instructions of the Vestry, submitted a scheme for the re-drainage of the Friar Street and Pocock Street areas, as an instalment of a larger scheme for the re-construction and repair of the whole of the defective sewers throughout the Parish. The estimates of the Surveyor, amounting to £4222 12s. 7d., were adopted by the Vestry on the 5th April, 1898, and 24 application was directed to be made to the London County Council for a loan of £4250, to be taken up on the following 1st October. The Council reduced the amount by £200, which they understood to be establishment charges, and offeied to giant a loan of £4050. This loan was accepted by the Vestry on the 21st July, the conditions of repayment being by annual instalments of principal and interest on the balance outstanding for a period of twenty yeais. The Council subsequently agreed to grant a loan of £200 to defray the cost of the salaries of the Draughtsman and Clerk of Works, if the same were added to the next loan applied for. The Surveyor was instructed to proceed with the work on the 6th September, 1898, and, at the same meeting, the mortgage for the money was sealed by the Vestry. Re-laying of Sewers. The Vestry, at the suggestion of the Committee, directed the following sewers, to be relaid out of current expenditure, at the undermentioned estimated cost:— £ s. d. Borough Road, from St. George's Circus to opposite the New Free Library 73 10 0 Borough Road, from the Library to Lancaster Street 278 0 0 Rear of 46 to 54, Marcia Road 52 0 0 Boundary Sewer from Emary Street to Westminster Bridge Road 50 0 0 (£25 being paid by the Lambeth Vestry). A serious case of typhus fever occurred at 20, Toulmin Street, at Typhus Fever.Easter, 1898.during the absence of the Medical Officer on vacation; but, by the prompt and vigorous action of Dr. Smith, who acted as Dr. Waldo's locum tenens, and Dr. Massie, the medical attendant on the patient, every precaution was taken to prevent the spread ot the disease, with great success; and, as a mark of their appreciation of the efforts of the two Doctors, the Vestry passed a resolution on the 15th April, 1898, placing on record their high appreciation of the skill and vigilance displayed by them in thus preventing the spread of the disease. 25 Overcrowding and Housing of the Working Classes. The density of the population on the South side of the river, and the difficulty of obtaining suitable houses for the working classes, induced the Vestry of Bermondsey to convene a Conference on the subject of overcrowding and on the housing of the working classes. The Vestry accordingly appointed delegates to attend the Conference, which was held on the 15th July, 1898, at the Bermondsey Town Hall, when various resolutions were adopted calling upon the London County Council to exercise their power under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, to provide dwellings within the County of London where required, and suggesting certain alterations of the law and of financial arrangements to enable Local Authorities also to erect municipal dwellings. The resolutions came before the Yestry on the 29th November, when the Vestry expressed its concurrence with the former proposal, and also with proposals that Local Authorities should be allowed to erect and permanently manage dwellings under Part I, Section 12 (5) of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and that the period of borrowing should be extended to one hundred years, but disagreed with the proposals to enable Metropolitan Local Authorities to erect municipal dwellings under part 3 of the Act. In February, 1898, a letter was received from the St. Saviour's Board of Guardians, drawing attention to the overcrowding within the area of the Union. The matter received the consideration of the Public Health Committee who directed a reply to be sent to the effect that the subject was continually receiving attention by the Committee and the Sanitary Staff, and they felt that every effort was being made to comply with the provisions of the Act for the abatement of overcrowding in the parish, at the same time no tangible suggestion had been laid before the Committee that could be recommended for adoption. Condensed Separated Milk. At the suggestion of the Vestry of Camberwell, the Yestry passed resolutions on the 20th September, 1898, urging the Government to introduce a Bill requiring persons manufacturing or importing condensed milk to state the quantity necessary to obtain the full benefit of new English milk. This resolution, which was adopted by a large number of Authorities 26 throughout the Metropolis, was followed up by the appointment of a deputation to wait on the Board of Agriculture with reference to the subject. Representatives of the Yestry accompanied the deputation, which was received by Mr. Long, of the Board of Agriculture, on Monday the 20th March, 1899. L.C.C. Bacteriological Laboratory On the 20th September, 1898, the Vestry had before them a proposal of the London County Council to establish a Bacteriological Laboratory, with a view to aiding Medical Officers of Health and medical practitioners in the diagnosis of suspected cases of infectious disease at the expense of the County, when a resolution was adopted expressing the opinion that the Council should apply for power to establish such a department. Sterilised Tubes for Bacteriological Examination. The question of providing gratuitously sterilised tubes to medical practitioners for bacteriological examinations in doubtful cases of infectious disease was considered by the Public Health Committee at considerable length, the matter being adjourned from time to time, in order that the Committee might, if possible, be furnished with further evidence as to the advantages of the system. They, however, were eventually unable, from the evidence laid before them, to see their way to recommend the adoption of the system by the Vestry. Red Cow Alley.. At the meeting of the Vestry on the 18th October, a formal resolution was passed to the effect that the continuance of the premises Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Red Cow Alley was dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwelling-houses, and that it was expedient to order the demolition of the same. Tuesday, the 29th November was fixed for further consideration of the resolution, and on that date a representative of the owners attended the Vestry, and stated that he could not say that the owners were prepared to put the property into a proper state of repair They objected to demolition on the grounds that the premises were not dangerous, and failed to see the right of the Vestry to order their demolition. The Vestry, however, made an Order for the demolition of the premises. 27 Messrs. Gover, the owners of the houses, gave notice of appeal to the Quarter Sessions, and the Vestry determined to defend their Order. The Appeal came before the Court of Quarter Sessions at Newington on the 13th January, 1899, when, after hearing evidence on behalf of both parties, the Court decided that the premises were in such a condition as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the surrounding population, and the public generally. They, however, came to the conclusion that in Section 33, Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, the word "dwelling-house" meant an inhabited dwelling-house in accordance with the definition contained in Section 29. The Court thereupon decided that as the Act was a penal one, they must read it strictly, and that Section 33 must be taken to refer to an inhabited house only, and as the houses referred to were not then inhabited, but in a ruinous state, they accordingly quashed the order. The Chairman, however, expressed the willingness of the Court to state a Case for the decision of the High Court on the point of law thus raised, and the Vestry determined to adopt this course. The case has been drafted by Mr. Corrie Grant on behalf of the Vestry, and is now in the hands of Messrs. Gover's solicitors for approval. Addresses of Outworkers. The Yestry of St. Mary, Battersea, having suggested inter-communication between Sanitary Authorities for the inter-change 'of information relative to outworkers, the Vestry passed a resolution concurring with the Authority in the proposal. It was deemed, however, to be impracticable to put the suggestion into practice, owing to the want of a complete list of streets in each of the parishes throughout the Metropolis, showing the number of houses in each respective parish. A resolution was therefore adopted, directing a communication to be forwarded to the London County Council, suggesting the advisability of the Council preparing a complete list of the whole of the streets in the Metropolis, showing, in respect of streets in more than one parish, the numbers of the houses in each respective parish. The question has been brought before the Council, but, up to the present, they have been unable to see their way to have such a list compiled. 28 Occupation of Underground Rooms. By Section 96 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the occupation of underground rooms not occupied in conjunction with any other room or rooms on any other floor of the same house is forbidden. In the case of underground rooms let in connection with premises on another floor no such prohibition exists. The Committee found that in a considerable number of cases throughout the parish underground rooms let in connection with rooms on other floors were occupied for sleeping purposes. They accordingly directed the Medical Officer of Health to report on the best means of preventing such underground rooms being used for this purpose. The Medical Officer suggested that the desired object might be obtained by deleting the word "separately" from Sub. Section 1 of Section 96 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. A communication was accordingly directed to the Local Government Board, urging that a Clause should be inserted in any Bill promoted for the amendment of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, amending Section 96 accordingly. Establishment of Public Slaughterhouses and Abattoirs. In November, 1899, a proposal came before the London County Council to abolish private slaughter-houses and establish public slaughter-houses and abattoirs throughout the Metropolis. The suggestion was strongly opposed by many Authorities and the Vestry received communications from the London Butchers' Trade Society and the London Chamber of Commerce, urging them to join in the opposition to the scheme. The matter came before the Vestry on the 29th November, when a resolution was adopted to the effect, that, in their opinion no adequate reasons had been adduced for the abolition of private slaughter-houses for the purpose of establishing the proposed costly and extensive public abattoirs. The Vestry further declined to support any proposition for the establishment of public abattoirs. Flooding of Basements. About Christmas, 1898, several heavy rain storms occurred which caused the flooding of basements in various parts of the parish, owing to the main sewers of the London County Council being inadequate to carry off the storm water. 29 It was reported to the Vestry, that in 1895 the Medical Officer of Health sent to the Chairman of the Main Drainage Committee of the Council a list of 20 cases of sewage flooding in basements, and in many of the instances referred to the rooms were used as work, rooms, but no action had yet been taken by the Council to deal with the matter in this district. A communication was accordingly directed to be forwarded to the London County Council drawing attention to the serious possible consequences that may arise from flooding of basement rooms, and urgently requesting the Council to take immediate steps for more efficiently dealing with storm water. The matter again came before the Vestry on the 7th February, 1899, upon a report by the Committee of the result of the Surveyor's inspection of certain arrangements at premises in Old Kent Road to prevent the flooding of basements. The Committee expressed the opinion that the' particular trap used, which is on the "stop back" valve principle, would doubtless prevent flooding, provided the drain is thoroughly well laid in a good bed of not less than six inches of concrete. Directions were given to the Inspectors in the event of a recur, rence of flooding to take the necessary steps by the service of intimations and notices to abate the nuisance and prevent a recurrence thereof, and to take proceedings if the notices were not complied with. A letter was also received by the Vestry from the Local Government Board on the subject, and a reply was directed to be sent by the Vestry Clerk to inform the Board of the steps taken by the Authority in drawing the attention of the Council to the matter, and of the above course adopted by the Vestry. Phthisis. At the meeting of the Vestry on the 7th February, 1899, a resolution was adopted to the effect, that seeing much suffering and a large number of deaths arise from phthisis, it being an infectious disease, the Medical Officer of Health be desired to point out in simple language, the danger of the disease, and to draft regulations which should be observed in respect to its prevention, 30 The question of tuberculosis also came before the Vestry at the meeting on the 21st March, on a letter from the Vestry of Westminster, drawing attention to the frequency with which milk and cream are infected with tubercle bacilli, and to the spread of this disease through this medium. A resolution was adopted by the authority directing that representation be made to the Board of Agriculture and the Local Government Board pointing out the necessity and advisability of so varying the provisions of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885, as to make it include the case of a cow with disease of the udder, which shall have been certified by a veterinary surgeon to be suffering from tubercular disease, and further that any cow found to be suffering from tuberculous disease should be condemned to be slaughtered, and such parts destroyed as shall be considered unfit for human food and dangerous to health if so used, and suggesting that compensation should be paid to the owner, provided that at the time of seizure the animal was of no less value than £10. Female Sanitary Inspector. The advisability of appointing an additional Female Inspector came before the Vestry on the 21st March, 1899, on a report from the Committee that very successful work had been carried out by the present Inspector with regard to houses let in lodgings, and the Medical Officer of Health reported that there was still a large number of houses in the parish which could be registered under the Tenement Bye-Laws. The Vestry determined to appoint an additional female Sanitary Inspector at a salary of £110 per annum rising by annual increments to a maximum of £150, subject to the approval of the Local Government .Board. Loan of ill,100. Works Committee. Early in the year 1898, it was determined to erect new workshops at the King James Street Yard, in accordance with plans and estimates which had been prepared by the Surveyor, at an estimated cost ot £350. On the 3rd May, 1898, resolutions were adopted for paving the portion of the carriage-way in the Waterloo Road, opposite the Board School, and also the portion of the c arnage-way ot Borough Boad, opposite the Library, with Jarrah wood blocks, the net estimated cost amounting to £293, 31 At the next meeting, the asphalting of the carriage-way in Union Street was added to the work, and it was then determined to apply to the London County Council for a loan of .£1,100, to include the above work. The sum of £200 was also added, being the amount deducted by the Council from the loan for sewerage works, thus making the total amount asked for £1,300. On application being made to the London County Council, some correspondence took place between the Vestry and the Council with regard to the loan, from which the Council insisted on deducting £57 9s. 0d., on the ground that they considered 12s. per yard was sufficient for the wood and asphalte paving, whereas the Vestry's late Surveyor and the present Surveyor stated that it was utterly impossible to carry out the work at less than 13s. Od. per yard. The Council also asked interest at 3£ per cent., a rate of interest which the Committee considered was more than ought to be paid, and after further correspondence the loan was abandoned. l. c. c. By-Laws as to Lamps, Ac. In May, 1898, the County Council forwarded to the Vestry, draft By-Laws for the regulation of lamps, signs and other structures overhanging the public way. After considering the By-Laws the Vestry made certain amendments therein, and returned them to the Council. The chief objection was raised to By-Law No. 19, which proposed to empower the Council, in any case which it might consider expedient, to modify or dispense with the observance of the By-Law on such terms and conditions as it might think proper. As the By-Laws were to be administered by the Local Authority, the Vestry expressed strong disapproval of this proposal as contrary to the spirit of the Section under which the By-Laws were framed. Dusting and Scavenging. An important report was brought before the Vestry on 29th November, 1898, by the Committee, containing suggestions from the Surveyor for extensive alterations in the present method of dealing with the work of dusting and scavenging, so as to secure the same being done more efficiently and frequently. The principal alterations consisted of the establishment of an early morning gang for scavenging the principal streets, the commencement of the horse brooms at 3 a.m. instead of 6 a.m., and the making 32 of the gangs to a certain extent common, in order to enable tne General Foreman to find work for dust trounoers during the time the vans are away at the shoot. The suggestions provided for the scavenging daily of all the principal roads in the parish, and of several of the side streets in Wards 1 and 2 twice a week, and Ward 3 three times a week. It also insured, as far a possible, the clearing of the dust from every place in the parish, twice a week. Numerous alterations in the staff were required, but the change was carried out, and is now working with very little friction. Street Lighting. An important offer was made to the Vestry in March, 1899, by the South Metropolitan Gras Company, for introducing a new design of lanterns and substituting incandescent burners for the present ones, in a large number of lamps throughout the parish. The proposal is still under the consideration of the Vestry. Asphalting Streets. The principal portion of the Sewerage scheme in the Friar Street area having been completed, the Vestry determined, on the 21st March, 1899, to re-pave several of the streets through which the sewers had been constructed, with asphalte, in accordance with the wish expressed by the Yestry that all side streets should, as far as possible, be paved with this material. As there was a large quantity of work to be carried out, it was determined that the concrete foundations should be prepared by the Vestry's workmen and the asphalte laid by a contractor. The streets it was decided to asphalte consisted of the following:— Estimated cost, s. d. Little Surrey Street 322 18 6 Silex Street 447 n 6 Lant Street and Lombard Street 480 13 10 Miniver Street 346 0 0 District Surveyors. The A estry received a communication from the Yestry of St. Mary, Battersea, asking support to resolutions of that Authority requesting the London County Council to adopt regulations with regard to District Surveyors, providing that they should devote the whole of their time to the duties, that they 33 should be paid a salary, and all building fees be paid to the Council, and that their offices should be at the Local Vestry Hall, so that they might be brought into closer touch with the Local Authorities. After considering the matter, the Vestry passed a resolution concurring with the views of the Battersea Vestry. The Paragon. General Purposes Committee. The necessary documents for the completion of the purchase of the Paragon Ground having been prepared, the Vestry, on the 7th June, 1898, directed a cheque to be drawn for the purchase-money, £3,400. It was, however, then found that the builder, who was engaged in taking down the old houses at the Paragon, had used the open space as a depository for building materials of all kinds, and, under the circumstances, the Vestry deemed it advisable to defer the purchase until the space was cleared. The purchase was completed on the 13th September, 1898, and at the meeting of the Vestry on the 18th October, permission was given to the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association to proceed with the work of laying out the ground, the plans having been previously approved by the Vestry. The work is now proceeding rapidly, the Vestry having accepted tenders for the provision of the necessary gates, railings and iron fencing, and arranged for a suitable water supply to be provided. It is hoped the ground will be opened soon after Whitsuntide. Portland Place open space. On the 24th July, 1898, the Vestry received a letter from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association stating that the Trustees of St. Bartholomew's Hospital were prepared to grant a lease to the Vestry of the triangular piece of ground opposite Portland Terrace for a term of eighty years, at a rental of 1s. per annum, and that the Association were prepared to lay out the piece of ground in the event of the lease being obtained and subject to the Vestry maintaining the ground, and providing and fixing new iron railings opposite the houses in Portland Terrace. The lease of the ground was completed on the 25th October, 1898, and the Association are now carrying out the work of planting the ground and making the footpaths, and the Vestry of fixing the new iron railings, and making and fixing new iron gates, &c. 34 Parapet Walls on High Buildings. In the month of June, 1898, a fatal accident occurred to a man who fell from the roof of Queen's Buildings, and the attention of the authority was thus called to the danger arising from high buildings of this character not being surrounded by more efficient protection on the parapet walls of the roofs to prevent accidents of this kind occurring; at the same time the attention of the Vestry was drawn to the fact that owing to the lack of such protection, boys not infrequently ran along the parapet walls of Queen's Buildings to their great risk and danger. The Vestry accordingly deemed it desirable to call the attention of the County Council to the necessity of more efficient protection being provided, and suggested the advisability for that authority obtaining statutory powers, enabling them to deal with these cases. A communication was received from the Council in regard to this recommendation, stating that the Building Act Committee were unable to see their way to recommend the Council to obtain statutory authority to compel owners of model dwellings of considerable height to provide such protection. The Vestry, on the 13th December, 1898, in view of another accident which had occurred in the meantime, at the same building, directed a reply to be sent to this communication asking the Building Act Committee of the Council to reconsider the subject and embody a clause in the direction indicated, in any General Powers Bill the Council was likely to promote in the ensuing Session of Parliament. It is much to be regretted that the Council have not seen their way to take this course. Control of Open Spaces. The question of the control of the smaller Open Spaces throughout the Metropolis having come before the London County Council, they determined to convene a conference on the matter, and at their request the Vestry appointed delegates thereto. The conference was held at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, on Wednesday the 25th January, 1899, when a resolution was adopted to the effect that the maintenance and control of all Open Spaces under ten acres should be undertaken by the Sanitary Authority for the District, and that the Council should grant to the Authority the amount of the cost, 35 based upon the average expenditure on the Open Space for the preceding three years; the grant to be subject to a certificate of the Council's officials that the expense has been incurred and the work properly carried out. South Eastern and London, Ghatham, and Dover Railway. A Bill was promoted by the South Eastern Eailway Company and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company, for the amalgamation of the two Companies by means of a joint committee to manage the whole system. It was felt generally throughout the Metropolis that the effect of such- an amalgamation would, by destroying competition, tend to increase tariffs on the two lines. A number of Authorities accordingly determined to petition against the Bill, and on the 21st February, 1899, the Vestry also decided to present a petition against the measure. The Bill has not yet come before a Parliamentary Committee. On the recommendation of the General Purposes Committee, the Yestry expressed the following opinions on the under-mentioned matters:— Shops Bill, 1898. On the suggestion of the Vestry of Limehouse, the Vestry passed a resolution concurring with the views of that Authority that the Bill should not become Law. L. C. C. Parliamentary Agent. On the suggestion of the Yestry of St. Mary, Battersea, the Yestry concurred in the opinion that the London County Council should have the whole services of their Parliamentary Agent. Combined Drainage. A Bill was promoted by a conference of Metropolitan Local Authorities which met from time to time at the Holborn Town Hall, for the purpose of drafting a measure calculated to relieve the Metropolitan Authorities from the burden thrown upon them by recent decisions, of repairing what are in fact private drains as public sewers. The Bill proposed to alter the definition of the word "drain" in the Metropolis Management Acts, so as to include any drain, the construction of which as a sewer has not been 36 sanctioned by a Local Authority, or which has not been approved as a sewer by the Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council. The Vestry concurred with the provisions of the Bill, and urged the London County Council to take up and secure the introduction of the measure. Census. The Vestry concurred with the expression of opinion of the Vestry of Camberwell that Her Majesty's Government should be asked to provide for the future taking of the Census in the Metropolis by the same authority that is responsible for the preparation of the Voters lists, having regard to the great importance of a correct return being obtained for the equitable working of the Equalisation of Kates Act. Inter-communication by underground electric railways. The Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, urged upon the Vestry to support that authority in making representation to the London County Council to oppose certain underground electric railway schemes with a view to the formation of a Parliamentary Committee to consider and report upon the routes along which further underground electric railways should pass, so that such schemes should be based upon a considered and formulated plan of inter-communication throughout London to be defined by Parliament. The Vestry concurred with this view and directed a communication to be forwarded to the London County Council accordingly. Rating of railways in progress. The attention of the Vestry was called by the Vestry of St. Mary, Lattersea, to the necessity of a measure being passed to amend Section 133 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, whereby local authorities shall in future be entitled to be recouped the whole of the local rates instead of only the Poor Late in respect of any property acquired by railway or other companies until the new works come into rating. The Vestry concurred with this view, and directed a communication to be forwarded to the local Members of Parliament accordingly. 37 Central Electric Supply Company. A Bill was promoted by this Company to enable them to supply electricity in bulk to various electric supply companies throughout the Metropolis, including amongst others, the London Electric Supply Corporation, which supplies electrical energy in this parish. The Bill was an attempt to render useless the powers of local authorities to purchase electric lighting undertakings in their respective parishes by reducing the undertakings to mere sets of wires without generating stations ; but as the place where it was proposed to establish the central station was Marylebone, the locus standi of the other parishes was not admitted. An attempt was made to throw out the Bill on Second Reading, but this was not successful. It is satisfactory to know that the name of the Company supplying this Parish was omitted in the House of Lords. Streets Traffic Bill. A Bill was promoted by the Chief Commissioner of Police with a view to empower him to regulate the character of the traffic along any of the streets and roads of the Metropolis. It was felt that this power might lead to invidious distinctions being made betweeu different kinds of traffic, which might produce great inconvenience to tradesmen and others. A strong feeling was expressed that the Bill ought not to pass into law, and the Vestry petitioned against it in the House of Commons. The Bill was subsequently dropped by the Government. Charities Committee. United Charities Scheme. On the 6th September, the Committee presented a report to the Vestry upon a draft scheme received by them from the Charity Commissioners, for the future regulation of certain of the charities of the parish. The scheme contained a proposal to constitute a body of thirteen Trustees— seven to be elected by the Vestry, five co-optative Trustees (including two life Trustees), and the Rector as an ex-officio Trustee—to whom the whole management and control of the charities referred to should be committed, and it was provided that, after applying the necessary amounts towards Sir John Fenner's and Edward Martin's charities in the purchase and distribution of bibles, and the educational purposes of Delaforce's Charity, the balance of the residue of the income of the charities should be applied in the 38 payment of pensions of not less than 7s. per week or more than 10s. per week, and provisions were made for the election of the pensioners accordingly. The Committee made several recommendations for the amendment of the scheme, the principal of which were as follows:— They asked that Humphrey Williams' (Kent Street) Charity and Simmonds's Charity should be included in the scheme. They opposed the appointment of five co-optative Trustees' as inconsistent with the Trusts under which the various charities were constituted. They suggested the increase of the number of Trustees to 22, and, if a less number, no ex-officio members to be included. They further suggested that the amount applicable in the purchase of bibles should be reduced to £5. A strong opposition was shown to a clause compelling the Trustees to apply a yearly sum of £300 towards the provision of nurses and temporary relief. It was also suggested that a clause should be inserted in the scheme protecting the rights of the present pensioners. The Vestry agreed to these recommendations, and appointed a Deputation to wait upon the Charity Commissioners to fully place the views of the Vestry before them. Sir Henry Longley, K.C.B., Chief Commissioner, received the Deputation on Thursday, the 24th November, 1898, when he stated, in dealing with the amendments suggested by the Vestry, that in appointing co-optative Trustees, the Commissioners had only followed their usual practice, but they would be prepared to consider other names, to be suggested by the Vestry, in the place of those mentioned in the scheme, as co-optative Trustees, for five years. With regard to the two life Trustees, the gentlemen being old Trustees, had made it a condition of their assent to the scheme, that they should be so appointed, which the Commissioners agreed to. The Commissioner also pointed out that although the Charity Commissioners were desirous of altering the application of the funds of the Bible Charities, the Court of Chancery had in a similar case decided that this could not be done without a special Act of Parliament. He agreed to the substitution of "may" for "shall" in the clause as to the sum ot £300 being applied for the provision of nurses and to the omission ot the Sub-section as to temporary relief, thus leaving it optional to the trustees to make a grant for the provision 39 of nurses for the sick and aged poor. He also agreed to a clause protecting the rights of the present pensioners. Sir Henry Longley added that it was intended to deal with Humphry Williams and Simmonds Charities by a further scheme. The original scheme was completed and sealed by the Charity Commissioners on the 21st March, 1899, and included in the names of the co-optative Trustees was one nominated by the Vestry in place of one named by the Commissioners, who declined to act. The number of Trustees remain as originally fixed at thirteen, but the other clauses have been altered as agreed to by Sir Henry Longley. Application for Revocation of Provisional Order. Electric Lighting and Dust Disposal Committer. county ok london and brush provincial electric lighting company. The position taken by the Board of Trade in the early part of 1808, of refusing to revoke the Order of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, on the ground that the Company had not carried out its Order for the period of six years, was maintained by the Board. The plans of the Company having been disapproved by the Vestry and the County Council, the Company appealed to the Board of Trade, who appointed Major Cardew, Inspector of the Board, to hold an inquiry with reference to the matter. The Inquiry was held on the 27th June, 1808, when the Vestry were represented by Counsel (Mr. Corrie Grant), the Company by Mr. Sydney Morse, their Solicitor, and Mr. A. J. Lawson, their Engineer, and the Council by the Chairman of the Highways Committee and other Members. After hearing the arguments on both sides, the Inspector made an award on the 11th July, allowing the appeal of the Company, upon conditions that they gave a written consent to the Board of Trade that they would at once commence and diligently proceed with the execution of the works, and that, if within eighteen months from the date of the Order they were unable to give a supply of energy in the parish from any generating station, they would at once proceed to ereet within the Parish, or within some adjoining district, a generating station from which a proper and sufficient supply of energy would be given. The Company were also required to furnish the Vestry with a corrected plan of the works, with details. The plan 40 was submitted by the Company on the 26th July, 1898, and the Company proceeded with the work. System of Supply. In December, 1898, the Vestry received a communication from the Board of Trade enclosing letters from the Company, asking permission to change the system of supply to a system of two-phase alternating currents; the Vestry, however, did not agree to the proposal. Injunction against Company. In carrying out the work of laying mains throughout the parish, it was discovered by the Vestry's Surveyor that between Saturday, the 11th, and Monday, the 13th February, the Company laid down two sets of mains across Borough High Street, near St. George's Church. One of these sets of pipes was laid in the correct line, but the other was laid along a trench deviating from the plan in a south-westerly direction, from a point opposite St. George's Church to the southerly side of Marshalsea Eoad. The Company still insisting on laying pipes along the southerly side of that road, contrary to the plan, the Surveyor stopped the work on Thursday, the 16th February. The Company having claimed the right to lay pipes along the northerly and southerly sides of the road, beyond the point indicated on the plan, the Vestry Clerk was instructed, on the 17th February, to obtain an interim injunction restraining the Company from proceeding with the work. The case came before Mr. Justice Kennedy the next day, as an ex parte application, and he made an order restraining the Company from proceeding until the hearing of a summons before a Judge in Chambers. The case was heard by Mr. Justice Phillimore, on Friday, the 24th February, 1899, when, after reading the affidavits of the Vestry Clerk and Surveyor, and of the Assistant Engineer of the Company, and carefully examining the plan deposited by the Company with the Vestry, his lordship suggested that in his view it would be desirable for both parties to treat the hearing in Chambers as the trial of the action. The Company's Solicitor agreed to this course, and the Judge thereupon gave judgment for the Vestry for a declaration, 41 "That the Defendant Company have no right to break up the pavements or surface of Marshalsea Road, in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, or to place electric mains and works in, under, along, or across such road otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of The Southwark Electric Lighting Order, 1892, confirmed by The Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 5) Act, 1892." He also gave judgment in favour of the Vestry for costs against the Company. The Judge, however, directed that judgment should not be entered until Tuesday, the 28th February, in order to give the Company an opportunity of then appearing, if on further consideration they were not prepared to consent to treat the hearing as the trial of the action. The Vestry Clerk subsequently received a letter from Mr. S. Morse, Solicitor to the Company, stating that he did not propose to appear on that day. Judgment was, therefore, drawn up and entered. Bill in Parliament. In the 1899 Session ot Parliament, the Company promoted a Bill, the practical effect of which was to enable them to construct three or four large generating stations in various parts of the Metropolis, and to supply the Parishes for which they held Provisional Orders and other extensive areas with electricity by this means. The Bill also sought to empower the Company to lay down connecting wires through Parishes, for which they already possessed an Order, but beyond the limits of the area of supply. After considering the whole measure the Vestry deemed it advisable to present a petition against the Bill. The Bill came before the Committee of the House of Commons on the 21st March; but a large number of local authorities, together with the County Council and numerous other Companies and persons were represented in opposition to the measure. The Vestry appeared by counsel, and after an hearing extending over seven days the Bill was thrown out by the Committee. generating stations and supply of electrical energy. A communication was received from the Vestry of Hammersmith, asking this Vestry to support the views of that Authority with regard 42 to certain suggestions contained in the Report of the Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament on the subject. After considering the suggestions, the Vestry passed a resolution concurring with the views of Hammersmith, that, where powers have been given for the erection of a generating station outside the area of supply, the Local Authority within the area of supply should have the power of deciding the route the mains are to be laid, as well as the power of themselves breaking up and reinstating the streets. The Vestry also strongly objected to the proposals contained in the report to minimise the power of veto possessed by local authorities as to the erection of overhead wires and the granting of Electric Light Provisional Orders. Officers. vestry clerk's department. Mr. Arthur E. Baldrey was, on the 24th May, 1898, appointed Clerk in the Accountant's Department of the Vestry Clerk's Office, in the place of Mr. F. Seabrook, resigned, at a salary of 35s. per week, rising, by annual increments of 2s. 6d., to a maximum of 45s. a week. Owing to circumstances which are well known to the Vestry and the Parish, the Collector for Ward 1 was on the 12th July, 1898, on the recommendation of the Overseers, removed from his office, and Mr. Thomas Brown, the Vestry's Accountant, was ultimately appointed to the post on the 15th November, 1898. His poundage was fixed at the rate of 2½d. in the £ until the sum amounted to £300 per annum; after that sum was reached, the poundage on all monies collected to be at the rate of l½d. in the £. The position of Accountant was filled by the appointment of Mr. C. H.

On the 4th October, 1899, the Vestry determined to appoint an Assistant Surveyor, and advertisement were issued, for applicants for the post. The salary was fixed at £130 per annum, rising, by annual increments of £10, to a maximum of £180 per annum, and on the 29th November, 1898, Mr. R. T. Miller was appointed to the post. public health department. Mr. C. Grover, having resigned his appointment as Clerk in the Public Health Department, Mr. E. H. Thomas, of Swansea, was appointed to the position on the 28th June, 1898, at a salary of 35s. per week, rising, by annual increments of 2s. 6d., to a maximum of 40s. per week. The previous Caretakers of the Reception House having resigned, Mr. and Mrs. Aylmer were appointed by the Public Health Committee to succeed them (the former to act also as Superintendent of the Disinfecting Department), at the wages of 30s. per week, rising, by annual increments of 2s. 6d., to a maximum of 35s. per week, with an additional bonus of 2s. 6d. for each family received into the Reception House. The latter amount was increased, on the 21st March, 1899, to 5s. a family. On the 4th of October, 1898, Mr. Philip David was appointed as Sanitary Inspector for Ward No. 3, in place of Mr. W. H. Ralph, who had obtained another appointment. On the 18th October, 1898, the Vestry passed a resolution to the effect that in all official appointments made by the Vestry, any application made by an employee of the Vestry for such appointment shall receive special consideration of the Committee of selection. By order of the Vestry, J. A. JOHNSON, Vestry Clerk. July, 1899. VESTRY OF The Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. ANNUAL REPORTS Of The Surveyor, FOR THE Year Ending March 25th, 1899. ARTHUR HARRISON, A.M. Inst., C.E., Surveyor. SURVEYOR'S ANNUAL REPORT. FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 25TH, 1899. TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following Report and Statement of the works executed under the supervision of my Department during the 12 months ending 25th March, 1899. ROADS AND FOOTWAYS. The works carried out under this head during the year have been generally in the character of repairs, with the exception of the wood paving opposite the Free Library, which was repaved in February with Jarrah blocks. The wood block paving has also been repaired in Borough High Street, Old Kent Road, and London Road. Repairs have been carried out to the sett paying in New Kent Road, Southwark Bridge Road, Newington Causeway, Page's Walk, Marshalsea Road, Tennis Court, Collier's Rent, Valentine Place, &c. Several streets which join Old Kent Road, and were in a dangerous condition, through the sharp dip at the crossings, have been re-laid, so that the roads now properly intersect. In paving and re-laying the above carriageways the following materials have been used:— REPAIRING WOOD AND SETT CARRIAGEWAYS. 109 ft. run Granite Channel. 23 gallons Tar. 470½ yds. super Old Granite Setts. 31 cwt. Pitch. 4½ cube yds. Sett Breakers. 34 ,, Coke. 65 ,, Pit Ballast. 7,866 new Jarrah Blocks. 89½ „ Sharp Sand. 290 old Jarrah Blocks. 69 „ Thames Ballast. 8½ lbs. Cotton Waste. 3 „ Old Concrete. 24 yds. Lamp Cotton. 713 sacks Cement. 25½ gallons Colza Oil. 60 gallons Creosote. 48 The repairs to the macadam carriageways during the year have been kept as low as possible, it being the intention in this district to do away with macadam as a carriageway material, and substituting either asphalte or granite sett paving, according to the circumstances of the case. Macadam, although recognised as a good and ready material for some situations, is most unsuitable for a district which is so completely built up as is this district. The Committee have already given orders in several cases for macadam roads and courts to be asphalted or paved, and the works are now in hand. The following is a list of the macadam streets which have been repaired:— MACADAM CARRIAGEWAYS REPAIRED, 1898-9. Alfreton street. Amicable row. Tower street. Ontario street. Montague street. Townsend street. Lant street. Hill street. Dantgic street. Falstaff yard. Skipton street. Little Surrey street. Potier street. Westcott street. Elliott's row. Mint street. Silex street. Little Mason street. Camelot street. Quilp street. King Edward street. Collinson street. Warwick street. Barbel street. Bath street. Scovell road. Little Hunter street. Staple street. Miniver street.

King's Bench wall Earl street. Webber row. Law street. Bittern street. Burman street. Lancaster street. Gaywood street. Lombard street. Surrey square. During the previous year a loan was obtained from the London County Council for re-asphalting a number of the public footpaths. I he works were then put in hand, and continued during the early part of this year, the following streets being dealt with:—Old Kent Road, Westminster Bridge Road, Blackfriars Road, St. George's Road, Little Suffolk Street, Mason Street and Townsend Street. After several of these works had been completed, the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Co., commenced the work of laying then mains in the parish, which necessitated their opening the footpaths, after that no further work was carried out in the streets 49 that would be so disturbed, but asphalte footways in Potier Street and Belvedere Place were relaid, being dealt with as ordinary repairs. The York or flag footways have been repaired or relaid in St. George's Road near to the Cathedral, Newington Butts, Borough High Street, Old Kent Road, Little Hunter Street, Kell Street, Earl Street, Library Street, besides other streets that have been partially dealt with in connection with the trenches. The Trench work during the year has been very heavy, and our ordinary staff for repairs had to be considerably strengthened to meet the work in hand, as large trenches have been made in all the main thoroughfares of the Parish. The following is a list of the materials which have been used in carrying out the above mentioned works:— MATERIALS USED ON ASPHALTE FOOTWAYS. 2389 cwt. Asphalte. 722 cwt. Coke. 5647 lbs.

A commencement was made on the 5th of September to take out the old sewers in the Friar Street Area, and to lay new sewers in accordance with the scheme prepared by my predecessor, and up to date the following streets have been dealt with:—Friar Street, Lancaster Street, King James Street, Silex Street, Belvedere Buildings, Bean Street, and Minor Place; and those in Gun Street and Miniver Street are in progress. Earlier in the year, the old sewers were taken out and new sewers constructed in Little Suffolk Street, Sterry Street, and a portion in Borough Road. In carrying out this work, it was found that the original sewers had been laid with little regard to either line or level, and that jointing material had in many cases been forgotten or of such poor substance that it had disappeared. At the beginning of March, the sewer in Falstaff Yard was found to be in a very defective condition, and at the order of the Vestry this sewer was relaid. A number of combined drains have been relaid in various parts of the parish. The number of street gullies in the various streets is very low, and there is often a difficulty, in draining the water from the surface of the road. If these were increased, considerable saving in the weight of slop taken to the shoot would result, besides keeping the streets in a better condition. As a result of constant reports to the Sanitary Committee, of various sewers being unventilated, &c., the Committee have instructed your Surveyor to have a survey of the sewers in the parish, with a view to getting a correct plan of the existing sewers, and that the Surveyor prepare a report upon their condition, &c. This work is now in progress, and I hope in a short time to be in a position to submit a report on one portion of the parish. During the year, the following drainage plans have been reported upon and submitted to the Public Health and Sewers Committee, and dealt with as indicated. 54 DRAINAGE plans submitted to the vestey. name of applicant. situation of premises. size or pipes. committee's decision.

Dickins, on behalf of Lord Llangattock, the estimated cost of the construction of a sewer in Searles Road, a new street which is being laid out behind the Paragon. So far, about half of the work has been carried out, it having to be done in sections on account of the amount of building material on the site. During the year 39 new frontage drains and 28 private drains have been cleared, relaid, or repaired. The following materials were used for this work :— 1 yd.

This report was submitted in October, the chief recommendations were, that the scavenging gang should commence work at 3 a.m., instead of 6 a.m., so that the greater part-of the main roads should be dealt with before the commencement of the ordinary day's traffic; that the main streets should be dealt with daily, and the other streets twice, or three times, a week, according to circumstances. The early commencement of work necessitated the opening of the shoot at an earlier hour by the wharf owner than was arranged in the contract; the Committee therefore agreed to pay to Mr. Murrell the sum of £1 per week during the winter months. The collection of dust was also overhauled, and it was anticipated that a bi-weekly collection of dust might be obtained in the greater part of 61 the parish. After due consideration by the Committee, it was decided that the above recommendations should be put in force, and on the 5th of December a commencement was made under the new system, and up to the present time it has resulted in much greater efficiency with no additional cost; the streets have been cleansed oftener, and the dust is collected from over three-fourths of the parish twice weekly, and the remaining portion once weekly, the crowded and poorer class of property receiving most attention, and is dealt with in the bi-weekly collection. The Vestry have decided to provide waterproof jackets, overalls, and sou'wester' for the men employed in scavenging and dusting, so that the men may be better able to do their work during the wet days, and when it is possible to more thoroughly sweep clean the roads. ELECTEIC LIGHTING TEENCHES. A great amount of trench work has been carried out in this parish during the year, and it has been considerably added to by the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Co., who commenced, about the beginning of October, to lay their cables in Old Kent Eoad. They then proceeded along New Kent Road, Tabard Street, Long Lane, Borough High Street, Newington Causeway, Borough Eoad, and Blackfriars Eoad. In connection with the above work, on the section crossing Borough High Street, from Long Lane to the corner of Marshalsea Eoad, I found they were diverting from the plan submitted and approved, both in line and as to the number of mains. On the 14th February, after drawing the attention of the Foreman in charge of the work to this, I wrote to the Manager on the matter. On the 16th, not having received any reply to my letter, I again visited the work, and found they were making further deviations, and proceeding along the south side of Marshalsea Eoad, over which they had no power. I therefore gave orders that the work must not proceed further, and had the ground filled up. From that date, until an injunction was granted to the Yestry against the Company, I had the ground watched day and night, to prevent any further openings. LIGHTING. During the year several lamps have been fixed in the courts and side-streets, and a notable addition in lighting has been made in 62 Borough High Street, near Marshalsea Road, by the erection of a column, and the fixing of two globe lanterns, with two No. 4 incandescent burners in each; two columns with lanterns containing incandescent burners have also been fixed near the entrance to the Free Library. The question of lighting that part of the parish supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, with incandescent burners is at present under consideration, and several lamps in Borough Road have been fitted, to test the effect. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES. During the year the construction of the following underground conveniences, &c., in various parts of the parish have been in hand:— In Old Kent Road, near the junction of New Kent Road and Bermondsey New Road, a convenience, with accommodation for both men and women, has been provided, the provision being, in the men's portion, eight stalls, seven w.c.'s (one of which is free), and two lavatory basins, for which hot and cold water is provided; and in the women's part, four w.c.'s (one a free one), and one lavatory. This work was carried out by Messrs. Finch & Co., and was opened for public use on the 27th February. The contract amount for this was £2,049, and the actual cost ,£2072 15s. 8d. In Borough Road, at the end next to St. George's Circus, a convenience for men only has been constructed, the provision being ten stalls, six w.c.'s (one of which is free), and one lavatory basin; provision is also made here for hot and cold water. This was opened on 16th March, the work being carried out by Messrs. Finch & Co. The contract amount was £1,659, and the actual cost £1650 5s. 11d. At the Newington Causeway end of Borough Road an under- ground urinal has been constructed, to take the place of the surface urinal removed at the time of the Jubilee. This also has been built b) Messrs. Finch, and will, I expect, be ready for opening before the end of March. The contract in this case was £879, and the actual cost £824 11s. 4d. in November, a contract was let to Messrs. Smith & Sons, for the construction of a ladies' convenience on a site behind the Free Library; but very little progress has been made with this. Terra cotta dressings are being introduced into the work, so as to be in 63 harmony with the Library; this has been the chief cause of delay, but it is now expected that the work will be completed early in June. The provisions are three w.c's and two washhand basins. The contract amount of this work is £363. GENERAL. The work of laying out the Paragon and Portland Place is well in hand, and it is expected they will be ready for opening early in June. The work here has been carried out jointly by the Vestry and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, the Vestry providing and fixing the railings, gates, hydrants, paving the footpaths, &c., and the Metropolitan Gardens Association laying out the grounds, providing the trees, and planting. We have now planted in the parish 421 trees—during the year, 37 trees either died or were knocked down, these were replaced, and are, generally, going on satisfactorily. The church-clock, up to the present, has been lighted by gas, and has not been giving satisfaction—it was therefore decided, after receiving estimates from the Surveyor, as to the cost of wiring and lighting, to have it lighted by electricity. This was turned on for the first time on the 2nd of March, with satisfactory results, and it is anticipated that the cost of electricity will not exceed that previously paid for gas. A refuge has been fixed in the centre of the Borough High Street, near Marshalsea Road, and it has been greatly appreciated by those crossing this busy thoroughfare, and it has also been of great assistance in regulating the traffic. At the request of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association, the cleansing of the horse-troughs erected in this parish by the Association has been taken over, and is now carried out by your staff. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ARTHUR HARRISON, A. M. Inst. C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. ABSTRACT OF THE ACCOUNTS OF THE VESTRY, of the Parish of Saint George the Martyr.

SEWERS RATE ACCOUNT. This account shows a deficit for the year of £1407 2s. 8d., accounted for as follows:— Deficit— £ s. d. Over expended on relaying and repairing Sewers 676 1 1 Cost of construction of new Conveniences over the loan borrowed 614 0 10 Receipts from St. George's Road and New Alley Conveniences 80 2 2 Expenditure during the period of the year the new Conveniences were opened—not estimated for 122 13 7 General Disbursements 102 18 4 Less Surplus— £ s. d. 1595 16 0 Urinals Account 26 1 10 Balance of Sewers Rate 162 11 6 188 13 4 £1407 2 8 Balance in Hand at March 25th, 1893 £ s. d. 4730 7 4 Less Deficit this year 1407 2 8 Balance to Credit of Sewers Account at March 25th, 1899 £3323 4 8 69 CAPITAL ACCOUNT. The sum to the credit of the Capital Account £1823 16s. 10d. is a balance of unexpended loan for Friar, &c., Streets Sewer Works. With regard to the Abstract, I have altered the form from that of previous years in order to bring the accounts more in keeping with the Estimates, and to be better able to compare the Estimates with the actual Income and Expenditure. I have extended the Balance Sheet to show the Capital Outlay on the various works as against the amount of loans outstanding, and have also appended a Statement of Loans showing the Expenditure, Instalments repaid, and Summary of Loans outstanding at March, 25th, 1899.

GEORGE THE MARTYR, SOUTHWARD For the Year Ended 25th March, 1899. The Overseers at the termination of their first year of office, after appointment by the Vestry, beg to report as follows:— COMPOUNDING FOR RATES. In accordance with the resolution of the 21st February, 1898, the Overseers adopted a new scale of allowances to owners of property, compounding for the payment of rates. The Overseers caused notices to be given to the whole of the owners who were then receiving the usual allowance of 25 per cent. on rates payable by them under Compounding Agreements. The notices were sent out immediately prior to the 25th March, 1898, and terminated at three months after that date. The Overseers also forwarded to the owners a circular asking them to enter into new Compounding Agreements on the reduced basis of commission adopted by the Vestry, viz.:— Model Dwellings rated at a sum not exceeding £20, a commission of 15 per cent. on the amount of Kates received from the owner, Small or Tenement houses rated at a sum not exceeding £10, a like commission of 20 per cent. Small or Tenement houses rated at a sum exceeding £10, but not exceeding £15, a like commission of 15 per cent. 138 A few of the owners raised objections to the scale as being inadequate to meet their losses on empty property, particularly where property was old and dilapidated, but the scheme was accepted by a large majority of those concerned. Before the end of the year, 204 Agreements had been entered into by owners, practically representing the whole of the available compounding property within the Parish. HALF YEARLY RATES. In connection with the re-adjustment of the Compounding Scale it was felt by the Board that the custom of making the rates quarterly and having the Rate Books re-printed for that purpose every three months, was cumbrous and contrary to the practice adopted in the majority of the larger Parishes throughout the Metropolis, and on the 2nd May, the Board determined that the rates should, in future, be made half yearly instead of quarterly. The alteration commenced from the 29th September, 1898. RATE BOOKS, DEMAND NOTES, ETC. The Board deemed the occasion of making half-yearly rates and the alteration of the Compounding commission a suitable time for the re-organisation of the Rate Books and the Demand and Receipt Notes for the Collectors. Alter a sub-Committee had carefully enquired into the matter, it was determined to alter the form of Rate Books so as to emboely two quarters' rates in one book. Another and more important amendment was made with regard to the order in which the names were set forth in the books. It had been the practice hitherto to place the names in the order in which it was most convenient for the Collectors to call upon the ratepayers, regardless of street or alphabetical order, the result being that the premises in some streets were scattered over a large number of pages throughout the Rate Hooks rendering it extremely difficult to ascertain whether the whole of the premises in such streets had been properly assessed. Having in view the provisions of the Registration Acts and the necessity for more readily finding the premises on the Rate Books, the Overseers deemed it advisable that in future the premises should bo entered in the books in alphabetical street order. It 139 was at the same time decided to introduce the modern practice of dinting the amount of rate payable, on the Demand and Receipt Notes his system being found to secure greater accuracy as well as being a check on fraud. REGISTRATION. At the Revision Court for the year 1898, on the accounts of the Overseers being presented to the Revising Barrister (Mr. Michael Moloney), he objected to the charges made therein of £60 for the services of the Vestry Clerk and of £36 15s. for clerical assistance rendered by the clerks in the office, on the ground that these amounts were not to be paid to the persons whose names they were set against, but were ultimately to be transferred to the Vestry's account, the Vestry Clerk and clerks being paid inclusive salaries to cover the work of Eegistration. He therefore struck the amounts out of the account, and they will not be received by the Vestry. AUDIT OF COLLECTORS' ACCOUNTS. The serious irregularities which occurred in connection with the accounts of the Collector of Ward 1, who was removed by the Vestry from his office, were on the Audit of the Overseers' accounts for the half year ending 29th September, 1898, commented upon by the District Auditor, who expressed the opinion that the counterfoils of the Overseers Receipt Books should be frequently compared with the Bank Pass Books and the Collectors Paying-in-Books. After giving very careful consideration to the suggestion, the Overseers were of opinion that a weekly Audit of the counterfoils of the Collectors Receipt Books should be made, and it was felt that the best method of having this work carried out was to employ Professional Auditors, which would secure a more independent audit than appointing an extra clerk for the purpose. The General Rate Accounts are audited from time to time on behalf of the Vestry, by Messrs. Hart Brothers, Tibbetts & Co., and after ascertaining that that firm would undertake the Audit of the Poor Rate Accounts weekly, at the sum of thirty guineas per annum, the Overseers on the 6th February, 1899, agreed to employ them for this purpose. 140 RATES. The rates levied by the Overseers during the past year are as follows:— DATE RATE MADE. POOR. GENERAL. >• TOTAL. s. d. s. d. s. d. 12th April, 1898 0 10 0 8 1 6 16th July, 1898 0 10 0 8 (including Sewer) 1 6 22nd October (half year to 25th March, 1899) 1 8 1 4 3 0 3 4 2 8 6 0 The rates for the five years 1893-1898 were as follows:— POOR RATE. general rate, (Including Sewers Rate.) Total for tiie Year. £ s. d. s. d. s. d. 1893—1894 0 3 3 0 3 1 0 6 4 1894—1895 0 3 6 0 3 0 0 6 6 1895—1896 0 4 0 0 3 2 0 7 2 1896—1897 0 3 8 0 2 11 0 6 7 1897—1898 0 3 6 0 2 10 0 6 4 ASSESSMENTS. During the year the Assessments of 1268 premises have been under review by the Overseers. Of these, old assessments have been altered representing a Gross Assessable Value of £34,162 and Rateable Value of £28,025, producing an increase of Gross Value £4,738 and Rateable Value £4,165 on the previous assessments, while new assessments to the extent of a Gross Assessable Value of £3,735 and Rateable Value £3,093 have been added. The total increase in the Gross and Rateable Value of the Parish for the year is therefore Gross £8,473, Rateable £7,258. DISORDERLY HOUSES. The Board have during the past year actively proceeded with the work of suppressing disorderly houses. Several houses have been watched and in tour cases proceedings were taken. The prosecutions were conducted by the Solicitor and Clerk to the Overseers, with the result that in three cases heavy tines were inflicted, and in the fourth the defendant was sent to prison for four months. 141 Communications were received from the Clerk to the Overseers of Lambeth in December, 1898, suggesting that it was desirable to convene a Conference of Overseers with reference to the above natter, with a view of obtaining an alteration of the law, transferring to the Police authorities the duty of suppressing brothels. The Board passed a resolution to the effect that, in their opinion the law as it stands, is sufficient to suppress disorderly houses, and that the Board have never during recent years paid infonners fees in consequence of expeditious steps having been taken in this Parish for the suppression of the nuisance, and informing the Lambeth Overseers that the Board were prepared to appoint Representatives to the Conference, but such Representatives would be instructed to oppose any legislation on the lines proposed. ACCOUNTS. The Overseers submit their accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1899, which have been audited by the District Auditor, and certified by him to be correct. By order of the Overseers, J.

The Public Library Commissioners have to report, that during the past year the work of erecting, furnishing and fitting up the Public Library has been completed. LIBRARIAN. One of the first matters calling for the attention of the Commissioners at the commencement of the year, was the question of appointing a suitable person as Chief Librarian. Advertisements were issued for a Librarian at a salary of £160 per annum, rising by annual increments of £10 to £200 per annum with house, coals and gas so soon as the building should be completed. Eighty-four (84) applications were received, and Mr. Thomas Aldred, the Chief Librarian at Barrow-in-Furness, was appointed to the post, and he commenced his duties on the 25th May, 1898. LADIES' CONVENIENCE. An arrangement was arrived at, and a formal agreement dated the 15th October, 1898, was entered into between the Yestry and the Commissioners for the letting to the former Authority of a small plot of ground on the westerly side of the Library for the erection of a Ladies Convenience, at the rent of £5 per annum. BOOKS. Immediately after the appointment of the Librarian, the Committee proceeded to the selection of suitable books for stocking the 158 Library, and were very largely assisted in the matter by the Members of the Books Committee, several of whom are not Commissioners. A sum of .£850 was set apart to be spent in the purchase of books, and there are now 6,472 volumes in the Library. The Commissioners made appeals to various institutions and persons for gifts of books, and these were in many case's responded to in a generous spirit. Application was made to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for copies of the Record Office publications, and 208 volumes were subsequently received from that Department. A similar application was made to the Authorities of the British Museum for their publications; but the Trustees stated that they would be prepared to consider the application when the Library had been established in a permanent building. The application will accordingly be shortly renewed. The method adopted in purchasing a large number of the books was that of sending round lists of books required to the second-hand booksellers throughout the kingdom and inviting quotations. These prices were subsequently examined by the Librarian and agreed to by the Commissioners. The majority of the volumes in the Library was purchased in this manner, and the remainder were obtained at prices from which considerably more than the usual discount was allowed. Tenders were also obtained for binding works published in paper covers, such as music, &c. BOOKS OF ACCOUNT, LIBRARY SPECIALITIES, ETC. The Commissioners deemed it desirable to obtain Tenders for these matters, with the result that the prices of the following firms were accepted:— Books of Account—Mr. T. Cornell. Library Specialities—Library Supply Company. Typewriting Machine—Hammond Typewriting Company. FITTINGS. The Commissioners obtained Tenders for the necessary book racks, tables, newspaper stands and counter from various firms, and Messrs. Wake & Dean, whose business is carried on in this Parish, obtained the contract. 159 RULES. In view of the early opening of the Library the Commissioners on the 12th October, 1898, adopted rules as to the opening, closing, admission of persons and borrowing of books in the various departments of the Library. CATALOGUE. Immediately a sufficient number of works had been purchased, the Librarian proceeded with the preparation of the Catalogue of the Library, and in November, 1898, the Commissioners obtained tenders for the printing of the work, and Mr. T. Cornell's tender being the lowest, was accepted. OPENING OF LIBRARY. The formal opening of the Library took place on the 8th February, 1899. The ceremony was performed by the Right. Hon. James Bryce. D.C.L., M.P., who delivered an admirable address on that occasion. Mr. J. Passmore Edwards, whose handsome donation of £5,000 has now been fully paid, was also present. DESCRIPTION OF LIBRARY BUILDING. In order to afford the Vestry a full description of the Library Building, the Commissioners submit the following statement prepared by the Architect. The building stands some twenty feet back from the pavement in the Borough Road, and the space thus available is turfed. This arrangement greatly enhances the architectural effect of the building, and also removes the reading rooms further from the noise of the passing traffic. The building consists of a basement, ground floor, and first floor, with an attic floor over the portion assigned to the Librarian's residence. The basement extends over the whole area of the building, being well lighted by an area which completely surrounds it. In the basement are the heating chamber and the coal cellars; the rest of the space is available for the storage of books, and for repairs, and unpacking, &c. 160 The ground floor is placed about three feet above the level of the pavement. On entering, one reaches the Ladies' Room on the right hand side, and the News Room on the left hand side, the public portion of the Lending Library being immediately in front. The Boys' Room has a door opening into the News Room, but it is proposed that the usual means of access shall be through the Lending Library, thus enabling the staff to have full control over those who use the room. The Public Rooms are all under the direct supervision of the staff in the Lending Library, as is also the Entrance Hall. On the first floor is the Reference Library and Magazine Room, with Book Store attached. A spiral staircase from the Book Store communicates with the Lending Library and basement below. This enables the staff to reach one department from another, with great facility. Adjoining the Reference Library is the Committee Room. There is a separate entrance for the Librarian's staff, and this entrance also leads to the Librarian's residence, which comprises— Drawing-room, dining-room, and three bedrooms, bath-room, kitchen, scullery, &c. The exterior facings of the walls are of red brick, with terra cotta dressings, cornices, mouldings, and enrichments, the roof being covered with slates. Over the entrance is a panel bearing the inscription "Passmore Edwards Public Library." The rest of the space being filled in with a conventional Tree of Knowledge. The figure subject in the upper portion of the gable represents St. George and the Dragon, and the shields on either side of this bear the Cross of St. George and the Badge of the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, respectively. Above the western window there is a panel representing "Truth holding the mirror up to Nature." The main staircase is of teak, the newels, balusters, and handrail being polished, while the doors and screens are of varnished pine, the wood being stained in two different tints. This treatment is also carried out to the wood panel ceiling of the Reference Library. Glass has been largely used, in order to provide as much light as possible throughout the building. 161 The Electric Light has been installed in the building, which is heated throughout by means of hot water pipes, with fixed Radiators. SUBSCRIPTIONS. The Commissioners made every effort to raise a sum during the year sufficient, along with the amount of rates receivable by them up to the 25th March, 1899, to cover not only the cost of erecting the Library, but also the purchase of the freehold of the land. They were, however, only able to obtain in promises and subscriptions the sum of £6,060, which leaves a sum approximating £3,900 still to be raised. The Commissioners are hoping to raise a further amount by subscriptions, but it is feared that it will eventually become necessary to obtain a loan towards the purchase of the freehold. ANNUAL ACCOUNTS. The Commissioners submit their accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1899, as audited by the District Auditor, from which it appears that the Income during the year (including balance from previous year) was £7,912 11s. 2d., the expenditure £5,597 6s. 10½d., and the balance standing to the credit of the Commissioners at the end of the year £2,315 4s. 3½d.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. George the Martyr. sectionl—statistical. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Seventh Annual Report, which I now have the honour to submit to you, treats of the sanitary condition and environment, for the year 1898, of one of the most densely populated districts in London, and, indeed, for that matter, in the United Kingdom.* The following summary of facts will be found useful in approaching the various matters contained in this report:— * According to the 1896 census Whitechapel heads the list with 220 per acre, and St. George the Martyr stands next with 212. 6 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. ABEA _St. George's, Southwark, covers 2841/3 acres. The roads and streets, as returned to the end of 1898, measure 19 miles, 5 furlongs, 14 poles. Boundaries. The parish, in shape somewhat like a hatchet, merges upou no less than six other Sanitary Districts. It is bounded on the north by St. Saviour and St Olave, on the west by Lambeth, on the south by Newington and Camberwell, and on the east by Bermondsey. Geological Formation.—The subsoil of Southwark consists of porous " made " earth, sand, and gravel, of a depth of fifteen to twenty-five feet, overlying the London clay. Saline springs rise at times to the surface, and in certain excavated parts of the parish e.g., Theatre and Music Hall—necessitate the constant use of pumps. Elevation. The district is low-lying and flat, and lies at an average of half-afoot below the Trinity high-water mark of the Thames, as against a mean elevation for London of 47.5 feet above the same mark. Houses.—I am indebted to the Medical Officer of the Administrative County for a copy of the Superintendent Registrar's Summary, giving the numbers resident in the district on the 29th March, 189G. This summary—given under Table I.—shows also there were 5,512 inhabited and 657 uninhabited houses, which makes an average of 10 9 persons to a house. TABLE 1. London Census, 1896.

Its Number of tenements is almost exactly double that of its inhabited houses.of the tenement occupiers, one-third live" in two rooms, and another third in a single room.There is no reason to alter the statement advanced Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. 7 ???r several years past that about one in every fourteen of your population is born, ???ows up, lives, works, and often dies within the four walls of a one.roomed ???nement. Prom Table I. it will be seen that the number of males in the parish is some 200 ???excess of the females. This may, I think, be explained by the following facts:. ???the presence of a number of factories where men are employed either exclusively ???mainly; (b) the comparatively small number of domestic servants employed in the arish; (c) the presence of the Salvation Army Shelter, which attracts to the parish daily average of several hundred men—(in 1895 the senior district magistrate stimated the Salvation Army accommodation at 550 per night);—and (d) Bethlem ???ospital, in which there is an excess of male patients. Another point brought ???trongly into relief by Table I. is the fact that the division of the parish into sub. ???istricts affords a more equal grouping of inhabitants than a division by Wards. Thus the greatest difference between the individual sub.district population is ???,796, whereas in the Wards the extreme difference is 9,304. This disproportion has a somewhat important bearing on various matters of administration. Population.—The number of inhabitants for the whole parish, according to the Census of 29th March, 1896, was 60,278, as against 59,712 in the Census of 1891. In the middle of 1898 the figures estimated on the foregoing Census reached 60,466. The rate of increase was extremely low, compared with that of London generally. Births and Birth=Rate. Table II. gives the birth.rate per 1,000 per annum for the years 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898 in each sub.district of the parish, in London, and in the thirty.three large English towns. TABLE II. Sub.District. Birth.rate per 1,000. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. Borough Road 38.2 39.4 37.5 39 6 London Road Kent Road 30.8 39.6 32.6 37.8 31.4 36.6 32.1 35.5 Whole Parish 36.0 36.6 350 35.4 London 30.4 30.4 29.9 29.5 33 large English Towns 31.6 30.7 30.6 30.3 It will be seen that the birth rate is 0.4 higher than that of the preceding year, and is considerably above that for the whole of London. The diminished rate of increase of population in the three sub.districts of the parish of St. George's is, therefore, not attri butable to a falling off in the number of persons born into the parish, but rather to a relatively high death.rate, and also, probably, to migration from the parish, since the death.rate is below the birth.rate in each sub.district. A reference to the section of the mortality of infants and children will reveal the fact that in the year 1898 nearly one.half, i.e., 45.4 of the total deaths in St. George's, Southwark, have taken place uuder five years of age. 8 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The fact is notable that the birth-rate in St. George's is higher than in London and in the thirty-three large towns. This may, I think, be partly explained by th. fact that the limitation of families is carried into effect by the better-to-do classes rather than by the poor. Deaths and Death-Rate for 1898. 1,218 deaths were registered in the parish during the fifty-two weeks ending 31st December, 1898, giving an average of 23 4 per week. Of this total 185 were deaths of non-parishioners in hospitals and asylums within the district. In additioin 436 parishioners died in outside public institutions and extra metropolitan asylums There were, therefore, 1,469 deaths amongst your parishioners, equivalent to a??? average mortality of 24.3 per 1,000. The death-rate for all London in the same year was 18.7 per 1,000, which is in itself, according to many authorities, 2 7 more per 1,000 than should occur from "the mortality incident to human nature." In St. Georgo's then, the death toll"—as it has been aptly called—claims 5.6 persons out of every 1,000 in excess of an already excessive rate. On the latter estimate, that of the whole of London, there have been some 339 unnecessary deaths in St. George's Southwark, during the year 1898, and comparing it with the ideal estimate, the unnecessary deaths number no less than 504. In the forty-three metropolitan sanitary areas the lowest death-rates were 11.7 in Hampstead, 13.2 in St. George's, Hanover Square, 13 7 in Stoke Newington, 14 .4 in Wandsworth, 14 9 in Lee, and 15.3 in Lewisham (excluding Penge); the highea??? death-rates, on the other hand, were 23 6 in St. Saviour's, Southwark, 23.8 in Lime house, 24.3 in St. George's, Southwark, 24 8 in St. George-in-the-East, 24.9 in Holborn. and 25.7 in St. Luke's. The facts of your death-rate are briefly as follows:— TABLE III. Sub-District. No. of Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000. Deaths under 1 year to 1,000 Births. 1897. 1898. 1897. 1898. 1897. 1898.

One is naturally led to enquire whether a further analysis of facts and figures will throw any light upon this state of affairs. On comparing the average death-rate in the three sub-districts for the years 1892-3-4-5-6-7-8 with that of 1898, we find:- Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1898. 9 TABLE IV. Sub-District. Death-rate per 1,000. 1892 to 1898. 1898. Borough Road 31.4 28.4 London Road 20.6 21.4 Kent Road 22.3 24.2 Hence we see the heavy death-rate in the Borough Road Sub-District has somewhat decreased. During the past year the mortality in the Borough Road has been 7.0 over that of the London Road, and 4.2 over that of the Kent Road areas. The period over which these figures extend—seven years—and the actual number of deaths are both too small to allow of drawing any absolutely sound conclusions. Nevertheless, it may be noticed that the mortality of the Borough Road Sub-District is 95 higher than that of the thirty-three large English towns. Further, the figures, so far as they extend, show that the excessive mortality of the Borough Road SubDistrict is maintained from year to year, so that it appears to be due to inherent and not to accidental causes. The annual death-rate for 1898 has risen to 24.3, as against 236 in 1897. There is still room for large and permanent reduction in the death-rate of St. George the Martyr. Were it possible to eliminate the Borough Road Sub-District or to reduce its mortality to a level with that of the other sub-districts, the condition of St. George the Martyr, as a whole, would compare favourably with many districts much more happily situated, both as regards density of population and general healthiness of surroundings.

If it be permissible to offer any observation upon the foregoing figures, and bearing in mind that comparisons of the kind are open to fallacies, it may be said that George the Martyr, Southwark, stands roughly with regard to its death-rate where London stood in the ten-yearly period 1851-60. At the same time the deathrate in both cases has shown a most satisfactory and uniform average decrease. Zymotic or Preventable Death-Rate. It may be noted that the term "zymotic" applies to the following seven diseasesSmall-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, "fever" (ie. typhus, relapsing puerperal, simple continued and typhoid) and diarrhœa. I have called the above zymotic diseases "preventable," because I regard all communicable diseases, broadly speaking, as coming under that heading. Diarrhoea is a symptom as well as a specific disease, and, although not usually communicated from one person to another, it may be regarded as the almost invarable result of bad environment. At the same time, it must be clearly understood that a vast amount of preventable disease, such as that due to alcoholism, is not zymotic. In other words, while all zymotic disease is preventable, not all preventable diseases are zymotic. The corrected death-rate in St. George's, Southwark, from the seven principal zymotic diseases was 4.0 per 1,000 in 1898, as against 2.8 per 1.000 in the whole of London for the same period, and 2.9 in the thirty-three great towns of England and Wales. As in the calculation of the general death-rate, so with the zymotic death-rate, the deaths of non-pirishioners occurring within tho district have been excluded; on the other hand, tho deaths of parishioners in public institutions outside the parish have been included. Unless a proper distribution of these deaths be made, especially of those from zymotic diseases, no really trustworthy data can be secured upon which to calculate the rates of mortality. Among the forty-three sanitary areas the zymotic death-rate ranged from 0.88 in St.-Martin-in-the-Fields, 129 in St. George's, Hanover Square, 1.40 in Hampstead, 1.51 in St. James, Westminster, 1.56 in Stoke Newington, and 1.76 in Strand, to 3.90 in Bethual Green,3.95 in Shoreditch, 4 0 in St. George's, Southwark, 4.04 in St. Luke, 4.13 in Woolwich, 4.26 in Limehouse.

The total absence of deaths from small-pox is in itself a valuable evidence as to the efficiency of modern preventive measures of vaccination, together with notification and prompt isolation. How long this immunity will continue under the new Vaccination Act remains to be seen. Diarrhœa. Amongst children diarrhoea is the most deadly preventable complaint in your parish. With the high figure of 99 it heads the table of mortality from zymotic diseases. Of this number 73 deaths occurred under the age of one year, 22 between one and five, and 4 at the age of five and upwards. In addition to the 99 deaths from diarrhoea coming under the general heading of "Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases "there were 36 deaths from enteritis placed under the class " Local Diseases." During the seven years 1892 to 1898 more deaths were due to diarrhoea than to any other of the seven principal zymotic diseases. This is seen in the following table :— TABLE VIII. Mortality in St. George's, from the seven principal Zymotic Diseases. Deaths. 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 Total.

This observation coincides with the climatic condition of 1897. 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. It has been proved that the temperature of the earth is one of the most important factors concerned in the development of the malady, and that the summer rise of diarrhœal mortality does not commence until the mean temperature recorded by the four-foot earth thermometer has attained somewhere about 56 degrees Fahrenhoit. From investigations made by Dr. Klein, it appears likely that summer diarrhoea is associated with the presence in the stools of a micro-organism, which he has named "Bacillus enteritidis sporogenes." This microbe presumably lives and multiplies in organically fouled and damp soil, and is given off in the air to contaminate and poison food, especially milk. The chief conditions of locality giving rise to diarrhoea in St. George's aro, I believe, the following:- (1) A loose damp soil polluted by liquid filth—e.g., from defective sowors. (2) Density of population. (3) Crowding of buildings upon areas. (4) Hindrances to the free circulation of air, both about and within dwellings. (5) Sewer emanations. (6) Accumulations of domestic refuse in ashpits and dustbins. (7) Absence of efficient control of dairies and of dairy farms supplying milk to local dairies. As regards tho conditions relating to the population, the chief causes predisposi ng to diarrhœa are:- (1) Poverty. (2) Mode of feeding of infants. (3) Maternal neglect and carelessness in infant management. (4) Unwholesome or improper place of storage for food and vessels connocted with food. The main suggestions to bo made are—To provide :— (1) Sound drainage system, both of houses and subsoil. (2) Impervious flooring to houses, so as to exclude ground air. (3) Free ventilation inside and outside houses. (4) Careful storage of food. (5) Systematic inspection of dairies, cow sheds, and dairy farms. (6) Boiling of milk, especially in summer. (7) Education of mothers as to the proper way of rearing infants. Measles. Measles is the mostdeadly complaint in your parish, and leads to a waste of life which, in my opinion, may bo traced to tho following causes (1) Measles, although highly infectious, is non-notifiable, and therefor# outside the control of your Sanitary Authority. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. 13 (2) It is generally looked upon as a mild disorder that wants little or no treatment, whereas it requires careful isolation and nursing, as it is liable to many grave accidents. (3) Bad environment; measles does little harm among the well-to-do, but among the poor it is estimated that twenty to thirty die out of every hundred attacked by the disease. As frequently pointed out by me before, I think that the compulsory notification of cases of measles throughout London, with subsequent hospital treatment and disinfection, could not fail, in a poor parish like St. George's, to result in a great saving of life. Diphtheria Mortality. There has been a further increase in deaths from diphtheria. There were 19 deaths in 1895; 26 in 1896; 28 in 1897; and 36 in 1898. (These figures including membranous croup, according to the method of the Registrar-General.) There can be no doubt that the density of population, and the modern system of Board School education, have a considerable influence upon the prevalence of this highly infectious disease. As I have said in previous reports, it would be prudent. I think, to consider the desirability of the frequent and systematic inspection of all schools. It is in such places that early and undetected cases of diphtheria, in the sore throat stage, are to be found under circumstances that afford every opportunity for the spread of infection. Last year I quoted from a special Report made in 1890, pointing out the value and necessity of obtaining an early diagnosis in doubtful sore-throat. As the passage in question contains the pith of the matter, I venture again to insert it :—" Early Diagnosis : It is well known to medical men that some cases of diphtheria are extremely difficult to detect. The diagnosis can only be made after a period of waiting. Moreover, it seems probable that a certain number of cases are never detected at all. As an illustration of this difficulty I have it from a doctor that four of his patients in Cornbury Street, although suffering from suspicious sore-throats, remained unnotified owing to the clinical evidence being too weak, in his judgment, to support the theory of diphtheria. Hence it is of the utmost importance to be able to decide at once whether a sore-throat is or is not of a diphtheritic nature. This can now be done in a bacteriological laboratory. In Marylebone, for instance, every medical man is provided with a small cardboard box containing two sterilised test tubes. One of these tubes is for membrane if it can be obtained, and the other is furnished with a sterilised swab of wool wound round a wire. The medical attendant touches the throat with the wool and sends it off to the Medical Officer of Health, who is able to send back within twenty-four hours a definite report as to the existence of the disease. The cost of the whole examination of each case amounts to 2s. 7d. It should be clearly understood, however, that the examinations are not for the purpose of revising certificates, but for dividing the cases into those which might possibly be treated at home in safety, and those which require strict isolation in an infectious hospital." In March, 1898, in compliance with a resolution of your Vestry. I drew up a special Report upon the bacteriological diagnosis of doubtful cases of diphtheria and of typhoid fever. This communication will be found under Section III. of this Report. It deals fully and systematically with the whole matter of the scientific detection of the two diseases named in early and doubtful cases. 1 here is no doubt, in my own mind, that a public bacteriological service such as that suggested, would materially add to the powers of your Vestry in the control of infectious diseases, which is one of the most important duties of a Sanitary Authority. A free bacteriological examination has been established in at least eight metropolitan parishes, and their legal position has not been questioned by the Local Government Board. 14 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

These figures represent a rate above that of the whole of London. That excess may, I think, be somewhat closely connected with the dense acreage-population of the district, together with its largo proportion of tenement dwellers and the prevalence of indoor occupation. A good deal of the mortality among young children is due to lung troubles, which often follow measles and whooping cough. The returns of deaths from consumption are not so heavy as one would expect in so densely crowded and poverty-stricken a district. At the same time it should be noted that the registrars have to depend for these figures on the death certificates, and there can be no doubt that a certain number of cases are not correctly described. This observation applies especially to alcoholism, and to such hereditary and constitutional disorders as syphilis and consumption. Of late widespread attention has been drawn to the prevention of tubercular diseases, a subject of vast importance to the community. Roughly speaking, lung consumption accounts for one out of every eight deaths in the United Kingdom, an average that is exceeded in your parish. The disease results from the invasion of the human body by a minute bacillus, which may be breathed into the air passages in the form of dust or bo conveyed in the flesh or milk of infected animals. All that weakens an individual, makes him less able to resist the invasion of the tubercle bacillus, hence the value of a good environment. The prevention of consumption may be considered under the headings of:— (a) General hygiene. (b) The care of infected persons. (c) Supervision of meat and milk supplies. (a) General Hygiene.—This comes under the ordinary sanitary administration of your parish, but special stress should be laid upon the need of good ventilation and diainage, both of houses and workshops and upon the dangers of overcrowding. The great natural agencies in the destruction of the bacilli are fresh air and sunlight. (b) I he care of Infected Persons.— Every consumptive person is an active centre of infection, just as he would be if suffering from typhoid fever or small-pox. The most common way in which the dangerous bacilli are spread is by means of the expertorations. 1 The latter become dangerous when dried and blown about as dust. Persons suffering from the complaint, therefore, should always, both indoorn and out, a special spitcup, the contents of which should be burnt, or else he should spit into a paper handkerchief, which may be similarly disposed of. Under a rational system of treatment, isolation of phthisical patients is not necessary, but notification Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1698. 15 would nevertheless be a desirable step, as it would then be possible to make sure that a patient was not spreading the disease, and systematic disinfection of his surroundings could be undertaken. Disinfection after deaths from phthisis is now undertaken by your Vestry and urged upon parishioners. It would be advisable to distribute among your parishioners printed forms containing special information on this subject couched in plain and simple language. (c) Supervision of Meat and Milk Supply.—Although the subject of the transmission of phthisis from the lower animals to man is still more or less obscure, yet it seems hardly logical to attempt to stamp out the disease in man and yet allow him to go on consuming the flesh and milk of infected animals. The same bacillus causes tuberculosis in both instances. That it may be transmitted in an active or living state in the milk of an infected cow is known, and it is also an indisputable fact that in the United Kingdom many cows suffer from tuberculosis. Moreover, an undue proportion of infants, who are largely fed with raw milk, are affected with the disease. It would be well, therefore, in my opinion, for your Authority to consider carefully all measures that tend to the exclusion of the flesh or milk of tubercular animals from the food supply of the parishioners. flortality of Infants and Children. The death-rates of infants under one year, and of children under five years, afford valuable indirect evidence of the sanitary well-being of a community. During 1898 the number of infants who died within the first year of life in St. George's was 402. These figures give the high rate of 188 deaths to every 1,000 births in St. George's, as compared with 167 deaths per 1,000 births for London. The average rate for the years 1892 to 1898 for St. George's was 189, as against 162 for London. Of a total of 1,470 deaths at all ages in St. George's 667 occurred under five years, which gives the large percentage of 45 4 of the total number of deaths. It is well known to specialists in children's diseases that " wasting" constitutes one of the commonest causes of death among infants. Thousands of children die every year in London simply because they are fed on food which they cannot digest, and which acts as an irritant to the stomach and intestines.

The many causes leading to loss of infant life in St. George's may be thus summarised:- (1) Bad environment, such us insanitary conditions, overcrowding, and absence of parks and open spaces. (2) Improper and insufficient food. (3) Mismanagement through maternal ignorance. (4) Early marriages. (5) Debility, disease, and dissipation of parents. (6) Maternal neglect, due to mothers being more or less employed away from home in factories and workshops. (7) Use of opiates; usually in the form of patent medicines. The question of how to lessen the excessive destruction of child-life is an important one. It is a complex result traceable to many causes, each of which demands careful consideration and separate treatment. Among general measures it may be broadly stated that anything which tends to raise the standard of wholesomeness of a district, will also help to diminish the infantile death-rate. Another valuable aid to prevention would be the education of parents generally in the simple laws of healthy living, with special reference to the diet and clothing of their offspring.

Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1898. 19 SECTION II.—GENERAL. The Salvation Army Shelter. During the past year no cases of infectious disease have been reported from this ???helter. During the day time—that is to say, while devoid of inmates—the building as been visited by your Sanitary Inspectors. For many years past I have advocated ???le desirability of systematic night inspection of such resorts. Under present Conditions your Vestry have no legal right to make such visitation, which could ???adily be instituted, however, by including them within the Common Lodging ???ouses Act. The legal aspects have been established by proceedings taken by your ???uthority several years ago. Briefly stated, Her Majesty's Judges decided that these belters did not fall under the Common Lodging Houses Act, to which Mr. Justice ???Vills added: "The case was clearly one in which the Public Health Act, so far as isinfection was concerned, ought to apply, but does not." Public Lavatory Accommodation. During recent years much attention has been directed to the important subject of Public Lavatory accommodation. Thus two old-fashioned structures above-ground ???vere demolished at the time of the Jubilee; while, under the powers conferred by he Public Health (London) Act, 1891, your Authority constructed an underground Convenience, for men only, near the '• Elephant and Castle," in 1893. Plans approved by the Vestry at the time of my last Report awaited the result of Government inquiry, for the construction of two additional underground Conveni???nces, namely, one (for men only) at the Obelisk, St. George's Circus, and the other for both sexes) at the junction of the Old and New Kent Roads. Both have received Government approval, aud are now in course of construction. A third (for women only) is shortly to be established on the premises of the new Public Library, in the Borough Road. Of these two will be free for women and three for men. Before leaving this important subject it may be well to add, in the interests of the general public health, the following suggestions, which, if carried out, could hardly fail to add to the comfort and wellbeing of a poor and crowded population :— (a) The provision at each of these points of accommodation for both sexes. (b) Ample free accommodation generally for both sexes, which appears to be imperatively called for in a poor district. Alcohol. The question of alcohol has an important bearing upon the wellbeing of any community, but more especially in dealing with a poor and crowded district like that of St. George the Martyr. Nowadays, the fact is widely recognised that mortality statistics furnish little trustworthy evidence as to the actual injury to life that results from the abuse of alcohol. Thus, very many deaths attributed to diseases of organs, such as the kidneys or the liver, are in reality due to intemperance. Another great contributing factor is that the drinking habit, even in its milder phases, renders its victims much less able to resist the onset of acute maladies. There can be no doubt that alcoholism is in many cases to be partly attributed—in its first stages, at any 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. rate—to the desire for stimulation of energies that have been exhausted by overwork, hunger, exposure to insanitary conditions, and other evils incidental to a poor environment. The whole question strikes deep into the social life of the community, and deserves careful attention in its many aspects by the administrators of sanitary laws, whether local or central. Complaint of Nuisance arising from Burial Vaults beneath the Parish Church. On the 17th March, 1898, a complaint was made to me by the Rector of the Parish Church, the Rev. W. J. Sommerville, as to an alleged nuisauce arisiug from bodies buried in the crypt. He stated that some of his parishioners had complained of bad smells entering the Church, and asked me to inspect the building. On the 24th March I visited the Church, and as a result of that visit I reported the matter to the Public Health Committee on the 28th. On April 25th I made an inspection of the crypt, with Mr. Ralph, late District Inspector. On the evening of the 25th I reported to the Public Health Committee that I had fouud in the crypt upwards of one thousand coffins, that the air of the crypt was musty, that there were cracks in masonry of roof and walls, and that in my opinion the state of affairs was such as to be likely to be a danger to health. On May 3rd, in answer to a question addressed to me in the Vestry, I stated my general conclusion as to the insanitary state of the crypt. I also stated that " the first and only inspection of the crypt made by me was on the 25th April, 1898, on the complaint of Mr. Sommerville, and that no other official complaint of a nuisance or danger to health from the crypt had ever been made to me." On May 9th the matter having been referred back to the Health Committee, with power to act, at the request of the Chairman for a report, I referred to my previous verbal report on the 25th April, and to the written record in my official diary. I recommended the Committee to communicate with the Home Office, which alone had powers to deal with nuisances arising from burials. A few days later I received a communication from Dr. Hoffman asking me to accompany him on a Home Office inspection of the crypt, to take place on the 19th May. Together with the Chairman of the Health Committee, the Rector, the Churchwardens, and Mr. Hilton, I was present at the official inspection on the date mentioned. So far as I was concerned as Medical Officer of Health, that ended the matter for the official year under report, namely, 1898. Up to the 31st December, no steps had been taken, to abate the state of affairs complained of by Mr. Sommerville to your Sanitary Authority, and pronounced a danger to health by the Home Office. Hortuary and Coroner's Court. 204 bodies were removed to the Parish Mortuary during the year 1898, as against I 179 in 1897 and 212 in 1896. This number includes bodies brought from the St. George's Workhouse. Inquests were held in 122 cases with 96 post mortem examinations. During 1898, 29 young children were suffocated whilst lying in bed with their parents, as against 13 in 1897. This lamentable loss of life might have been prevented had these unfortunate children slept in cots. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1891. 369 Workshops have been registered by your Authority since January 1892, when the Act first came into operation. Of this number 31 have been added during the past year. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. 21 The Order remains only partly enforced in this parish, and will continue so unless some means be devised to lighten the more pressing duties of the Sanitary Inspectors. In my Annual Reports from 1893 to 1897, I stated my opinion that a special inspector would be required to carry the Order out thoroughly in your district. This view of the question I would again respectfully urge upon the attention of your Vestry, especially considering the added duties imposed by the 1895 Act of Mr. Asquith. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1895. The chief points may be briefly touched upon. First and foremost the Act provides that a factory or workshop shall be deemed overcrowded if there be less than 250 feet of cubic space to each person during the hours of work, and of 400 cubic feet during overtime. It authorises a Magistrate, on complaint of an inspector, and being satisfied that a factory or workshop is in a dangerous or injurious condition, to prohibit the place from being used until such works as are necessary to remove the danger have been executed. Adequate penalties are provided against the employment of persons in work injurious to health, or for allowing wearing apparel to be made up, cleaned, or repaired in places where there is scarlet fever or small-pox. It also directs that a full notification and register of deaths from accident be kept by owners or occupiers, and that the Factory Inspector attend the subsequent inquest, while the Home Secretary is furnished with powers for additional investigation if he deem fit. Numerous provisions have been made with a view to enforcing the duties of employers in the observance of sanitation, of the fencing of machines, of the affixing of notices, and of the general carrying out of their responsibilities under the Act. It is worthy of special note, that in the case of tenement factories the owner is made responsible in place of the occupier. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1800. In my last Annual Report I suggested that two ''unhealthy" areas should be dealt with in Ward 1. These areas have since been included in a larger scheme set forth in a Special Report presented to your Vestry on the 13th December (see page 32) The whole cost of carrying out of any such scheme would devolve upon the London County Council as Local Authority. In view of the overcrowded and insanitary condition of the areas in question I would urge your Vestry to lay the matter forthwith before the Council.

Houses and tenements respecting which representations were made to the Vestry that they were in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. Houses and Tenements 3 Inhabitants 17 From the year 1892 to 1898, applications have been made for Closing Orders in the case of 322 houses and tenements unfit for human habitation. These dwellings have sheltered upwards of 1,517 persons, and I think some steps should be taken to re-house those whose occupations necessitate their living in or near the district. To effect this object, the necessary powers are given the Local Authority under Part III. of the Act. As in previous years, I would again respectfully draw the attention of your Sanitary Authority to this pressing problem. I have also advised demolition of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Red Cow Alley, of 25. Barron's Place, and of 6a & 9, Emmett's Cab Yard. In the case of the houses in Red Cow Alley action has been taken by the Vestry. Bakehouses under the New (1895) Act. The general provisions of the Act enforces 400 cubic feet of air space for each workman engaged in a retail bakehouse. They also appear to allow the Local Authorities to proceed against the owner as well as the occupier, for certain offences committed in any such bakehouses. The special requirements of the Act as regards retail bakehouse are as follows:— "Section 27.—(1) Sections 34 and 35 of the principal Act shall apply to every bakehouse, and so much of those Sections as limits the operation thereof to cities, towns, and places having a population of more than five thousand persons, shall be repealed. "(2) In Section 15 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, the words "which was not so let or occupied before the first day of June, 1883,' shall be repealed. "(3) A place underground shall not be used as a bakehouse, unless it is so used at the commencement of this Act, and if any place is so used in contravention of this Act it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with the principal Act." It will be seen, after thirty years of tentative legislation, Government has recognised the fact that underground bakehouses should cease to exist. The prohibition for any underground workplace used afresh as a bakery after the 1st January, 1896, may bo reasonably regarded as a first step towards their entire removal. The Notification of Infectious Diseases. Certain maladies have been made notifiable in London since the passing of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. They comprise:—Small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, the disease known as scarlatina, or scarlet fever, and the fevers known by any of the following names: typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal. In 1898 the sum in fees paid to medical practitioners for notifying 681 infectious cases in St. George's amounted to £70 6s. 6d. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. 23 This amount, paid in the first instance by your Vestry, is recouped by the Asylums Board, and charged to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. 75.6 per cent. of the total number of cases notified in the parish during 1898 were removed to the Asylums Board and other hospitals. It is important to bear in mind that prompt isolation alone can obviate the danger resulting from the detention of infectious patients in so poor and densely packed a district as St. George's. Typhus Fever. On the 12th April, a case of typhus fever was notified to me, in the parish, and at once removed to the South Eastern Hospital. The patient was a woman who had been exposed to the disease in Kensington, where she had attended a family in which typhus fever had recently existed. The case was thus an imported one, and no further case arising from it was notified in the parish—a fact which may be fairly attributed to prompt removal of exposed persons to the reception house, and to thorough subsequent disinfection. In Kensington, on the contrary, where there is no reception house, there were many cases and several deaths. Another case of typhus fever was notified on the 22nd October, six months later. It was that of a young man who was found to have the disease upon presenting himself as an out-patient at Guy's Hospital. The source of infection could not be ascertained, but up to the end of the year no further attack was notified. Full details of this and of the preceding case will be found in the Special Reports (pages 27 and 30). Room Disinfection. It will be within the memory of your Vestry, that, during the year 1896, a considerable amount of attention was given to the subject of room disinfection. As a result of my personal experience and investigation I expressed the conclusion that the system of administration as then practised was imperfect. Among the chief causes of such imperfection the following were mentioned (page 24 of my Annual Report for 1896):— (a) Want of a refuge house. (b) Want of a larger staff of disinfectors. (c) Want of a special inspector to deal with infectious diseases. (d) Want of promptitude of the Asylums Board in the removal of cases. With regard to the foregoing, it may be stated that a Refuge House has been established and is in working order; that in 1896 an addition was made in the staff of disinfectors in the person of a Superintending Disinfector who, with his wife, lives in the Reception House ; and that the question of the special inspector is still in abeyance. Since I made the suggestion for the appointment of the latter in my Annual Report for 1896, the duties of the District Inspectors have been considerably increased with regard to the investigation and supervision of infectious cases. In this way their work is to some extent curtailed in other directions, and the desirability of appointing a special Fever Inspector is thereby emphasised. Lastly, considerable improvement has taken place in the adequacy of the hospital accommodation provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Reception House. This link in the preventive handling of infectious diseases is no less necessary than the allied measures of notification, isolation and disinfection. In a poor and 24 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. crowded parish it is imperative to provide a temporary shelter for persons who have been exposed to infection and in whose homes disinfection is being carried out. This principle has been recognised by your Vestry in the foundation of a Reception House at considerable outlay. During the year 1898, a total of 149 persons were received ; of that number 66 were adults and 83 children. Considering the difficulty of inducing parishioners to take advantage of a novel departure of this kind the Vestry may be congratulated on the foregoing figures, which will in all probability be largely iucroased in the near future. Mouse to House Inspection. The first section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, directs that a house to house inspection shall be made by the Local Authority. Such a visitation as that intended by the framers of the Act, was for the first time in the history of this Parish, commenced in 1894. During 1898 such inspections have been made of 1455 houses as against 1300 in 1897 and 1665 in 1890, and the results of such visits have been entered into the registers kept for the purpose. To repeat the words made use of lor the last four years, I may perhaps bo allowed to add my opinion that this system of house to house inspection is likely to do more towards raising the general health standard of your district than any single step yet taken by your Vestry. Houses Let in Lodgings. So far, 421 dwelling houses, inhabited by the poorest classes, have been registered in conformity with the Bye-laws. In this parish, houses built on the so-called "model" or block system, and accommodating upwards of 12,800 inmates, at present escape the salutary provisions of the new bye-laws. These dwellings, often inhabited by the uneducated and unruly poor, are for the most part badly supervised. I would beg once more to suggest that such "models" should bo included, in the interests of the public health, within the purview of the new tenement bye-laws. Such a reform could be accomplished by means of an amendment of the Public Health Act. During the past year Miss Elliott has again done good work as regards cleansing and tho abating of overcrowding, as will be seen by reference to her report. Falcon Court and Neighbourhood. Last year I reported that there appeared to be every likelihood that the unwholesome area of Falcon Court and its neighbourhood would be swept away at an early date and replaced by an open air-space. A Local Government inquiry held in 1896 insisted upon the necessity of housing the population that would be displaced under the scheme. Accordingly the London County Council prepared plans for the erection of artizans' dwellings in the Borough Road. These plans were submitted to the Local Government Board and passed. Representations were made by your Vestry to the London County Council pointing out the urgency of the case and the continued delay in carrying out the proposed scheme. I am now able to report that the foundations of the new buildings have been laid in the Borough Road. It is to be hoped that before the lapse of another year this important clearance of an unhealthy area will have been accomplished. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898 25 SECTION III.—SPECIAL REPORTS. Special Report upon the Bacteriological Diagnosis of doubtful cases of Diphtheria and of Typhoid Fever. In compliance with a resolution adopted by your Vestry on the 8th ultimo, I herewith beg to submit the following Special Report. The directions contained in your resolution relate to the two diseases, diphtheria and typhoid or enteric fever. Clearly, the tests referred to may be applied before, during, and after an attack, and have a special value in each of those stages. Before the Attack.—In using the term "before," I mean it to apply to those cases in which the disease, though present, cannot be detected, with certainty, by any means yet known to medical science. This fore-running or doubtful stage occurs in diphtheria and typhoid fever more often than in any other malady with which we are called upon as sanitary administrators to deal. In handling diseases of so highly infectious a nature it is evident that there is an especial danger attached to non-detection at the onset of an attack. In the case of diphtheria, it is just as contagious during the early days as at any other period. Hence, any trustworthy means of diagnosis is of the utmost value, not only to the patient, but also to others with whom he may be brought into contact. A similar remark does not apply with equal force to typhoid fever, but, nevertheless, it is an important point to be able to say with certainty about the end of the first week of the illness that an attack is or is not typhoid fever, the more so as it occasionally happens that the medical attendant may not be able to decide the point even after the lapse of a fortnight. During the Attack.—Here the tests are only of value in determining the nature of doubtful cases. It may be at once said that the chief value of both these bacteriological methods of diagnosis applies chiefly to ill-defined attacks. No one who is skilled in practical medicine could fail to recognize at a glance a well-marked case either of diphtheria or of typhoid fever. The most experienced man in the world, however, will be undecided for some time in a certain proportion of attacks of both these maladies. The bacteriological method would therefore be of value in settling differences of opinion between medical men, and in the case of typhoid fever would at once determine the proper and only safe line of treatment. After the Attack.—In diphtheria the absence of the special microbe that causes the disease marks the stoppage of the infectivity of the patient. This can now bo ascertained by exact bacteriological examination. As regards diphtheria the question is of particular importance, as a patient in a town environment is far more likely to be a centre of disease when recovering from diphtheria than from typhoid. METHODS OF TESTING. In the case of diphtheria both secretion and membrane from the patches that form in the throat are collected and sent to the laboratory. The throat of the patient is touched with a little swab of wool, which is replaced in a sterilised tube, and sent to the Medical Offier of Health by post in an appropriate package. In the case of typhoid fever a drop or two of blood is drawn off from a prick in the patient's finger by means of a small sterilised glass tube, the euds of which are 6ealed, and the whole forwarded to the laboratory. 26 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. METHODS OF COLLECTING SPECIMENS. The plan usually followed is to provide every medical man in the district with outfits suited for both the foregoing purposes. COST. The total cost of the laboratory examination varies from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d., the latter price being authorised at St. Pancras. To the above amounts must be added the original cost of outfit and the postage to and from the Health Department. It should be borne in mind, however, in considering the question of cost, that the method is needed only in doubtful cases. HOW FAR IS THE BACTERIOLOGICAL METHOD PRACTISED? St. Pancras and St. Olave's adopt the plan both for diphtheria and for typhoid fever, and, so far as can be ascertained, are the only Sanitary Authorities in London which follow that course. For diphtheria alone the public test is applied in St. Marylebone, Holborn and Strand, while Camberwell has made arrangements to do the same shortly at a cost of four shillings per case. Poplar has a similar course under serious consideration. From Mr. Murphy's London County Council Report for 1896, wo learn that in St. Marylebono, material from 87 cases was examined with positive results in 46; in Holborn 17 with the like result in 10. This gives a decision in the affirmative of over fifty per cent. in 104 presumably doubtful cases to which the test was applied. It should be noted that the bacteriological method of diagnosing diphthoria has been carried out for some years past in many provincial districts, notably in Bristol, Brighton, Manchester, and Liverpool. In some of them tho typhoid fever test has also been instituted. The pioneers in this extremely practical departure in public health work hail from America. My own conclusions upon this important subject may be briefly indicated as follows:— 1. That it is of great value from a practical standpoint to detect diphthoria and typhoid fever with certainty, especially in the early and late stages. In both cases tho method may be now and then essential in the prevention of the spread of the disease. 2. That the benefit will be both individual and general: (1) Individual, in tho determination of doubtful cases, and of the proper course of treatment, and in saving him from unnecessary exposure. (2) General (a), in the detection of cases, and ho of indicating the need of isolation and disinfection; (6) in preventing uncured cases in children from returning to school, and there becoming fresh centres of infection. 3. That the possibility of such detection is now rendered scientifically cortain by means of a bacteriological examination of the secretions of diphtheria, and of the blood of patients suffering from typhoid fever. 4. That the actual cost to the Vestry would be small in comparison with tho gain to patients and the prevention of the spread of disease. 5. That, so far as I have been able to learn, the exporienco of those Sanitary Authorities who have adopted the tests has been satisfactory, although perhaps medical men have not availed themselves of the proffered opportunities so generally as had been anticipated. That, in my opinion, the adoption of both tests would be of distinct value to the sanitary administration of tho District of St. George the Martyr. 8th March, 1898. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1898. 27 Special Report on a case of Typhus Fever notified in April, 1898. I am happy to be able to report that the case of Mrs. E., of 20, Toulmin Street, notified and removed to hospital with typhus fever on the 12th April last, has not been followed by any spread of this extremely contagious and fatal disease. The wisdom of Parliament in casting the duty of enforcing S. 60—(4) of the Public Health (Lond.) Act, upon those responsible for the safeguarding of the health of the people is, I think, sufficiently apparent in this case. The section referred to, as your Vestry will remember, reads as follows:— "The Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation, with any necessary attendants for the members of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority." On the question of the usefulness of Eeception Houses in stamping out diseases such as typhus, I cannot, perhaps, do better than quote the following passage from the "Medical Press," which puts the matter—so to speak—in a nutshell:— "Last Easter a case of typhus was reported in St. George's, Southwark. The patient, a woman, contracted the disease from nursing the children of a family that had been attacked in Kensington. The family she visited consisted of a man, wife, and seven children, who all took the fever, together with the doctor and undertaker. In another flat on the same floor lived three persons —father, mother, and child— who were infected by a child of the former family sleeping there after the death of the mother. Kensington, wealthy parish though it be, has no reception house for the isolation of persons who have been exposed to infection. In striking contrast comes tbe case of St. George's, Southwark, which has recently provided itself with a substantial and well-appointed shelter of the kind. The parishioner was promptly removed to the South Eastern Fever Hospital, and her husband quarantined for fourteen days, while the premises were thoroughly cleansed. In the same house, living in five small rooms, were four families, who were at once removed to the reception house for two days and a night. Thanks to this radical and clear-sighted policy, there can be little doubt that the poverty-stricken and densely-crowded parish of St. George's has been saved from the disaster of an epidemic of typhus, whereas unwise Kensington suffered to the extent of fourteen cases and three deaths, including the medical attendant. The Southwark Vestry may be congratulated on the brilliant success of their experiment." To this I might add. that the Medical Officer of Health of Kensington,. in a copy of a report he has been good enough to forward me, says he is of opinion that Mrs. E., of 20, Toulmin Street, Southwark, "probably would have escaped taking typhus, had it been possible to place her in a shelter whilst the rooms of the two flats at Western Dwellings, Kensington, were being disinfected." 24th May, 1898. The need of further free Public Lavatory Accommodation for Women and Children. The following communication and copy of letter have been received by me:— London County Council, Public Health Department, Spring Gardens, S.W., 8th July, 1898. Re Public Conveniences for Women and Children in London. Dear Sir,— I am directed by a Committee of the Council to forward you for your information the enclosed copy of a letter received by the Council from Mr, Gerald C. Parsons, 28 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. of No. 50. Wray Crescent, Tollington Park, N., calling attention to the alleged neglect to supply adequate water-closet accommodation in London for women and children. I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully SHIRLEY F. MURPHY. Medical Officer of Health Dr. F. Waldo, Vestry Hall, 81, Borough Road, S.E. [Copy.] 50, Wray Crescent, Tollinoton Park, N., 10th June, 1898. Sir,— I venture to suggest that the attention of the different Vestries of London should he drawn to the danger to public health and morality owing to the neglect to supply in certain crowded districts proper public accommodation for women and children (partly free). Amongst such districts might be named the Elephant and Castle, the Britannia, Hampstead Road, St. Paul's Churchyard, the Angel, Islington, Ac. London being such an immense forest of houses, these places must be situated centrally to be of any use to strangers to a locality, and surely it is to the interest of Londoners to encourage tourists to visit the metropolis, though this is viewing it from the lowest point of view. I would further suggest that it is desirable that all conveniences for women should be labelled "for women and children." I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) GERALD C. PARSONS. In reference to this important matter, I may perhaps bo permitted to state for the information of new members of the Vestry, that your attention was called to the further need of the provision of accommodation for women in my Annual Reports for 1895 and 1896. In these reports I suggested "as a first step in the right direction a women's lavatory might be added to the one existing near the "Elephant and Castle." Again, referring to the same subject in my annual report for 1817, I said that "During the year under report much attention has been displayed to the important subject of public lavatory accommodation. "Two old-fashioned structures above ground were demolished at the time of the Jubilee. Under the powers conferred by the public Health (London) Act, 1891, your Authority constructed an underground convenience for men only near the 'Elephant and Castle' in the year 1893. "Plans have been approved by the Vestry and await the result of Government inquiry, for the construction of two additional underground conveniences, namely, one (for men only) at the Obelisk, St. George's Circus, and the other (for both sexes) at the junction of the Old and New Kent Roads. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. 29 "Before leaving this important subject it may be well to add in the interests of the general public health the following suggestions, which if carried out could hardly fail to add to the comfort and well-being of a poor and crowded population:—(a) The provision at each of these points of accommodation for both sexes; (b) Ample free accommodation for both sexes, which appears to be imperatively called for in a poor district." At the present time only one public convenience exists for women, namely, that situated in New Alley near the Parish Church. Tenders have, however, been received for the construction of conveniences at (a) the junction of the Old and New Kent Roads, and (b) the rear of the new Public Library Buildings in the Borough Road. On the completion of these works I submit that three w.c's. to be provided free for the use of women will prove to be quite inadequate for the needs of the densely populated parish of St. George's, Southwark, and more especially so when one takes into consideration the constant and well-founded complaints of nuisances due to the improper use by strangers of conveniences in block buildings and of blind alleys and entries. 26th July, 1898. Report Re Suggested Demolition of No. 24, Barron's Place. I should advise your Vestry—the "Local Authority"—to take action under Sec. 36 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, with a view to the demolition of No. 24, Barron's Place, Waterloo road. This dwelling-house was closed in February, 1895, on a Magistrate's order under the provisions of the Housing Act, and is in my opinion in such a condition as to be "dangerous or injurious to the health of the public or of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwelling-houses." 20th September, 1898. (The advice given in this Report has not yet been acted upon.) Special Report on the Housing of the Poor. Section 30 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, states that "It shall be the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of every district to represent to the local Authority of that district any dwelling-house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. The machinery of the Act also provides that such representation shall originate in one of two ways: either— 1. Indirectly on the written complaint to the Medical Officer of Health of any four or more householders living in or near a street in which any dwelling-house is thought to be in a state unfit for human habitation ; or 2. On the direct representation of the Medical Officer of Health to the "Local Authority"—that is to say, in this District, to your Vestry itself. In compliance with this statutory duty, I beg to report that Nos. 187,189, and 161, Waterloo Road, are in such a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation; and would accordingly advise your Vestry to puss the usua1 resolution to the effect "That notices be served on the owner or owners to make the premises fit for human habitation within a specified time, and, failing which, that proceedings be taken before a Court of summary jurisdiction for prohibiting the use of the same," 30 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. I would also advise your Vestry to pass a resolution in accordance with Section 33 of the Housing Act, to the effect "That it is expedient to order the demolition of the buildings," namely, Nos. 1, 2, 3,4, and 5, Red Cow Alley, Tabard Street. These dwelling-houses were represented by me to your Vestry as being unfit for human habitation, on the 96th February, 1895, and were closed by means of a Magistrate's order on the 24th March, 1895. Nothing has been done to these buildings—which still remain closed—and their continuance in that state is, in my opinion to quote the words of the Act—"dangerous or injurious to the health of the public, or of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwelling-houses. 4th October, 1898. Special Report on a recent case of Typhus Fever in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, with General and Special Remarks thereon. Mr. Chairman,— In the statistical report which I present to you to-night, mention is made of a case of typhus in your district. An occurrence of that kind raises issues of so much importance that I have thought it best to embody my remarks thereon in the form of a special Report. On the 22nd October, I received a notification of a case of typhus fever at Guy's Hospital. The patient was a man, F.K., aged nineteen, who came from 2, Walker Street, Tabard Street. Alter about a week's illness at home, he went to the hospital, where he was detained as an in-patient, and his case notified as typhus on the 19th of October. By error this notification was sent to Bermondsey in the first place, so that it did not reach me before the morning of the 22nd October. I immediately wont to the patient's house and inquired into the circumstances of the case, and without delay urged upon the mother the necessity of disinfection and cleansing, to which she agreed, together with the removal of herself and children to the Reception House. The father went away to stay in the house of a son living in Bermondsey, but two days later I induced him also to come to the Reception House, and meanwhile communicated to the Medical Officer of Health of Bermondsey the fact that a person who had been exposed to the infection of typhus has entered his parish. The patient was a brushmaker by occupation, and had been at work up to the time of his illness. The circumstances of the family were fairly easy for the labouring class. The father was a casual river-side labourer ; three boys were earning wages, and a girl attended school. The family living in the house numbered man and wife, three sons, aged 19 (the patient), 10, 14, and a girl upwards of 10. The house contained two rooms, a living one on the ground floor (with a capacity of 132 cubic feet and floor space of 22 square feet per person) and a bed room upstairs reached from the lower room by stairs. The whole family of six adults (counting as an adult everyone over 10 as laid down in the bye-laws of this parish for lodging. houses) slept in three beds in the upstairs room. The cubic space of the bed room (making no deduction for beds or other contents) was 1,095 cubic feet, leaving 182 5 cubic feet per head, whereas tho minimum allowance under tho above quoted byelaws is 300 cubic feet for each inmate of a bed room, used exclusively as a sleeping apartment. I may add, that, in my opinion, the allowance per head should bo at least l,000 cubic feet, and that, only in the presence of free ventilation. In this particular bed room under notice there were two windows, an open fireplace and a doorway. The windows were on one side of the room, opposite a sloping roof on the other side so that there was no opportunity of cross ventilation. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. 31 Turning next to the floor space, we find it a few inches over 25 square feet per inmate, which is, in my opinion, inadequate. The general condition of the house was fairly clean. The w.c. was at back, in a small yard closely hemmed in by houses. Walker Street is composed of small two and four-roomed houses, and lies in the midst of a network of streets and courts of similiar small dwellings, closely packed together. The inhahitant3 of this area are chiefly fish curers, hawkers, costermongers and labourers. The source of the infection in F.K., I have been unable to trace. Since the above case, another patient has been notified to me as suffering from typhus. The patient was removed to the South-Eastern Fever Hospital on the 30th October. His symptoms were obscure and misleading, but subsequently a postmortem examination revealed the fact that death was not due to typhus. Previously to the case of F.K., the only typhus notified to me in this parish occurred in April, 1898. Infection was traced to a patient at Kensington. Before that, no case had been reported since my appointment as Medical Officer in 1892; but a serious outbreak of the malady took place in 1864 and 1865. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Typhus, it is well known, is a most infectious disease, with a period of " sickening " of seven to fourteen days, and has not yet been traced to a definite micro-organism. It is quite certain that the chief cause of its spread are overcrowding and depressing conditions, such as poverty, want of food, intemperance, bad ventilation and insanitary environment. It is a disease of the poor, spread mainly by personal contact, and attacks chiefly children and young adults. In patients over middle age it is exceedingly fatal. The importance of any one case as regards the rest of London may perhaps best be shown by means of a particular example. The case spoken of as occurring in this parish early in that year was traced to North Kensington. Your parishioner who was attacked, went to nurse some sick relatives in the suburb mentioned, where she contracted the disease. The Kensington outbreak involved about fourteen cases, with three deaths (including that of the doctor in attendance). To quote the words of the Medical Officer of Health—Dr. Dudfield —our parishioner " probably would have escaped taking typhus, had it been possible to place her in a shelter whilst the rooms of the two flats at W.D. . . . were being disinfected." This incident shows how necessary it is for the welfare of the Metropolis for all districts to be equally well provided with sanitary safeguards, and also how the occurrence of an infectious disease in one quarter is a possible danger to the inhabitants of any or all other quarters. THE SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS TAKEN. These consisted in disinfection of the surroundings of the patient. The bedding and clothes were burnt, and the house disinfected and cleansed at the cost of the authority. The other inmates of the house were taken to the Reception House, and retained over the full incubation period of the disease, fourteen days. At the same time they were personally cleansed and their clothes disinfected. CONCLUSIONS. From a careful consideration of the foregoing facts, I conclude that this case, if not actually contracted from disease germs latent in the house, wa* certainly 32 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. rendered more dangerous by the crowded condition as to space both of the house and the neighbourhood. It is possible, but in my opinion not in the least probable, that the malady may have been conveyed in the materials from foreign source used in the patient's employment. If the Vestry think that any further action should be taken with regard to this congested district, the existence of which is specially dangerous in the presence of infectious disease, I would point out as a first step the necessity of providing better housing accommodation for the poor of this parish. In my opinion, powers are already in existence under Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, whereby the London County Council as Local Authority under the Act are empowered to provide dwellings for the working classes. The intention of this act appears to be the relief of overcrowding in poor districts, and it seems clear that it could hardly anywhere be applied for that purpose more appropriately than in the parish of St. George's, Southwark. 15th November, 1898. Special Report on an unhealthy area and vacant sites as the basis of an official representation to the London County Council with a view to the better housing of the poor of the Parish of St. George the Martyr, in accordance with the Council's resolutions of 29th November, 1898. Mr. Chairman, Your attention has been recently drawn to a local congestion of population in your parish by the occurrence of a case of typhus in a house the conditions of which showed what there need be little hesitation in describing as gross overcrowding. The subject is by no means new for it has been before the parish in a more or less pointed form for some years past. Recent decisions of the London County Council have brought the whole matter into such prominence that it can hardly be neglected by the London parishes, much less by those which are inhabited mainly by a working population. It may be well to preface my remarks with a short statement as to overcrowding, which may be considered under the headings of (1) Space, and (2) Housing. (1) With regard to space, which term is here confined to ground space the density of population in the whole of London is 58 per acre, whereas in its several parishes St. George the Martyr comes second on the list with 212 per acre, and follows Whitechapel with 220 per acre. It is only fair, however, to state that in my opinion the acreage density of population must be accepted with some reserve as an ultimate test of over-crowding, because much depends on the class of dwellings existing on any particular site, especially as regards the size and proper ventilation of rooms, and the sanitary equipment and maintenance of the buildings generally. (2) W ith regard to house overcrowding, the following facts are drawn from cases that have been dealt with by your parish during the eleven months ending 30th November, 1898. (a) Specific cases of overcrowding reported by district inspectors and abated. Ward I. During the 11 months 23 Ward II. „ „ 17 Ward III, „ „ „ „ 14 54 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898 33 (b) Specific cases reported by Inspector for Houses let in lodgings during the above mentioned period 299. The total abatement from both sources therefore equals 353. That statement lone suffices to prove the existence of serious overcrowding in your parish. That it onsiderably understates the case will be abundantly evident when we re realise that be Special Inspector for Lodging Houses has not rigorously adopted the standard aid down by the Bye-laws which demand 300 cubic feet per inmate for bedroom sed for sleeping purposes only, and 400 cubic feet per head when not so occupied xclusively. Under the less stringent conditions then, your Authority has abated vercrowding in 299 houses during the past eleven months: or under all circumtances in a grand total of 353 houses. The recent resolutions of the London County Council upon the question of over;rowding run thus:— (a) That housing accommodation should be provided for a number of persons equal to that of the working classes displaced by any scheme under the Housing of he Working Classes Act, 1890, or under the provision of any Improvement Act; but not necessarily in the immediate neighbourhood of the displacement, due consideration being given to the needs of those living on any particular area. (b) That all clearances under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, which involve re-housing be done at the sole cost of the Council. It will be evident that the above resolutions are based upon the principle of an. equal distribution of the responsibilities of the metropolis in sanitary mattersf Henceforth poorer parishes will be able to approach the problem of the housing o, bhe poor without the necessity of imposing fresh burdens upon already heavily rated and poor districts. Under these circumstances it is tolerably certain that many of the poorer parishes will hasten to avail themselves of the advantages thus offered them by the London County Council. In your own parish the need of immediate action is emphasised by the facts that your district is one of the most heavily rated, one of the poorest, and one of the most densely populated in the Metropolis, while the death-rate has always been abnormally high. I would, therefore, urge the Vestry to take immediate steps to secure the advantages thrown open to them by the new policy of the County Council. To reduce the position of your Vestry, as far as possible, to a short and practical form I would suggest that you approach the Council with definite proposals as to (1) unhealthy area for clearance and reconstruction, and (2) certain sites, now vacant, to be used for rehousing. The desirability of providing fresh sites for houses results from the fact of the Council's decision that dwelling accommodation has to be provided on the improvement area for the same number of persons of the working class as is displaced. The unhealthy area which I suggest should be dealt with by the Council lies in Ward I. (St. Michael's) on the north of the parish. It may be conveniently divided into three sections, referred to hereafter as the Grotto Place, the King's Bench Walk, and the Webber Bow unhealthy area. 1. The Grotto Place unhealthy area has been described as a triangular portion bounded on the north by Suffolk Grove and the Couuty Council Fire Brigade Station, with the two remaining sides of the triangle running southwards, and made up of Southwark Bridge Road and Lant Place. This small area I would extend to a larger triangle, bounded roughly on the north by Suffolk Grove, in St. Saviour s, and on the two remaining sides stretching southwards by Great Suffolk Street and Sturge Street. The smaller triangular portion of this area comprises a dense network of narrow courts and blind alleys. 34 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. 2. The King's Bench Walk area is bounded roughly by Pocock Street on the north, and by Friar Street on the south. The remaining two sides of a quadrilateral area are formed by King's Bench Walk and Wellington Place, running in a S.E. direction, both sides of which streets being included. In addition to this roughly quadrilateral area, is an outstanding portion at its S.E. corner, comprising Upper Green Street and Bean Street (both sides) and bounded on the south by King James Street. Upon this King's Bench Walk area certain sites would be left untouched.: They are the Pocock Street Board School, caretaker's house, and playground; the L.C.C. dwelling-houses, and a lamp factory recently built. The Webber Row unhealthy area is bounded on the north by Webber Street, and stretches down in a south-west direction as a rough quadrilateral, bounded on the western side by Webber Row, on the eastern by Peabody Square Buildings, and on the southerly extremity by Waterloo Road. The acreage and population covered by these three sections is approximately as as follows:— 1. The Grotto Place unhealthy area - (a) Smaller section, half-an-acre, with a population of 250. (b) The large section (inclusive of preceding) three acres, with a population of 856, # 2. The King's Bench Walk area, two-and-a-quarter acres, with a population of 879. 3. The Webber Row area, two acres, with a population of 293. It will thus be seen that the total acreage of the unhealthy areas is seven-and-aquarter acres, with a population of 2,028. I have described the Grotto Place (smaller) area and the King's Bench Walk area (excepting the small S.E. portion) in my Annual Report of 1897 (see pago 17). I have also several times suggested to your Health Committee the desirability of dealing with the Webber Row area as an unhealthy area under Part I. of the Working Classes Act, 1890. ] The vacant sites that appear to me to be immediately available in tho three Wards of your parish for building operations by the County Council represent a rough aggregate of 56,640 square feet. I would respectfully suggest to your Vestry that an official representation he made of the above unhealthy area and vacant sites without loss of time, to the L.C.C., who are the Local Authority under the Act, with a request that they will deal with the same forthwith under the resolutions already referred to as passed by the Council on the 29th November, 1898. From a perusal of the Act, 1 find that the official representation of the case must come through the Medical Officer of Health, and be addressed to the London County Council. In that event, a somewhat fuller statement of details would be required than has been possible in the short time available for the preparation of this Special Report, which I now have the honour of submitting to your Vestry. In the present instance, I have thought it would be better, in the interests of the parish, to submit the matter to the Vestry, in the first place, with a view of learning your views and wishes, and of determining the course of action most likely to secure |he approval of the ratepayers. 13th December, 1898. Annual Report or the Medical Officer of Health.—1898. 35 Special Report on Sewage Flooding in Basements. Amongst Bewage-flooded cellars visited by me were those in use as workrooms by bakers, cooks, printers, a butcher (a meat pickler), a window-blind maker, a urrier, a gas-fitter, a gilder, a paper-bag maker, and a publican. This question of basement-floodings in various low-lyings parts of the metropolis has been for some years past under the notice of the London County Council, and in 895 the Council resolved that the general enlargement of the main drainage system was not then necessary, but that "local flooding needed immediate attention." In 893—in accordance with the request of the Chairman of the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council—I furnished particulars of 20 cellars in which found evidence of sewage flooding. A summary of a detailed report on the subject is recorded in my Annual Report to the Vestry for 1893. In this report I explained that "the special danger connected with this form of basement flooding is that this sewage is always more or less recharged with the specific poison of typhoid fever, and is at any time liable to that of cholera and of other deadly diseases. It is obvious that such contaminated cellars are unfitted for the preparation of bread or other articles of food, and almost equally 50 for use as workshops or dwelling rooms." I also added—"In reference to this report a correspondence took place between your Vestry and the London County Council. The latter, as you are aware, suggested that the less costly remedy would be to fill up the cellars rather than to enlarge the main sewer. No mention was made, however, of the question of compensation for disturbance to owners, nor did the Council state on whom it was proposed to lay the necessary cost involved of filling up the cellars. Further, no answer of any kind was given to my proposal contained in a previous report, that the Council should lay down a separate system of drainage for carrying off storm water." The London Building Act of 1891 provides against the occupancy in the future of dwelling-houses on low-lying land. Section 122 of this Act says:— "It shall not be lawful for any person upon land of which the surface is below the level of Trinity high-water mark, and which is so situate as not to admit of being drained by gravitation into an existing sewer of the Council, to erect any building to be used, wholly or in part, as a dwelling-house, or to adopt any building to be used, wholly or in part, as a dwelling-house, except with the permission of the Council, and subject to and in accordance with such regulations as the Council may from time to time prescribe with reference to the erection of buildings on such land." In concluding my Seventh Annual Report, I may again say, as in former years, that so long as I am honoured with the confidence of your Vestry, it will be my earnest endeavour to carry out the duties of the important office with which I have been entrusted, with all necessary care and vigilance. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, Medical Officer of Health. 1, Plowden Buildings, Temple, 21st March, 1899. 36 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark APPENDIX. Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. I beg to present the following report for the year ending the 31st December, 1898:- Daring the year 249 complaints have been made and entered in the official register kept for that purpose, being seven less than the preceding year. 5 notices in respect to 8 houses have been served under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 22 inspections have been made relating to newly erected houses. 22 water supply certificates have also been granted, under section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to 22 houses and 12 tenements. 135 visits have been made relating to factories and workshops and 20 notices served in relation thereto, there are 369 now registered, 31 of which have been added during the year. Several alterations have been made so as to prevent the direct approach to the conveniences from any room used as a factory or workshop. This has been done by enclosing them by a solid wall or partition of brick or other materials, extending the entire height from the floor to the ceiling so as to screen the conveniences from view of the workers.

The following is a copy of a memorandum forwarded me by the Local Government Board:— Memorandum as to Annual Reports of Medical Officers of Health. Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under Order of the Local Government Board is required to make an Annual Report with regard to the Sanitary district which 53 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1898. is under his superintendence. The report is to be for the year ending the 31st December, or, if the Officer at that date has not been in office for a whole year, then for so much of the year as has elapsed since his appointment. The report is to be made to the Sanitary Authority, and the Medical Officer of Health himself should send a copy of it to the Local Government Board and to the London County Council. It should be made to the Sanitary Authority as soon as practicable after the expiration of the year to which it relates, and should be in the hands both of the Sanitary Authority and of the Local Government Board within at most five months from the end of the year. The Board's copy of the report should be forwarded to them when the original is sent to the Sanitary Authority, except where the report is likely to be printed by order of the Authority. In such cases the Board need only be supplied with a printed copy. Article 18 (Section 15) of the Board's Order of 8th December, 1891, specifies the information to be contained in the Annual Report, and is printed below. The report should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district and with the means of improving these conditions. It should consider these subjects with reference to the past and future, as well as to the particular year; and the account of the sanitary state of the district generally should, while marking the point that has been reached in the sanitary state and administration of the district, indicate directions for further consideration and action. The sanitary history of the year under review should include a record alike of the proceedings of the Medical Officer himself and of the proceedings taken under his direction or advice. The Medical Officer of Health, in reporting his proceedings and advice, may find it convenient to follow in the main the order in which the subject matters of his duty appear in the several paragraphs of Article 18. Special care should be taken to report fully and explicitly in reporting on the influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the public health within the district; and the causes, origin, and distribution of disease within the district may usefully be the subjects of annual record. An account should also be given both of the actual circumstances of the district up to the end of the past year and of any improvement or deterioration that has occurred during the year in conditions conducive to health or to disease. For example, a vigilant health officer has in his annual report an opportunity for pointing out any facts as to water supplies and house construction, conditions of storage and of removal of refuse customary in the district, together with any facts as to the adequacy or inadequacy of means of isolation and of disinfection, and the like; and such a health officer, reporting on the diseases and their causes within the district, will generally have some instructive details to give, either of conditions newly productive of disease or of matters that have been remedied with advantage to the public health. In reporting upon Section 3, not only should the fact of having made systematic inspections, but the outcome from those inspections should be duly put on record. The report should contain a full account of inspections, whether systematic or occasional, of the judgment which the Medical Officer of Health has formed thereon as to the sanitary state of his district, and of the advice he has in consequence given to the Sanitary Authority, and the action taken by the Authority thereon. By "systematic" inspections are meant inspections independent of such enquiries as, under other Article of the Order, the Medical Officer of Health has to make into particular outbreaks of disease, or into unwholesome conditions to which his attention may have been specially called by complaints or otherwise, and such inspections will include the house-to-house inspections which may be necessary in particular localities. In making systematic inspections, as in much of his other action, the Medical Officer of Health will usually have required the assistance of the Inspector of Nuisances, and it will bo for the Medical Officer to include in his report an account of the action which at his instance the Inspector may have taken for the removal of nuisances injurious to health, 54 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The tabular statements of sickness and mortality in the district during the year, to be made on the forms supplied for the purpose, should be the subject of comment in the text of the report, in so far as deductions from them may assist the Sanitary Authority to an appreciation of the lines of action needful in the future. As regards these statements of sickness and mortality only one other observation appears to be needful. The district under the superintendence of a Medical Officer of Health will often contain several parts evidently differing in their circumstances, or having very different rates of mortality, either from all causes or of mortality from some particular disease or class of diseases. The observation of these differences can scarcely fail to lead to valuable information, and it is in view of such differences that the tabular statements are required in Section 15 to be classified according to localities, and that provision for such classification is made in the forms supplied for returns of deaths. In the absence of any ascertained differences of the above sort it will still be desirable to classify the deaths of the district according to the part of the district in which they occur; and for this purpose any areas of known population may be taken as representing "localities" for the purposes of the Order. Classification on this basis will be likely to lead to the discovery of real differences when the returns for several years can be compared together. The same considerations apply to the records of sickness (Table B). These records should be tabulated for every sanitary district, and it will be well before proceeding to fill the columns and the blank spaces to note carefully the headings and the foot notes. What has been said above with regard to the information which an annual report should contain must be understood not as suggesting that the report should be limited to these subjects or that more detailed or differently arranged tabular statements may not be added, but as indicating the sort of information required by the Board's Order. Many Medical Officers of Health will doubtless with great advantage to the administration of their districts furnish much more detailed information respecting particular questions to which they have been led by the circumstances of the foregoing years to devote attention, or in the investigation of which they may have arrived at valuable conclusions. Any information of this kind will be appreciated by the Local Government Board. (Signed) R. THORNE THORNE, Medical Officer. Local Government Office, December, 1896.
