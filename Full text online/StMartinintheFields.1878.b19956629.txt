Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the- Fields, for the Year 1878. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Ninth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The year 1878 has been a healthy one, although tli deaths have been higher. This increased mortality is attributable to the larger number of deaths in the Charing Cross Hospital, which Institution having recently enlarged its accommodation for patients, has naturally increased the death-rate of the Hospital. Smallpox was not so prevalent this year as in the previous one; no death has occurred in the Parish from this malady, therefore we may hope that the epidemic is fast subsiding. In every case that came to my knowledge 1 visited the house and gave instructions for the prevention of the spreading of the disease, and when the patient had recovered, the apartment, bedlinen, and clothes were thoroughly disinfected by your late Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Hunt. That portion of Bedfordbury condemned under the “Artizans' Dwellings Act,” still remains in statu quo, but I trust shortly the demolition of these miserable habitations will commence in earnest, and that dwellings will be raised, in place of these wretched hovels, more fitted for the abode of human beings. 18 In one of my fortnightly Reports, I drew your attention to the unsanitary and bad structural condition of the houses situated in Chymister Alley, Bedfordbury, that they might be dealt with under Torrens' Act, but your Vestry Clerk pointed out the legal difficulties attending the carrying out of this project, and as there was then a Bill in Parliament to amend this Act, so as to give the Local Authority greater facilities for dealing with such cases, the matter was allowed to remain in abeyance. Births. The Births registered in the year 1878 were 467, that is 24 less than in the preceding year. The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month:— Males. Females. Total. January 30 15 45 February 9 25 34 March 16 16 32 April 28 16 44 May 26 25 51 June 24 23 47 July 20 20 40 August 21 13 34 September 16 12 28 October 21 26 47 November 19 16 35 December 17 13 30 247 220 467 19 Deaths. The Deaths registered in the year 1878 amounted to 519, being 53 more than in the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring in each month:— Males. Females. Total. January 28 17 45 February 19 17 36 March 22 20 42 April 22 19 41 May 22 19 41 June 30 18 48 July 34 24 58 August 21 14 35 September 23 15 88 October 36 15 51 November 21 20 41 December 27 16 43 305 214 519 Of the above 519 deaths, 186 occurred in the Charing Cress Hospital; of this latter number, 148 were non residents in St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This circumstance will therefore give the true death-rate of the Parish. Deaths, 1878 519 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 148 371 20 Death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1878, 17.5 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 57 By the above figures the death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1878 was 17.5. This death-rate though slightly higher than the previous year is still a very low one. The death-rate per 1,000 for the whole of London in the year 1878 was 23.5 against 21.9 of the previous year. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the last eight years:— 1871 19.4 1872 18.7 1873 20.2 1874 18.6 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 1878 17.5 Ages at Death. Of the 519 deaths, 177 occurred in children under 5 years of age, 33 between 5 and 20 years, 98 between 20 and 40 years, 125 between 40 and 60 years, 78 between GO and 80 years, and 8 above 80 years. Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—This important class of disease includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Croup, Whooping Cough,Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Simple Continued Fever, Remittent Fever, Diarrhoea and Cholera. The mortality from these diseases was 40, that is 11 more than in the previous year. 21 Smallpox.—No death occurred from this disease. Measles.—There were 3 deaths from this disease, which was 2 less than in the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—5 deaths were due to this malady, whereas last year none were recorded. Whooping Cough was fatal to 12. This is 7 in excess of the preceding year. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever and Remittent Fever. 7 deaths were registered from this class of disorders. All were due to Typhoid Fever. Diarrhoea.—12 deaths occurred from this malady, all in children under 5 years of age. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.—Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 176. This number is 8 in excess of the previous year. Diseases of the Heart.—37 deaths were registered from this complaint, against 34 of last year. Cancer proved fatal to 16 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed in a table at the end of my Report. Inquests. In the year 1878, there were held 65 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— N atural causes 22 Run over or knocked down in the street 5 Burns and scalds 5 Fall from a window 2 Fall from a cart 3 Fall from a ladder 2 Carried forward 39 22 Brought forward 39 Fracture of skull, newly born baby— Verdict wilful murder 1 Injuries received from the fall of a house in the Hay market 1 Hanging (Suicide) 2 Suffocation (accidentally, when in bed with Parents) 3 Injuries received from falling in the street 2 Poisoning with muriatic acid (Suicide) 1 Cause not ascertained 1 Injuries received from falling down stairs 2 Haemorrhage from navel string of a newly born infant 1 Fall from a horse 1 Suffocation, accidental, a stableman was found dead at foot of loft stairs with a sack of corn across his back, at 12, Wilson Street 1 Fall from scaffolding 2 Chloroform, when about to undergo an operation 1 Drowning (No evidence to show how deceased came into the water 4 7 Drowning (Suicide) 2 Drowning (Accidental.) Seized with faintness from heart disease, whilst taking a bath at St. Martin's Baths 1 65 Bakehouses. The several Bakehouses situated in the Parish have been duly inspected. Some few I have caused notices to be served upon the owners for the purpose of limewhiteing, etc. 23 Mortuary Chapel. The number of bodies taken to the Mortuary since it was opened, up to the present time, (July, 1879), is 133, equivalent to about 33 per annum. I would like to see this boon more highly appreciated by the poorer classes, for it is very revolting that a dead body should be allowed to remain in the same room as that occupied by the living. Registration. For the Registration of Births and Deaths, in this Parish, the Long Acre District and the Charing Cross District have been merged into one, under the title of the St. Martin-in-the-Fields Sub-District, Mr. J. F. Pink is appointed Registrar, who attends daily, with the exception of Saturday, at 10, Agar Street, Strand, from 9 to 10 in the morning, and 5 to 6 in the evening. Sanitary Work. In the year 1878, 82 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property to remedy sanitary defects. Legal proceedings in one case only were resorted to, the owner or occupier failing to act upon the notice served. The several courts and passages in the Parish have been lime-wliited from time to time. The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed; and those gullies in the streets which at times emit offensive effluvia, have also been flushed with carbolic acid and water. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street. 24 Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1878.
