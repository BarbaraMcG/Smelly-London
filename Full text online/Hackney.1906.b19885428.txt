MEDICAL OFFICERS REPORT. FOR THE YEAR 1906. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith my Fifteenth Annual Report on the Public Health of the Borough of Hackney. The year 1906 has been extremely satisfactory from a health point of view. In spite of increasing density of population and the increasing immigration of aliens, the general mortality for the year was only 14.17 per 1,000 living. This is the lowest annual death rate we have had for more than a decade. The infant mortality rate, which was 123 per 1,000 births, was also considerably lower than during the year 1905; and this, too, with a high atmospheric temperature during the third quarter of the year. The notifiable infectious disease was also less prevalent during 1906 than during the previous year. While the decline in the infant mortality during 1906 is very satisfactory, the rate is still extremely high, and by suitable preventive measures may be considerably reduced. The measures most suitable to attain this end are contained in the resolutions passed at the National Conference on Infant Mortality, which met at Westminster in June of last year. These resolutions are given on page 14 of this Report. 6 I am pleased to state that the Officers of the Public Health Department have on the whole carried out their respective duties to my entire satisfaction. Population and Density.— I estimate the population of the Borough of Hackney at the end of June, 1906, to be 229,596 persons. The density of the population of the whole Borough is 69.8 persons per acre, varying from 49.4 persons per acre in the North SubDistrict, to 104 persons per acre in the South-West Sub-District. The separate populations, area and density for each sub-district are given in the subjoined table.

The annual rate of persons married per 1,000 of the population during that period is, therefore 15.4 per 1,000. The marriage rate for London during the same period is 17.1 persons married per 1,000 of the estimated population. The following table gives the marriages and marriage rate for the Borough of Hackney and London for the ten years, 1896 to 1905. * I have here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Tom Hosgood, Superintendent Registrar, who has kindly abstracted for me the number of marriages for the year 1906. 7 Year.

The total number shows a decline of 6 upon the number of births during the previous year. The birth rate for 1906 is 25.5 per 1,000 of the population. The table below shows the number of births and the birth rates in the four sub-districts of the Borough. The birth rate for London during the same period is 26.5 per 1,000 living persons. Illegitimate Births and Birth Rate.— There were 355 illegitimate births registered in the Borough during 1906, but of these 250 took place in the Salvation Army Rescue Home, Mare Street, but 223 of these were of mothers drawn from places outside Hackney. After deducting these from the total illegitimate births registered, there remain 132 illegitimate births to be credited to Hackney. This gives an illegitimate birth rate of 22.5 per 1,000 births for the Borough of Hackney. 8 Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-District. All London. North. Central.

On the other hand, there were 352 deaths of Hackney residents who died in institutions outside the Borough. Making the necessary corrections, the correct number of deaths to be credited to Hackney is 3,131. This figure shows a decline of 161 deaths on the previous year. The general death rate for Hackney for the year 1906 is therefore 13 6 per 1,000 of the population. This rate requires further correction for age and sex distribution, which is made by multiplying the above rate by the factor 1 04262. Making this correction, the true general mortality for Hackney becomes 14.17 per 1,000 living. The mortality rate for 1905 was 15 01, the year 1906 shows then a lower death rate to the extent of .84 per 1000 of the population The lowest death rate is in the North Sub-District (11.6 per 1,000), the highest in the South-West Sub-District (14.8 per 1,000). The annual death rate from all causes for London in 1906 is 15.1 per 1,000 living. Sub-District. Population. No. of Birtbs. Birthrate. Total Deaths Deathrate. Deaths under 1 year.

The deaths of infants under one year of age in the Borough during the year of 1906 numbered 721. This figure shows a decline in infant mortality compared with the year 1905, the number of infant deaths for this latter year being 822. The infant mortality for the year 1906 is therefore 123 per 1,000 births, compared with 140 per 1,000 births for 1905. This fall in the infant mortality is due to a diminished prevalence during 1906 of infectious disease, epidemic diarrhoea and diseases of the lungs, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. An encouraging feature is the diminution in the deaths under one year due to epidemic or summer diarrhoea, in spite of the fact that the atmospheric conditions during the summer of 1906 were such as to lead one to anticipate rather an increase in the deaths than a diminution.

This Conference did good service in making more widely known the causes which lead to a high Infant Mortality, and in indicating the lines along which hygienic efforts should be directed with a view to the reduction of the present excessively high Infant Mortality. The following subjects were discussed at the Conference :— The teaching in schools of elementary hygiene in reference to the rearing of infants. The appointment of qualified women with special reference to the hygiene and feeding of infants. The public supply of pure or specially prepared milk for the feeding of infants. Premature birth in relation to infantile mortality. Ante-Natal causes of infantile mortality, including parental alcoholism. The teaching of the hygiene of the expectant and suckling mother. Earlier notification or registration of births. On the earlier registration or notification of births. Infant life insurance. Infantile mortality and life insurance. Infant mortality and the employment of married women in factory labour before and after confinement. The regulation of the placing of infants out to nurse. The amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act. The chemistry of infant foods. Increase of the powers of local authorities with regard to milk supply. The operation of the Midwives Act in England, with a view to its extension to Scotland and Ireland, in relation to infantile mortality. 14 As a result of the discussion of the foregoing subjects the following resolutions were passed by the Conference:— 1. That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in elementary hygiene with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants to their present scheme for systematically training girls in the senior classes in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and the elements of dietary. 2. That, in the opinion of this Conference, immediate legislation is required enabling Sanitary Authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of pure, or modified, or sterilised milk, and to defray any cost out of the monies available for public health purposes. 3. That, in view of the information submitted, the Conference is of opinion that all still births should be notified within 48 hours to the medical officer of health of the district in which they occur, and that no burial should take place without a medical certificate. 4. That notification of all births be given within 48 hours to the medical officer of health of the district in which they occur. 5. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the question of the insurance of infant lives under twelve months is one demanding serious consideration, and, with a view to receiving reliable information, the Government should be asked to appoint a Departmental Committee of Inquiry on the whole question. 6. (a) That the period of one month's absentation from factory work away from home now imposed on mothers, be extended to at least three months, and that, on their return to work, evidence must be produced satisfactory to the local authority that proper provision has been made for the care of the child. (b) That no employer of labour shall permit a woman advanced in pregnancy to engage in factory labour unless her ability therefore has been certified to the satisfaction of the local authority. 7. (a) That, having regard to the ascertained fact that in centres of industries where women are largely employed away from their homes, an excessive number of deaths of infants takes place 15 and that this is contributed to by the improper conditions existing at the houses in which infants are placed out to nurse, it is necessary that the persons by whom, and the places into which infants are received should be under supervision by the local sanitary authority. (b) That the Infant Life Protection Act be amended to remedy abuses which are not at present provided against. 8. That all preparations offered or sold as food for infants should be certified by a Government analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. 9. That the Dairies, Milkshops, and Cowsheds Order is defective, and that any amendment should extend the definition of disease as applied to animals, and should make the provision of regulations by local authorities compulsory. That the scope of the regulations should be extended to cover dirty milk, and should enable local authorities to prohibit the sale of any milk which fails to comply with the conditions of purity agreed upon. 10. That in the opinion of this Conference the appointment of qualified women specially trained in the hygiene of infancy is necessary as an adjunct to public health work. 11. That in the opinion of this Conference the Midwives Act, 1902, should be extended to Scotland and Ireland. Senile Mortality.— The deaths at 65 years and upwards which occurred in the Borough during 1906 numbered 810, and of these 422 occurred between the ages of 65 and 75 years; 307 between the ages of 75 and 85 years, and 111 were at 85 years and upwards. The annual mortality rate of persons at 65 years and upwards is 36 per 1,000 persons living. Deaths in Public Institutions.— There were 1,286 deaths in public institutions in the Borough during 1905. Of these 465 were residents of other districts, and the remainder, 803 were residents of Hackney. The following gives the institutions within the Borough receiving persons both from the Borough, and also persons from without, with the number of deaths in each institution during the year 1905. 16 INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE BOROUGH RECEIVING PERSONS BOTH FROM AND WITHOUT THE BOROUGH.

During the year there were 1,860 cases of infectious disease compulsorily notified in the Borough, but of these 117 cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from infectious disease, thus reducing the genuine cases of notifiable infectious disease to 1,743 cases, a decline of 123 cases upon the number notified in 1905. The attack rate for the year is therefore 7.5 per 1,000 persons. The deaths from the seven chief zymotic diseases numbered 356, This is equal to a zymotic death rate of 1.7 per 1,000 living persons in the Borough. A—NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Smallpox.—There were 9 cases of this disease notified in the Borough during 1906, all of which recovered. The following is an account of the circumstances connected with these cases:— On the 15th February, Daisy W. age 10 years, of 5, Elm T. was notified to me as suffering from smallpox. On enquiry at this address, I found the patient's father carried on the business of boot and shoe manufacturer and that the patient's sister Eleanor, age 17 years, had been suffering from what was thought to be chickenpox three weeks before. On examining her I found a few scars of a dark red tint on her wrists and face. Another sister, Beatrice, 20 years, I learned, had suffered 4 weeks before in the same way. She also showed similar scars on the wrist and palms of the hand. These two latter worked with their father in the boot and shoe making. Further enquiry revealed the fact that another of Mr. W's workwomen, Henrietta B., age 24. of Bethnal Green had also suffered from what was thought to be chickenpox five weeks before. (This case I heard afterwards had been notified to the Bethnal Green Medical Officer of Health as chickenpox). On examination this woman showed scars on the face and wrists. Another worker, Lavinia R. aged 18 years, who was then away from work was stated to be suffering from some eruptive malady. On examination she was found to be suffering from smallpox of a very mild form. Chart showing the number of cases of notifiable Infectious Diseases during each Week of the Year 1906. 33 Daisy W. and Lavinia R. were removed to hospital, but the earlier cases which had recovered were not removed, but their clothes were disinfected, also the workshop of Mr. W. and its contents. Henrietta B. of Bethnal Green seems to have introduced the disease amongst Mr. W's workshop hands. As to the source of her infection, it appears that on the 24th December, 1905, she visited Devonport and stayed with a sister in that place until the 31st December, on which date she returned to London. On Sunday the 7th January, she fell ill with what was thought to be a severe cold. On Monday 8th she felt worse, and on this day noticed a red rash on the skin of her arms and legs and in the evening a few spots on her face. On Tuesday, January 9th the red rash had faded away and the spots remained and became larger, others also appearing on her wrists. When examined on the 16th February she had two small pigmented scars on her face and one on her wrist. In Plymouth smallpox was epidemic at the time of Henrietta's visit, and although there was no proof that she had been in contact with a case of smallpox in that town, she was probably infected either there or on her way back to London. The measures adopted were sufficient to prevent any further spread of the disease from this centre. Another series of cases of smallpox occurred in the district in the month of March. On the 19th of this month I was asked to see certain suspected cases of smallpox at 43, N. Street. On enquiry at this address and examination of all the members of the family, I found the father Arthur H. aged 37 years, and his sons Arthur, aged 14, John aged 12, Willie aged 10 and Henry aged 8 years suffering from mild but well marked smallpox. None of these children had ever been vaccinated and the father only in childhood. The mother and the youngest child were not infected, the latter having been vaccinated somewhat recently. The source of the infection of these cases could not at the time be ascertained. c 34 Perhaps connected with these cases was the following : William B. aged 8 years, 41, N. Street was notified on the 13th May as suffering from smallpox and was removed to hospital. He had never been vaccinated. Subsequently the mother admitted that two of her other children Florrie, aged 9 years and Rosie, aged 6 years had had some weeks previous to William falling ill a few spots on their face and arms (although at the time of William's removal she denied to me on my visit of enquiry that any other of the children had been ill), and although these two were vaccinated twice after William's removal to hospital the operation failed on both occasions. These facts I obtained from Dr. Rickets, the Medical Superintendent to the Smallpox Hospitals, and he further added in connection with these cases "From these facts it may be presumed that Florrie and Rosie were insusceptible to vaccination. But natural insusceptibility to vaccination is extremely rare, and it follows almost certainly that these two children had acquired their immunity from previous attacks of smallpox. I suggest that these attacks were recent, and that they preceded and originated the attack in the case of the brother William." The dates of the appearance of the eruption on Florrie and Rosie are very indefinite but it is not improbable that the illness of the H's who lived next door may have been connected with these cases. One other case of smallpox occurred in the district, that is Chas. H. aged 31 years, of 20, A. Road. The case was brought to my notice by the patient calling one morning on me at my office and requesting a certificate that he was free from ill-health and fit to return to work. It appears he had been absent from work some time with what he thought was influenza. On examining him I found unmistakable evidence that he had been suffering from smallpox and had not at that time completely recovered. He had still several scabs on his arm and legs. I notified the case and had him removed to hospital. It appears this man worked at a workplace in Bunhill Row, and that in all probability his infection originated there. 35 Scarlet Feyer.—The total number of cases of this disease notified in Hackney during 1906 was 1,052, but of this number 55 were afterwards found not to be suffering from this disease. This reduces the number of genuine cases notified to 997. This figure shows a decline of 60 upon the number notified during 1905. The attack rate for the year is 4.3 per 1,000 living persons. With the exception of a rise in the number of notifications in the first week in February, the incidence of the disease kept low until the third week in September, when there was a considerable rise in the notifications. This rise was maintained until the second week in December, when a fall took place which continued to the end of the year. These variations in the incidence of scarlet fever are shown in the accompaning chart. The number of cases of scarlet fever removed to hospital during the year was 924, which is equivalent to over 87 per cent. of the total notified. The following table shows the dates of removal of these cases in relation to the date of notification:— SCARLET FEVER—1906. Nursed at Home. Removed to Hospital. Removal to Hospital after Notification. Before Receipt of Notification. Same Day as Notification Received. 1 Day. 2 Days. 3 Days. 4 Days. Over 7 Days. 128 571 316 22 5 i 4 5 Total Cases Removed, 924. The following table shows the distribution of the disease in the respective sub-districts of the Borough. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Scarlet Fever. 196 291 265 300 Attack rate per 1,000. 3.8 5.3 4.3 4.9 C 2 36 It will be seen from this table that scarlet fever was more prevalent in the Central and South-East sub-districts. Of the cases notified, 924 were removed to Hospital. This is equal to nearly 88 per cent. of the total. The deaths from scarlet fever numbered 22. This is equal to an annual mortality of 22 per 1,000 attacked and .09 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate for London during the same period is .11 per 1,000 living persons. During the year another report was presented to the Metropolitan Asylums Board respecting return cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria by their Medical Investigator, Dr. F. M. Turner. The following summary gives the chief conclusions drawn by Dr. Turner from his investigations :— Summary on Return Cases of Scarlet Feyer and Diphtheria Notified for the Three Years, 1902, 1903, and 1904, by F. M. TURNER, M.D. The chief conclusions to be drawn from this investigation are:— 1. The alleged return cases include some coincidences as well as true cases, but the proportion of the former is small. Among scarlet fever outbreaks, arising after the discharge of scarlet fever cases, the proportion is probably less than 10 per cent. Among diphtheria outbreaks following diphtheria, and in out breaks where the diseases are different, the proportion is probably higher than in the former group. 2. The convalescent hospitals discharge fewer scarlet fever infecting cases in proportion than the acute hospitals. 3. Classification in scarlet fever has not yet caused any notable reduction in the infectivity rate. 37 4. In diphtheria cases, the adoption of routine bacteriological examination before discharge has not caused any reduction in the infectivity rate. 5. The connection between a high infectivity rate and the weather is not close enough to permit of any notable reduction of return cases by withholding the discharge of patients on bad days. 6. In regard to Group C—diphtheria following discharge of a scarlet fever case—it has been suggested that a routine examination of scarlet fever patients for diphtheria bacilli before discharge would abolish such outbreaks. In the light of the very inconclusive results obtained hitherto by bacteriology in reducing return diphtheria cases, I cannot recommend its adoption for scarlet fever. These conclusions as a whole are disappointing. Had a positive result been obtained in each of the above lines of inquiry, we might have hoped to adopt measures to seriously reduce the percentage of infecting cases discharged. The lower proportion at the convalescent hospitals i3 undoubted; and past experience leads to the hope that return cases might be reduced to about two-thirds or less of the present number by discharging all cases from the convalescent hospitals. The experience of the three years does not lead to any similar hope as regards further classification or bacteriological examination. It is true that classification has hardly had a fair trial, and other systems or a further trial of those already in use may give better results. I have to thank many of the Medical Officers in the Board's service for assistance in preparing this Report. I have also to acknowledge the help of Mr. Beresford, my clerk, in the tracing of cases and other portions of the work. January, 1906. 38 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—The number of cases of this disease notified during 1906 was 387, but of these, 49 diphtheria and 2 membranous croup cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from any infectious disease, so the genuine cases of diphtheria and membranous croup for the year is reduced to 336. This is equal to an attack rate of 1.4 per 1,000 living persons. This is a slight decline in the prevalence of the disease upon that during 1905, when the attack rate was 1.5 per 1,000 living persons. As may be seen from the Chart, the disease remained low, with small fluctuations, during the whole year. The following shows the distribution of diphtheritic disease in the various sub-districts of the Borough during 1906:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Diphtheria. 72 124 72 105 Do. do Membranous Croup. 1 6 1 6 Total attack rate per 1000. 1-3 2-4 1-2 1-8 It will be seen from the above, that diphtheritic disease was most prevalent in the Central sub-district and least in the SouthWest sub-district. Of the cases notified 322 were removed to Hospital. This is equal to 83 per cent. of the total notified. The deaths from diphtheria and membranous croup numbered 20 during the year. This is equal to 5.9 per cent. attacked, and 09 per 1,000 living persons. The death rate from diphtheritic disease for all London is .15 per 1,000 living persons. 39 During the year, 140 swabbings from the throats of persons suspected to be suffering from diphtheria were bacteriologically examined with the result that 48 gave positive, and 92 negative, results. Typhoid or Enteric Fever.—During the year 1906 there were 95 notifications of enteric or typhoid sent in, of these 11 cases were found not to be suffering from this or any other notifiable disease. This reduces the genuine cases of typhoid fever occurring in Hackney to 81. This is equivalent to an attack rate of .35 per 1,000 living. This rate is lower than that for the year 1905, the number of genuine cases during the latter year being 149, and the attack rate .65 per 1,000 living. The disease was prevalent in Hackney during the whole year but not in a very marked degree. There was the usual seasonal increase in the months of September, October and November, but the excess was not great. The following table gives the distribution of the cases in the sub-districts of the Borough. Sub-Districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Typhoid. 13 36 19 24 Attack rate per 1,000 living. 24 66 .31 .40 This table shows the incidence of the disease to be greater in the Central and South-East sub-districts than in the other sub-districts. Of the number notified 81 were removed to hospital. This is equal to nearly 90 per cent. of the total. 40 The deaths from enteric fever numbered 14, which is equal to an annual mortality rate of 17.2 per cent. attacked, and .06 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate of enteric fever for London for the same period is .06 per 1,000 living persons. During the year 13 specimens of blood from persons suspected1 to be suffering from enteric or typhoid fever were examined; of these 4 gave the reaction known as " Widal's." In the remainder the examination results were negative. I give below details of certain groups of secondary cases of typhoid fever which appear to me to have arisen from personal infection while nursed at home. Group 1.—Geo. V. H., aged 19 years, of 189, W. Eoad, fell ill on the 19th March with enteric fever, and was removed to hospital on the 30th March. During this time he was nursed at home. Percy H., aged 15 years, brother of the above and living in the same house, fell ill with enteric fever on 2nd April, and was removed to the fever hospital on the 9th April. Percy not only lived in the same house as George, but slept in the same room and shared the same bed. Group 2,—W. P., aged 34 years, of 5, C. Eoad, is said to have fallen ill with enteric fever on the 19th September, and was removed to the fever hospital on the 22nd September. At the same address a child of the above, age 2 years, died on the 20th September, from diarrhoea and vomiting. Mr. P. was by occupation a cellarman, and occupied with his wife and two children a tenement of two rooms. Group 3.—Thomas G., age 39 years, 14, C. Street, fell ill with enteric fever on or about the 27th August, and was removed to hospital on the 17th September. He was treated at home during this interval. On the 11th October W. G., son of the above, aged 10 years, was found to be suffering from enteric fever and removed 41 to the fever hospital the same day. These patients were members of a family consisting of two adults and two children, and belonging to the coster class. They occupied a tenement of three rooms. Group i.—Florence G., of 234, D. Road, age 35, fell ill with enteric fever about 28th September, and was removed to the fever hospital on the 10th October. George G., age 40 years, husband of above, is said to have fallen ill about 1st October from the same disease, and was removed to hospital on the 6th October. These two patients seem to have contracted the disease about the same time, or within a day or two. Enquiry as to the source of their illness reveals the fact that another lodger in the same house, a Mrs. B., had been suffering from diarrhoea for several weeks before the illness of Mr. and Mrs. G. These latter patients belong to a family consisting of father, mother and seven children. They occupied a tenement of three rooms. The father was a tram driver. Group 5.—Martha W., of 230, D. Road, age 12 years, fell ill on or about 29th September with enteric fever, and was removed to the fever hospital on the 10th October. On the 14 th October Rosie W., sister of above, fell ill with enteric fever, and was removed to hospital on the 25th October. On the 17th, Thomas W., father of the above patients, age 45 years, fell ill with enteric fever, and was removed to hospital on the 29th October. Louisa W., age 17 years, daughter of Thomas W., fell ill with enteric fever on the 23rd October, and was removed to hospital on the same date as her father, the 29th October. This family consists of eight members, six adults and two children, and they occupied a tenement of five rooms. Mr. W. was a dock labourer by occupation. In all of these groups of cases the more usual sources of infection were excluded. In three cases of enteric fever the patients had been away from home at different places out of London, and in all probability had become infected during their absence. One had been to Maldon in Essex, another at Southend, and the third at Folkestone. 42 Typhus.—One case only of this disease was notified during the year, which ultimately recovered. The source of infection could not definitely be determined, but at the time of the occurrence of this case others were observed in the Borough of Stepney. Continued Fever.—Under this name two cases of fever were notified, both of which recovered. Puerperal Fever.—Nineteen cases of puerperal fever were notified in the Borough during 1906, of which 9 were removed to hospital. The deaths numbered 9, which is equal to a death rate of 47 3 per cent, attacked. The attack rate per 1,000 births is 3'2 and the mortality per 1,000 births equals 1-5. Plague.—No case of this disease occurred in the Borough of Hackney during 1906. Erysipelas.—No less than 298 cases of erysipelas were notified during 1906, being equivalent to an attack rate of 1-2 per 1,000 living persons. Of the total cases notified 73 were removed to hospital, which is equivalent to over 24 per cent. Below is given the distribution of the disease in the several subdistricts of the Borough. Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Cases of Erysipelas. 44 55 49 150 Rate per 1,000 living. .8 1.0 .8 2.4 The deaths from this disease numbered 17. This is equivalent to an annual mortality of 5.7 per cent. attacked, and 0.7 per 1,000 living. 43 B. NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Influenza.—There were 21 deaths due to this cause in the Borough during 1906. This shows a decrease of 7 upon the number during the previous year, The mortality rate is equivalent to '09 per 1,000 living persons. That for all London—per 1,000 living persons. Chicken-Pox.—No deaths from this disease was registered in the Borough during 1906. Diarrhoea.—The deaths from diarrhoea during the year numbered 205. In addition there were 37 deaths due to enteritis. The mortality rate for the whole district from this disease is '89 per 1,000 living persons. The mortality rate for London for the same period is '94 per 1,000 living persons. The distribution of the deaths from diarrhoea is given below:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Diarrhoea. 32 60 51 62 Death-rate per 1,000 living. •6 1.1 •8 1.0 Measles.—.Judging from the deaths, this disease appears to have been less prevalent in the Borough during 1906 than during the previous year, the deaths in 1906 numbering 61, with a mortality rate of -26 per 1,000 living, against 74 deaths, with a mortality rate of -32 per 1,000 living in 1905. The following table gives the distribution of the deaths in the different sub-districts:— 44 Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Measles. 6 23 11 21 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. •11 •42 •18 •34 The mortality rate for the whole of London is -41 per 1,000 living persons. During the year under review information was received from the headmasters of elementary schools of 1,101 cases of measles either amongst scholars or at their homes. Whooping Cough.—The deaths from whooping cough in the Borough during 1906 numbered 34. This shows a decline in the deaths compared with the year 1905, the number occurring during the latter year being 64. The mortality rate for this disease for last year is -15 per 1,000 living, against a mortality rate of -28 per 1,000 living during 1905. The mortality rate for all London for 1906 was '26 per 1,000 living. The deaths were distributed in the Borough of Hackney in the following proportions :— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Whooping Cough. 4 5 11 14 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. •07 .09 •18 .23 45 Daring the year information was received from the headmasters of elementary schools in the Borough of the existence of 213 cases of whooping cough. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Tuberculosis.—During the year 1906, there were 415 deaths in the Borough due to tuberculous disease, they are classified as follows:— Tuberculous Phthisis 183 Phthisis 104 General Tuberculosis 45 Tuberculous Meningitis 38 ,, Peritonitis 16 Tabes Mesenterica 18 Tubercle of other Organs 10 Scrofula 1 415 The death rate for London for Phthisis is l-44 per 1,000 living. The annual mortality rate for the Borough is 1-7 per 1,000 living. The deaths are distributed in the different sub-districts in the following proportions:— Sub-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Tuberculous Disease. 69 94 135 117 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. 1.2 1.7 2.2 1.6 Early in the year a communication was received from the London County Council on the subject of the notification of phthisis, and asking " whether the Hackney Borough Council is of opinion (a) that phthisis should be declared under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to be a notifiable infectious disease, or, (b) that 46 the system of voluntary notification of the disease should be adopted throughout London." The Public Health Committee, to whom the matter was referred, reported in favour of adopting the system of voluntary notification of the disease in the Borough. This view was approved of by the Council, and from this date phthisis has been a voluntary notifiable disease in Hackney. The fee payable to the Medical Practitioner is the same as that for the other notifiable diseases. The first case was notified on the 9th June, 1906, and from that date to the end of the year 44 cases had been notified. The procedure adopted on notification is, if allowed by the patient, the occasional disinfection of dwelling, bedding and clothes, &c., giving instruction by means of a leaflet sent to the premises, describing the nature of the disease and the means to be adopted to prevent its spread. The result of voluntary notification of phthisis will, I believe, result in educating the public to know the real nature of this disease. During the year, 42 specimens of sputa from persons suspected to be suffering from phthisis were bacteriologically examined : in 10 of the specimens the examination gave positive; in 32, negative results. Cancer.—The number of deaths in Hackney due to this disease during 1906 was 175. This is 28 deaths less than the number dying from the same disease during 1905. The annual death rate is '75 per thousand living. The deaths were distributed in the sub-districts in the following proportions :— Sab-districts. North. Central. South-West. South-East. No. of Deaths from Cancerous Disease. 46 39 46 44 Mortality rate per 1,000 living. •85 •71 •75 •72 47 Below is given a table showing the number of deaths and death rates in this Borough during the ten years ending 1906:— Years. 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 | Borough of Hackney.

During 1906 there were 7 deaths due to acute alcoholic poisoning. In addition there were 36 deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, a disease in all probability caused in almost all cases by excessive continual indulgence in alcohol. VACCINATION. I give below a summary of the Vaccination Officer's returns for ths half year ending June 30th, 1906. During this period there were 2,970 births registered in the Borough, and of these 1,519 were successfully vaccinated. Of the remainder, certificates of conscientious objection were received in respect of 58 births, 321 died unvaccinated, the vaccination was postponed on a medical certificate in 68 cases, 746 removed to other districts or to unknown places, and 267 are entered as not being accounted for. After deducting the 321 which died unvaccinated from the total births, the successful vaccinations equalled 57 per cent, of the remaining births. This is much less than during the corresponding half-year of 1905. The proportion during this latter half-year was 66'4 per cent. 48 Return made on the 8th February, 1907, by the Vaccination Officers of the Hackney Union, respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in their Districts from 1st January to 30th June, 1906, inclusive. Registration Subdistricts comprised in the Vaccination Officer's District. 1 Number of Births returned in tbe " Birth List Sheets " as registered from 1st Jau. to 30th June, 1906. 2 Number of these Births duly entered by 31st January, 1907, in cols.

(a) Complaints of Nuisances.—During the year 1906 there were 1,968 complaints of nuisances received. Most of these, on investigation, were found to be due to some cause removable under the above Act. These complaints were investigated and dealt with by the respective Sanitary Inspectors of the various districts. (b) Infectious Disease.—There were 1,743 occupied dwellings inspected during the year in which notifiable infectious disease had occurred. Any nuisances discovered, although not necessarily related in the way of cause to the disease, were immediately brought to the notice of those persons responsible for their abatement. (c) House to House Inspections.—The inspections made during the year under this head numbered 1,325. This is an increase of 371 over the number in 1905, the inspections during this latter year having been 954. The largest number of inspections were made in the following localities, viz.: London Fields 186; Homerton 485; Kingsland 142; and in the High Hill Ferry District 125. These inspections were independent of inspections made in consequence of complaints or the occurrence of infectious disease. The nuisances found on inspection were abated in the majority of cases on the service of an Intimation Notice alone; 303 were abated on the service of both Intimation and Statutory Notices, and 30 required the issue of a summons to appear before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction before the nuisance was abated. The result of the prosecutions is given in the appendix to this report. The following details refer to the house-to-house inspections made during the year by the special Inspectors appointed for this purpose. 50 Details of house to house inspections made in the London Fields District during the year 1906 by Inspector Walter C.

In addition to these, 114 cocoa-nuts and two trunks of haddocks were surrendered and destroyed. DAIRIES, COW-SHEDS AND MILK-SHOPS. Cow-houses.—There are now 22 licensed cow-keepers in the Borough, with 31 cow-sheds. During the year one license for two sheds lapsed. The Inspector reports that he made 250 visits of inspection to these during the year, discovering defects in 4 instances. These defects were remedied by the service of a notice. On the 15th September, 1906, the Public Health Committee made an inspection of the cow-houses of the Borough. The 54 condition of the cow-houses was satisfactory in the majority of cases, but 3 were found to be dirty, 1 of which had an abnormal quantity of filth on the premises. In another instance, the yard paving was found defective. Dairies and Milk-shops.—During the year 1906, there were 24 milk places removed from the register and 30 added. At the end of the year there remained 368 milk places on the register. Two registered milk-sellers were summoned for using dirty milk utensils, each being fined £1 and ordered to pay £1 3s. costs. Three milk sellers were summoned for neglecting to register as milksellers ; one was ordered to pay Is. as fine and 2s. as costs, another £1 as fine and £1 3s. as costs ; the third summons was withdrawn. Inspector Bobbitt reports that he made 981 visits of inspection to these premises and discovered dirty utensils on 22 of these visits. A caution was sent to each of these latter sellers. Repairs were supervised by the Inspector in 18 dairies and 6 notices were served. Offensive Trades.—There is only one offensive trade now licensed in the Borough, and that is a tripe boiler. The Inspector made 15 visits to these premises during the year. Slaughter Houses.—There are 25 licensed slaughter-houses in the Borough, one having been removed from the register during the year. The number on the register at the end of 1905 was 26. The Inspector reports that he made 392 visits to these 25 slaughter-houses during the year. The Public Health Committee visited these slaughter-houses on the 15th September. In connection with one, the pound was found dirty, and in another case the slaughter-house was being used as a builder's yard. With these exceptions the slaughter-houses were found to be in a very satisfactory condition. 55 The following statement gives particulars as to the milk-places, cowsheds, slaughter-houses, aud offensive trades in the Borough.

These observations lasted from half-anhour upwards. The Intimation Notices served numbered 79, and the Statutory Notices 2 during the same period. Water Supply.—Sec. 48 (2) Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Under this section 28 certificates of proper and sufficient supply of water were issued under this section to owners of either new houses or houses rebuilt. The certificates refer to 90 houses and tenements. By-Laws for Houses let in Lodgings.—At the end of 1906 there were 463 houses let in lodgings on the Register, 12 only of which were unoccupied. During 1906 the whole of the registered houses were inspected, and below will be found a detailed account of the result of these inspections. During 1906 new By-laws for houses let in lodgings were drafted by the Borough Council and submitted for approval to the Local Government Board.

During the year 1906, applications were made to me by 52 owners of tenement properties to inspect their property, with a view to giving certificates that the tenements were so constructed " as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or " persons dwelling therein, and that due provision is made for their " sanitary requirements," for the purpose of obtaining exemption from Inhabited House Duty. The 52 applications had reference to 864 tenements. These I inspected and granted the required certificates, after the execution of any required alterations. CANAL BOATS ACT, 1877-1894. The Canal Boats Inspector of the Borough reports that he made 79 visits to the waterways in the Borough during the year, and inspected 81 canal boats. Amongst these he only found one infringnaent of the Regulations, i.e. the marking on the boat required by the Act was not legible. The remainder of the boats were found to be in good repair, clean and habitable. ICE CREAM VENDORS. During the year 1906, there were 158 premises inspected where ice creams were manufactured. The necessary cleansing, &c., was done on the service of intimation notices. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890-1903. During the year 1905, I represented the premises known as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, Queen's Court, to the Sanitary Authority as being unfit for habitation, and that negotiations had been opened between the owners of the property and the Sanitary Authority, to render the property fit for habitation. This was the position of affairs at the time of writing my annual report for 1905. Since then further progress has been made. The owners were informed that, in order to render the cottages habitable, it was necessary at least to make the following alterations :— 60 1. Provide through ventilation under ground room floors. 2. Provide through ventilation in living rooms. 3. The present w.c's. to be removed, and a w.c. provided for each cottage where it will not be a nuisance. 4. Provide water with sink &c., in each cottage. 5. Abate dampness of walls. 6. Eelay yard paving. The owners agreed to comply with these requirements, and to that end submitted the following specification of works to be executed on the property. The specification met with the approval of the Sanitary Authority. At the time of writing, the alterations are approaching completion. SPECIFICATION. April, 1906.

During the year one instance occurred where it was necessary to give notice to the occupier of a workshop that a certain place in which work was carried on in connection with such workshop was in such a condition as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the persons employed therein. The occupier of the workshop ceased to give out work to be done in this place. SECTIONS 109, 110, FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. No case occurred during the year requiring prosecution under Section 109, or an order to be served under Section 110. Several instances occurred where scarlet fever attacked children living in the same dwelling where wearing apparel was being made or altered, but immediately the diagnosis of scarlet fever was made, the case was removed to hospital and the premises disinfected. (See table of Cases of Scarlet Fever removed to Hospital, page 35.) SANITARY CONVENIENCES. SECTION 38, PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. The provision of suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences in Factories, Workshops and Workplaces in London is dealt with by Section (38), Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Here the local authority appears to be the sole judge of suitability and sufficiency, but on the question of the provision of separate sanitary conveniencies for both sexes in Factories, Workshops and Workplaces, 75 which is also dealt with in the same section, no discretion appears to be left with the local authority. This latter part of Section (38) would, I am of opinion, if literally and rigidly enforced in any London Borough,operate in certain cases severely upon a large class of small employers, without any corresponding health advantages. I can illustrate my meaning by quoting typical cases, drawn from inspection work in the Borough of Hackney. 1. Mr. L., Boot Manufacturer, lives in a house of 14 rooms, the two rooms in the basement constituting his workshop. He lets off two of the rooms of the house to a man and his wife. Besides himself he employs in his workshop two men and one woman. The only sanitary conveniences on the premises is one W.C., approached from the yard. Thus there is one W.C. for four men, three women and two children, of which the workpeople, two men and one woman, are on the premises only during working hours, while on the other hand, the male lodger and his wife are away from the premises during working hours. 2. Mr. S.,Boot Machinist, lives in a house of 12 rooms and a retail shop with his wife and two children. He reserves one room in the basement for his workshop, in which he employs one man and one woman, he of course working with them. Two rooms of the house are let out to a man and his wife, one of which rooms is used as a retail shop for provisions. The only sanitary accommodation on the premises is one W.C. Thus there is one W.C. for three men, three women and two children, one man and one woman being on the premises only during working hours. 3. Mr. M., Tailor, lives in a house of eight rooms and a retail shop, reserving one room on the ground floor as a workshop. Besides himself there is employed in the workshop two men and three women. Mr. M.'s family consists of his wife, a grown up daughter and three children. An additional man works in a retail shop, for which one room is reserved. The sanitary accommodation here is one W.C. for four men, five women and three children, but two men and three women are on the premises only during working hours. 76 The above cases represent a class of workshop of which there is a large number in the Borough of Hackney. They exhibit very very plainly some of the difficulties in the administration of those parts of the Factories and Workshops Acts relating to the provision of sanitary conveniences, especially having regard to the requirement of separate conveniences for the sexes. Is it reasonable or requisite to enforce separate accommodation when the number of a particular sex does not exceed those in the above quoted cases, the number of persons of the opposite sex being small also? If it is not reasonable or requisite, then—1st, a standard should either be fixed by law, i.e., it should be definitely laid down whether one, two or more females may, having regard to decency, use the same sanitary conveniences provided for males, where the number of males does not exceed a certain number; or one, two or more males may, under the same circumstances, use the sanitary conveniences provided for females. 2nd. Or the difficulty might be met by giving power to the local authority to exercise some discretion in this question of the separation of the sexes, the same as they may in regard to the sufficiency and suitability of sanitary accommodation for dwellings : and a strong argument for allowing such discretion may be found in the fact that we are really dealing in many instances with dwelling houses, a part of which is used as a workshop or workplace. 3rd. If neither of these suggestions is adopted, it should definitely be declared that separate accommodation must be provided even for a single male or a single female if employed with persons of the opposite sex. In many cases where employers of labour have been called upon to provide separate conveniences where one or two females have been employed with a larger number of males, and vice-versa, the employers have dismissed the females or males, retaining only persons of one sex in their employment. In other cases employers have made arrangements with the owners of neighbouring property for the sanitary conveniences there to be at their disposal for the use of the one or two males or females for whom no separate 77 accommodation is provided in connection with their workshop or workplace. The dismissal of workpeople as a result of the administration of the Factory and Workshops Acts is not desirable, nor calculated to make employers of labour sympathetic towards factory and workshop legislation; but is calculated to provoke a sense of injury, and opposition to workshop legislation. Is the latter arrangement satisfactory? In many cases I think it is an arrangement which in practice does not work well. To those who would force all small workshops in private dwellings to close, and drive all labour into large factories or workshops the above suggestions (1 and 2) would be condemned; for, obviously, the way to bring such a condition about is to make the lot of the small employer of labour as hard as possible, and no more effectual means exists than to press literally upon him the various sections of the Factory and Workshops Acts, but I am of opinion that to bring about such a result would be lamentable, and here draw attention to the subject of separate sanitary conveniences, with the hope that the Home Office will deal with this aspect of the question. Ventilation and Heating.—To see that workshops shall be provided with adequate means of ventilation, and that such ventilation shall be maintained is the duty of the local authority; to see that a proper degree of temperature is maintained is the duty of the Home Office through their Inspectors. Now the ventilation and heating of a building are so interdependent that the two matters cannot satisfactorily be separated and dealt with by two authorities. I am of opinion that that part of the Factory and Workshop Act dealing with the heating of workshops should be handed over to the local authority, or that dealing with ventilation should also be administered by the Home Office. The present system is altogether unsatisfactory, and produces needless friction between the officers of the two authorities, and is also needlessly worrying to employers of labour. 78 DISINFECTION. (a) Rooms.—During the year 1906 there were 2,154 rooms fumigated, and 845 rooms cleansed by the Staff of the Public Health Department. Amongst this number is included the disinfection after cases of phthisis, measles and whooping cough. The disinfection and cleansing done each month of the year is set out in the following table. Number of Rooms Fumigated and Cleansed each Month during 1906. Month. Rooms Fumigated. Rooms Cleansed. Remarks. January 174 80 The method of fumigation is by burning sulphur. After fumigation the rooms to be cleansed are stripped of their wall-paper and cleansed with a solution of carbolic. The ceilings are afterwards whitened.

This total consisted of 26 men, 37 women, and 51 children, and shows an increase of 21 persons upon the number admitted during 1905. The total cost for maintenance during their residence at the shelter was £15 4s. 9d. The average period of stay was 2.2 days. The table on page 86 gives further particulars concerning these contacts.

During the year 1906 the facilities for cleansing provided by the Borough Council under the above Act were utilised to a greater extent. The total number of persons bathed and cleansed during that year was 330. This is an excess of 89 on the number for 1905. In connection with this effort to deal with parasitic skin disease, it is very desirable that some effort should be made to combat the parasite causing ring.worm. The most recent and effectual mode of dealing with this filth disease is the application of the X.rays. Our disinfection station seems specially adapted to meet this need. The initial expense of an X.ray apparatus would be very small, and the results would be incalculably valuable. 88 The following table gives particulars of the number, &c., of persons who were bathed and cleansed for parasitic disease at the disinfecting station during the year:— Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Totals.

During the year 1906 there were 37,962 tons 11 cwts. 2 qrs. of house refuse removed from dwellings in the Borough, and conveyed for destruction to the Borough Destructor. From the Northern Division 17,026 tons 11 cwts. 1 qr. and 7 lbs. were removed, and from the Southern Division 20,936 tons and 21 lbs. The total cost for the removal of house refuse during the year is £7,962 l1s. 9d. The quantity of refuse removed during 1905 was 37,953 tons 5 cwts. and 3 qrs. at a total cost of £8,010 0s. 5d. The figures for 1906 therefore show an increase of about 9½ tons in the amount of refuse removed with a decrease in the cost of £47 8s. 8d. This decreased cost is due to the fact that at the beginning of April, 1906, the contractor for the Northern Division reduced his price for the removal of refuse 1d. per ton. The cost of the destruction of house refuse for 1906, including the cost of disposal of residue and clinker, etc., has been estimated by the Electrical Engineer to the Borough at £6,722 8s. 5d., at a rate of 3s. 6½d. per ton, therefore the total cost for removal and disposal of house refuse for the year is £14,685 0s. 2d., which works out at a rate of 7s. 6¾d. per ton for the Northern Division, and 7s. l0½d. per ton for the Southern Division. Distributing the total cost over the whole population of the Borough, it amounts to 1s. 3¼d. per head. CD to DUSTING ACCOUNT, 1906. Month. Northern Division. Southern Division. Totals. Weight. Cost.

Subject to the provisions of these by-laws, the landlord of a lodging-house shall, in the month of April, May or June in every year, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed. 108 Subject, as aforesaid, the landlord of a lodging-house shall, in the same period, except in such cases as are hereinafter specified in this by-law, cause every area, the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every water-closet belonging to the premises, and the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every room, staircase, and passage in the house to be thoroughly lime-washed, in every case where lime-washing is necessary for effective cleansing. Subject, as aforesaid, where the internal surface of the rooms, staircases and passages, in a lodging-house or of any part thereof is painted or where the material of or with which such surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or not necessary for effective cleansing, the landlord shall in the same period aforesaid cause such surface to be thoroughly cleansed and the paint or other covering thereof to be renewed if the renewal thereof shall be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. Provided always that where such cleansing or lime-washing or removal of paint as is hereinbefore prescribed shall have been duly carried out at any time within three months prior to the months aforesaid, nothing in the said by-law contained shall be deemed to require such cleansing, lime-washing, or removal of paint in any of the months aforesaid save in so far as the same shall be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 18. Subject to the provisions of these by-laws the landlord of a lodging-house shall provide adequate means of ventilation in or in connection with every room, landing, passage and staircase in such house, and shall from time to time repair and renew the same when necessary, and the tenant of a lodging-house shall, subject to the provisions of these by-laws cause such means of ventilation in any room occupied by him and in any common passage and staircase in such house to be maintained at all times in good order. 109 19. A lodger in a lodging-house shall cause all such means of ventilation as may be provided in or in connection with any room in such house in his occupation and in or in connection with any staircase, landing or passage therein, to the exclusive use of which he is entitled, to be maintained at all times in good order. 20. Where a duty imposed upon or a prohibition applied to the landlord or the tenant of a lodging-house, as the case may be, is by any by-law expressly imposed or applied, subject to the provisions of these by-laws, proceedings shall not be taken against the landlord or the tenant for an offence against the by-law unless and until the landlord or the tenant after service upon him of a notice in writing by the Council requiring him within such reasonable time as is specified in the notice to comply with the by-law has failed to comply with the by-law within the time so specified. Penalties. 21. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing by-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after failure to comply with a written notice of the offence from the Council. Provided, nevertheless, that the Justices or Court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this by-law. Repeal of By-laws. 22. From and after the date of the confirmation of these by-laws, all by-laws with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by 110 members of more than one family previously in force in the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney shall be repealed.

Mumps.—This is a very infectious disease, attacking children usually at school ages. It may occur at any time of the year, but at certain seasons, particularly in the spring and autumn, the number of cases increases very rapidly, sometimes assuming the features of a widespread epidemic. It attacks males rather more frequently than females, and has a tendency to spread very rapidly in schools and similar institutions. The disease is not regarded as very dangerous to life, but complications may occur during the course of the disease which may seriously impair health for a considerable time or may lead to a fatal issue. Owing to its frequent occurrence amongst school children, mumps may seriously interfere with school education. It is therefore desirable, both for the maintenance of the child's health as well as to prevent interference with school education, that parents and those in charge of children should learn something as to the nature of this disease and the measures which should be adopted to prevent its spread. Symptoms.—A child will not usually show any sign of having been infected until two or three weeks after exposure to infection. This period is known as the incubation period. The first symptom to show itself is feverishness, which is usually slight but may be severe. At the same time the child complains of pain just below the ear on one side. Here a slight swelling appears which gradually increases in size, extending over the side of the cheek and neck. The other side of the neck and face is usually affected in the same way after a 112 day or two. The swelling is due to an inflammation of a gland, known as the parotid salivary gland, which is situated on each side of the neck just below the ear. The swelling causes great inconvenience to patients, especially in attempting to take food, for it is difficult to open the mouth when the disease is at all severe. There may not be much pain, but there is an unpleasant feeling and tightness about the neck. Earache, with inflammation of the interior of the ear may be present. In very severe cases the fever is very high and the patient may even be delirious. Various complications may arise in the course of the disease which may either lead to a fatal result or much subsequent ill-health. The disease is one in which relapses are of frequent occurrence. 113 MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF MUMPS. 1. As soon as there is any suspicion of a child sickening for mumps it should be removed to a warm, well ventilated room, free from draughts, apart from the remainder of the household, from which all unnecessary clothings, hangings, carpets, etc., have been removed. 2. The washable clothings and bedding, and the towels used by the patient should, before removal from the bedroom, be placed in a tub of water to which some disinfectant has been added. Cups, saucers, spoons, etc., should be scalded before being used by others. 3. Persons attending upon a child ill from mumps should wash their hands before leaving the sick room and associating with others. 4. After recovery, the room, bedding, clothes, etc., used by the patient should be well disinfected before being used again, and this will be done free of charge on application to the Public Health Department, either by the Medical Attendant or person in charge of a case of mumps. 5. No child should be allowed to go to school from a house in which there is a case of mumps until the complete recovery of the patient, and the disinfection of the house, etc. 6. No child should be allowed to attend school who has been exposed to the infection of mumps until 25 days after exposure, and not even then if there are signs of the disease having been contracted. J.
