August, 1952 To the Chairmen and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am glad to be able to report that the district has not suffered from any serious epidemic during this year, but the incidence of measles has risen very considerably (as recorded on page 7). This is probably due to the fact that in this year there were a great number of children who were susceptible to the disease, not having been protected by a previous attack. The Registrar General's statistics shown on pages 4 and 5 show a further rise in the total population to 69,640, on which figure the Birth and Death Rates have been calculated. The Crude Birth Rate shows a slight decrease from the previous year, but the total Death Rate shows a slight increase. The infantile mortality rate, however, shows a distinct decrease from that of 1950. During April, seventeen smallpox contacts from the Steamship "Ranchi" were notified to me by the Port of London Authority. These contacts were kept under supervision for 18 days and I am pleased to report that none of these contacts developed the disease. 2 From the 16th to 21st April, the department held a "Clean Food" Exhibition in Ruislip Manor which was opened by the Chairman of the Council, Mr. Councillor W.L. Carr, L.R.I.B.A., J.P., and proved a distinct success judging by the number of visitors who attended. My thanks are due to the staff of my department for the excellent exhibits which they displayed in a very limited space (see page 24). The Mass X-Ray Unit of the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board operated this year for the first time in three separate localities in the district, which proved an eminently satisfactory arrangement (see page 7). Action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948 was taken in respect of one aged and infirm person and her removal to Redhill Hospital was secured (see page 12). Drinking Water and Swimming Baths. Samples taken throughout the year proved eminently satisfactory. In my opinion the health of the population as a whole maintained a high level due in no small measure to the constant vigilance and attention to detail of all the members of the staff of this department to whom I extend my sincere thanks. I am, Your obedient Servant, L. D. BAILEY, Medical Officer of Health. 3 POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the mid-year:— 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 64,590 64,270 66,010 67,090 69,640 Population Census, 1951 (February)—68,274 Number of Inhabited dwellings: 19,865 BIRTH RATE 1950 1951 Basis No. of Births Birth Rate No. of Births Birth Rate M.
