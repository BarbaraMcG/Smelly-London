St. Sabiour's District Board of Works. REPORT OP PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR 1874-75, and REPORTS of THE MEDICAL OFFICER, ANALYST, AND SURVEYOR; Also Accounts in Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board during the same period. Printed in accordance with section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. In February last, the Board advertized for fresh Contracts for Cleansing the Streets and Collection of Dust and Refuse during a period of three years from the 1st June, 1875; those entered into in the previous year expiring at that time; and Tenders were received from various Contractors for the execution of the work, the lowest being from Messrs. Edmund Reddin & Co. for Cleansing or Scavenging, and Mr. Jacob P. Batch for Dusting, viz.:— SCAVENGING. Roadways only £1,040 per Annum. St. Saviour's Roadways and Footways 1,190 ,, ,, Roadways only 960 ,, ,, Chirstchurch Roadways and Footways 1,110 „ „ DUSTING. Whole District £1,250 per Annum. Cleansing, Dusting, and Watering. 4 On receipt of the above-mentioned Tenders, the Board thought it advisable to dispense "with the Cleansing of Footways; the experiment of so doing during the previous three years not having proved satisfactory, and it was resolved to accept the Tenders for Roadways only, at the above rates, as also the Tender of Mr. Batch for Dusting, and Contracts were shortly afterwards entered into accordingly. Contracts have also been entered into with Messrs. Reddin & Co. for continuing the supply of water-carts, &c. for watering the roads, on the same terms as last year, viz., 9s. 6d. per diem for each cart required, the Contractors finding the necessary men and horses. improvements. In order to effect a very desirable improvement at the NorthWest corner of Broadwall, the Board has purchased, for the sum of £1000, the copyhold messuages and premises, Nos. 110 and 112, Broadwall, and is now in treaty for the enfranchisement of the same. So soon as possession can be obtained of the premises, it is intended to have them taken down, and the corner rounded off in accordance with a plan which has been submitted to and approved by the Metropolitan Board of "Works, who have consented to contribute £450 towards the cost of the improvement, and it is hoped that a further portion of the expense will be retrieved by sale of the surplus land. In connection with this improvement the Trustees of the Peabody Estates have, in consideration of the benefit which they will derive, dedicated a small strip of land in Roupell Street to the widening of the public footpath in front of their buildings in that Street. A further improvement has been effected by the setting back of the "Smith's Arms" public house in Park Street to the line of the adjoining buildings on the East side, and the dedication of the strip of land in front thereof to public use, in consideration of which, this Board has paid the freeholder £40. Towards this cost it is expected the Metropolitan Board will contribute £20. Street Nomenature and umbering. In accordance with the expressed desire of inhabitants of Holland Street, Blackfriars Road, this Board, in the early part of 5 last year, applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works for authority to abolish the name of Green Walk as applied to the short thoroughfare connecting Holland Street with Southwark Street, and to incorporate the same with Holland Street under the latter name, in order to relieve Holland Street as much as possible from its position of isolation and obscurity resulting from the western entrance or mouth of the Street in the Blackfriars Road having been permanently closed by the works of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company; and, in August last, the necessary authority having been obtained, the alterations in name and numbering were effected. About the same time an Order was received for continuing the numbering of premises in Southwark Street to the western extremity thereof, which hitherto had remained in abeyance in consequence of the non-appropriation of Sites; and this also has been carried out. The Board has given permission to the promoters of Cabmen's "Shelters" to place a "Shelter" at the Cab-stand in Southwark Street, and another at the Cab-stand near the Bridge-end of the Blackfriars Road. Cabmen's Shelters. The attention of this Board having been called by the Board of Works for the Westminster District and other Boards and Vestries of the Metropolis to the large and increasing expenditure of the School Board for London, this Board, in April last, appointed three of its Members, viz.,—Mr. Cozens, Mr. Chappell, and Mr. Dunn, as delegates, to confer with the other local authorities on this important question, and a deputation has lately waited upon Lord Sandon and the Duke of Richmond upon the subject. School Board Policy and Expenditure The Board regret to announce the decease of their Colleagues, Mr. "William Allan, Mr. Henry Prince, and Mr. John Castle, who had long been associated with them as Members of the Board; and also, on the 6th April last, of Mr. Herbert Sturmy, who, from the commencement of the Board and until his retirement at Lady-day, 1874, had filled the Office of Clerk and Solicitor of the Board.

Gentlemen, In pursuance of the duty which annually devolves upon me, I have the pleasure, for the nineteenth time, to present a short review of the sanitary condition of the Saint Saviour's District, and the work accomplished during the year 1874. The recurrence of this obligation has, on almost every occasion, afforded me satisfaction and pleasure. As the death rate is the principal safe and approximate indication of the general healthiness of the inhabitants, it is interesting and encouraging to observe, from the statistics which I now place before you, that the mortality from all causes is less, and from Epidemic diseases is not greater than in the year preceding. The total mortality of the District was 727 persons. Of this number 104 Deaths were due to Zymotic disease, and the remaining 623 to all other causes combined. In this latter category, a large number suffered and died from diseases to which the nature of our climate renders the human frame peculiarly susceptible, such as Phthisis, Bronchitis, and other complaints by which the respiratory system is liable to be permanently, and too often fatally, affected. The severe cold of the last six weeks of the year considerably increased the death rate of London among the extremes of age— the very aged and the very young; but in your District the difference in the last did not in any marked degree exceed the average of the three preceding quarters. Of the 104 persons who succumbcd to Epidemic disease during the year, there died from Pyœmia 5 Infantile Ecver 1 Erysipelas 1 Diphtheria 2 Measles 8 Whooping Cough 11 Scarlet Fever19 Diarrhœa 34 Typhus and Typhoid 7 Syphilis 6 Rheumatic Fever 2 Croup 8 In the Workhouse no Death was recorded as the result of Zymotic disease. Of the mortality of the remaining 623, 10 persons were registered in Guy's Hospital who previously resided outside the DistrictThere were 42 Coroner's Inquisitions: in the Parish of Christchurch 33, and in Saint Saviour 9. A large proportion of these Deaths was due to violent, accidental, and sudden causes, which could 8 not have been avoided by the application of sanitary laws and regulations. The total mortality of the past year was 32 less than in the year 1873; and, as the death rate from Epidemics was equal, the diminution is due to other forms of disease. The records exhibit an increase respectively of 3 from Pyoemia, 14 from Scarlet Fever, 5 from Typhus and Typhoid, 2 from Rheumatic Fever, 1 from Infantile Fever, 4 from Syphilis, and 6 from Croup. The decrease is accounted for by 3 from Erysipelas, 22 from Measles, 1 from Diphtheria, 6 from Whooping Cough, 2 from Diarrhoea, and 1 from Dysentery. Throughout the country the death rate from Scarlet Fever was exceptionally high; and although the Tables which are before you give an increase in the Saint Saviour's District, yet a comparison with other localities is highly favorable; and the diminution from Measles and Whooping Cough is in strongly-marked contrast—the death rate in all England being equal to the average—while in this locality it was considerably lower. In the south-east of the Metropolis the fatal cases of Diphtheria were excessive, but in this sub-division only two Deaths were registered, and from Small Pox none. The mortality from Scarlet Fever was less than one-half the estimate per 1000 of persons living in the remaining parts of England. Of the total already given, 73 persons died in the Workhouse during the year—47 of these were between the ages of 60 and 80 years, and 10 upwards of 80. In the whole District the mortality among Children under 1 year was 188, and of Adults 137 between the ages of 60 and 80, and between 80 and 100 years 26. The registered ages of this latter class were equal to an aggregate of 2194 years, or an average of 84½ years to each individual. As I have, during the past year, kept a technical weekly record of the cause of death in every instance, if it would have served any useful purpose, an exact summary of every disease resulting in death might easily have been furnished. As such an amplification would probably neither prove serviceable nor intelligible to the general public, I have tabulated only those causes which are to some extent preventable by such measures as Sanitary Boards possess the power to adopt. In 1874 there was a diminution of 81 Deaths upon the average of 10 preceding years, and 70 fewer than the average of 3 years subsequent to the return of the population, as certified by the Registrar-General after the census of 1871. 9 The number of Births was 1044, being 317 in excess of the registered Deaths. Since the enumeration of 1871, the total difference in excess amounts to 1297, which gives an estimated increase of that number to the population. I have been somewhat more minute in these estimates and comparisons than usual, because old objections to population, as adopted by the Registrar-General, the Government, and Statisticians, as a basis for calculations and inferences, in reference to health and disease, have recently been reiterated by Medical Officers of Health, influential and respected in their profession. It is self-evident that no calculation of a cotemporary population can be more than approximately correct; and this, and similar Local Boards, aided by the returns of their Officers, are for all practical purposes sufficiently qualified by their position to form a just estimate of the influence of disturbing causes upon the diminution or increase of the resident inhabitants at any given period. I trust that a careful consideration of the facts thus adduced will lead to the conviction that, on the whole, the state of the District is as satisfactory as could have been anticipated, in view of the limited resources of Local Boards, and the restricted powers conferred upon them. Upon a recent retrospection, I found that the number of cases involving active operations, including the demolition, repairs and cleansing of houses, disinfecting bedding, providing proper closet accommodation, &c., amounted to about 7000, since the establishment of this Board. This estimate is of course exclusive of a very much larger number of other Sanitary works performed—such as periodical inspections, attention to dust complaints, and all those minor matters which demand unremitting attention. It must be apparent to all who are able, from a connection with this Board, to look back over so long a period as nineteen years, that many important and beneficial changes have occurred. Dwellings unfit for human habitation have been cleared away; streets formed and improved; almshouses, and baths and wash-houses erected; disinfecting stations established; churchyards improved and beautified; a new system of sewers completed; the river at the northern boundary considerably purified; hydrants, giving a continuous supply of water, set up in places where formerly the supply was irregular and intermittent; and commodious and healthy schoolrooms erected. Of course all these altered circumstances are not regarded as due exclusively to the action of the Central and the Saint Saviour's B 10 Board, but they may claim a share to an extent perhaps not readily realised; and it is satisfactory to know that all has resulted from a prevailing public desire for the progress of moral and physical improvement. I venture also, from experience in this District, to express my conviction, that with much still to be deplored in the character and habits of the inhabitants detrimental to their health and morals, some good progress is observable; and to hope that the beneficial effects of the gradual improvement of dwellings, and a more systematic course of education, will in a few years be such as to justify the expectations of those by whom these social reforms have been so strenuously and persistently advocated. The domestic legislation of the past few years has impelled statesmen and philanthropists of all classes to demand and press forward further measures intended to benefit the great mass of the people. A general recognition of the necessity for purer and a more constant supply of water; dwellings better adapted to the condition and requirements of the poor; open spaces for healthy recreation; extended and improved education, and other schemes for ensuring the health and advancing the happiness of all—proving that "the brotherhood of man" is not a mere sentimental phrase, but an important and accepted truth, calling for practical exemplification. During the last Session of Parliament an Act was passed more effectually to secure the health of the Metropolis, by improving the supervision of Slaughter-houses, and businesses of a kindred character. The Metropolitan Board, which is constituted the "local authority" of the Metropolis by this Act, and empowered to make bye-laws, has issued four sets of regulations for the conduct of the business of Slaughter-houses for Cattle to be used as butchers' meat, Tripe Dressers, Horse Slaughterers, Blood and Bone Merchants, and Soap and Tallow Melters. Of these four sets of rules, that relating to premises for the Slaughter of Cattle to be used as butchers' meat is at present alone applicable to this District. This document comprises 22 bye-laws of a somewhat stringent character; but the sanction of the Local Government Board is necessary before they can be legally acted upon. "When this is granted, proper measures will be at once taken to secure a prompt compliance with the requirements set forth. It is probable that the first attempts for the enforcement of these regulations may encounter some opposition, but when those affected become convinced of their necessity for the public good, willing acquiescence will doubtless follow. 11 I am indebted to Professor Frankland for the information upon which the following observations relative to the water supply of London is founded. It appears that the purest source is that of the Kent Company. This deep well water maintains an almost uniform temperature throughout the year, and having undergone natural filtration before its delivery, is uniformly clear and transparent. Taking the water of this Company, therefore, for a standard of comparison, as unity, the following table will exhibit the average proportion of organic impurity in the remaining seven Metropolitan Companies, whose sources are the Thames and the Lea, viz.:— Kent 1.0 New River 1.5 East London 2.7 West Middlesex 3.0 Southwark 3.3 Grand Junction 3.3 Lambeth 3.4 Chelsea 3.7 Notwithstanding this result, so unfavorable to the Thames and the Lea, it must be observed that these rivers are as pure at their source as the wells of Kent, but become contaminated by the sewerage and washings of cultivated lands on their downward course. As Professor Frankland pertinently remarks—"This impurity is composed of a great many substances, some of which are organic and very objectionable, and at times eminently noxious, and others are entirely or comparatively harmless." The pollutions of the Thames and the Lea are very largely of animal origin; and by the application of the microscope to the sediment deposited by turbid water, out of twelve examinations during the year 1874, living and moving organisms were observed in the Southwark Company's water five times, and in that of the Lambeth Company four. The water of the Thames has undergone but slight deterioration during the year, and it may be hoped that tho progressive increase of impurity, which occurred in the three preceding years, is now effectually checked. This is undoubtedly attributable to an improved sewerage, and proves that much may yet be done still further to purify the water supplies. But the mode of receiving the supplies is of almost equal importance in a sanitary point of view, as the purity of the water when delivered from the mains. An examination of the tanks and b 2 12 butts of London would, in numerous instances, reveal an amount of pollution and danger, to many almost incredible; and until this Metropolis enjoys the boon of a continuous and direct supply, a much larger amount of benefit in this direction can scarcely be anticipated. The experiment has been successfully tried in some large towns where the water has since been purer, and the consumption considerably less. Although no town nor city can vie with London in magnitude, it is impossible to conceive that the abolition of a system of intermittent supply is an achievement beyond the power of intelligent, scientific, and humane citizens to accomplish. I conclude by commending the accompanying Tables to you for perusal and consideration. You will observe that the Inspector of Nuisances has been zealously at work during the year in guarding against the encroachment of disease by removing its causes. As to myself, I will simply acknowledge, that if any improvement in the health and comfort of the inhabitants of this District has accrued from the little I have been able to accomplish, the credit is chiefly due to the kind support and hearty co-operation of the Members of this Board and its Officers.

Gentlemen, I take the opportunity, in presenting my First Annual Report, of thanking you for the honor you have done in selecting me as your Analyst, and to assure you of my intention to deserve your confidence. Since my appointment as successor to Dr. Bianchi, I have received every assistance from that gentleman; the interregnum between his cessation from, and my commencing the office of Analyst, proving very distinctly the absolute need for looking after the food of the people. Adulteration, in the case of Milk, had greatly increased, and it has taken some months to convince many of the vendors that your Board is thoroughly in earnest in putting down the practice. Since executing my office, practically within the last nine months, your Inspector, Mr. Errington, has brought me 128 samples. Milk takes the first place as an article of food, and I am bound to say that I have met with an amount of adulteration quite beyond my experience as a Public Analyst. "What is to be said of a Milk (No. 59) having the following composition ?— Sp. Gr. 1.014 Total Solids 5.73 "Water 94.27 Pat 1.58 Solids, not fat 4.15 100.00 Ash 0.47 Salt in Ash 0.23 Here we have a Milk watered to the extent of 54 per cent., and salted in order to cover its poverty. Surely it is not too much to assert that, owing to the injury to infant life from the administration of such Milks as Nos. 20, 24, 39, 56, 59, 70, 71, 75, 88, and 93, the vendors stand forth in their relation to the public as slow poisoners. 18 There is the less excuse in the case of Milk, because the lactometer tells a story, which, although not the whole truth, would afford a means of judging very fairly. It is true that a low specific gravity may bo the indication of a Milk very rich in cream, but this can generally be ascertained by the eye, and also by the creamometer. It is a very common opinion that the low specific gravity of a Milk is often occasioned by frequent dipping. Now the very contrary is the case. But, as this opinion has been freely given in Court, it may be as well to give it a decided contradiction. I have already stated that I have made 128 analyses, and of these 91 were of Milks. Every analysis of an adulterated Milk has been made in duplicate. Although this practice greatly increases the labors of the Analyst, it is the more fair to the defendant, as it is impossible quite correctly to estimate the fat after the Milk has become sour, and as the proportion of the water suffers an increase, the greater, according to the inferiority of tho Milk. According to my experience the quantity, of ash, and its nature, are amongst the very best tests of the quality of a Milk. Dividing my experience as your Analyst into the three periods of Michaelmas, Christmas, and Lady-day, the percentage of adulterations would stand as follows:— percentage of adulterations. In the first period 48 In the second period 45 In tho third period 11 As it may be a matter of interest to the parishioners to know the number of cases taken into Court, the convictions obtained, and tho amount of fines inflicted, I subjoin the following account. Twenty-two persons were summoned for adulterating Milk. One, who had assaulted the Inspector, disappeared from the district; another, a very poor woman, was dismissed with a severe caution; the other twenty were convicted, and mulcted in the sum of £84 6s. 6d. Were I to include No. 129, which was also taken in the month of March, the fines and costs would amount together to £104 17s Under the new Act these fines would be paid to the Parish. This, then, is the practical result of nine months' 19 working of the Act, as regards the cases magisterially decided. As many as twenty-one cases of adulteration were, however, detected in the first quarter; but in every instance you were lenient enough to allow a warning to be given on the first detection of adulteration, so that the prosecutions only represent a second offence; and thus, some of the grossest offenders have escaped. Whatever, then, may be the opinion of outsiders, no parishioner will be able to say that the Act has been too severely construed by their representatives in the Yestry. It may not be out of place to mention that Mr. Errington, on one occasion, took six samples of Milk on a Sunday. This was for the purpose of testing whether the sanctity of the day had any effect upon the morality of the vendors, or whether it offered complete immunity. Of the six samples, four were adulterated with water, one was skimmed, and one was genuine. I say one was genuine. And here I would wish to do justice to many of the vendors. Some of the Milks sold in the parish are of admirable quality. The following analysis is only a fair illustration:— Sp. Gr. 1.033. Total Solids 13.02 Water 86.98 Tat 3.77 Solids,* not fat 9.25 100.00 *Ash 0.75 Salt in Ash 0.11 In calling attention to the adulteration of Milk by water, I have not given any account of adulteration by abstraction. No. 109 is one of the worst of these cases, as the fat amounts only to 0.39 per cent. Here we have a Milk sold at the rate of fivepence per quart, that ought to have been sold as mere skim milk, and is of less value than an ordinary Milk adulterated with 15 per cent. of water. It will be interesting to see what the new Act will do for us. The eight samples of Bread, and two of Flour, I found to be 20 genuine. I would, however, strongly advise the addition of a sufficiency of salt to the dough. No. 14 only contains 0.09 per cent. instead of 0.5 or ½ per cent. When we remember that bread is the staple food of children, it is the more necessary that we should not leave them the option of taking or refusing so essential an element of healthy life. So far, I have only examined four specimens of Butted., and one of these was adulterated. Lemonades, two in number, were of fair quality, and well aerated. A sample of Ginger Beer contained a distinct trace of lead. The mode of cleansing bottles with shot, especially wine bottles, is very objectionable; and lead will be found more frequently in wines than in any other beverage. Of Alcoholic Drinks I have but little to report. A sample of Porter was very good. The Wine,—a cheap "Port,"—contained 32 per cent. of proof spirit, and was "plastered" as much as any ordinary Sherry. Tea, for obvious reasons, has not been looked into. One sample was of common quality, but genuine. The leaves were indeed much broken, and I found no less than 13 per cent. of twigs. It was a fair illustration of the want of instruction on the part of the Public, as an educated eye would at once have rejected it. If a Museum of common things were attached to every Board-school, it would prove of very great advantage to the rising generation. I have also analyzed some infused Coffee as sold in the streets, and, except as to the poverty of tho Milk, I found it as good as that which is retailed at the Crystal Palace. A Cocoa was especially rich in Sugar and Starch, and contained very little Cocoa; but, as it was sold as "Prepared Cocoa," I can assert that it answered to its title. The Mustards (2), Vinegars (3), and Pickles (4), were of fair quality. One Pickle, No. 26, contained a trace of Copper, but not in quantity to be more than an accident. Lastly, samples respectively of Arrowroot (2), Pepper, Cake, and Sweets, have been examined without much result. In bringing my Report to a conclusion, I would express my conviction that the system of adulteration is not nearly so extensive 21 as in the days gone by. The drink of the people, will, however, require constantly looking after, whether it he in the form of Milk, Beer, Wine, or Spirit. As long as the seasons are fine, there is no reason for the introduction of Alum into Bread, and the practice has, for the present at least, gone out of fashion. Saccharine food will require occasional examination, as, in the form of Jam, it is more and more likely to compete with Butter. The number of analyses made by me will be found greatly to exceed the requirements of my office, and I trust I may be allowed to diminish them in my second year. I may further express a hope that my work has given general satisfaction. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT JAMES BERNAYS.
