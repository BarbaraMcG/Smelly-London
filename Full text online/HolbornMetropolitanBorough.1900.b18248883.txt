REPORT relating to the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the Area of the Holborn District Board of Works; of the Holborn Sub-District, now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn; and of the Parish of St. Sepulchre Without and the Liberty of Glasshouse Yard, now in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31st DECEMBER, 1900. To the Mayors, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Boroughs of Holborn and Finsbury. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report for the year ending December 31st, 1900. The year has been a very memorable one on account of the changes under the London Government Act, 1899; the new Metropolitan Boroughs coming into existence on the 9th November, 1900.

Holborn District Board of Works 25.3 Holborn Sub-District of Holborn Borough 25.5 St. Sepulchre 25.0 Glasshouse Yard 9.4 The birth-rate for the Holborn District in the preceding year was 24.4 per 1,000. The number of births registered in London was 130,868, giving a rate of 28.6 per 1,000 of the population, the lowest London birth-rate recorded. The number in England and Wales was 926,304 or a birth-rate of 28.9. The excess of births over deaths was 338,845. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATES. The number of deaths in the following Holborn District and Sub-Districts after making the usual corrections (i.e. excluding those of persons who died in Public Institutions, who did not belong to the District, and including those of persons, who belong to the District but died in Public Institutions outside the District) were:- Holborn District Board of Works 749 Holborn Sub-District of the Borough 707 St. Sepulchre 31 Glasshouse Yard 11 and the following were the corrected death-rates per 1,000 of the population:- Holborn District Board of Works 25.5 Holborn Sub-District of the Borough 25.7 St. Sepulchre 20.4 Glasshouse Yard 17.3 The rate for the Holborn District for the preceding year was 24.1. In London the corrected number of deaths was 86,007 equal to an annual death-rate of 18.3 per 1,000. In England and Wales the number was 587,459 giving a death-rate of 18.3 per 1,000. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of children under five years of age was:- Holborn District Board of Works 245 Holborn Sub-District the Borough of 232 St. Sepulchre 10 Glasshouse Yard 2 The corresponding number in the Holborn District the Preceding year was 222. 5 The number of deaths of children under one year of age, and the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 registered births, were the following for:- Deaths under 1 year. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 registered births. Holborn District Board of Works 174 234 Holborn Sub-District of the Borough 166 237 St. Sepulchre 6 158 Glasshouse Yard 2 333 166 223 Corresponding numbers preceding year CAUSES OF DEATH. Tables IV. and. IVa. give the principal causes of death. Table V. gives a list of the deaths of persons belonging to the District in outlying Public Institutions. PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. The number of deaths from Phthisis during the year was 84, equivalent to a death-rate of 2.86 per 1,000. The rate diminished from 3.11 in 1898 and 2.99 in 1899. For St. Sepulchre and Glasshouse Yard the number of deaths from phthisis was 5, equal to a death-rate of 2.31 per 1,000. The corresponding rate for London was 1.71. In 1899 it was 1.82 and in 1898 it was l.72. PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION. Although Sanitary improvements have already done much, there are still about 60,000 deaths annually in England and Wales from Consumption and other forms of tuberculosis. In London there were in 1899, 8,510 deaths from Consumption alone. The corrected annual average of the preceding ten years was 8,453, or rather less. It has been estimated that in any year there are five times as many persons as the deaths that are suffering from the disease. It is known that this terrible waste of life with all the protracted suffering attending it, and the distress, moral and material which it involves, is in great measure preventable. Years ago Farr gave £156 as the average value of each human life in England. The value in London is now probably more than £200. Taking it at this figure, the loss to London during the past ten years by deaths from all forms of tuberculosis may be estimated at more than £20,000,000 (twenty million pounds), In addition therefore to humanitarian reasons there are powerful financial and economic reasons for its prevention. VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION. In order that preventive measures may be carried out by the Council in individual cases, the Council must have information of their existence. Voluntary notification was begun in the City of New York, March 1st, 1894, and in January, 1897, the notification was made compulsory. In New York the following numbers of cases of consumption were notified voluntarily:- In 1894 4,166 cases. In 1895 5,824 cases. In 1896 8,334 cases. So that the system cannot be said to be impracticable or unsuccessful. 6 In England it has only recently been adopted in a few towns. In Manchester, Brighton and Sheffield it has been attended with successful results. It has also been recently adopted in the adjoining Borough of Finsbury. I have information of sixteen towns in England where voluntary notification is now practised, but in about half of them only within the past twelve months. In those towns in which no fees have been allowed, it has naturally not been a success. I therefore think that it is desirable for your Council to adopt this system of voluntary notification and the same fees paid as for notifiable diseases. DISINFECTION OF ROOMS. Many experiments have proved that the dust of rooms in which a consumptive person has been living is generally infected with the germs of tuberculosis. Rooms occupied by consumptives ought therefore to be cleansed at least once a week by using wet dusters and wet tea leaves or sawdust. When the consumptive removes to a sanatorium, hospital, or other premises, or dies, the room ought to be thoroughly disinfected as after other infectious diseases. SANATORIA. Proper Sanatoria for the open air treatment of Consumption ought to be provided by the Boards of Guardians, instead of sending consumptives as at present to the general infirmaries. At a meeting of the representatives of the Metropolitan Guardian Boards at St. Martin's Town Hall last year, this subject was discussed and agreed to and referred to the Local Government Board, with a view to the necessary steps being taken by that Board for the carrying out of the proposal. This Council as Sanitary Authority might assist by writing to the Guardian Boards of the Borough and the Local Government Board, advocating the above proposal. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SPUTUM. As the sputum or expectoration of consumptives often contains large numbers of the germs of tuberculosis, before a certain diagnosis can be made by other methods of examination, and prevention and cure can be more successfully carried out in the early stages of the disease, it is desirable that the Medical practitioners of the Borough should have facilities for this bacteriological examination given them by the Council. I have on previous occasions referred to the general Sanitary measures that assist in the prevention of consumption. LEAFLET. I am glad to report that the Council has consented to a leaflet giving hints on its prevention being circulated in the Borough. This leaflet is now being printed. INFLUENZA. Influenza was the assigned cause of 24 deaths, rather more than the preceding year, when it was 21. In St. Sepulchre no death was assigned to this cause, and in Glasshouse Yard only 1. In London the number of deaths referred to influenza was 1,950, which is the highest number recorded since 1895. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. During the year the number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases (" Typhus," Enteric " or " Typhoid " and " Simple continued fever " being classed by the Registrar-General under the heading of " Fever "), and the death-rate per 1,000 from these diseases were:- Number. Zymotic death-rate.

Smallpox 225 101 32 29 87 Scarlet Fever 25,647 22,848 16,849 18,089 13,800 Diphtheria 13,362 12,803 11,543 13,346 11,716 Membranous Croup 446 389 312 338 209 Enteric or Typhoid 3,190 3,103 3,024 4,453 4,291 Typhus Fever 6 4 16 13 7 Other continued Fevers 106 68 56 70 73 Puerperal Fever 277 264 247 326 237 Cholera 13 38 23 15 5 Erysipelas 6,436 5,794 5,169 5,606 4,762 Totals 49,708 45,415 37,316 42,285 35,247 SCARLET FEVER. Excluding duplicate notifications 96 cases were notified, and 90 of them were removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board or the London Fever Hospital. Only 5 cases were notified in St. Sepulchre, of which 4 were removed to hospital, and in Glasshouse Yard only 1 case, which was removed to hospital. There were fewer notifications of this disease both in the District and in London than in 1899. In the first half of the year only 22 cases were notified. The principal incidence of the disease was during the months of July, August, September and October. Of the District cases 4 died, 1 belonging to St. Sepulchre ; and of the London cases 361 died. A case of Scarlet Fever that was not diagnosed until desquamation had begun was the cause of 5 other cases in the same house, and a similar cause led to 2 other cases in another house. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of Diphtheria was 65, of wich 9 belonged to St. Sepulchre and one to Glasshouse Yard. Of these 56 were removed to hospitals for treatment; all the cases in St. Sepulchre and Glasshouse Yard were so removed. The number of notifications for the three preceding years were in 1899, 65; in 1898, 138; and in 1897, 158 cases; so that Diphtheria has much declined in the District during the past two years. The cases were sparsely scattered throughout the District during the year. The number of deaths from Diphtheria was 5, or a mortality of under 8 per cent. One of the deaths belonged to St. Sepulchre. In London the number of cases notified was 11,985 (including 209 cases of Membranous Croup) and the number of deaths was 1,558 or a mortality of 13.0 per cent. 9 The treatment of Diphtheria by its anti-toxin continues to give improved results, especially in laryngeal and tracheotomy cases, and those that come under the treatment within two or three days of the onset of the illness. The bacteriological examination of material from doubtful cases of Diphtheria has been continued by the Jenner (late British) Institute of Preventive Medicine. Of 84 such cases the Diphtheria bacillus was isolated in 21, and the pseudo-diphtheria bacillus, which is non-virulent to animals, was isolated in 10 cases. In the remaining cases it was not isolated. Most of the material was sent by the London Homeopathic Hospital. At the Hospital for Sick Children where also many cases of Diphtheria from various parts of London are treated, the bacteriological examination is carried out by their own staff. TYPHOID FEVER. During the year the number of cases notified was 24, St. Sepulchre, and Glasshouse Yard having each but one notification, in comparison with 34 in 1899, 9 in 1898 and 25 in 1897. of the 24 cases, 4 died, including one in Glasshouse Yard. Of these 24 cases, two were afterwards certified not to be Typhoid, and 4 cases were not contracted in the District. Three cases were probably contracted by direct infection from previous cases, during nursing or attendance on the patients. In London there were 4,291 cases of fever notified, and 756 deaths. MEASLES. The number of deaths assigned to Measles was 21, including one death in St. Sepulchre. In 1899 there were only 11 deaths, and 36 in 1898. In London there were 1,936, in comparison with 2,143 in 1899 and 3,075 in 1898. Closure of St. George the Martyr Infants' School.—Information was received on May 6th, that 119 children out of a total of 220, or 54 per cent., were absent chiefly on account of measles, or measles in the houses in which children attending the school resided. There were also many cases of whooping cough. At a meeting of the Sanitary Committee the following day, an order for the closure of the Schools till the following Monday three weeks was issued. On the opening of the School there were 8 children still away on account of measles, and 20 children on account of whooping cough, or whooping cough or measles in the house, 5 of the 28 returning, however, during the week of re-opening. Princeton Street Board School.—Although there were many absences from this school on account of measles, I did not advise the closure of the Infants' department, as on enquiry I found that rather less than 10 per cent. of the children in that department were absent for that reason. Information from Board Schools.—In accordance with the regulations of the School Board for London many notices giving information of the exclusion of children on account of infectious disease in the house were received. In preceding years the number of notices thus received was very few. WHOOPING COUGH. The death rate in Holborn from Whooping Cough was less than that for London. The number of deaths in Holborn was only 10. There was no death in St. Sepulchre or Glasshouse Yard. All the deaths were of children under 5 years of age. The number of deaths in London was 1,948. DIARRHŒA. The number of deaths assigned to Diarrhoea was 25, of which 22 were of children under 5 years of age, the great majority being infants under 1 year of age, and took place in the third or summer quarter. No death in St. Sepulchre and Glasshouse Yard was assigned to this cause. Of 3,564 deaths assigned to Diarrhoea in London, 2,867 took place in the third quarter. The temperature of the summer quarter was 2°•0 above the average of the preceding 129 years, and the rainfall of that quarter was less than the average. 10 PLAGUE. Notification and Precautionary Measures. In accordance with the Regulations of the Local Government Board, dated the 19 th September, 1900, Plague was made a notifiable disease, and a printed circular was at once prepared and sent to each medical practitioner practising in the District, giving information of this. Arrangements were made with the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the removal of any case of Plague to one of their hospitals. The London County Council made arrangements for any suspected case to be seen by Dr. James Cantlie before removal to a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. An arrangement was also made with Dr. Klein for the bacteriological examination of material from suspected cases. The London County Council also had premises prepared for the prompt removal of all persons who had been in contact with a plague case, where they could be isolated and placed under medical supervision until it could be ascertained whether or not any of them had been infected with the disease. Inquiry was also made at all seamen's lodging houses, common lodging-houses and shelters in Sanitary Districts in the Eastern half of London on both sides of the Thames, for cases of sickness which might possibly prove to be plague; and all cases of sickness of a doubtful nature were enquired into by one of the Council's medical officers. DISINFECTION. During the year ending December, 1900, 278 rooms were fumigated and cleansed. The rooms were also stripped and limewhited where necessary. 1,928 articles were disinfected by steam, viz.:— 185 Beds 156 Quilts 15 Mattresses 395 Pieces of wearing apparel 74 Bolsters 5 Curtains 312 Pillows 3 Rugs 377 Blankets 68 Sundries 292 Sheets 46 Cushions 1,928 Total The family shelter at 47, Northampton Road (conjointly used by the Clerkenwell Vestry), was used for sleeping accommodation by 16 families, consisting of 62 persons from this District, during the disinfection of their rooms. SICKNESS RETURNS. The number of cases of sickness under the care of the District Medical Officers was 1,421. In 1891 the number of cases of sickness was nearly double, viz., 2,816 and they have diminished each year since that date. Details of these are given in Table VII. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. Union Buildings Area Aylesbury Place, Clerkenwell, and Union Buildings, Holborn, Improvement Scheme, 1899. Details of my reports on the Union Buildings Area were given in my Annual Report for the year 1899. I made a special report to the Board on the greater part of the Area in 1896. The following are the mortality statistics for the Union Buildings Area, giving the average general death-rate, phthisis death-rate, and the zymotic death-rate for the four years, 1896-1899, inclusive. I give also the corresponding rates for the Holborn District, and for London as a whole. This Board was not supplied with the details of deaths in the District until the year 1896, so that I can only give the statistics for the four years 1896-1899 inclusive. 11 The population as enumerated by the London County Council in June, 1899, viz., 817, may, I think, be fairly taken as the average of the population during the four years 1896-1899 inclusive, for although the population was greater in the beginning of 1896, the greater part of that year and in 1897 it was less on account of the closing and demolition of parts of the Area. General. Death-rate. Phthisis. Death-rate. ic. Death-rate. Area 48•6 7•96 6•12 Holborn District 23•4 3•11 2•89 London 19•3 1•77 2•45 Per 1,000 persons. * The true death rates of the Area are most probably greater than the above high figures, because a large number of the inhabitants of that Area, when they are ill or infirm, go to Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and Workhouses, and at death the address is often given as Holborn, St. Andrew's, or some other inexact address, and these deaths therefore cannot be included as of persons belonging to the Area. The Local Inquiry was held at the Holborn Town Hall on the 15th and 16th March, 1900. At this inquiry the past and present District Poor Law Medical Officers, Dr. Gabe and Dr. Gahagan, gave evidence of the large proportion of sickness, especially phthisis or consumption, other respiratory diseases and zymotic diseases, that had been prevalent amongst persons living in the Area. Many other witnesses (including Dr. Hamer, Assistant Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, and myself) were also examined and cross-examined. After the Local Inquiry a Provisional Order was made by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, for improving the above areas; and an Act confirming the Provisional Order was afterwards passed.
