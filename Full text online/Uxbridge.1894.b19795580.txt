UXBRIDGE URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. 1894 ANNUAL MEDICAL REPORT BY WILLIAM RAYNER Medical Officer of Health. John King, "Gazette" Printing Works, Uxbridge. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1894. Uxbridge, February 25th, 1895. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit to you the Annual Report as to the Health and Sanitary Condition of the Urban District of Uxbridge for the year 1894. The deaths from all causes number 118, classified under the several heads of diseases and localities in which they occurred. Making up this total 11 took place in the Workhouse of persons removed there from the Urban District at various dates, and 4 at the Cottage Hospital; one of these was the result of an accident, and has to be deducted, as the man did not belong to this district. Parish of Uxbridge. Population 3154. Part of Parish of Hillingdon. Population 5052. Whooping Cough 2 Whooping Cough 3 Diphtheria 2 Influenza 2 Influenza 2 Phthisis 7 Phthisis 3 Bronchitis 14 Bronchitis 9 Heart Disease 7 Heart Disease 6 Injuries 2 All other Diseases 20 Violent 2 All other Diseases 26 Total 44 Total 63 4 This makes the number of deaths in both divisions of the District 117; of these 3 were over 80, 24 over 70, 11 over 65, 48 under 65, 2 under 25, 5 under 15, 8 under 5, and 17 under 1 year of ago. There have boon 2 deaths from Zymotic disease = .2 4 per 1000. Influenza was still prevalent during the year; 4 deaths are ascribed to it. The annual death rate is = 14.1 per 1000, The population being estimated at 8297 This is a very marked improvement over last year =17.18. The number of births in the district were:—Boys 112, Girls 96. Total 208. 7 loss than last year. The Infectious Diseases which have been notified during the year are according to the following monthly table annexed, and number 51. Last year the number was 178, showing a very great reduction. Diphtheria.—12 cases. There were 2 deaths at their own homos. 5 were sent to the Joint Hospital. Scarlatina.—24 cases. 17 sent to Joint Hospital. All recovered. Typhoid Fever.—G cases. All recovered, one case became almost a skeleton, but ultimately got quite well, after being sent to the Workhouse Infirmary. Puerperal Fever. — 1 case. The Midwife had duo warning given not to attend other cases for a specified time. Small Po.r.—1 case. Disease contracted at St. John's Wood,London, devoloped after she came to this town. I have made many analyses of the Water supplied by tho Urban District Council during the year; most of the samples have been quite good, but in a few there has been evidence of sewage and gas contamination. This has been due to defective service pipes, allowing the water first to escape into the surrounding soil, and, when the water is turned off, the dirty water gets into the mains through what is termed insuction. I know from personal knowledge that many of the service pipes havo been in the ground about 40 years, I fear many are in a very decayed condition and require very close supervision in order to prevent foul matter getting into the mains. 5 I can only in this way account for the cases of Typhoid Fever in the Hell Yard. Not far from this spot a faulty pipe was found, namely Norton Street, Atwell's Yard. In conjunction with the Inspector of Nuisances we found that DO Drains were stopped and defective; 07 Water Closets stopped and defective; 42 Closets were without a proper supply of Water; 7 Pigsties were considered to be a Nuisance ; 2 Housos over crowded ; 27 Houses dirty and dilapidated. In all these cases notices were served and complied with, without legal proceedings having to be taken. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM RAYNER.
