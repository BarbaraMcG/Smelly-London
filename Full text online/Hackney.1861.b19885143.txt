HAC 41 REPORT on the SANITARY STATE of HACKNEY DISTRICT, for the Quarter ending March 30th, 1861, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the District, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, ed., Vice-president of the British Meteorological Society, &c. Printed by Order of the Board, by JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1861. REPORT. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, During this quarter I have made personal inspection of the premises and localities enumerated below, many of which I have reported in my Minutes periodically laid before the Board, and therefore need not now state the nature of the nuisances detected on visitation. In many of the streets, places, and courts mentioned, every house was inspected, and notices issued requiring the owners to make such alterations and improvements as were necessary to make the premises habitable, and prevent injury to health by dilapidation, filth, &c. These places were:—Pickle's-buildings; Roseberry-place, Dalston; James'-place, Shacklewell; Francis-yard, Sheep-lane; Hartwell-street, Dalston; Cock-and-Castle-lane; Southgate-grove; Lawrence-buildings; Brook-street, Homerton; Ottley-terrace, Lea-bridge; Stone-yard, Leabridge-road; Baines'-buildings; Henry-street, Kingsland; Mary Annplace, Kingsland; De Beauvoir-road; Wick-road; Baxter's-court, Churchstreet; Queen's-road, Dalston; Winn's-dustyard; Montpelier-terrace, Shacklewell; Elizabeth-cottages, Bull-yard; Church-road, De Beauvoirtown; Forest-row, Dalston; Woodland-street, Dalston; Augusta-row, High-hill-ferry; Webber-place, Brook-street, Clapton; Knifton's-wharf; High-street, West Hackney; Payne's-court, William-street; Williamstreet; Down's-park-road; Melina-place, Sheep-lane; New Church-road, Well-street; South-row, Bird-cage-fields; Hurst-cottages,Bird-cage-fields; Helmsley-terrace, London-fields; Brunswick-street, Well-street; Samuelrow, John-street, West Hackney; Orchard-terrace, High-hill-ferry; 3 Dalston-lane; Margaret-street, Well-street; Chapel-road, Stamford-hill; Cambridge-heath-wharf; Helmsley-place, Mare-street; Stapleton's-buildings; Coldbath-lane, Church-street; Conservative Land Society; Georgestreet, London-fields; Jerusalem-square; Orchard-street and Court; Adelaide-place, Forest-row; Enfield-road, North; Rugby's-buildings, Stoke Newington; Woburn-place, Well-street; Grove-lane, Hackney. Mr. Valentine accompanied me to all these places. The total number of houses inspected was no less than 320. I paid numerous visits to Winn's dustyard, Knifton's yard, Harrison's factory, and some others. The preliminary and other notices issued in consequence of these visitations having in many instances failed to obtain the removal of the nuisances complained of, 23 owners of property were required to attend before this Board, to show cause, if possible, why they should not be summoned to one of Her Majesty's Police Courts. This step was successful as regards 19 persons, so that it was necessary to issue only 4 summonses during the quarter, the whole of which were decided in favour of the Board. The mortality for the quarter has been most unusually high in consequence of the extremely cold weather in the early part of the quarter, no less than 509 deaths having been recorded; but against these there were 699 births, or an excess of 190 births over the deaths. This is very satisfactory when a comparison is made with other districts, as in some the death-rate was nearly equal to the birth's-rate. Thus in Holborn there were no less than 385 deaths to 361 births; in Whitechapel, 700 deaths to 710 births; in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, 162 deaths to 170 births; in Chelsea, 438 deaths to 528 births. Of the 509 deaths 239 were of males and 270 of females, whilst of the 699 births 367 were of males and 322 females. Of the 699 births 46 were registered in Stoke Newington, 35 in Stamford Hill, 185 in West Hackney, 277 in Hackney, and 156 in South Hackney sub-districts. Of the 509 deaths 25 happened in Stoke Newington, 15 in Stamford Hill, 140 in West Hackney, 239 in Hackney, and 92 in South Hackney. No less than 54 deaths, out of the 239 in Hackney sub-district, occurred in the East London Union and German Hospital. As proof that the extremely large number of deaths resulted from the intense cold, I have placed the temperature of one week against the deaths which were registered in the 4 next, when it will be seen how the deaths diminished as the temperature increased.—  Deaths.

This table shews that 192 deaths were registered during the first 4 weeks, and consequently correspond with the extremely severe weather, whilst 132 only were registered during the next 4 weeks, when the temperature, with but few exceptions, was much above the average. An examination of the Table of Deaths, as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1859 (which was very mild), also shews that whilst the deaths from almost all the great groups of disease, with the exceptions of the zymotic, had increased, the great excess was caused by inflammatory diseases of the lungs. Thus, in 1859 there were when corrected for increase of population, 84 deaths from epidemic diseases against 81 in 1861, there were only 83 deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs against 118 in 1861; and, whilst in 1859 there were only 31 deaths from consumption, against 50 in 1861. These facts point out very strongly the necessity of those inhabitants of Hackney district, who are in a weak state of health, or liable to diseased lungs, taking the utmost care of themselves during very cold weather. The deaths from the remaining groups of diseases may be briefly stated as follows:—19 from dropsy; 75 from tubercular diseases, including consumption; 67 from diseases of the brain and nervous system; 34 from diseases of the heart and blood vessels; 23 from affection of the stomach and digestive organs; 7 from diseases of the kidney; 13 from premature 5 birth and debility; 38 from old age; and 17 from violence, including 5 from suffocation in bed (all infants); and 3 from burns and scalds. The number registered as from old age was unusually large, and included 9 persons who were 87 years of age and above, viz.:—2 of 87 years old, 2 of 88, 1 of 89, 1 of 90, 1 of 91, 1 of 92, and the other above 100 years old. No less than 8 of these were females, and only 1 a male. The nuisances abated by Mr. Valentine during the past quarter are as follows: Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 57 Cesspools emptied 20 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 54 Houses limewashed, purified, and repaired 38 Pigsties repaired or removed 13 Foul and offensive drains cleansed and reconstructed 61 Other nuisances 10 253 The temperature, as already stated, was very low in January, so much so indeed as to have been quite an exception. Mr. Glaisher observes, in the Quarterly Report of the Registrar General for Births, Deaths, &c., that "the cold of the first half of January this year was more rigorous than in any corresponding period since 1820," and that it was the coldest January, with one exception, since 1842. The highest temperature recorded at the Town Hall was 54.6°, and the lowest 14.2°, affording a range of more than 40°. The amount of rain-fall was less than usual, having been about 4½ inches.

TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the District, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, ed., Vice-president of the British Meteorological Society. Printed by Order of the Board, BY john coventry, church street, hackney. 1861. REPORT. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, During this Quarter I have made numerous house to house visitations, as well as inspected many isolated houses and premises. Amongst others, I would mention Urban-place; Pickle's-buildings; the Conservative Land Society's Ground at Homerton; John-street; Wellington-street; Orchardplace; Clarence-road; Needham-terrace; World's-end, Upper Clapton; Ebenezer-place; James's-place; Peartree-place; King's-head-yard, Clapton; Lansdown-place, London-fields; Coldbath-lane; Church-terrace, Homerton; Caroline-street; Nelson-terrace; Jerusalem-square; Exmouthplace; High-street, Homerton; Navarino-road; Charles-street, Dalston; Francis-yard; Orchard-street; Brook-street; George-street; Grove-lane; Plough-lane; Saxony-cottages; Albert-street; Devonshire-place; Greenlanes; Homerton-terrace; College-street; numerous houses in the vicinity of the River Lea; Sandford-place; Hayne's-court; Williams's-cottages; Sandford-lane; Draper's-court; Henry-street; Cock-and-Castle-lane; Pond-lane; Havelock-road; James's-place; Kossuth-terrace; Albionroad; Palace-cottages; Tottenham-road; Greenwood-row; Winn's Dust-yard; Larter's-yard; numerous cow-houses, piggeries, &c. As these places have been previously mentioned in my Reports to the Board, I need not detail the nuisances which I found, or the course adopted to remove them. 3 Amongst other matters to which I have drawn the attention of the Board, are the gradual increase of saline and organic matters in the water supplied by the East London Water Works Company; and the enormous deposition of vegetable refuse, fish offal, and filth, in various excavations within the District. As regards the water supply, there is no doubt that the quantity of organic matter contained in the water is not at present sufficient to cause a decided injury to health, but as it is gradually increasing, some measures should be speedily taken to remedy what may become a most serious evil. As regard the saline matters, I do not consider them at all injurious; indeed as the quantity of lime is not very large, they are likely to be rather beneficial than otherwise. There can, however, be no question whatever as to the injurious effects of the fish offal and other refuse deposited in the numerous excavations which have been made for the purpose of obtaining gravel or brick earth. I am therefore much gratified at the decision given at Worship-street, against one of the parties who thus offended, especially as since the judgment, the practice has obtained to a far less extent. The death-rate has been a little above the average for the quarter, but not from what are termed preventable (zymotic) diseases, for these were far below the average. The deaths from tubercular affections were unusually high, as well as from diseases of the nervous system; also from premature birth and debility. The excess in these classes account for more than the total number registered above the average. The birth-rate steadily increases, and was larger this Quarter than in any of the corresponding Quarters during the last five years. The total number of births registered in the District was 696, of which 333 were of males, and 363 females. Of these 60 children were born in Stoke Newington, 33 in Stamford Hill, 220 in West Hackney, 253 in Hackney, and 130 in South Hackney sub-districts. Of the 391 deaths registered in the whole District, 23 occurred in Stoke Newington, 24 in Stamford Hill, 97 in West Hackney, 189 in Hackney, and 58 in South Hackney. As the births were 696 in number, and the deaths only 391, 4 there was an excess of births over deaths of no less than 305 during the Quarter. The largest number of deaths registered in any one week was 44, and the lowest 20; the week during which the smaller mortality was registered having been the first of the Quarter, and the largest the last week but one, when the temperature had become very much higher. The mortality from epidemic (zymotic diseases) was only one-seventh part of the total number of deaths, which is a remarkably small proportion. There was not any death from small-pox; 6 from measles; only 7 from scarlet fever; 9 from whooping cough; and only 8 from all kinds of continued fever, including typhus. This is a most satisfactory proof of the benefit derived from sanitary measures, for it must be remembered that the diminished number of deaths also indicates a much larger decrease in sickness, misery, and pain. The victims of typhus are generally in the prime of life, and belong to the working classes, so that a diminished rate of death from fever, also signifies a less claim on the poor rates. There were 21 deaths from diseases having an uncertain seat, such as dropsy, hæmorrhage, &c.; no less than 74 from tubercular affections, including consumption; 51 from diseases of the nervous system, of which as many as 18 were registered from "convulsion;" there were also 22 from heart affections; 61 from diseases of the lungs; 26 from abdominal maladies; 17 from premature birth and debility; and 28 from old age. The deaths from violence were fewer than usual, especially from suffocation. Of the 391 deaths 75 occurred of children under 1 year of age, 99 of persons between 1 and 20 years of age, 47 of persons above 20 but below 40 years old, 69 of those who were more than 40 but less than 60 years of age, no less than 84 of those who were 60 years old but not 80, and 17 who were more than 80 years of age. The majority of those above 80 were, as usual, females—one-fourth only being males and three-fourths females. A comparative large proportion of aged persons died in charitable institutions. There were 39 deaths in the East London Union and German Hospital; so that there were only 359 deaths which may be considered as belonging to the District. 5 The nuisances abated by Mr. Valentine during the Quarter, partly under my instructions, are as follows:— Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 92 Cesspools emptied 31 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 77 Houses limewashed, purified, and repaired 69 Pigsties repaired or removed 19 Foul and offensive drains cleansed and re-constructed 91 Other nuisances 33 412 This number, 412, is decidedly in excess of the average for the corresponding Quarters of the last three years, especially as regards the houses limewashed, purified, and cleansed. In order to obtain the removal of so many nuisances, it was requisite to require the attendance before the Board of twenty-seven owners of property, and to summons five persons before the Magistrates at the Worship-street and Clerkenwell Police Courts. The Magistrates ordered the removal of the nuisances in all these cases. The weather was not so warm as usual—the mean temperature for the Quarter having been about one degree below the average. During the first six weeks the temperature was much below the mean, but it increased at a greater rate than usual during the remainder of the Quarter. The highest temperature recorded was 80.6°, and the lowest 27.4°, affording a range of 53.2°. The pressure of the air as indicated by the barometer was in excess of the mean; whilst the rain-fall was rather more than an inch below the average.

HAC 41 REPORT on the SANITARY STATE of HACKNEY DISTRICT, for the Quarter ending Septembar 29th, 1861, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Medical Offices of Health to the District, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Ed., Vice-president of the British Meteorological Society, &c. Printed by Order of the Board, BY JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1861. REPORT. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The Registrar General of Births and Deaths observes, in his Report for this Quarter, "That in the whole of the Metropolis the number of deaths registered in the three months was 100,986, considerably more than in the same Quarter of 1860, which was 86,423, but less than in that of 1859. And over England the fluctuation in the deaths was generally similar to that which is shown in the aggregate number. The annual rate of mortality did not rise quite to the average, for the former was 199 in 10,000 of the population, the latter is 202. In the cold September Quarter of 1860 the rate was 171." The Registrar General also points out the great increase in the deaths from diarrhoea during this Quarter, above the number registered in the corresponding Quarter of 1860. A comparison of the deaths in Hackney District during the Summer Quarters of 1859, 1860, and 1861, shews identical results with those obtained for the whole of London. Thus the deaths from all causes in the Quarter ending September 30th, 1859, were 426 in number, which, when corrected for increase of population to the present time, would be 460; in the corresponding Quarter of 1860, being only 308, is corrected 320; whilst in 1861 they were 430. The deaths from diarrhoea, when corrected, were as follows: for the summer of 1859, 81; of 1860, only 11; in 1861, 43. The deaths, corrected, from epidemic diseases, daring these periods were no less than 137 in 1859; only 58 in 1860; and 106 in 1861. The remarks which I made on the temperature of 1859 and of 1860, I will now quote. In 1859 I observed that "the meteorology of the quarter has been most unusual; the mean temperature having been 3 63 degrees, or more than 3 degress in excess of the average temperature of the season during the last 88 years." "The thermometer exceeded a heat of above 90 degrees in the shade on four days, and for ten successive days and nights the mean temperature of each 24 hours was above 70 degrees," which has not been paralleled since accurate records have been kept. As regards the Summer Quarter of 1860 I wrote. "The weather during this Quarter has been, taking it altogether, the most extraordinary on record. The mean temperature for July was only 57.9 degrees; for August, 58.0 degrees; and for September, 53.4 degrees;" making together the coldest summer which has yet been recorded. In 1861 the contrast was very great, the mean temperature for July having been 60.9 degrees; for August, 63.2 degrees; and for September, 57.1 degrees. The deaths and temperature were greatest in 1859, smallest in 1860, and intermediate in 1861. I have for many years pointed out the intimate connection between the mortality and temperature, and especially as regards this District, which being elevated, suffers more from change of temperature than those which are lower. At the same time it must be remembered that an elevated district is, upon the whole, more healthy than a low-lying one. The practical deductions which I draw from this comparison, and others I have previously made is, that the greatest cleanliness should be observed at all times, but especially in hot weather, that no house refuse should be allowed to accumulate, no unripe fruit eaten, and the water butt frequently cleaned out. The poorer classes suffer most from the diseases of hot weather, because their houses are dirty, the drainage often neglected or carelessly damaged, the food unwholesome, and their clothes worn too long without washing. As above stated, there were 430 deaths in the District, of which 219 were males, and 211 females. Of these 28 died in Stoke Newington, 20 in Stamford Hill sub-district, 111 in West Hackney, 189 in Hackney, and 82 in South Hackney sub-district. Against the 430 deaths there were no less than 680 births, of which 354 were of males, and 326 of females. Of these 35 were registered in Stoke Newington sub-district, 28 in Stamford Hill, 215 in West Hackney, 278 in Hackney, and 124 in South Hackney sub-district. 4 The mortality from epidemic diseases was unusually large, namely, 106 or nearly 25 per cent. of the whole, Of these 1 was registered from small-pox; 4 only from measles; 12 from scarlet fever; 6 from diphtheria; 7 from whooping cough; 43 from diarrhœa; and 12 from fever. There were also 27 deaths registered as being from diseases of uncertain seat; 74 from tubercular diseases (including 46 from consumption); and 15 from abdominal consumption (tabes mesenterica) in young children. There were also 46 deaths from affections of the brain and nerves, including 12 from inflammation, and 18 from apoplexy and palsy. Of the remainder 28 were caused by diseased heart, many being sudden; 46 only from affections of the lungs; 25 from diseases of the digestive organs; the very unusual number of 20 from premature birth and debility; 27 from old age, of whom no less than 17 were 80 or above; and 15 from violent deaths. Of the 27 deaths from old age, 7 persons were above 85 years, one being 89, another 90, and the oldest 93. The ages at death were as follows:—104 were under 1 year old; 101 above 1 and under 20 years; 53 were above 20 and under 40; 71 were above 40 years old, but under 60; 72 were above 60, but under 80; and no less than 29 were above 80. I have made, amongst other places, inspections or house to house visitations, in company with Mr. Valentine, in the following localities, and ordered notices to be served, requiring the owners to abate the nuisances existing on the premises. Many of the inspections were made in consequence of the unusual prevalence of diarhœa and other epidemic diseases during this Quarter. The localities visited were:—Conduitstreet; Brook-street, Clapton; Orchard-cottages, Clarence-road; Ditches in the vicinity of Stamford-hill, which caused diarrhœa; Church-street, Stoke Newington; Albion-road; King's-head-yard, and Waterloo-place, Upper Clapton (18 houses); Needham-terrace; Retreat-place, Homerton (28 houses); Kossuth-terrace, Hackney-wick; Abbot-street, Kingsland; Augusta-row; High-hill-ferry (10 houses); Lea-bridge-road; Duncansquare; Bell-yard, Church-street; Salem-place, Homerton; Elizabethplace, Stonebridge-common; Austin's-buildings (10 houses); Francis-yard, Sheep-lane; Manor-place, Newington-common; Pratt's-row, Brooksby's- 5 walk; Exmouth-place; Goring-street (41 houses); Robin-hood-hill; Lawrence-buildings, Sanford-lane; Queen's-court, Well-street; Homertonrow; College-street, Homerton; Palatine-houses, Stoke Newington-road; Albert-street(10houses); Brunswick-street; Robinson's-row, Kingsland; Pleasant-place; Clarke's-buildings, Stoke Newington; Holly-street-south; Lordship-road; Elizabeth-terrace, Stamford-hill; Matthias-street, Kingsland (26 houses). Also many piggeries and cow-houses, and the sixty-one slaughter houses scattered about the District. The number of nuisances abated during the Quarter by Mr Valentine, partly in consequence of my inspections, were unusually large, viz., 393. These may be classified as follows: Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 72 C esspools emptied 8 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 59 House and other premises, limewashed, purified, and repaired 150 Pigsties repaired or removed 32 Foul and offensive drains cleansed and reconstructed 62 Other nuisances 10 393 To obtain the removal of so many nuisances, it was necessary to require 24 persons to attend before the Board, to shew cause why they should not be summonsed before the Police Magistrates ; but of these 4 only were summonsed, as the other 20 removed the nuisances without legal proceedings. Having already referred to the temperature during this Quarter, I need only state that although the temperature on certain days was unusually high, yet the difference from the average of the last 90 years was but small, viz., not quite 1 degree in excess. The mean pressure of the barometer was less than usual, and the rain-fall not quite one-half of the average quantity. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, November, 1861. JOHN W. TRIPE.

HAC 41 REPORT on the SANITARY STATE of HACKNEY DISTRICT, for the QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 28th, 1861, by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the District. Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Ed. Vice-president of the British Meteorological Society, &c. Printed by Order of the Board, BY JOHN COVENTRY, CHURCH STREET, HACKNEY. 1862. REPORT. To The Board of Work for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The Registrar General of Births and Deaths states, in the Report for this Quarter, .That the total number of deaths was not so great as in the same Quarter of 1859, but greater than in that of 1860. In the last Quarter fever, under various designations—typhus, typhoid, low continued fever, and scarlatina—prevailed extensively in many parts of the country.. These remarks precisely apply to the sanitary condition of the Hackney District during this Quarter, as the mortality was 412 from all causes, of which 104 were registered as being from zymotic diseases, including 26 from fever. I have made enquiries respecting the deaths of most of those registered as being from fever, but could not detect any special cause, in many instances, to account for the mortality. In many cases I should not have tabulated the deaths under this head, but rather under that of one of the acute diseases of the lungs or brain ; but did not consider myself justified in thus classifying them, as similar deaths have hitherto been registered as from fever. In some instances we found the premises in a bad state as regards drainage, when notices were served requiring the owners to remove the nuisances existing. The disease appeared in various parts of the District, but the only localities in which several case6 appeared were those which were badly drained—as in the vicinity of Margaret. street, Stamford.hill; Morpeth.road, Victoria.park; and Sanford.lane. As regards Margaret.street, I have brought up two reports on the subject, the sewer being too superficial to drain the. houses; in Morpeth.road a 3 sewer is to be laid down; and in Sanford.lane the stoppage, which was temporary, has been removed. In some of my former Reports I pointed out that although bad drainage is one of the chief causes of fever, especially of typhoid, yet that other agents, partly meteorological, take part in the production of this disease; overcrowding and the effluvia evolved from dirty rooms or filthy clothing, are also to be included in the number. I again mention this, as however efficient a perfect system of drainage may be, we shall not, by carrying out these works, entirely remove fever from amongst us; we shall, however, reduce its frequency and modify its virulence. The localities in which deaths from fever have been registered are as follows:—German Hospital; Anderson.s Road; Eleanor Road; Homerton.row; Dalston.terrace; Down.s.terrace; Stamford Hill Brewery; Little Margaret.street; Burges.s. yard; Meadow.street; Palatine.houses; Culford.road; Stamford.villas; Sanford.lane; Hermitage.place; Caroline.place; High.street, Stoke Newington and Kingsland; Coronation.place; Glaskin.street; Duncan. terrace ; Park.street; Theresa.place; and Goring.street. In addition to most of these localities, I have visited with Mr. Valentine the following placesPond.lane, Clapton; Wellington.street, Shacklewell; Coldbath.lane; High.street, Homerton; Elizabeth.terrace, Stamford. hill; William.street; Payne.s.court; Park.cottages, Well.street; Robinson.s.row; Matthias.street; Matthias.place; Abbot.street; Salem. place, Homerton; Waits..buildings; Kenton.road; Baines..buildings; Bath.place, Dalston; Chapel.road, Stamford.hill; Prospect.place, Kings. land; Ada.street; George.street; Salem.place, Stoke Newington; Birdcage.walk; Dalston.place; Premises at Upper Clapton occupied by W. Bacon and others; Wharf.road, Canal.bridge; Gresham.terrace, Queen.s.road; George.place, Stamford.hill; Union.row, Morning.lane; Victoria.cottages,Hertford.road; Medina.villas; High.hill.ferry; Duncan. street; Nelson.terrace; San ford.place; Cross.street, Homerton; Prince.s. road, Homerton; Queen.s.road; King.s.terrace; Prospect.place,Kingsland; Caroline.street; Albert.grove; Morpeth.road; Clarence.villas; Church. street, Stoke Newington; Lordship.road; Castle.street; and James..place, Shacklewell. 4 The mortality from diseases of uncertain seat was 22, including no less than 17 from cancer. There were also 65 deaths registered from tubercular diseases, of which 42 were from consumption; 43 from affections of the brain and nervous system; 26 from affections of the heart and vessels; 78 from diseases of the lungs and organs of respiration; 15 from abdominal affections; 10 from premature birth and debility; 25 from old age; and 11 from violence. The ages at death are very nearly the same as for former years, except that the mortality of children under 1 year was less than usual, and that of young persons between 1 and 20 was decidedly in excess. They were as follows :—65 under 1 year; 136 between 1 and 20; 48 between 20 and 40; 62 between 40 and 60; 83 between 60 and 80; and 21 who were above 80 years of age. The total number of births was 677, of which 367 were of males, and 310 of females. There were 31 births in Stoke Newington, 32 in Stamford Hill, 198 in West Hackney, 285 in Hackney, and 131 in South Hackney sub.districts. There were 24 deaths in Stoke Newington, 17 in Stamford Hill, 119 in West Hackney, 174 in Hackney, and 81 in South Hackney sub.districts. Of the 415 deaths 28 occurred in the German Hospital and East London Union, so that 387 may be considered as belonging to the district. The number of nuisances abated during the Quarter by Mr. Valentine, partly in consequence of my inspections, was unusually large, viz., 350. These may be classified as follows : Cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the Sewer 79 Cesspools emptied 36 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 42 House, and other premises, limewashed, purified, and repaired 56 Pigsties repaired or removed 16 Foul and offensive drains cleansed and reconstructed 80 Other Nuisances 42 350 Sixteen owners of property were summoned before the Board to shew cause why proceedings should not be taken before the Magistrates, of whom 10 performed the work necessary to abate the nuisances complained 5 of, whilst 6 were summonsed and ordered to abate the nuisances by the Magistrates. The meteorology of the Quarter has been somewhat unusual, as the temperature for October was no less than 55°2, being nearly 5½ degrees above the average. There have been only three instances, during the last hundred years, of so high a temperature. On the 1st of November a change occurred, when a cold period set in and lasted for more than three weeks— on some days the cold being intense. On the 18th the temperature was 15 degrees below the average of 43 years, having remained below freezing point the whole day. The weather then set in warm, and remained above the average for one month, viz., from the 24th November to 24th December. The highest temperature recorded was 74°4, and the lowest 22°0, affording a range for the quarter of 52°4. The average temperature for the Quarter was about l½ degrees above the mean, and the rain.fall was somewhat in excess. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN W. TRIPE. lUth February, 1862.

TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the District. Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Ed. Vice.president of the British Meteorological Society, &c. Printed by Order of the Board, BY john coventry, church street, hackney. 1862. Annual Report. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, This year has not been so healthy as either 1860 or 1859, but more healthy than 1858. The extreme cold in the early part of the year produced an immense mortality from diseases of the lungs and from old age; whilst the unusually high temperature of the last five months has been coincident with an excessive number of deaths from zymotic diseases, amongst which, I regret to number, fever. The unusual mortality from fevers of all kinds, has not been confined either to Hackney, or to the Metropolis at large, but has prevailed, more or less, throughout the whole of England. It is also worthy of remark that fever has not been epidemic chiefly in the houses of the poor, but has invaded, to a great extent, the dwellings of the rich. If we glance over the localities enumerated in my last Quarterly Report as those in which fever has caused deaths in this district, we shall see that the same holds good here to a great extent. The places however in which it has raged most furiously, have been those in which the drainage was defective, and the smell from unavoidable 4 accumulations most unpleasant. The Registrar General of Births and Deaths observed, in his Report for the last Quarter, .that fever, under various designations—typhus, typhoid, low continued fever, and scarlatina—prevailed extensively in many parts of the countryand he then enumerated a long list of places in which they had caused an excessive proportion of deaths. In one of my former Reports I pointed out the injury which would accrue to sanitary proceedings, if too much importance was attached to efficient drainage only, and too little to diet, clothing, density of population, the internal condition of the dwellings of the poor, proper water supply, and the immense influence exerted on health by atmospheric variations. The experience of the past year again shows the necessity of keeping up a regular and efficient supervision of the interior of houses, of attention to diet, clothing, and exercise, especially when the weather is unusually hot. The details of the sanitary works having been laid before you in the fortnightly Minutes, and in the printed Quarterly Reports, I shall now submit for your consideration a general abstract of the births and deaths, the ages at death, and the causes of death, which have been compiled by me from the original returns.

Of the whole number registered in 1861, 1421 were males, and 1331 females or an excess of 90 males. The excess of male births and of male deaths during the first five years of life, not only in England, but in all other European countries, is a singular fact, and one which has by no means been satisfactorily accounted for. I was engaged, some years since, in some very laborious investigations on this subject; and ascertained that the excessive mortality of male children is caused by all diseases, and is not the result of one or two, and that a much larger proportion of male than female children are born dead. The rate of child.birth in the sub.districts varied, as might be expected, considerably from the ratio of population. Thus in Stoke Newington the population in 1861 was 7.9 per cent. and the birth.rate 6.2 per cent.; in Stamford Hill the population was 6.6, and the birth.rate only 4.6 per cent.; whilst in South Hackney the population was 18.5, and the births 19.7 per cent.; and in Hackney the former was 37.8, and the latter 39.7 per cent. The difference in the social condition of the inhabitants explains this variation, in part; but the following Table shows that the causes are partly accidental, as the ratio of births varies somewhat every year in each of the sub-districts :— TABLE II. 1857.61—Birth.hate in each Sub-district.

The deaths in each quarter include all those registered during the year, so that in looking to the line in Table 3 of .totals,. we ascertain the aggregate mortality in each sub-district. But as the deaths in the German Hospital, in a great measure, do not belong to the district, and those in the East London Union in no way whatever, I eliminate 154 deaths from the total, and then distribute the deaths in the Workhouse over the whole districts pro rata to the population. The figures under the Hackney district show the necessity for this proceeding, for all these institutions are in this sub.district, by which the mortality is unfairly increased ; and we find the proper number to be 570 instead of 791 deaths. The ratio of deaths in the sub. districts are as follows;—6.7 per cent in Stoke Newington; 5.0 in Stamford Hill; 31.5 in West Hackney; 35.9 in Hackney; and 20.9 in South Hackney 7 TABLE IV. 1857.61—Corrected Rates of Death in the Sub-districts.

Thus the death-rate was below the average in the Stamford Hill sub-district—having been less than at any period since 1856—and, with one exception, the same applies to Stoke Newington; in West Hackney the rate varied but little from the average; whilst in Hackney it was somewhat above, and in South Hackney decidedly more than the mean. The whole of the deaths in the district have been grouped together in Table 5, so as to shew the causes of death, and the per centages for the four years, 1858—61. We perceive that in the first Quarter inflammatory diseases of the lungs caused the greatest number of deaths—more than 25 per cent.—whilst in the second Quarter the greatest mortality resulted from tubercular affections; and in the two last Quarters, zymotic diseases were most fatal, having been above 25 ner cent.

This might have been calculated on, as 1860 was a cold and 1861 a warm year; for, as a rule, the mortality from diarrhoea—the chief cause of death in summer and autumn in this group of diseases—is in an almost invariable ratio with the temperature of these seasons. In 1859 the temperature was nearly 4° above that of 1860, and the mortality from zymotic diseases was only 16.8 per cent. in 1860; whilst it was no less than 23.0 per cent. in 1859. Tubercular diseases have been decidedly on the increase, not only relatively but absolutely, whilst brain diseases have been less this year than for the preceding three years. Affections of the lungs caused a greater mortality than in 1858 and 1859, but less than in 1860. The mortality from diseases of the heart was also unusually large in 1861, as no less than 101 deaths, or 6.5 per cent. of the whole were registered in this year against 6.3 per cent. in 1860, 3.8 per cent. in 1859, and 4.5 per cent. in 1858. The other groups of diseases do not require any special consideration. As the group of zymotic diseases includes several most important maladies, I now lay before you the mortality during the year from small-pox and other eruptive fevers.:— TABLE VI. 1861—Deaths from Epidemic Diseases 1st.

I say in great measure, because vaccination is not an absolute protection against small.pox, but the same may be said as regards a second attack of the disease. Measles has, however, prevailed to a considerable extent, whilst scarlet fever has decreased since 1859, as I predicted at page 8 of my Report for that year. I expect scarlet fever to be more fatal during the next two years than it was in 1860 and 1861. The number of deaths from diptheria is larger than for 1860, but not so great as for 1859. Whooping.cough has also been on the increase, 62 deaths having been registered in 1861 against 51 in 1860, and 36 in 1859. The greatest increase amongst epidemic diseases has been from fever, as I pointed out in my last Quarterly Report. Diarrhoea has caused a larger mortality than in 1860, but smaller than 1859. With the exception of fever—the unusual mortality for which is not confined to any special district of the Metropolis, or indeed to London itself—we may therefore be satisfied with the sanitary condition of the district, so far as the causes of death are concerned. The total number of deaths was not so satisfactory, but, to a certain extent, the increase has been shared with other districts. I now propose submitting to you a Table showing the mortality in each Quarter, and the ages at death. TABLE VII. 1861—Ages at Death. Quarter. Under 1 Year. Between 1 and 20. Between 20 and 40.

Thus during the first quarter of the year there occurred in 1859 24.4 per cent, of the whole number of deaths for the year; in 1860 31.3 per cent.; and in 1861 29.2 per cent. During the second quarter, in 1859 21.4 per cent.; in 1860 23.5 per cent.; and in 1861 22.4 per cent. During the third quarter, in 1859 27.2 per cent.; in 1860 only 20.0 per cent.; and in 1861 24 6 per cent. In the last quarter, in 1859 27.0 per cent.; in 1860 24.7 per cent.; and in 1861 only 23.8 per cent. The ages at death varied from the average chiefly in the larger proportion of deaths between 1 and 20 years, and between 40 and 60 years of age; also in the smaller proportion between 20 and 40 years. There were 328 deaths of children under 1 year, or 18.8 per cent.; 468, or 26.8 per cent. of young persons above 1 but under 20 years old; only 199, or 11.5 per cent, of those between 20 and 40; 279, or 16.0 per cent. of persons between 40 and 60; 367, or 21.0 per cent. of individuals more than 60 and less than 80; and 104, or 5.9 per cent. of old persons above 80 years old. The Registrar General states, in his summary for the year 1860, “that in the ten years, 1840—49, the mean rate of mortality in London was 2.51 per cent.; and in the subsequent decennium, 1850—59, it fell to 2.36 per cent. It is still more satisfactory to observe that the rate of mortality in each of the three last years, 1859—61, has been less than the lower of the two rates that have just been mentioned. In 1860 the rate was 2.26, in 1861 it was 2.32. If the mortality of London were confined permanently within, the limit represented by the mean of the last three years, the effect of that reduction in the population as it exists at present would be that more than 4,000 persons would survive annually, whose lives would drop under the mean rate derived from the twenty years, 1840—59.” 11 The mortality of Hackney district, as usual, indicates a higher standard of health than that for the whole of London, as the population on April 1st, 1861, having been 83,188, it would probably be on July 1st, (the mean day of the year) about 83,570. Now as the number of deaths belonging to Hackney was 1,592, it follows that the rate of death was 10 in each 523 inhabitants, or only 1.91 per cent. The number of nuisances removed during the year by Mr. Valentine, partly under my direction, have been in excess of those abated in 1859 and 1860. As usual I present them in a classified list:— Privies emptied, filled up, and drained into the Sewer 300 Privies and Cesspools emptied 95 Stable, Pig, Cow-dung, and other refuse removed 232 Premises repaired and limewashed 252 Gulleys trapped, Roads cleansed, &c 27 Pig removed, and Pigsties repaired and cleansed 79 Choked Drains cleansed, repaired, and re-constructed 294 Other Nuisances 138 Total 1417 The list of sanitary improvements effected, indicates a part only of the sanitary work performed; as a very large number of premises are inspected on which no nuisances are detected, and which do not therefore appear in the above Table. This untabulated work increases every year, for as the sanitary condition of the district becomes improved, more inspections are made in proportion to the nuisances discovered, than obtained during the first years of working the Metropolis Local Management Act; but it is only by repeated and careful inspections of the dwellings of the poor, and an inculcation at those visits of the necessity for keeping clean their rooms, that epidemic diseases can be kept in check.

All the observations have been corrected for error, diurnal range, &c., and reduced by Glaisher.s Tables, last editions. 13 The weather during the past year has been somewhat remarkable, and very different from either of the two preceding years. As regards mean temperature it varied but little from the average; but whilst during January it was nearly 4½ degrees below the mean, and also below the mean in April, May, June, and July, it was considerably above the average in February, March, and October, especially in the latter month. The highest temperature recorded, 87°.4, was registered in August, and the lowest, 15°6, in January, so that the extreme range for the year was 71.8 degrees. In 1859 the highest temperature was 94°.6, and the lowest 15°., so that the range was greater, being 79.6 degrees; but in 1860 the highest temperature was only 76°.4, and the lowest 5°.6, (being 10 degrees below the extreme cold of 1861,) so that the range was 70.8 degrees. The mean of the highest temperature recorded in each month was 69°.1, and of the lowest 32°.3; whilst the mean of all the highest was 58° 7, and of all the lowest 42°.5, so that the average daily range was 16.2 degrees. The adopted mean temperature for the year was 49°.7, and the dew point was 43°.8. The general direction of the wind was westerly, and the total rain.fall 21.22 inches. Rather more ozone was registered than during the previous year. The mean pressure of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, was greater than in 1860, having been 29.897 inches against 29.767 in 1860. The barometer was highest in January, April, May, and December, and lowest in February, March, July, and November; especially in November, when the rain.fall amounted to the enormous quantity of 5 3 inches, or about one quarter of the whole sum for the year.
