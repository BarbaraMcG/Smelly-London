With Table of Causes of Deaths, &c. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clericenwell. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Eighth Annual Report upon the sanitary state of the district, for the past year, viz., 1863. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes in the district during the past year 1863, was 1509 ; the annual average of the last ten years being 1455 ; hence the deaths were 54 more than the average. During the last 7 years, the total numbers of deaths in the district have been respectively as follows : in 1857, 1406 ; in 1858, 1477 ; in 1859,1374 ; in 1860,1383 ; in 1861,1494 ; in 1862,1572 ; and in 1863, 1509. In each year a certain number of deaths of the Inhabitants takes place in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for 1863, amounts to 101. The births which took place in the year were 2449; the natural increase of the population thus being 940. The number of deaths from Zymotic* diseases in 1863, was 411 ; that for the preceding 6 years being respectively 340, 327, 329, 266, 381, and 422. The number of deaths occurring from the principal Zymotic diseases was 376; the kind of diseases, as also the number occurring during the preceding 5 years, are shewn in a subsequent table. * This term, which was first proposed by Dr. Farr, of the Registrar General's Office, is now generally employed for brevity to signify Infectious, Epidemic, and Endemic diseases. 11. 728 deaths occurred from all causes, in infants and children under 5 years of age. In the preceding 6 years, the numbers were 663, 656, 628, 624, 707, and 724. 264 deaths took place in persons at and above 60, including 43 at and above 80; the corresponding numbers for the preceding year being 321, and 43. 248 deaths occurred from Tubercular or Consumptive diseases, the number for the preceding year being 311. 262 deaths arose from Pulmonary diseases, against 266 in 1862. 158 deaths took place in the Workhouse, 77 being those of males, and 81 those of females. The number was 120 in 1859; 137 in 1860; 160 in 1861; and 172 in 1862. 21 deaths occurred in the House of Correction ; and 1 in the House of Detention; most of these are not referable strictly to inhabitants of the Parish. The Accidental deaths were 19, against 23 in 1862 ; viz.: 6 from fractures and contusions, 4 from burns and scalds, 1 from drowning, 6 from the suffocation of infants, and 2 from other causes. Five deaths arose from the murder of infants, and 4 from suicide. The table appendid to this Report contains a list of the deaths arising from all causes, arranged according to the diseases which produced them, and the ages at which they occurred. 79 Inquests were held in the year; 57 upon those who had died from natural causes, producing sudden death, as disease of the heart, convulsions, &c.; 13 upon cases of accidents; 4 of suicide ; and 5 of child murder. 21 of these inquests were held in the House of Correction, and 1 in the House of Detention. On considering these numerical data, it is evident that the deaths were less than in the preceding year, but still beyond the average. Some increase of mortality must be expected with the annual increase of population; but according to the rate of increase in the last 10 years as ascertained by the census, the latter is small, amounting to only 90 per year, and not sufficient to raise the mortality so much above the average as it has been during the past year. The following Table will serve to show the comparative mortality of Clerkenwell with that of the other Districts of the Metropolis. It represents the mean proportion of deaths occurring annually in 100,000 persons living, during the 10 years 1851-60, corrected for the deaths in Hospitals by distributing them proportionally over the several Districts, and corrected also for the deaths in Workhouses situated out of the Districts to which they belong. 15 Rothbury 1,475 Newington 2,426 Hampstead 1,760 Greenwich 2,449 Lewisham 1,787 Strand 2,456 Hackney 1,880 West London 2,495 St. George, Hanover Rotherhithe 2,527 Square 1,891 Stepney Kensington 1,985 Mile End 2,553 Islington 2,095 Westminster 2,581 Wandsworth 2,194 Chelsea 2,615 London (City) 2,222 Bermondsey 2,638 Pancras 2,232 Holborn 2,641 St. James,Westminster 2,290 St. Luke 2,736 Clerkenwell 2,309 St. George, South wark 2,744 Camberwell 2,319 East London 2,762 St.Martin-in-the-Flds. 2,345 Whitechapel 2,841 Bethnal Green 2,352 St. Giles 2,846 Lambeth 2,353 St. Olave, South wark) 2,863 Poplar 2,359 St. Saviour „ Marylebone 2,404 St.George-in-the-East 2,879 Shoreditch 2,421 I have headed the Table with the mortality of the District of Rothbury, in Northumberland, which is the smallest of any district in England and Wales; its population amounts to very nearly that of our Goswell District. It is true that a rural district has many advantages over a densely crowded manufacturing district. For, in it, the inhabitants are scattered over more ground, and their habits are very different; they rise early in the morning, retiring early at night, and so avoiding the exposure to the excesses too often committed during late hours. They also breathe a purer air; the mothers are strong and hearty, and are enabled to suckle their children during the proper period ; while the mothers in crowded parishes are too closely confined within doors; too often obliged to work and neglect their children, whence these are fed upon improper food. If the mortality of Clerkenwell were as low as that of Rothbury, it would cause only 908 deaths yearly, instead of 1,509.

It will be noticed that the larger number of them, 289, occurred in infants and children under five years of age. The mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases, or those which are most fatal, is almost exactly the same as that of the previous year, 376 deaths having arisen from them. The details are given in the subjoined Table.— Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus (in Fever Hospital.) TOTALS.

During the year, this malady was quite epidemic in the metropolis, and prevailed to a much greater extent than even in 1859 and 1800, when it was also extremely prevalent; and it visited this Parish severely, as might be judged from the mortality it produced. This complaint is so completely under the control of vaccination, that no doubt, if vaccination were thoroughly carried 18 out, not only would the deaths be diminished, but the disease would be reduced to an extremely mild form, or would even vanish entirely from among us. In fact, the importance of vaccination is now so generally admitted, and its practice so ordinarily adopted among the more well-to-do classes, that the main question is, how the unvaccinated shall be found out. And I may remark, that whenever I have called at the houses where deaths from Small Pox have occurred, as is my custom, to ascertain why the deceased had not been vaccinated, and if there were others in the house who had not been vaccinated, the answer that the parent " had an objection to vaccination," which has been occasionally made, always appeared to be simply an excuse for the neglect; and that, in fact, the reason why so much small pox prevails, from the want of vaccination, is really that a certain number of parents thoughtlessly and carelessly omit to have their children vaccinated. If the provisions of the " Act further to extend and make compulsory the practice of Vaccination" were fully carried out, there would be but little trouble in ascertaining what children had not been vaccinated. For the Act requires that Medical Practitioners shall deliver to the Registrars a certificate of the successful Vaccination of each child; and if these were compared with a list of the births registered, the unvaccinated children could be readily discovered. But the Act is ineffective, for Medical Practitioners do not send these certificates, I believe from their not being acquainted with the Act. Neither has the Registrar General performed his part, in sending books and forms in which these entries might be made. And to call upon the parents of between 800 and 900 children, born in the parish every year, would require the appointment of a Special Inspector. During the year 26 cases of Small Pox were sent to the hospital, 3 deaths occurring among them. At this rate, the 26 deaths occurring in the parish would have arisen among 485 cases of the disease. But as the milder cases are not usually sent to the hospital, the absolute number of cases which occurred in the parish must have seen considerably larger than this. In the entire metropolis, 2012 deaths arose from it; and at the death rate in this parish, more than 17,437 cases of the disease must have existed. The Deaths from Measles were rather more than half those occurring in 1862, but twice as many as those occurring in 1861. The mortality from Typhus has suffered a diminution, although it is still high, having caused 50 deaths in this parish and 2892 in the entire metropolis. And it is with pleasure I bear testimony to the great amount of good done, although the 19 dant expense is considerable, by the removal of persons afflicted with Typhus or Small Pox, from the crowded and unhealthy dwellings in which they too often live, to the well-ventilated and well-managed Fever and Small Pox Hospitals. The patients thus cease to become centres of infection to all around, and the spread of the diseases is most materially prevented. It is satisfactory also to know, that patients suffering from these diseases are removed to the hospital in a special vehicle kept for the purpose, which has been provided by the Guardians of the Poor. In the early part of the year, a communication was received by the Vestry from the resident Medical Officer of the Fever Hospital, to the effect that more cases of Typhus were sent from Bishop's Court and Eagle Court, than from any other locality. Accordingly the Sanitary Committee inspected these and several other Courts, and ordered improvements to be made in the cleansing of the houses, provision of traps to the drains, &c. But the overcrowding and occupation of underground rooms was not interfered with. Ample evidence was afforded in these visits, that the inhabitants of the courts take so little care of themselves in a sanitary point of view, that the mortality inflicted upon them is to a considerable extent to be attributed to their own neglect. It may not be without interest, to extract from the Census of 1861, the results shewing the occupancy of the houses in some of the too crowded and ill-constructed courts of this parish. They are as follows:— Names of Courts No. of Houses No. of Occupants Aylesbury Place 28 136 Bishop's Court 11 226 29 inhabitants in No. 6. Bitt Alley 13 81 22 inhabitants in No. 12.

Yates' Rents 17 75 It does not follow, that because a house or court contains a large number of occupants, it must necessarily be overcrowded. But the Vestry are well aware that most of these courts are very confined, and the houses and rooms veiy small, and quite unfit for the number of occupants. The Zymotic diseases generally, are those especially to be considered by all engaged in sanitary improvements, not only because they are so prevalent and fatal, but because the conditions under which they are so, are well known, and can be to a great extent remedied. The first of these is infection, which is the most common cause of them. And in regard to this source, it is often painful to witness, especially among the poorer classes, the thoughtless manner in which they unnecessarily expose themselves and their children to sources of infection. This proceeding can only be obviated by better education upon the point; and a vestry or 21 sanitary officer can have little power here. The next point is the overcrowding, which is a fearful source of disease in this as in many other parishes. When four or five children are confined in one small dwelling-room, as is often the case, it is almost impossible for any of them to escape having an infectious disease, brought home perhaps by a child from school, or by a mother who has visited a sufferer. And it is extremely common to see 3, 4, or 5 children, all suffering from one of these complaints, crowded in one small room often with the upper window sash fixed, so that ventilation is impossible. Under these circumstances, a patient has not a fair chance of recovery, from having to breathe the vitiated air evolved by himself and by the rest, over and over again. We must look forward to the removal of the old and illarranged tenements forming the numerous courts, and to the erection of new and properly constructed ones. The process has begun among the wretched courts of Turnmill Street—Turk's Head Yard having been cleared of buildings, and Lamb Court having been emptied. The new model buildings in the Bagnigge Wells Road, and in Farringdon Road, will afford suitable accommodation to a number of the poor Inhabitants; but the rent will probably be too high for the poorer occupants of the worst courts. But independently of the houses in the courts, a large number of the rooms occupied in other houses are quite unfit for the use of a family, even if it were desirable that an entire family should occupy a single room. For they are too small, often with no back light, or means of ventilation, the window and door being frequently at the same end of the room, so that the pouch, as it may be termed, left, it is impossible to ventilate. And many rooms thus occupied are situated underground. Another point is the want of cleanliness, both of the apartments and the clothing. Among the poorer class, many of the mothers before marriage are in service, and any one of them can keep a house, with as many inmates as there are in their own apartment, clean and wholesome ; but when they have a home of their own, consisting of only a single room, it is too often in a very dirty state, quite unfit for health, and much more so for enabling the occupants to struggle through an infectious malady. In many cases, the poor are difficultly placed in this respect, for they have not a proper water supply, or have to fetch water from a distance. I always regret to have to allude to this circumstance, and to be unable to announce that there are proper Wash-houses in the Parish. I think also, that more pressure might be put upon the landlords of the Parish in regard to the cleansing of the walls and ceilings of the houses. The slaughter-houses and cow-houses are ordered to 22 be whited at least twice a year; while the houses of the poor are allowed to remain for years without this important means of purification. Age has an important influence upon mortality. The subjoined Table shows the number of inhabitants living and the proportion of deaths occurring in Clerkenwell:— Clerkenwell At all Ages Under 5 5 — 20 20—40 40—60 GO —80 80 and warda Both Sexes Males and Females Population 65681 (M. 31960) 8547 19631 22029 11616 3656 202 (F. 33721) Deaths 1509 ( M. 763 > 728 125 154 238 221 43 ( F. 746 J Per-centage 2.29 ... 8*51 0-63 0-69 2-04 6 04 21*2 It will be noticed that the mortality of children under five years of age is very great. Undoubtedly children at the early periods of life are more delicate and susceptible of disease than those of more advanced age and adults; and some allowance must be made for the circumstance, that many mothers have to work and cannot devote sufficient time and attention to the proper management of their children. Yet, the large number of deaths occurring among them from Zymotic diseases, shows that much of the mortality might be prevented, if proper care were taken in attending to the points previously alluded to. And reference to the Table showing the statistics of the mortality of Rothbury, will show that age alone is not the cause of the large mortality among them in this Parish. The least mortality occurs between 5 and 20 years of age; probably, because at this period, there is greater approximation to nature's laws, by the free exercise taken in the open air, and the least excess committed. At the period between 20 and 40, the consumptive class of diseases claims a large number of victims; close confinement in ill-ventilated rooms and workshops, with want of sufficient exercise, being at least predisposing causes. Between 40 and CO, consumptive diseases still retain their sway, pulmonary diseases, with those of the brain and liver, taking their share; and above CO, pulmonary disease, with general decay, to which all organic beings are subject, carry off the remainder of those who have been spared. 23 Cow-Houses.— Towards the end of the year, the cow-houses in the Parish were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself, prior to the issuing of the licenses. They were 31 in number, kept by 28 cowkeepers, and contained 669 cows. The keeping of cows in a crowded parish is always objectionable, on account of the noxious effluvia evolved by the decomposing dung, and the fermenting grains; in addition to the deterioration of the milk secreted by the animals in a confined state. In a few cases, great complaint was made of the nuisance arising, although the general condition of the cows and cowhouses was good. The nuisance can always be reduced to a great extent, by causing the dung to be removed often, and early in the morning, and by ensuring the thorough cleansing of the grainpits before each fresh addition of grains. It may be well to remark, that in consequence of neglect in the management of the cow-houses in St. James's Parish, Westminster, after repeated warning, the magistrates refused to grant licenses to any of the cow-keepers; so that cows are no longer kept in the Parish. And the result has been very satisfactory. For the property in the neighbourhood of the cow-houses has already improved, a better class of tenants occupy the houses, and no complaints are made of the quantity or quality of the milk to be obtained in the Parish. This may serve as a warning to the cow-keepers in this Parish, for the Vestry have decidedly the power to close any cowhouse which is a nuisance. Slaughter-Houses.—The slaughter-houses were also inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 43 in number, kept by 41 butchers. The complaints to be made against the slaughter-houses are of a minor kind. In a few cases, they are small, and the cattle have to be driven over the pavement to enter them ; but as regards the manner in which they are kept, the slaughter-houses in this Parish will well bear comparison with any others in the metropolis. Bakehouses.—The " Act for the regulation of Bakehouses " having come into force about the middle of the year, a notice of its provisions was sent to the bakers of the parish; but the bakehouses were not inspected during the year. Sanitary Improvements.—The following sanitary improvements were effected during the year: 340 feet of new sewer were constructed; 53 sewers were cleansed; 225 gullies were cleansed, 12 repaired, 2 trapped, 9 newly constructed; 39 houses were drained; 27 house drains laid; 36 cesspools emptied and filled up ; 224 cart-loads of soil carted away from sewers and gullies ; 1 new 24 urinal constructed; and numerous other improvements effected, such as the removal of filth, animals, &c, which it is not worth while to specify. The following Table expresses the meteorology of the year. 1863. Temperature, mean. Difference from mean of 92 years. Dew Point. Humidity. (Saturation = 100.) Height of Barometer. Rain, in Inches.

The amount of rain which fell during the year was less than the average. These conditions are important as regards mortality, for a warm year diminishes the number of deaths from pulmonary diseases, and a cool summer diminishes those arising from diarrhoea. A small amount of rain also prevents the proper washing away of the organic matter from the streets and the sewers, and from the air; and renders the gullies and traps ineffective.
