Owing to the death of Dr. Dixon, the Registrar for "Deptford Central," the Registrar - General, after a conference with the Greenwich Board of Guardians, rearranged the Registrars' districts, making them coterminous with one or more of the wards of the borough. In consequence of the alteration, the statistics of the borough will, in future, be based entirely on the population of the wards, 6 NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. As stated in my Report for 1908, this Act came into operation in this Borough on 27th December, 1909. Appointment and Duties of Health Visitor. Difficulty having arisen as to the legal power of a Sanitary Authority to appoint Health Visitors, the London County Council in Section 6 of their General Powers Act, 1908, obtained powers for each sanitary authority within the County of London, to appoint suitable women (to be known as "Health Visitors)," for the purpose of giving to persons advice as to the proper nurture, care, and management of young children, and the promotion of cleanliness and discharging such other duties (if any) as may be assigned to them in accordance with the provisions of this section. The approval of the Local Government Board having been received to the appointment of Miss McCleverty, of Luton, she took up her duties here on March 2nd, 1910. Miss McCleverty visits the homes of newly-born children, and gives advice to the mothers on the following subjects:— Feeding, cleanliness of the child and its surroundings. Need of fresh air. Danger of giving drugs and alcohol, except by doctors orders. Risks attending the use of teething powders and soothing mixtures, and general hygienic advice. In addition to the visiting, the Health Visitor keeps all the books in connection with her work, viz.:—A daily journal, and report book in which are entered all the details of the cases visited and her reports thereon. She also makes out a weekly return to the London County Council of the births notified. I have much pleasure in stating that she has carried out her duties in an efficient, tactful, and very thorough manner. 7 The following is a report on her work from the date of her appointment, March 2nd, to December 31st, 1910 :— Public Health Department. Town Hall, New Cross Road, S.E. February 4th, 1911. Sir, I beg to lay before you the following report on my work between the dates March 2nd and December 31st, 1910, inclusive. I have paid in all 1,995 visits, of which 1,552 were first visits, and 443 were revisits. The distribution of visits in the different wards was as follows :— E. N. N.W. S. S.E. S.W. Totals. Visits 679 405 231 20 138 79 1552 Revisits 231 101 67 1 34 9 443 Totals 910 506 298 21 172 88 1995 As a result of the adoption of the Notification of Births Act by this Borough, 2,786 births were notified during the course of the year 1910. This number does not represent the total number of births in the Borough during the year; and when it was found that so many were failing to notify the births of their children in accordance with the requirements of the Act, a careful check was kept, and to all those who failed to comply with the provisions of the Act, I had instructions to write. This check has been kept since the beginning of June, and from that date to the end of the year 1910 I have had to write to 190 parents on account of their failure to notify the births of their children. On receipt of my letter most of them have either replied apologising and pleading ignorance, or else have come up to the Town Hall to explain, but in 34 cases a second letter was necessary, and two cases, after being written to twice and no reply being received, were reported to the Public Health Committee. After a letter had been written to them by the Town Clerk these two parents finally sent in their notifications, 8 In accordance with the requirements of the Act I have re-copied the births notified each week on to a form specially provided for the purpose, and this form has been forwarded weekly to the London County Council. Among the 2,786 births notified were 34 sets of twins, of whom 62 were born living (28 males and 34 females) and six were still-born (two males and four females). Of the 62 born living 12 (eight males and four females) died under the age of seven months, and the other 50 were alive at the end of the year. Two sets of triplets were born, one set (all girls) died, two at a month, and the other at three months old. Of the other set (two girls and a boy) one girl died aged five days and the other two are still alive. The following table contains information with regard to the births notified in the different wards, giving the sex, whether born alive or dead, and by whom the birth was notified:— Ward. Births Notified. Alive. Dead. By whom Notified. Total. Males. Females Parent. Doctor. Midwife. Other Person.

I have not been brought into such close touch with the doctors as with the midwives, but whenever I have had reasons to go to them I have always found them most kind and willing to help in any way. By the mothers themselves I have been extremely well received; mine was a new appointment and they frequently were not expecting me at all, but I have had very little difficulty with any of them, either in getting into the house or in seeing the baby. They usually are anxious to carry out any suggestions I may make and the only two points on which I have had any real trouble with them is in the use of the baby's "comforter" or "dummy," and in the provision of 9 separate cots for the babies, so that they shall not sleep in bed with their parents. One can only hope that in time with the co-operation of the doctors and midwives we may educate the people to see the harm that these dummies do, and also the importance of the children not sleeping with their parents. The following table gives the result of my inquiries as to the feeding of the babies. In all cases I urge the extreme importance of breast feeding for as long a period as possible until the child is 9 months old. If I find that hand-feeding is necessary, I leave one of the leaflets drawn up by you, giving careful directions as to the feeding of the child, the cooking of the milk, and the bottle to be used, etc., etc. "Mixed feeding" in the table below means both breast and hand-fed.

It is therefore highly probable that a great many of the 1,103 children who were only breast fed on my first visit were later on hand fed as well in some way. The Committee of H. R. H. The Duchess of Albany's Deptford Fund have very kindly allowed me tickets, which enable me to give three dinners a week to two women on payment of a penny for each dinner, or to two children on payment of id. for each dinner. These dinners I have found specially useful for some of the mothers, who, at the time when I visit them just after their confinement, are in special need of nourishing food. I am in touch with the Deptford Branch of the Charity Organisation Society, with the Rescue Workers in the Borough and also with the Ladies' Committee for helping girls after they leave Greenwich Infirmary. 10 One or two cases of child neglect I have had to report to the N. S. P. C. C. and I have also referred several cases to the Relieving Officer for relief. Any sanitary defects found by me during my visits, I have reported to the Inspector for the District. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, E. A. McCleverty, H. W. Roberts, Esq., Health Visitor. Medical Officer of Health. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The following diseases are classified by the Registrar General under this heading:—Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough,"Fever" (Typhus, Enteric and Continued) Diarrhoea, Plague.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The arrangement for the bacteriological examination and report upon doubtful cases, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, was renewed by the Council with the Clinical Research Association of Watergate House, Adelphi, W.C. The number of examinations made by them during the year ending 31st Dectmter, 1910, was 160; beirg, for Diphtheria 35 positives and 114 negatives; for Enteric Fever 4 positives and 7 negatives. At a cost of £28 19 6. DISINFECTION. Disinfection is carried out at the New Disinfecting Station, Watson Street, by means of two machines of the Washington-Lyons pattern, in which all articles of clothing are disinfected. For such infected articles which would be injured by steam : leather goods, furs, boots, &c., are disinfected by formic aldehyde, volotised in an alformant-lamp in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. There are two vans employed, one used for collecting infected articles, and the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions, all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is made. The number of rooms disinfected by the Council's staff during the year was 1,351. The number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected being 5,193. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis where required. See Tables 20, 21, 22 and 23. 17 Disinfection of wearing apparel, &c., under the Midwives Act, was carried out in five cases. Eighty-six books belonging to the Council's Public Library, collected from houses where infectious diseases had occurred, were disinfected before being put back into circulation. Seven premises consisting of twenty rooms were fumigated during the year, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, as being verminous. SCHOOLS CLOSED.

The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common Lodging-houses. The following is a list of Common Lodging-houses registered in this district, providing accommodation for 437 persons; in addition to which there is Carrington House, Brookmill Road, which provides for 802 lodgers.

The principal sections of the Act are Sections 15 and 17. Section 15 (l), gives the Council power to compel the landlord of a house, let after the passing of the Act, to keep it in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. Sub-section (2), gives power to enter, on giving 24 hours' notice in writing to the tenant or occupier, for the purpose of viewing the state and condition thereof. General power of entry is provided for in Section 36, on giving 24 hours' notice in writing to the occupier and to the owner. Section 17 (l), makes it the duty of the Council to cause to be made from time to time, an inspection of their district, with the view to ascertaining whether any dwelling house therein is in such a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. The Order of the Local Government Board made under the above section states that "the Council shall make provision for a thorough inspection to be carried out from time to time, according to the varying needs or circumstances of the dwelling houses or localities in their district." The Local Government Board have intimated that it will be advisable for the Council, when practicable, to resort to the provisions of Section 15 for securing that houses are kept by the landlord in habitable repair, in preference to enforcing the powers conferred upon them by Section 17 in regard to the closing and demolition of houses which become unfit for human habitation, inasmuch as the closing of houses involves a decreased amount of accommodation in the district, whereas such objection is obviated by dealing with cases under Section 15. Broadly speaking, the great difference between the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Housing Act of 1909, is that under the former we can only deal with defects which are a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health; whereas under the latter we can deal with all "defects," such as defective, or the absence of, facilities for cooking, washing, storage of food, &c., which would render the premises unfit for human habitation in the ordinary acceptance of the term, and in the event of the notice to remedy the defects not being complied with, the Council, by resolution, can make an order closing the premises. 25 HOUSE PROPERTY INSPECTIONS, &c. A summary of the sanitary work done during the year will be found in Table No. 27. The total number of premises inspected was 4,631, whilst re-inspections, calls, services of notices, etc., amounted to 15,454. The number of preliminary notices or "intimations" served during the year was 2,284, whilst the number of "statutory notices" served was 166, and in only one case was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders. Overcrowding was abated in 18 cases without having to take legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year 34 observations were made, and in 6 cases where black smoke was emitted in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, notices were served to abate the nuisance. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The bylaws relating to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, made by the Council pursuant to Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 :— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of houses so let or occupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. (e) For the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises. (f) For the taking of precautions in case of infectious disease. The number on the register is 273, the whole of which were regularly inspected with a view to seeing that they comply with the bylaws as regards cleanliness, overcrowding, etc. PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. These premises have been periodically inspected during the year. The number of inspections for the year was 153, and include hotel kitchens, restaurant kitchens, coffee shops, eating houses, fried fish shops, eel pie shops, oyster bars, ham and beef cooking and sausage making and meat-chopping premises, &c., or any place where food is cooked or prepared for sale to the public, or intended for human consumption, 26 Premises added to the register during the year were 20 and removals 12, leaving 119 premises on the register. Twenty-nine notices were served for amendment of various defects and for cleansing, and these were complied with. The premises were found generally well kept and in good condition and the occupier always ready to comply with any request as to amendment or cleanliness of the premises. BAKEHOUSES. The number on the register at the end of the year was 72, 69 as "workshops" and 3 as "factories." During the year one was added to the register and five removed. One was closed in consequence of tramway extensions. Underground premises in use at the end of the year was 25. Cleansing and Limewashing. The cleansing and limewashing was regularly done in accordance with the regulations, and any defect or insanitary conditions immediately remedied on discovery. The number of inspections was 244, and in only two cases was it necessary to serve written notices. No legal proceedings were necessary. The bakehouses throughout the borough are kept in a satisfactory condition. Certificates of Underground Premises. During the year certain underground premises were vacated and re-occupied. Section 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, deals with underground bakehouses, fixing the conditions under which they shall be occupied or used, and while providing for a certificate to be granted, does not provide for the transfer of such certificate to a future occupier, in case of closing or sale of the premises. And though it would appear to be the intention of legislation to limit the number of underground premises, and that the said premises should not be re-occupied or used after being closed, still no provision has been made and the evil continues, and the premises are relet and occupied on the original certificate. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES AND OUTWORKERS. These premises were regularly visited during the year. Special attention was paid to sanitary accommodation for persons employed. During the year 27 new w.c's. for the above were 27 provided. Much better attention is now paid to the question of sanitary accommodation for workpeople than formerly, owing to a continual application of the provisions of the Acts relating thereto. The registers were kept posted up for the year. Factories. The number of factories on the register at the end of the year, including bakehouses and laundries, was 123 involving 273 rooms. 159 inspections were made and 18 written intimations served. Workshops. The number of workshops on the register at the end of the year was 264 (including bakehouses and laundries and domestic workshops) with 410 rooms. The work carried on in the various workshops consisted in additions to bakehouses and laundries: of dressmaking, millinery, shirt and collar making, tailoring, mantles and blouse making, wheelwrights' and smiths' work, cycle and motor work. The number of inspections was 439. Number of written intimations served 15. Workplaces. The number of workplaces on the register at the end of the year was 170 (including food premises, kitchens, etc.) with 315 rooms. Inspections for the year numbered 200, and 30 intimations were served. These premises include stables, builders' yards, restaurants, kitchens, etc. Outworkers. The number of premises on the register at the end of the year was 565, using 572 rooms. The number added during the year was 173 and cancelled 83. The number of inspections for the year was 258 and 6 intimations served. The lists received from employers in the borough numbered 76, giving the names and addresses of 532 persons employed. The references received from other authorities were 629, and forwarded to other authorities 310. In three instances work was found in connection with infected premises, and in each case the necessary disinfection of the materials on hand was carried out, before being returned to the employers of the outworkers in question. 28 I should like to point out the continued increase of the work in this department since the duty was imposed upon the local authorities in its present form by the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. The varied and fluctuating character of the work, owing to removal, change of address, and decease of outworkers from time to time, and the correction of registers, etc., absorbs a great proportion of the Inspector's time, and thus the actual inspections of premises are not so numerous as is desirable. The work is all-important, as the moving of the work from employer to worker and vice versa, is a frequent means of the propagation of infection, and every opportunity should be taken for checking this by frequent inspection of the outworkers' premises, more than can be done at present, and most especially during epidemics of measles or small pox. No legal proceedings were necessary during the year. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS AND PURVEYORS OF MILK. These premises were constantly inspected during the year. The number on the register at the end of the year was 206. During the year 52 were added and 45 were cancelled by closing of premises or transfers. The number of inspections were 474 and 6 notices served. One prosecution was taken under the provisions of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders for carrying on the business of a "purveyor of milk" without registration, and the offender was fined 10s. and costs. The usual cleansing and limewashing of premises was carried out, and any other repairs found necessary were duly enforced, and where necessary, corroded cans and measures were prohibted. Infectious Cases.-Only three cases of infectious disease occurred during the year in connection with Dairy, Cowshed and Milkshop premises. In each case action was taken in accordance with the orders, the sale of milk, or contact with the premises, being prohibited until after disinfection and certification of the premises by the Medical Officer of Health. The cases were:—Scarlet Fever 2 cases. Measles 1 „ 3 „ 29 ICE CREAM. These premises received the usual attention during the season of the year in which the business is carried on, and, where necessary, cleansing, renewal of vessels, etc., carried out. The number of premises on the register at the end of the year was 122; 6 were added during the year and 16 cancelled. This shows a reduction of 10, which is satisfactory. I am pleased to report that there is less of the Italian element in this business in the borough than formerly, and consequently less of the itinerant vendor, carrying on the barrow trade in the street. The itinerant vendor of the street is a constant danger, being continually exposed to the dust and other accumulations of the street, together with the habit of repeated use of the same glasses by different persons, principally children. The personal cleanliness of the itinerant vendor's is not of the best, and although constant supervision is exercised over them, it is very difficult to enforce the regulations, and the better remedy would be the entire prohibition of the itinerant vendor; the article to be sold only in duly registered premises, as in the case of milk, which should form one of the principal ingredients of the ice cream. The number of Inspections was 172; and the number of notices served 6. No prosecutions were necessary during the year. COWSHEDS. The following are the Cowsheds in the Borough at present licensed by the London County Council:— Weston, J. & Sons, 33 Octavius Street 25 cows. Do. 211 Railway Arches, Edward Street 17 cows. Total 42 cows. One Cowshed at 178-182 Grove Street was closed during the year, and no further license applied for. The periodical cleansing and limewashing was regularly carried out in accordance with the bylaws. Number of Cowsheds in the Borough 2 Number of Cows allowed 42 Number of Inspections for the year 23 30 SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The following are the slaughter houses in the Borough at present licensed by the London County Council :— Wellbeloved, Alfred, 180 Brockley Road. Lane, Frank, and Wellbeloved, Sidney John, 13a High Street. Williams, William, Friendly Mews, Friendly Street. Owing to the decease of the licensee of 13a High Street, during the year, the license was transferred by the London County Council to the above occupiers. The premises were cleansed and limewashed every quarter as required by the bylaws. Number of slaughter houses in the Borough 3 Number of Inspections for the year 40 OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. There are still three premises in the Borough of offensive businesses under the offensive trade regulations of the London County Council, viz.:— Messrs. Wheen & Sons, Ltd., Copperas Street. Messrs. Hill & Sons, Ltd., 1 Frankham Street. Mr. Alfred Sharp, 6 Edward Street. Number of inspections during the year 49 The premises were periodically cleansed and limewashed in accordance with the regulations. I am pleased to report that very few complaints were received in reference to these premises, and that they were well supervised. CANAL BOATS. Annual Report for the Year 1910. January 2nd, 1911. Gentlemen, I beg to present my report under the Canal Boats Acts as follows, for the year ending 31st December, 1910 :— For the purpose of inspection during the year, 19 visits were made on the following dates, viz.:—February 15th and 25th; March 4th, 14th and 30th; May 5th, 11th and 30th; June 9th; July 6th, 12th, 16th and 25th; August 17th and 31st; October 5th and 26th; December 8th and 20th. 31 Boats were found and inspected on the following dates, viz.:— March 4th (two boats), 14th and 30th (two boats), May 11th (two boats), June 9th (two boats), July 12th and 25th, August 17th and 31st (two boats), October 5th, December 8th and 20th.

Children on Boats. During the year children of school age were found in four boats, in each case information was forwarded to the local education authority for their attention. On June 9th, notice was received under the Notification of Births Act, 1907, of a child born on the boat "Swan," No. 467, while lying off Messrs. Weston & Westall's wharf, Windmill bridge. The boat left on the 11th, when the mother and child were doing well. No cases of sickness were found on the boats during the year. The boats inspected were found in a clean habitable condition. The canal under the jurisdiction of this authority is very little used. This borough is not a registration authority. The arrangements made for the inspection of boats are—Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector, duly appointed an inspector under the Canal Boats Acts jointly with other duties as Inspector of Workshops, Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, etc. 32 Name and address of Inspector—Thomas Turner, 161 St. Asaph Road, Brockley, S.E.
