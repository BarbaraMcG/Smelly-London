3615 Paddington METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25TH MARCH, 1875. Paddington. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF THE VESTRY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25TH MARCH, 18 7 5. 2 The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board it returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (August excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow ; viz.:— All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre ol such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace WARD Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road ONE and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1, and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of ward Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite two. the West end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. 1, and a line drawn from the boundary warD such Ward Southward along the centre of three Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. ward four. All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Boro' of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 14 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', „ John's, „ Mary's, Holy Trinity, St. Paul's, All Saints', St. Matthew's, St. Luke's, „ Saviour's, „ Michael and All Angels, Christ Church, St. Mary Magdalene, „ Peter's, „ Stephen's. 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road, near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines, Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George, Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board meeting at the Vestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Vestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by the Imperial Gas Light Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.:— the Grand Junction Water Works Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. The population, as shewn by the Census taken in 1871, is as under, viz.:— Ward No. 1 21,793 „ „ 2 41,029 „ „ 3 18,469 4 15,522 Making a total of 96,813 The number of inhabited houses being 11,874. 6 The Rates levied since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act to the end of the year I874, are as under, viz.:— s. d. £ For the year I856 2 I based upon a rateable value of 522,570 I857 2 6 „ 538,879 I858 2 4 „ 582,995 I859 2 7 „ 605,382 I860 3 0 „ 625,479 l86I 2 8 „ 643,063 I862 2 8 „ 6I7,840 I863 2 8½ „ 646,256 I864 3 0 „ 663,I72 I865 3 0 „ 685,434 I866 3 2 „ 704,7I4 I867 3 6 „ 729,838 I868 3 5½ „ 740,686 I869 3 9 „ 759,I58 I870 4 0 „ 773,524 Under the Provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, I869.

Vestry Hall; May 26th, 1875. To THE Rev. Chairman and Gentlemen, This Annual Report is the Eighth and the last time I shall have the honor of collecting and distributing information upon the Sanitary and vital statistics of your parish. In the whole series of Reports, such records have been presented to you as will be found useful to a Sanitary authority, and I hope available in the future, and for practical ends, presuming as I do, that Sanitary organization has in view the limiting or prevention of certain classes of disease, the causes of which are ascertainable and removable. Sanitary authorities are yet very indifferent to the study of practical Hygiene, and the large amount of life sacrificed by the neglect of means at their command for improving the public health. For example—The Zymotic diseases sweep through the country year after year and 4 excite very little alarm, although they carry off one hundred and twenty thousand persons. The Tubercular or wasting diseases, the great consuming plague of the British Islands, take off another hundred thousand, chiefly persons in the prime of life. Lastly, amongst the class of deaths to which I always give great prominence, is Infant mortality, or the excessive deathrate in young children under 5 years of age. Tables II., III., IV., indicate the annual loss of life from each of these causes in this parish, and Table V. shows the total result during the last eight years. TABLE I. The following Tables shows the number of Births and Deaths during the last 4 Quarter:— Quarter ending Births. Deaths. Excess of Births over Deaths. Total. Rate for 3months per 1,000 Total.

The large registration sub-district which this is, being a part of Kensington, now above 100,000, is no longer 5 cally useful taken as a whole. Table VII. shows the mortality in different districts. The birth-rate, 27.7 per 1000 of population, shows a thriving state of the people. At the same time, the increase of population, (950 births in excess of deaths,) is attended with a high death-rate in some quarters of the Parish. TABLE II. The following Table shows the Annual, Quarterly, and Comparative Mortality from Zymotic Diseases:— Causes of Death. April, May, June, July, August, Septem., October, Novem., Decern.

The Diptheritic cases, too, have been unusually numerous, and Whooping Cough has prevailed extensively in the parish. During the height of the Epidemic of Scarlet Fever in certain districts and threatening this neighbourhood, it appeared desirable to resort amongst other things to all preventive measures possible to guard against further extension. 6 The Sanitary and Public Health Committee therefore issued a letter, drawing attention to the necessity of urging upon families where Fever does exist, the propriety of keeping their children from attendance at School while the Fever continues, as it was found by the Inspector's Reports that infection is communicated by children coming into contact with each other at Schools. This letter was sent to Ministers of Religion, District Visitors, and Medical Practitioners, and has exercised some important influence in preventing the extension of this Epidemic, since that, the London School Board District Inspector has communicated to the Sanitary Inspector the name and address of numerous families whose children were absent from School from Fever. The visits of the Inspector to these houses have been attended with most excellent results. Amongst other efforts to diffuse Sanitary knowledge, the Society of Medical Officers of Health issued a sheet of " Suggestions for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, such as Scarlet Fever, Small-Pox, &c." A second edition of 10,000 copies of my "Practical Sanitary Hints, &c." was also distributed with the annual notices from house to house in the parish. In all of these, attention is particularly directed to the provisions of the Sanitary Acts, in regard to "Infectious Diseases." Would it were made compulsory that the 600 Local Boards of the country did as much to protect the lives of their constituents, we should hear less of the sad consequences of their neglect, and the saving of much suffering to the community.

That however is too high. TABLE IV. The following Table shows the Annual, Quarterly, and Comparative Mortality from Tubercular Class of Diseases:— Causes of Death.

A few final remarks on this long standing nuisance cannot be out of place in this my last Annual Eeport. During the whole period of my official career in this parish, and also that of my predecessor, every attempt made by us, supported by the Sanitary and Public 9 Health Committee, has failed to abate to any appreciable degree the dangerous consequences likely to ensue from the foul and stagnant water of the basin. The large amount of mud at the bottom, and the refuse matters in transit on the wharves, house dust, garbage, offal, street sweepings of probably one-third of London, amounting to hundreds of tons, besides this, the manure of thousands of horses, are loaded daily at the Paddington Canal Basin into the barges. Since the completion of the Metropolitan main drainage system, fortunately for us, no foecal matter has been mixed with the other general refuse, or the consequences must have been long since felt, and would have proved decidedly dangerous to the public health. The Directors of the Grand Junction Canal have been interviewed on more than one occasion, and have generally expressed themselves willing to take any steps that could be suggested, but beyond letting off and changing the stagnant water when it had begun to be putrid in hot weather, or in the partial annual removing of a portion of the mud in the Basin, no thoroughly efficient methods have been adopted of regulating the noxious traffic carried on on their premises. The recommendations made from time to time, and the provisions of the Local Act have never been carried out, nor does it appear that action has yet been taken in the right direction, although the Vestry empowered the Sanitary and Public Health Committee to resort to proper legal methods. As a nuisance injurious to health under the Nuisance Removal Act, the Magistrate refuses to convict. B 10 Therefore,beyond constant inspection,even including Sundays, and the orders for enforcing speedy removal, and the infliction of fines for detention of loaded barges, nothing effectual is done to remedy the imperfect system of conducting trades in manure and refuse. The recent conviction of the Company in the case of the explosion of gunpowder in October last has an important bearing upon the present position of this Company, and the aspect of indifference manifested by the Directors in regard to the dangers to public health. Great danger will most certainly sooner or later arise from the neglect of enforcing Sanitary regulations. Those who are concerned in carrying on noxious trades in densely populated districts, ought to be aware of the responsibility resting upon them, should they fail to adopt all practicable measures for abating or preventing a dangerous nuisance. An explosion of epidemic disease is by no means improbable, and should it be proved to arise from neglect of Sanitary laws, it might be, and ought to be, as costly a matter for the Canal Company as that of the gunpowder explosion in October last. The following trades are (more or less noxious,) carried on to a large extent on the wharves of the Canal Basin. The trades alluded to are—1. Contracts for the collection, sifting and removal of dust, ashes, house refuse, garbage, &c.; 2. Deposits of street sloppings, scavenging, or street sweepings; 3. Deposits and loading of manure from stables. The Canal will always give a great deal of trouble. It is chiefly owing to the stagnant water turning putrid during the summer months, and arises through 11 tive cleansing or removal of the mud and other offensive matter deposited at the bottom of the Basin.* Amongst the remedies 1. a concrete bottom has been suggested. 2. The water to be changed much more frequently than it is, and could be done by letting it off occasionally. 3. It might even be converted into a running stream.† 4. It would be quite feasible to buy the ground for building purposes, and remove the noxious businesses further into the country. It should have a thorough cleansing during winter months, and dredges used all the year round. But the putrid water, whether let off or not, will always be a very great annoyance to the inhabitants of the District, as well as to those residing in the line of sewers through which the water passes. On one occasion the running off of the water made the tunnel of the Metropolitan Railway exceedingly offensive. * Note.—From my Sixth Quarterly Report as Public Analyst for Sept. 1874. The water of the Canal Basin, between Bishop's Road and Praed Street, was examined nearly every day during the hot weather of July 1874, and is continued at intervals, the object being to make a record of the actual organic, or sewage contamination of the water. July 7th.—The temp, of the water, 4°F. higher than the atmosphere in the shade. Three dead cats were observed. The odour from the water was very strong, and large bubbles of gas rose frequently from the decomposing matter at the bottom. Two samples of this gas were examined and found to contain Marsh gas, sulhuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid. Such exhalations may be injurious to the ealth of persons who breathe air contaminated with them. July 18th.—Temp, of water 70° F. Colour, greenish yellow, very strong odour. Three dogs under Bishop's Road Bridge in a state of decomposition. Free ammonia very high. July 29th.—Temp. 68° F., temperature of air 62° F. Water, yellow green— muddy. Manurial refuse visible. Organic impurity about the same in amount as when last taken. Very little change in water till Aug. 10th, when the general temperature is lower. Sept. 3rd.—Analyses shew little difference in amount of latent organic impurity, but it is less evident to the senses, probably owing to the atmospheric causes. Chemically speaking, the water is little better than sewage. † Report on the pollution of the water and cleansing of the Canal Basin, 1868. 12 Systematic Inspection of the Tenant-House Dwellings of the Parish. The practice of employing one inspector for this special duty of Systematic Inspection from house to house, has been in operation for eight years in this parish, and it is found that he requires 15 months to get over the whole work allotted to him. In 1871 a report was made upon the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors, and it was then believed that 20 to 40 houses could be inspected daily, and would enable one Inspector to get round the parish in the year, and visit some blocks or groups of streets 3 or 4 times during the year. He has however not been able to do so. I have before observed that this kind of Sanitary work is attended, with marked success. Records now exist of the exact state of every house in the following streets, vide Tables VI., their population, or families on each floor, or in single rooms, the condition of rooms as to overcrowding, the water supply, cleanliness, drainage, &c. The names and addresses of owner, occupier or agent. In order to form a basis for the future comparison I have for some time endeavoured to tabulate districts, or blocks of streets in different localities, vide TableVII., page 16, each of which might with advantage be separately studied. 13 Showing the Systematic Inspection of Tenant-house Dwellings of the Parish.

In my report of 1871, I gave the "composition" of certain streets, and compared death rates. I have again done so, and much regret to find the comparison, as might be expected shows a higher death-rate in some streets, than the general rate of the parish, but it is far less than most of the tenanthouse population throughout the metropolis generally. It will be seen from the preceding tables that there are nearly three thousand dwelling houses under regular inspection. This does not include the mewses and stables of the parish, which are under the charge of 17 Inspector Clifford, and were at one time also under the same kind of systematic inspection as the tenant-houses until the work got interrupted by the epidemic of Smallpox in 1872, and since the pressure of other duties. The importance of house to house, and room inspection, extending to the mews and stables, will be shown by the fact that there were at my last estimate in 1872, about 120 mews in the parish under inspection, containing upon the average in the stables, 50 horses, and in the rooms above, 40 adult persons, 35 youngchildren in each mews. The gross amount of population in streets of the tenant-house character is about 33,000, and of these 17 per cent. are children under 5 years of age. The amount of sanitary work undertaken by the Vestry for promoting the comfort and health of this class of persons can scarcely be appreciated, without personal knowledge of the many details it involves. Overcrowding is kept down as far as possible, for practically no fixed arbitrary law can be peremptorily carried out. It is not possible to secure 500 cubic feet of breathing space for the adults, and 250 for each child. It will be seen from Tables VI. that vast numbers of families are living in single rooms. Amongst these many who earn good wages, could well afford to pay for two rooms. I must add that too frequently the scantiness of house accommodation has arisen from the improvident and drinking habits of parents, and the consequent reduction of the family, either to absolute pauperism, or the verge of it, which is worse. If we take the average of a working-class family, c 18 man and wife and 2 or more children, 300 cubic-feet for each person would be the maximum space that they live in. In some of these single rooms dangerous overcrowding exists. Inspector Biorn has found as many as 7 or 8 individuals of the same family in one room, but rarely, if at all, immoral overcrowding existed, or has been reported to me. Medical Officers of Health are content with an average of 300 cubic feet space, because our public boards could not at present carry through the enforcement of a law requiring more air space for dwellings, but all their inquiries into death-rates, show that the unwholesome state of the abodes of the poor leads to a large development of diseases under the heads of mal-nutrition, convulsions, tubercular meningitis, atrophy and debility in young persons, and this defective brain-nutrition in after-life, sooner or later brings about habits of crime and pauperism. Pauper Cases under treatment during the year. The register of cases treated during the year by Dr. Lyle and Dr. Hibberd is inspected weekly, with a view of ascertaining the seat of Zymotic diseases that may have occurred in the two districts assigned to each of the Poor-Law Surgeons. The name, age, and residence of cases under the headings of Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Fevers, Erysipelas, Diarrhoea, Bronchitis, Malaria, Rheumatic Fever, Phthisis, &c., are noted, and if 19 any remarks are appended by the Poor-Law Officers as to insalubrity, over-crowding, or other conditions which require the interference of the Sanitary Officers, as regards cleansing, disinfecting, &c., they are at once attended to. It is remarkable how few cases of Zymotic diseases occur in the Poor-Law practice of these districts. It would be desirable for much more details to be given as to the social state of patients under Poor-Law treatment. These records should enable anyone to ascertain how large a proportion were living in kitchens, in dark and noisome places, without proper clothing, beddiug, and washing and cooking utensils; a further history of the cases should be noted as to the drinking and improvident habits of adults, the School attendance of the children; it might then be shown how much and almost entirely, these things were concerned in the production of pauperism and crime, in the promotion as well as the cure of disease affecting masses of the population, and for which as a remedial agent the mere habit of prescribing medicines for their ailments alone, is but a delusion. The cases of infectious diseases under treatment are all enquired into or removed, but since the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals have been established, infectious forms of disease are not admitted into the Workhouse Infirmary. Registration Returns. At the request of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee in January last, I made a Report, with a 20 recommendation relative to the mode of obtaining returns of the births and deaths of this Parish. For many years previous to December 30th, these returns had been sent from the Registrar-Generals Office to Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis; it was an uuusual course, and attended with some inconvenience, but adopted with a desire to aid the labors of Medical Officers of Health. Under the new Registration Act, the duty of procuring such returns as may be required for sanitary purposes is imposed upon the Sanitary Authorities, and I need scarcely say that they cannot get on without them ; the fact being that they are no less essential for sanitary work in any district than appreciated as they deserve to be by the public. The arrangement I have made with the two Registrars of this Parish, and which has been duly sanctioned by the Vestry is this:—the returns of births and deaths are made up weekly up to Saturday night, and are sent on the following Monday on the forms provided for that purpose. The expense agreed upon is 25s. for the first 50 entries each quarter, and 2d. for each succeeding entry; and it is agreed that notice of deaths from epidemic forms of disease shall be sent at once during epidemic seasons, or at the request of the Medical Officer of Health. It was ascertained that any attempt to procure these returns without payment to the Registrars would be futile, more particularly as in the Registration Act it was settled that a claim of not less than 2d. could be made for the work imposed upon the Registrars. 21 The Dust Removal Contract. Last year the Dust Removal Contract was a source of great trouble. The imperfect manner in which it was carried out lead to the most grievous complaints from householders in all quarters. In May, and the early part of June, 520 complaints were made in 8 days, no attention being paid to the D Card placed in the windows, therefore letters and complaints poured in daily. The Contractor paid no attention to anything but the written orders sent from the Vestry Clerk. That was utterly insufficient to abate the nuisances existing in all parts of the parish. The Sanitary and Public Health Committee found that the plan of enforcing a fine for non-removal, and to prove the case was a crude and troublesome process; but the powers conferred by the contract to employ other persons, and, a Resolution of the Committee authorizing me to act upon it, had the desired effect. The following letter was perfectly successful, and in only a few instances were extra carts employed. The following is a Draft of Letter to the Dust Contractor:— MR. COLLINS, Sir, The Sanitary and Public Health Committee have had under consideration the Resolution referred to them by the Vestry at their last meeting relative to the non-removal of Dust and have had again brought before them numerous complaints from householders in all directions as to the refusal and neglect to remove their dust. The serious sanitary nuisances arising from so 22 large an accumulation of dust, and the failure on your part to remove the grievance of the rate-payers, have induced the Committee to pass a Resolution, empowering me to take such steps as 1 may deem necessary to protect them. I therefore think right to inform you, that unless you comply with the terms of your Contract, and reduce the large number of requests for dust removal, by having the carts in streets twice in every week, and undertake to remove the dust from the houses, either at the verbal request of the inhabitants of the said house, or on the intimation of requiring dust removal, by the Letter D in the window, or by the notice to you from the Vestry, I shall feel it my duty to cause the dust to be removed, with or without further notice to you, than herewith stated, at your expense. I need scarcely say that it is absolutely necessary for the health and comfort of the inhabitants that prompt and vigorous efforts should be made to remedy this scandalous neglect on your part to remove the dust. I have instructed the Inspectors of Nuisances to inspect and report all cases to me of the neglect of removal; and shall not hesitate to act on the terms of your Contract, and employ carts and men to remove and dispose of the dust, &c., accumulated on premises throughout this Parish. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, WM. HARDWICKE, Medical Officer of Health. Slaughter-houses. There are 26 slaughter-houses in this Parish, which are as usual visited and reported upon by the Inspector Clifford, although last year the new Act places them under the Metropolitan Board of Works, they have only recently issued their new Bye-Laws for the future regulation. They have within the last three years been greatly improved by having the cattle-pens 23 properly paved with York flag-stones, and drained, all joints made in Portland cement; the offal is removed almost daily; sleeping-rooms, if found over any slaughter-houses, are closed, or not permitted to be used for the men to sleep in. The ventilation has also been greatly improved ; and I may add, that of late through this constant supervision, the owners of these places have shown a great willingness to carry out any reasonable suggestion made to them for constructive works. If the proposed regulations be strictly carried out with regard to site, it will close several slaughterhouses in various parts of the metropolis, and lead eventually to the erection of Public Abattoirs. Cow-houses. These are 14 in number in this Parish, and also have been very much improved in a sanitary point, the channels being paved with York and cement joints, the number of cows reduced, and ventilation improved by taking away the lofts over the cows, or shafts made for better ventilation. Manure is insisted upon removal daily, and for some time I have not received any complaints of offensive smells from them. Dead-house, or Public Mortuary. Although not so large and convenient as it might be, this place is becoming a great boon to the Parish. The Inspector pays daily visits, and since the Vestry appointed a man who had previously had great experience at St. Mary's Hospital, to be placed at the disposal of the Inspector, it adds greatly to the convenience of medical men who have to attend for 24 making post mortem examinations. There has been amongst other improvements, a more plentiful supply of water. Special coffins for the reception of infectious diseases, with glass let into the lids, so that the Coroners' Juries may view the body without any danger to themselves; disinfectants are largely used, and the ventilation attended to. I have not received any complaints from the inhabitants of the house immediately in rear, still I trust the Vestry will, at some future day, see the desirability of erecting a mortuary and dead-house, more or less in connexion with a disinfecting chamber, and the whole placed under the charge of a resident attendant upon the spot. The number of bodies brought to the Mortuary during the year, shows an annual increase, and the objections of persons to remove the corpse from a single room, inhabited by a family, are less heard of than formerly. Inquests were held upon 64 out of the 93 bodies that were brought from various parts of the Parish. Urinals and W.C. Accommodation. The number of public urinals ought to be increased throughout the Parish, and not only public but the private one s of taverns and public houses should have constant water supply served on a simple mode of construction. I have for many years advocated public water closets, with an attendant at all the cab-stands. They should be constructed for male and female accommodation, and might easily be made self-supporting. 25 Manure from Mewses. I trust the day is not far distant when the plan of collecting manure spoken of in my former Reports will be attended to. The manure should be deposited in public receptacles of the mews, and removed by the local authority daily, or dealt with in a similar way to the removal of house-refuse. The removal of manure might be made a profitable undertaking. The systematic inspection of these mews might well occupy one special officer, and is a matter well worthy of the consideration of the Vestry. The last two years Inspector Clifford has had to perform more work than could be reasonably expected from him, his time being much occupied in the more frequent inspection than formerly of the slaughter and cow-houses, marine-stores, fried fish-shops, the wharves on the canal—the latter requiring daily visits, including Sundays, during the summer,— and the increasing demand by the more wealthy inhabitants of the Parish for his services in the investigation of complaints and suggestions for the sanitary improvement of their houses has encroached largely upon him. Bake-houses. These are frequently inspected. (See last year's Report.) Fried Fish-shops. Fried fish-shops are sadly complained of by neighbours. These places, as well as rag, fat, and bone-shops, D 26 should be subject to a licence before they are allowed to be opened, and certain conditions should be observed. A hood might be erected over the pans for frying, and the fumes carried off by a tall chimney. The fumes are so powerful that they taint the air and make it noxious for 50 yards distance; and I think the great mistake made in the construction of these places is, that this business instead of being carried on the ground floor, or in the basement, should be done at the top of the premises, so that the passers-by and the whole neighbourhood would better escape the stench that comes from them. Rag, Bone, and Fat Collection, known as Marine-stores. These are under frequent inspection, more particularly during the summer months. Covered receptacles have been introduced for the reception of fat and bones; they are frequently limewhited. From the closely crowded streets in which they are generally placed they are a source of nuisance to neighbours, and special legislation is much needed for these places. They should be included in the list of noxious businesses. Storage rooms should be entirely separated from the living rooms, and if possible in a cool place. It is essential that they should be licensed by the local authority, and certain conditions observed, more particularly the prohibition of the boiling or melting of fat which takes place in the early morning, surreptitiously, or after sunset. 27 Fever Ambulance Number of times used during the years ending December, 1872, 1873, and 1874:— 1872. 1873. 1874.

One of the last questions I had under consideration at the request of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, was the best methods of removing persons to Hospitals whilst suffering from infectious diseases. It involves questions of the highest Sanitary interest to the community; the kind of vehicles and attendants, the authority who ought to provide them, the isolation of patients, the methods of cleansing and disinfecting of bedding, rooms, garments, and carriages. I must refer those interested in this question to the Report itself for the details and recommendations. I venture to make suggestions for future guidance—with an expression of hope that at no distant future a properly organised Ambulance Staff in the metropolis and large towns will be provided for public use. For my experience daily teaches me that the whole duty of dealingwith, and giving immediate help to persons suffering with infectious disease, must be done with better trained officers, and it is impossible not to see that 29 the whole question can be separated from the necessity of improving the plans of dealing with the many casualties of daily occurrence in a large town—dying and dead persons, whether sick, insane, injured, drunk and incapable, demand skillful treatment and humane treatment. The Police are the proper authority, I should say, to be entrusted, and a few trained officers should be employed upon an acknowledged difficult duty. Sanitary Work during each Month of the Year.

REPORT OF THE WORKS EXECUTED IN THE PAVING AND SEWERS DEPARTMENTS. BY GEORGE F. STEVENS, SURVEYOR. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall; 28th June, 1875. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this, my Annual Report on the principal Works executed, and the chief business transacted in this department, during the year ended Lady-day, 1875. Highways. In various Streets the Footway Pavements requiring repair have been taken up and re-laid, and in others having considerable traffic through them, it was found necessary to remove the worn and uneven Hags and substitute new ones. 3 The Carriageway in Connaught Square Mews, hitherto paved with old Rag Stones and Pebbles, has been much improved by re-paving it with new Granite Cubes. The existing Channel Paving, where requisite, has been taken up, re-laid, and repaired with old Stones dressed for the purpose. In various parts of the Parish the Water Channels and Crossings have been paved with the best description of Granite. Under the authority of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the closing, either in whole or part, of the Streets for carriage traffic during the repair of the roadways, and the use of the Steam Road Roller for consolidating the metalling, have continued to be carried out successfully. With regard to the paving of New Streets, the powers of the Metropolis Management Acts were enforced by the Vestry in certain cases, and in some instances the works have been completed satisfactorily by the Owners of Houses abutting on such Streets; the additional length thereof added to the previous extent of Roads, make a total of 42 miles 4 furlongs and 123 yards, now under the control of the Vestry. Gas and Water Companies, and other parties have opened the Streets in 2735 places for laying and repairing pipes, constructing vaults and additions to Houses, and the execution of repairs. The costs and 4 charges for reinstating such places were paid to the Vestry. Buildings, Sewers, and Drains. Forty-two Notices were received by the Vestry, in accordance with the 76th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, for the erection of 140 Buildings, namely—1 School Building; 1 Warehouse; 136 Houses; and 2 Stables; also Stabling in two Private Stable Yards. The orders of Vestry for the drainage of these Buildings have been served upon the parties concerned and copies there of filed at the Vestry Hall. Two miles, three furlongs, and one hundred and eighty-six yards of Stoneware Drain Pipes have been laid down to the above-mentioned New Houses and Premises at an estimated cost to the Owners of the Property of £880. Eighty-five applications from Owners and Occupiers of Houses for the re-construction and repair of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways to 94 Houses and Premises have been received and the Works executed at the cost of the Applicants. A Brick Sewer, together with side entrance and air openings, has been constructed in Oakington Road, St. Peter's Park, for the drainage of New Buildings in course of erection there. A Brick Barrel Sewer, with manhole and air opening, has also been constructed in 5 Junction Place, between Praed Street and Market Street, for the drainage of the first four houses in Praed Street, west of Junction Place, which could not be drained into the Sewer in Praed Street in consequence of the Sewer in such street being under the permanent way of the Metropolitan Railway. The Pipe Sewer in Lanark Place has been continued to admit the drains from two houses lately erected there. The whole of these Works have been executed at the expense of the respective owners of the beforementioned Property, under the superintendence of the Vestry's Officers. Six hundred and one distinct Works relative to the repair of Sewers and Gullies, laying Pipe Drains, and fixing Traps have been executed at a cost of £3,459 19s. l1d. This sum includes £647 4s. 9d. received from various parties for fixing Traps at outlets of drains, constructing Gullies in new Streets, and laying Drain Pipes under the Footways and Roadways in connection with House drains. Eighty-one examinations from Sewers were made as to the cause of stoppage in House drains, and whether trapped at their outlets, at a cost to the Applicants of £16 4s. 0d. In addition to the above-mentioned Works, one hundred and fifty-seven subjects of Complaint have 6 been received and entered in a Book kept for that purpose, referring to stoppages in Gullies and Drains, and to other matters. In a majority of instances the Drains were relieved, and the remaining cases promptly attended to. The operations of cleansing Sewers, Gully-drains and Catch-pits are still performed by workmen under the immediate control of the Vestry, who have during the year removed from the Brick Sewers to the surface of the streets, and thence carted away, 150 cubic yards of heavy deposits, which impeded the flow of the sewage matter. The emptying and cleansing of the Catch-pits of Street Gullies, and the removal of deposits therefrom, have been carried out at the rate of 54 gulleys per day, making a total of 16,472 removals during the year. The flushing and cleansing of Pipe Sewers have been attended to as circumstances required, with beneficial results. Improvements in the Sewers and Street Gullies, as commenced by the Vestry and continued from time to time since the year 1859, have been extensively carried out this year, namely:— The construction of 25 side entrances, to afford easier means of access to the Sewers for cleansing purposes, together with other necessary requirements. 7 The construction of 31 air openings, some of which are carried direct from the Sewers at considerable depths, and others from the brickwork of old manholes only. The air openings are covered with cast-iron moveable and fixed Ventilating Grates, level with the surface of the carriageways; the moveable gratings are found to be of great service in saving of labour during the cleansing of the Sewers, as the workmen are enabled to remove the heavy deposits by means of buckets to the surface of the roadways. The construction and re-construction of 182 Gullies, and the repair of 41 others in various Streets of the Parish. lie-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses.

FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC LIGHTING UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE AVERAGE METER SYSTEM. to the YESTRY OF TIIE PARISH OF PADDINGTON, Gentlemen, In drawing up a Report in reference to the Meter System to be determined by "Averages" as regards the Public Lamps for the Lighting of the Parish since October 1st, 1874, it appears to be desirable that a brief epitome of the same should be laid before you. As Inspector of Public Lighting in January last, I considered it desirable to have an accurate Map of the Parish, in order to determine the positions of the Lamps, and to mark thereon the most eligible localities for fixing the Meters; for in the absence of such information no satisfactory arrangements could be made with the Imperial Gas Light Company. Taking this view of the question, I made a tracing of the Parish Map, which only defined the Streets up to the year 1864, consequently the several new Roads and Streets formed in the Parish since that period, had to be plotted down on the tracing. The next step to be taken was to ascertain the exact position of the lamps throughout the Parish, which occupied considerable time, this information having been obtained, it became necessary to define with precision the Metered Columns, which was accordingly done, the matter was then submitted to 4 the Imperial Gas Light Company, and approved by them on the 23rd of July, 1874. It was then deemed necessary to set out new lighting districts for the 20 lamplighters required to perform the work of Public Lighting. On the first of July the Gas Company having finally agreed to the working of the Referees Notification in conjunction with the Company's proposed heads of agreement, arrangements were made respecting the sinking of the Cast Iron Meter Boxes, and restoration of the paving. In accordance with clause 2 in the Heads of Agreement, the Gas Company insisted upon all Meters being tested at the St. Pancras Gas Works, which involved some further delay, and the first consignment of Meters came to hand on the 8th August, and on the 10th of the same month I commenced having the Boxes put down, and the Meters connected to the Company's Services. At this time alterations were being; carried out at the Vestry Hall Premises, to convert a portion of the Basement into an Office, Testing Room, and Store for the Lighting Department, I drew up a plan and specification of this work, which was approved by the Gas and Water Committee. Owing to the delays and late delivery of the Meters, it was found impossible to get into anything like an efficient working order by the 1st September, arrangements therefore had to be made with the Gas Company 5 to continue the old Contract until the end of the September quarter, by which time everything was in a satisfactory condition for commencing. On the 1st October the new system was inaugurated and not withstanding the severe tests to which it has been subjected, it has accomplished in a most satisfactory manner what the Vestry has so long desired, viz.:— the purchase of Gas by measurement in a convenient way, and with justice both to the Ratepayers and the imperial Gas Company. I have the pleasure to submit the following Tables, showing the results of the working under the Old and New Systems for the first six months:— Table showing the Monthly Gain per Lamp by Meter Indication and Modified Hours.

It is a well-known fact to Gas Engineers and Gas Manufacturers, that ordinary Consumers' Meters of small capacity are very unreliable in their registration when applied to Street Lamps, and should not on any account be used for such purposes, hence the necessity of having a Meter specially constructed, in order that the friction may be reduced to a minimum. In the Meter used scarcely half-a-tenth pressure is absorbed by friction. It must not be expected from this that any Meter will supply Gas for ordinary lighting purposes at this low pressure ; but supposing the pressure on the inlet-pipe to equal a column of water one inch in height, the pressure at which the Gas would be indicated on the outlet pipe, after passing the measuring drum, would be nine-and-a-half-tenths, showing that only half a tenth has been absorbed by friction in working the Meter. This result is arrived at by the increased diameter of the measuring wheel, which is equal to a five-light Meter, and diminished in depth of rim to nearly equal the capacity of a three-light ordinary Meter, and the quantity passed per revolution being .125 of a cubic foot, or 12 cubic feet per hour. This extra diameter assists in distributing the pressure further away from the central axis, thereby increasing the leverage of the measuring drum, and of course greatly reducing the friction. This class of Meter cannot by any chance be overtaxed, or even worked up to its maximum power, having only one light of five cubic feet per hour to supply, and that controlled by a governor at the burner. 9 The cause of the varying quantities recorded in the Meters after passing through the governors to the burners, is due in a great measure to the partial stoppages in the service-pipes belonging to the Company, such as water, defective supply-pipes, napthaline, &c., as well as different pressures given during the hours of burning, and more especially to the many atmospheric changes that take place during the seasons; for instance, during sudden variations of temperature, numerous lamps, both metered and un-metered, especially the latter, will have the gas-way so impeded with napthaline that scarcely three feet of gas per hour will be passing, and in some instances they go out altogether, in consequence of this crystalline substance forming so rapidly in the fittings, thereby causing incessant inconvenience and trouble. So soon as discovered, the lighters have been instructed to remedy the defect by pouring a ilittle paraffine oil through the cocks and stand pipes, which generally has the effect of dissolving this substance. The following extract respecting Napthaline is taken from the Journal of Gas Lighting of the 22nd December, 1874:— "Coal Gas is never produced without the formation of some napthaline, and the common belief is a true one—that the higher the heat, the greater is the production. It is, in fact, the troublesome accompaniment of poor gas, in the manufacture of which, "quality has been sacrificed for quantity." The practical sagacity of gas engineers has taught them how the inconvenience from the presence of this body may be avoided. The chief characteristic of napthaline 10 may be said to be its pre-eminent solubility. It is soluble to any extent in liquid hydrocarbons, and its vapour is freely soluble in, and is carried along with, vapours of similar bodies. Thus the art of removing napthaline consists in the slow condensation, whereby the vapours are kept together until at a point of what we may call supersaturation is reached, at which deposition takes place, leaving so much as can be retained in solution by the vapours of benzol, &c., to pass on to the consumer's burner. It is a valuable illuminant, and, therefore, the retention of as much as possible is desirable." It is generally believed that varying pressures do not affect the working of the regulators; theoretically it would appear so, but practically it is otherwise, for instance, in testing 12 governors that were formerly in use in this Parish before the introduction of the average Meter system the following results were obtained:— At 8/10th pressure. At 15/10th pressure. The Average being 4.65 Cu. ft. 5.04 Cu. ft. The Maximum „ 5.1 „ 5.7 " The Minimum „ 3.7 „ 3.5 „ Again, in testing 33 governors after three months working, which before being fixed were tested and stamped by the Gas Company's officials as being correct, the following results were obtained:— At 8/10th pressure. At 15/10th pressure. The Average being 4.83 Cu. ft 4.81 Cu. ft. The Maximum „ 5.3 „ 5.4 „ The Minimum „4.1 „ 4.1 „ 11 The following Table will illustrate in detail the varying quantities passed by 30 Governors at three different pressures. These Governors have been working for several months on the Metered Lamps—and before using were tested and stamped by the Gas Company's Officials as correct:— Reference No. Pressure at 7/10th. 8/10th. 15/10th Cu. ft.

Such being the case, it is undeniable that the cod sumption and purchase of Gas for all Public Street Lighting ought to be ascertained by Meter Indication, which system corrects and explains many little matters not readily understood by the public. During the half-year the Gas Company have been served with 201 Notices of defective supplies of Gas through stoppages and water in the service-pipes, all of which were attended to by them. The practice formerly, I am told, was to allow the defects to remain until the lights were greatly diminished or out altogether, and then steps were taken for rectifying such defects. The accompanying Table contains a total of the number of defective and bad lights that have been reported during the half-year by the lamplighters. The numbers blown out may appear large and require explanation to account for the same. When the lighting and repairs of the Public Lamps were taken in hand by the Vestry, a great number of lantern glasses were found broken, which properly belonged to the Gas Company to repair under their former Agreement; a long time elapsed before they carried out.this necessary work. Owing to this delay, and the windy and rainy weather which prevailed during the first three months of the work under the new system many lights were blown out, the majority being extinguished by the intense and continuous frosts; for during inclement weather, Gas will frequently condense, hence the pipes get frozen, and the supply stopped. During the latter end of December, in some Parishes, the frost had affected so many lamps that fire pots had to be placed around the bases of the columns to thaw the fittings. 14 METERED LAMPS.

When commencing it, it was apparent that certain expenditures could be avoided if the lamplighters were instructed to do the various works of disconnecting and connecting Meters, &c., whenever it was necessary to take them out of the boxes, without employing a gas-fitter, and this work has been allotted to the lighters accordingly. By having the Testing Apparatus at the Vestry Hall, Meters can be taken out of the boxes (with the sanction of the Company's Inspector) and. tested as to their correctness. Without this provision, all Meters, when disconnected, would have to be taken to the Official Tester's Office, involving a very serious item of expenditure yearly, and other periodical testings of the governors can also be made. In concluding this Report, I feel it my duty to the Vestry Clerk, as the promoter of the Average Meter System in this Parish, to acknowledge the deep interest he has taken in this subject, and the assiduous attention and valuable assistance he has given at all times in connection with the furtherance of this arrangement, and also to the Members of the Gas and Water Committee. As a proof of the interest taken in the subject of burning gas by measurement, I may perhaps 16 mention that many of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards have pronounced in favor of the Average Meter System; and there is every reason to believe that ere long the same will be generally adopted throughout the Metropolis. / I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WESTON, Inspector of Public Lighting for the Parish of Paddington.

The death rate is 22 per 1000 of the living population, 21.1 in St. Mary's, 22.9 in St. John's, including the Hospital and Workhouse mortality in each district. The 106 deaths in public institutions are 19 per cent. nearly, or 1 in 5 of the total deaths. The births are nearly 200 in excess of the deaths of the quarter; the birth-rate is 30.2 per 1000 of the population, that is, about 3,000 infants are born in the parish annually, and registered. The number of still-born children is unknown. There are 95 deaths in the class of zymotic diseases—half being measles— which was the epidemic of the season and carried off 46 young children. Its severity was influenced by the cold weather. The chest and tubercular diseases are very high—the extreme cold and great fog of December left traces of their effects for the several weeks following. The fever cases are a very mixed group, and include rheumatic fevers, puerperal fevers, with typhoid. The deaths in young children are, as usual, very high- 372 of total deaths, far too high, indicating some grave fault somewhere—84 young children were taken off by measles, whooping cough and bronchitis, no doubt, deaths all accelerated by undue exposure to cold while suffering from attacks of these complaints ; 86 more deaths are from the consumption class (always high during the winter months); 29 deaths were from violence or accidental; 3 from suicide; and 3 from infanticide; these latter by person or persons unknown, who are thereby guilty of wilful murder of newly-born infants. 53 inquests were held during the quarter, and 2 bodies were brought to the Mortuary or Dead-house of St. Mary's Churchyard. The fever ambulance was only used 5 times. TABLE II. Deaths from Zymotic and other Diseases, from December 27th, 1873, to March 28th, 1874. Weeks. ending Small-Pox. Measles.

The Systematic Sanitary Inspection of the following group of streets and places with their population, has been completed up to the last quarter by Inspector C. J. Biorn. They are named respectively, Kilburn District, and the Amberley Road District. TABLE VI. Streets and Places. No. of Population at Census 1871. No. of Families living in Single Rooms.

The 270 houses in Amberley Road district had a population of 3130 at the census in 1871, but many have been added since; and a new neighbourhood has sprung up within the last 6 years. With the exception of Chippenham, Bristol, Elnathan, Amberley and other mewses in this District, not included at present in the work of systematic inspection—the streets are wide, the houses have 8 rooms, and are well drained, but there is in them unfortunately a very large element of pauper population, particularly in Netley Street and Amberley Road, gradually extending to Shirland Road, Edbrook Road, and into the adjoining mews. The melancholy fact, shewn upon the records of inspection, Table VI., that 312 families are living in single rooms in these two districts, indicates the 7 class of persons we have to deal with, and the probability of finding occasional overcrowding, with high rates of mortality, and a predomination of death amongst young children. The benefit which accrues from regular sanitary inspection is shown by the discovery of instances, such as the following:— In a room having only 900 cubic feet, the Inspector reports— a widow with 5 children, aged 17, 15, 13, 11 and 9 respectively; the landlord was served with a Notice to abate overcrowding. Where is she to go to better herself is the question ? Builders intended these houses at first for one respectable family, but such as Andover Place and Carlton Place, in violation of common sense and decency, they are let out in tenements and single rooms, without those essential conditions of a dwelling, which landlords should be compelled in all instances to provide. There are indeed very few houses let out in separate holdings but what are deficient in respect to cubic space, ventilation and all needful appliances for washing and drying of linen, for the reception of food and fuel, for speedy removal of refuse, slop water, dust, &c., matters, which if neglected for a very short time, pollute the air, and engender disease. There is yet in reality no law to prevent the creation of unhealthy districts as long as five or six families are allowed to live in one house intended for a single family. It would be a blessing, and great economy in the long-run, to make conditions of structural fitness for all houses intended to be occupied by more than one family. Houses should be built with reference to the future health of the people who will have to live in them. It will cost dear to this parish to maintain the poor population that infest the tenement houses here referred to, and now, while the fields are open and still unbuilt upon, it would be worth the attempt to overcome the destructive influences likely to be established in building of tenement dwellings as the population gathers in this and other neighbourhoods. They will some day be hives of pauperism; where many of the children must be blighted, or grow up with such feeble constitutions, that they become ineffective and unprofitable members of the community. 8 The following Reports and Pamphlets on Public Health have been received with thanks:— Traité pratique du Chaufage, et de la Ventilation, et de la distribution des eaux dans les habitations, &c., par C.

Zymotic diseases formed 14.3 per cent. of the 462 deaths; 19.6 of the total deaths were in public institutions, that is, 91 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital and the Workhouse. 2 The deaths from measles were still very high, as well as of whooping cough; a few cases of scarlet fever begin to show themselves; out of the 7 deaths under fever, one was puerperal, one from blood poisoning, and one from bilious fever. Upon the whole the quarter was an extremely healthy one. The mean temperature being favorable. The deaths of the corresponding quarter for 5 previous years* slightly exceed this quarter, yet 10,000 persons have been added to the population of the Parish. There is a growing improvement in the condition of certain portions of the population, which is also manifest from personal observation of those who are well acquainted with some of the worst streets of the Parish. There has been much work done by the Poor Law Officials, and through the medium of the Charity Organization Committee to sustain a large proportion of the indigent population, and to prevent the squalid misery that seeks refuge in streets where the homes of the poor are not under the same strict supervision as in this Parish. * 1870. 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874. 458 464 464 476 462 TABLE II.

The mortality of children under 5 is at the rate of 38.7 per cent. of total deaths, or about equal to that of most large towns with a large proportion of infant life. The Zymotic diseases are represented thus:—Measles 1; Scarlet Fever nil; Diphtheria 10; Whooping Cough 3; Fever 10; Diarrhoea 51; Erysipelas 9; making 94, or 23.4 per cent. of total deaths. The deaths from Consumption and Bronchitis this quarter are always lower than the average. The quarter presents a very healthy state of the Parish. 2 Summer Diarrhœa. The Zymotic deaths are made high by an addition of the Diarrhoea cases (51) 49 of which are as usual in young children. The Summer Diarrhœa of young children is dependent more upon the relaxing and predisposing influences of warm weather, than upon Local unsanitary conditions of their surroundings. In Summer months, a relaxed state of the mucous membrane of the bowels causes about as many deaths in young children, as the effects of cold produce in the severe Winter months upon the infantile population. Large numbers of sickly and weakly children abound in the tenant houses of our thickly populated streets, their mothers are themselves badly nourished, and deficient in natural breast milk; artificial feeding is resorted to by many nurses who are grossly ignorant of infantile management ; this ignorance on the part of those who have the care of children, is the chief source of that form of gastric irritation which prevails in warm weather, and in a few days often proves fatal. In Summer, the digestive organs readily suffer; in Winter it is the respiratory organs that become attacked. In summer months, whilst only half a dozen fatal cases of Bronchitis are recorded, about ten times that number of deaths occur from the Alvine-flux, or Summer Diarrhoea. In Winter, the figures are just reversed—70 to 80 deaths are the usual mortality from bronchitis and inflammation of the respiratory organs in young children, and there is no fatal Diarrhœa.

The birth-rate is 25.4, and the rate of mortality in young children to the whole deaths is 36 per cent. 2 Amongst the Zymotic diseases of this quarter scarlet fever has been severe—24 cases, nearly all children, have succumbed to it—this number probably represents 240 or 250 attacked in the three months. Last quarter not a single death from this disease was registered in the parish, although it was epidemic in most of the Eastern districts. This epidemic has been travelling Westward in the metropolis for the last 12 months; and it is some consolation to observe that measles and whooping cough disappeared from our list of deaths on its approach ; not one case of the latter will be found amongst the deaths, and one only of measles. Cold an enemy to Public Health. It will be observed from Table II. that the deaths show an increase during the last weeks of December. From 10 to 18 deaths weekly in excess were registered from the inflammatory diseases of the respiratory organs alone—bronchitis and pneumonia—the mean temperature of the air during that period was 34.6, a little above freezing, and for many days below that point. This cold proved a very deadly enemy to old persons—large numbers of whom reside in the wealthy district of St. John's. During several weeks the deaths registered were actually above the births; a most unusual circumstance, which I believe had never before happened in this Parish. TABLE II.
