Stol 4 THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. OLAVE DISTRICT. Annual Report of the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the District. FOR THE YEAR 1899. by WILLIAM ARTHUR BOND, M.A., M.D, B.C., D.P.H. (Camb), M.R.C.P. (Lond.) Fellow and Member of the Council of the Royal Institute of Public Health ; Lecturer and Demonstrator to the Sanitary Institute ; Fellow of the Society of Medical Officers of Health ; Member of the Epidemiological Society, etc. Medical Officer of Health to the Board of Works for the Ho/born District; and Medical Officer of Health for the District. London: Printed by C. Talbot, 101 Tooley Street, S.E. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1899. To the Members of the Hoard of Works for the St. Olave District, Southwark. Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you my sixth Annual Report. This Report, in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, deals with the twelve months ended 31st December, 1899. The details of the Report show that much work has been done in improving the sanitary condition of the District. A large amount of house-to-house inspections have been effected during the year, and the sanitary defects found have been remedied, with a few exceptions in which the works required are not yet completed. The general death-rate, the zymotic death-rate, the phthisis death-rate, and the mortality of infants under one year of age, per 1,000 births, are all higher than for the year 1898. The London general death-rate and the phthisis death-rate are also higher than the corresponding rates of the previous year. During the year 51 cases of overcrowding were abated. 613 notices were served for the cleansing of dirty rooms. 4 Many rooms were again fonnd to be in a filthy and disgraceful state on account of the neglect of the occupiers. In 175 such cases notices were served on the tenants. The bakehouses were twice inspected during the year, and the nuisances found were abated. During the year the Metropolitan Asylums Board was able to receive all the cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhoid fever, that required to be removed to their hospitals. The treatment of diphtheria by anti-toxic serum still continues to give verv satisfactory results, which have been confirmed by an enquiry by a committee of the Clinical Society. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, the two middle blocks of Barnham Street Buildings were represented by me as "obstructive buildings." For further details see pages 20 and 21. A very large amount of unsound food, including 195 tons of decomposed potatoes, were, at the request of the owners, removed by the Board as trade refuse and destroyed. In addition, 200 tons of decomposed potatoes were condemned, and removed for destruction by the owners. The regular removal of house refuse has for many years compared favourably with that of any London district. The streets and courts have, as usual, been regularly cleansed, and the walls of the public courts have been twice limewhited during the year. 5 Underground conveniences for men and women were constructed by Messrs. Doulton & Co., for the Board, on the triangular piece of ground west of the Tower Bridge Approach. The prevention of consumption was considered in my last Annual Report, so need not be repeated. Many other Public Health matters have received the attention of the Committee and the Board during the year, and have been reported upon by me. Sanitary Legislation, 1899. The following is a short abstract of the sanitary provisions of the Acts affecting the Metropolis that were passed in 1899 :— The Metropolis Water Act, 1899, which enables and requires the Metropolitan Water Companies to supply each other with water in cases of emergency, and to construct the necessary works if so required by the Local Government Board. The London Government Act, 1899, an Act to make better provision for Local Government in London, by making Metropolitan Boroughs, the Councils of which shall each consist of a Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors. By this Act, the following powers and duties will be transferred from the London County Council to the Borough Councils: 6 The registration of dairymen and the duty of enforcing the bye-laws and regulations with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughter-houses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses [2nd Sched., Part I., and sec. 6 (4)]. The power to adopt Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, that is, the power of providing "lodging-houses for the working classes" [2nd Sched., Part II.] The Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (Dye-laws) Act, 1899, authorizes the London County Council to make bye-laws requiring persons about to do any drainage work to deposit with the Sanitary Authority all necessary plans, sections, and particulars. The Heats for Shop Assistants Act, 1899, provides for seats being supplied in the proportion of at least one for every three female assistants in each room of retail shops. It is to be enforced by the London County Council. The Board of Education Act, 1899, provides for the inspection of Secondary Schools, by Officers of that Board, to ascertain the provisions made for the health of the scholars. The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899, empowers Local Authorities (in London, the Sanitary Authorities) to advance money for enabling persons to acquire the ownership of small houses in which they reside. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1899, considerably amends the previous Acts relating thereto. 7 Importers are liable to heavy penalties unless margarine or margarine-cheese, adulterated or impoverished butter, milk or cream, or condensed, separated, or skimmed milk, is imported in packages, tins, or other receptacles conspicuously marked, and indicating the nature of the contents. Power is given to the Local Government Board or the Board of Agriculture to sample articles of food. Power is given to the Board of Agriculture to make regulations for determining the standards to be taken in the analysis of milk, cream, butter, or cheese. All packages of "Margarine" or "Margarine Cheese" must be marked as such in f inch letters on the top, bottom, and sides of such package, not on a label attached thereto. When exposed for sale, it must be marked in 1½-inch block letters, and when sold must be delivered in a wrapper marked in ½-inch block letters "Margarine" or "Margarine Cheese," as the case may be, and no other printed matter must appear on the wrapper. All manufacturers of and wholesale dealers in Margarine must register the premises at which they carry on their business with the Local Authority, and keep a register of all Margarine and Margarine Cheese imported and sold by them. No one shall make, sell, or expose for sale any Margarine the fat of which contains more than 10 per cent, of butter-fat. Every person who, by himself or his servant, in any highway or place of public resort, sells milk or cream from any vehicle, can, or other receptacle, must have his name and address conspicuously inscribed on the vehicle or receptacle, 8 Every tin or other receptacle containing condensed, separated, or skimmed milk must bear a label clearly visible to the purchaser, on which the words "Machine skimmed Milk," or "Skimmed Milk," as the case may require, are printed in large and legible type. No label giving notice of admixture of any article shall be deemed to be distinctly and legibly written or printed if the notice of mixture is obscured by any other matter on the label. All samples when purchased must be divided into three parts. If the vendor wishes to have one of these parts, he must ask the purchaser for it. At the request or with the consent of the purchaser or consignee, samples of all articles may be taken in course of delivery. The expression "Food" includes any article used for food or drink by man, except drugs or water, and any article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of food and flavouring matters and condiments. The Local Government Board issued a circular and Orders, together with Model Regulations, for dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis. By an Order of the Home Secretax-y of the 17th March, 1899, all cases of poisoning by mercury, contracted in any factory or workshop, have to be notified to the Home Office. 9 VITAL STATISTICS. Population, etc.—The populations of the several parishes of the District at the censuses of 1881, 1891 and 1896 were— 1881. 1891. 1896. Area in acres. St. Olave 2,247 2,159 ] 2,314 48 St. Thomas 781 752 8 St. John, Horselydown 8,928 9,812 9,417 69 11,956 12,723 11,731 125 The density of population in 1896 was 94 persons per acre; for Registration London it was 59 to an acre. I have based the calculations in the following Reports upon the population of all ages as usually estimated to the middle of the year 1899. This is 11.128. I think this estimate is not less than the true population, because, notwithstanding the demolition of houses in connection with the Tower Bridge Approach and the South Eastern Railway Extensions, the natural increase of the population or excess of births over deaths during the past three years has been 602. Moreover, the number of persons belonging to the District who were in outlying public institutions, of whom 92 died during the year, is unknown, and therefore not allowed for in the estimate of population. Allowance is also made in the calculations for the fact that the Registrar's Returns include exactly 52 weeks. B 10 BIRTHS. The number of births registered for the whole District (which includes the united Parish of St. Olave and St. Thomas and that of St. John), for the 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1899, was 365. Of this total, 179 were male children and 18(5 female children. This gives a birth-rate of 32.9 per thousand of the population. The birth-rates for the five preceding years were 31.7, 37.9, 35.9, 32.9, 33.2, and the birthrate for Registration London for the year was 29.4, the lowest London birth-rate recorded. DEATHS. The deaths registered in the 52 weeks ending 30th December, 1899, as having occurred in the District were 895 ; 711 of these took place at Guy's Hospital, this number including only 26 deaths of parishioners, 685 belonging to other Districts. At the Parish Street Workhouse there were 29 deaths, only six of these belonging to the District. Four bodies were found in the Thames, all non-parishioners. Five non-parishioners died in the District. I received the returns of 92 deaths occurring outside the District, among persons belonging thereto. Thus the number of deaths of persons belonging to the District was 270. The corrected annual death-rate was 24.3 per thousand. 11 The corresponding death-rate for London for the year was 19.3. The corrected death-rate of St. Olave's and of London for the past nine years are as under— Year. St. Olave's Death-Rate per 1,000 London Death-Rate per 1,000 1891 25.2 21.4 1892 23.7 20.4 1893 21.2 21.3 1894 19.4 17.4 1895 23.1 19.4 1896 21.7 18.2 1897 20.9 17.7 1898 19.7 18.3 1899 24.3 19.3 The population for the years 1891—95 inclusive, estimated in the usual way was probably too high, as the census of 1896 showed that the population had diminished. The death-rates therefore as given for these years are probably lower than the true death-rates. Table I. gives the causes of death in the form required by the Local Government Board. Infantile Mortality—The deaths of young children always bear a high ratio to total deaths. There were 97 deaths of children under 5 years old, that is 35 9 per cent, of the total deaths ; last year it was 37.4 per cent., and in 1897 it was 41.0 per cent. 12 53 children died under one year old ; that is 145 per 1,000 births registered. The corresponding rate for London was 166 per thousand. For the past four years this rate has been lower than the corresponding rate for London:— Year. St. Olave. London. 1895 205 165 Deaths of children under one year old per 1,000 births registered. 1896 150 161 1897 145 158 1898 129 167 1899 145 166 Phthisis and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. There were 27 deaths of persons belonging to this District caused by phthisis, or an annual rate of 2.43 per 1,000 inhabitants; the corresponding rate for London was 1.82 per 1,000. There were also 8 deaths due to other forms of tuberculosis. 69 deaths were caused by other diseases of the respiratory organs, namely, pneumonia, bronchitis and pleurisy. Influenza was the registered cause of 12 deaths. In London the number was 1,817, which is the highest recorded since 1895. 13 Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic Diseases was 28, or a zymotic death-rate of 2.52 per 1,000. The corresponding rate for London, was 2.46 per 1,000, or about the same rate. The deaths in London from these Diseases were:— 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. Total 1899. 1st Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd Qr. \ 4th Qr.

Small-pox.—No case of small-pox was notified. In London there were 29 notifications, and 3 deaths. Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina.—There were 65 cases notified, and 2 deaths; 61 of the 65 cases were removed to hospital. In London the notifications were 18,112 in number, and the deaths from the complications of this disease were 398, the smallest number of deaths in London from this disease ever recorded, and much below the average of the preceding ten years. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—32 cases were notified, and all but two were removed to hospital, one of which was dead before the notification was received. There Avere eight deaths, a case mortality of 25 per cent., that of London being 14.7 per cent. In London there were 13,363 cases notified, and 1,964 deaths from this disease. Typhoid Fever.—There were 11 cases notified, and two deaths. Four of the cases were probably contracted from some unnotified cases in a house in the same street. In London there were 4,460 notifications and 801 deaths. Measles.—10 deaths were assigned to this disease. In London the number of deaths was 2,143. In London there are generally four or five consecutive quarters of years with few deaths, followed by three or four consecutive quarters in which the number of deaths is very large. 16 Whooping Cough.—No death was assigned to this disease. It was, however, very prevalent in this District during the preceding year. In London the number of deaths from whooping cough was 1,720. Diarrhoea was the assigned cause of only 6 deaths, and of these 5 were those of young children. In London the number of deaths was 4,196. It was very prevalent during the third quarter of the year, the temperature during that quarter being above the average. The measures taken in dealing with the cases arising in the District outside Guy's Hospital were as follows:— Number of rooms fumigated 113 Number of rooms stripped and cleansed by Owner or Occupier 89 Do. do. by the Board 7 Number of notices served, calling the attention of Occupiers of Houses to the provisions of Sections 02 and 65 P.H. (London) Act, 1891 93 Number of notices requiring disinfection 91 Number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected 6,900 Number of articles given up and destroyed (exclusive of books) 1,318 Number of persons using Shelter 82 Disinfection, &c. 17 Number of notices sent to Schools notifying where houses are infected 111 Number of notices sent to schools notifying that houses have been disinfected 107 Number of copies of certificates made and forwarded to the M.A.B. or other Districts 121 The premises where infectious diseases occurred were all inspected and examined, and notices served when necessary. The Shelter provided for temporary occupation by families during the disinfection of their rooms has been used 19 times during the year, by 82 persons, 73 of whom were also provided with sleeping accommodation. Collection of House Refuse. This important service continues to be carried out regularly and efficiently, as for the sixth year in succession not a single complaint of neglect or inattention has been received. On the contrary, 206 visits have been made to houses where the dustmen have reported failure to obtain the refuse at the appointed times; and in four cases, where the occupiers have refused the dustmen's request to permit the removals, notices have been served, but no further proceedings were necessary. 27 new sanitary dust-pails have been provided in the place of old brick or wooden dust-bins. These must facilitate the work of the dustmen, and reduce to a minimum the nuisance caused by the storage and removal of house refuse. One ancient public dust-bin has been demolished during the year. c 18 Inquests. 183 inquests were held in this District; only 19, however, were on the bodies of parishioners. 161 of these inquests were held in the Coroner's Court at Guy's Hospital, and 22 in the St. John's Vestry Hall. Mortuary. 30 bodies were removed to the Mortuary in Weavers Lane, and on 22 of these a Coroner's inquest was held in the St. John's Vestry Hall, Fair Street. Four were bodies of non-parishioners that were found in the Thames. Temperature. The mean temperature of the year was 50.6° F., being 1.9° F. above the average of the preceding 128 years. The rainfall was 22.34 inches, and was 2.50 inches below the average of the preceding 84 years. Rain fell on 141 days during the year. Further meteorological details are given in the Appendix (Table V.) Houses Closed, Demolished, Rebuilt, or New Premises Erected. During the year the following places have been closed, demolished, or rebuilt, or new premises erected:— On the site of Nos. 32, 33, 34 and 35 Queen Elizabeth Street, and some land which was used as a yard, sheds, &c., new premises for Messrs. Silver, Edgington & Co. bave been erected. 19 Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 19 Three Oak Lane have been demolished, and the site, with that of Nos. 10 to 20 Lafone Street, is now vacant, and the "Goat" P.H., at the corner of Queen Elizabeth Street and Lafone Street, has been rebuilt. Nos. 46 and 48 Weston Street have been .closed. Nos. 64 and 66, 68 and 70, 72 and 74, and 76—84 inclusive, new Provision Stores and Salerooms and Railway Offices were completed. No. 141 Tooley Street, new premises erected. Nos. 134 and 136 Tooley Street were demolished, and new premises erected. Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 Boss Street; Nos. 60, 61 and 62 Queen Elizabeth Street; Nos. 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 Lafone Street, and a builder's shed in Goat Street. This block of houses was pulled down for the purpose of building warehouse property. Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 Shand Street. Pulled down to make way for warehouse. Gun and Shot Wharf, Morgan's Lane. For purpose of rebuilding. Extensive excavations have been made on the site between Tooley Street, Morgan's Lane, and Green Bank, for the erection of a new distillery. The extension of the South Eastern Railway in the District has caused the undermentioned premises to be closed : Nos. 4, 5 and 6 Matilda Place. Between Vine Street and Stoney Lane have been erected Hay's Wharf and Dock, new stables, and a large block of new warehouses. 20 Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. Barnham Street Buildings. A resolution was passed at a Ratepayers' Public Meeting declaring these Buildings and part of Vine Street Buildings to be unhealthy areas, and a copy was forwarded to the Board. Barnham Street Buildings were so constructed that many of the rooms, w.c's., passages and staircases of the ground and first floors are generally very dark, and the Buildings have not been maintained in a sanitary condition, notwithstanding the hundreds of notices that have been served the past five years. The encroachments of the S.E. Railway extension also tended to make many of the rooms, See., darker and to impede the circulation of air. I, therefore, after careful consideration and advice, formed the opinion that the most satisfactory and reasonable way of dealing with these Buildings was to represent the two middle Blocks as "obstructive buildings" within the meaning of Sec. 38 (1), and that it was expedient to have them pulled down ; and to have the remainder of the Blocks registered under Sec. 94 of the P. H. (London) Act, 1891. The great importance of good light, air and ventilation in the prevention and cure of disease is now more and more recognised, not only by the Medical Profession but also by many of the general public. The average death-rate of the past five years of the unhealthy tenements (all the ground and first floor rooms except those facing the front, Barnham Street, and the rear of the 21 Buildings) was at least 49.6 per 1000, and of the remainder at least 29.1 per 1000, and for each of the five years the deathrate in the unhealthy tenements was much higher than that of the remainder. The Committee, after carefully considering the representation, reported that, although some of the rooms are dirty and dark, and perhaps hardly desirable as habitations, many of the worst are already closed, and the others would be much improved by more frequent white-washing and cleansing. Also that "the demolition of Blocks 3 and 4 would involve the loss of 48 undoubtedly habitable tenements (all those, namely, which are above the first floor), and the Committee feels that in face of the great demand for housing accommodation in the District the Board would not be justified in producing this result unless the reasons in support of such action were very strong and urgent, which the Committee does not consider is the case." "Much has already been done and can still be done under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector to improve the condition of these dwellings and a large amount of work is now being carried out in accordance with orders made by the Board, and the Committee is of opinion that the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector should continue to give constant attention to these buildings and also to the Vine Street Buildings, and that in order to make the task of supervision by the Board's Officers easier and more efficient it is now desirable that these buildings should be brought under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings." 22 House-to House Inspections. The following house-to-house inspections have been made during the year, and most of the sanitary defects found have now been remedied:— Artillery Lane 6 houses Barnham Street Buildings 72 dwelling 3 & 4 Blocks twice inspected. „„ „ 204 „ Boss Street (part) 18 houses Bermondsey Place 7 „ Clarks Place 3 „ Coxson Place 46 „ Cottage Bow 3 „ Church Street (part.) 5 „ Curlew Street 35 ,, Fells Square 8 „ Finnimore Place 6 „ Gibbons Rents 6 „ Gainsford Street (part) 32 „ Gibsons Court 2 „ Goat Street 4 „ Lafone Street (part) 27 „ Landrail Place 4 „ Little Maze Court 6 „ Magdalen Street 22 „ Maze Pond (part) 15 „ Maze Pond Terrace 13 „ Melior Place 4 „ Inspected twice.

Vine Street Buildings 37 dwellings. 23 Registered Houses. The following are the houses let in lodgings that are now on the Register:— Maze Pond, Nos. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 & 18; Lafone Street, Nos. 8 & 31; Gainsford Street, No. 60; Curlew Street, Nos. 1 & 2; Morris Court, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12. Four Summonses were taken out for failing to comply with the Bye-laws, one was withdrawn, and for the other three a fine of £6 and 6s. costs was inflicted. Bakehouses. The Bakehouses of the District have been twice inspected during the year. Ten notices were served on the occupiers to comply with the Board's regulations. Five of the seven Bakehouses are situated below the ground level. Sanitary Work. A detailed account of the sanitary work done will be found in Table III. (of the Appendix), prepared by the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Thomas Ashd own. All the work has been satisfactorily carried out. Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. A summary of the samples that have, been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst, and the proceedings taken, will be found in Table IV, 24 Foods Unfit for Human Consumption. The under-mentioned articles, unfit for the food of man, were given up by the respective owners, and removed by the Board as trade refuse for destruction:— Tons. cwt. qrs. 1bs. Potatoes (9 lots) 195 13 3 12 Eggs (6 lots) 1 4 3 - Tinned Meats (3 lots) - 7 1 10 Tripe - 8 1 22 Fish - 4 2 24 Ox Tongues - 1 3 4 Calves' Heads - 8 0 0 Condensed Milk - - 3 16 Total 198 9 3 4 A further quantity of 200 tons of potatoes were condemned, and were barged away for destruction without being carted to the Board's wharf. I again desire to acknowledge the excellent and cordial co operation afforded by your Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Thomas Ashdown. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND.
