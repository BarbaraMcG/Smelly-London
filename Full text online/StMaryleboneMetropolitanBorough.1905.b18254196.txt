MARYLEBONE FOR THE YEAR 1905. By A. Wynter Blyth. METEOROLOGICAL SUMMARY. March Quarter. January of 1905 was on the whole mild, with but little frost; the snowfall was so scanty as to only equal 02 inch of rain. The rainfall was far below the average, the rainy days being but six in number, and the total fall measuring 0.5 inch. Sunshine was variable ; the firs! week was gloomy, the sunshine being only 5 per cent., but the succeeding weeks were brighter, and during the last January week 27 per cent. of the possible sunshine was registered in Regent's Park. February was a wet cool month. There were 14 rainy days, the rainfall measured 0.74 inch. Sunshine was rather above the average, and during the third week amounted to 33 per cent. The temperature varied from 30° to 54.5o. The winds were mostly in the cool quarters of N.W. and N.E. The March weather, instead of the usual dry, windy, cool, ordinary weather, was wet. Rain fell on no less than 21 days, and the rainfall attained 3 inches. The temperature varied from 33o to 49o. The winds were as a rule S.W. Sunshine was, notwithstanding the numerous rainy days, of fair amount. June Quarter. April was on the whole wet. There were 15 rainy days, yielding 2.09 inches of rainfall. The temperature varied from 31.0o to 65.0o. The sunshine from 13.6 to 51 percent. The winds were mostly N.E. and N.W. 8 May was unusually bright, warm, and sunny. The sunshine no week fell below 45 per cent., and attained one week even 57.4 per cent. There were six rainy days, yielding a rainfall of 063 inch. The temperature varied from 36.5° to 81.2o. Only the third week of June was one of summer, the remainder of the month was wet, cool, and unsettled. There were 15 rainy days, the total fall being equal to 4.44 inches. The winds were variable. Temperature ranged from 48.0o to 79.0°. Sunshine was deficient during the first week, averaging only 9.8 per cent., the remaining weeks it varied from 28 to 51.7 per cent. September Quarter. A warm July followed, the mean temperature being 62.1°; maximum 87.2°. On seven days rain fell, the rainfall being equal to 0.64 inch. Winds mostly W.S.W. Sunshine about 29%. August was moderately fine, the mean temperature was 61.6°, and the maximum 75.6°. There were 11 rainy days, the rainfall equalled 0.79 inch. Winds south-westerly. Sunshine 41%. September was cool, owing to the prevalence of N.E. winds. The mean temperature was 57°, the maximum 74.0°. There were 12 rainy days, the rainfall measuring 2.08 inches. The sunshine was deficient, the average being 26 %. December Quarter. October was a fairly dry month, on seven days slight rain fell, giving a rainfall of 0.38 inch. The temperature sunk on several occasions for a short time under freezing point, the maximum was 59 0° and the mean 467. The winds were mostly N.W. The sunshine about 25% November was cool and wet, on 17 days rain fell, the total rainfall being being equal to 3.61 inches. There were several frosts in the early hours of the morning, the mean temperature was 43° and the maximum only 64.5. Winds S.W. and N.E. Average sunshine 13%. December was a mild month, on 12 days rain fell yielding 0.96 inch. During the first two weeks the sunshine varied in Regent's Park from 10% to 28%, but during the remainder of the month frequent fogs and much cloud prevented, with the exception of transient gleams of sunshine, the direct rays of the sun reaching the district. Frost was almost entirely absent, the minimum temperature being on only two mornings 30°, the maximum temperature was 56.5°, the mean 41.7°, The winds were variable. 9 BIRTHS AND DEATHS. During the fifty-two weeks ending December 30th, 1905, there were registered 2,618 births and 2,026 deaths. The distribution and manner of the deaths are tabulated in tables VII. and VIII ; 801 of the deaths took place in a number of extraparochial institutions as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 500 North-Western Fever Hospital 25 Western Fever Hospital 1 London Fever Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 49 Children's Hospital, Paddington 19 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 10 Belgrave Children's Hospital, Belgrave Road 1 London Hospital 1 West London Hospital 7 University College Hospital 21 King's College Hospital 2 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 4 Westminster Hospital 5 St. Thomas's Hospital 3 St. George's,Hospital 14 Guy's Hospital 3 Charing Cross Hospital 4 German Hospital, Hackney 1 French Hospital 2 Italian Hospital 2 National Hospital, Queen's Square 1 Homoeopathic Hospital 2 Cheyne Hospital, Chelsea 1 Queen's Jubilee Hospital 3 St. Luke's Hospital, Pembridge Square 2 Middlesex Asylum 1 London County Asylum, Norwood 10 Claybury Asylum 3 Leavesden Asylum 3 Caterham Asylum 1 Cane Hill Asylum 3 London County Asylum, Colney Hatch 4 ,, ,, Ilford 1 ,, „ Dartford 1 ,, „ Friern Barnet 1 Hanwell Asylum 16 Banstead Asylum 5 Tooting Bec Asylum 1 Hoxton Asylum 1 Carried forward 735 10 Brought forward 735 Camberwell House Asylum 1 Darenth Asylum 2 Metropolitan Benefit Asylum 1 St. Saviour's Hospital 1 St. Peter's Hospital, Covent Garden 1 Whitechapel Infirmary 1 Home Hospital, Fitzroy Square 1 London Temperance Hospital 7 Craven Hill Creche 1 Cancer Hospital, Chelsea 3 Salvation Army Maternity Home, Hackney 1 St. Joseph's Home 3 St. Luke's Home 3 Royal Hospital for Incurables 3 Royal Chest Hospital, Brompton 5 Sick Asylum, Hendon 2 City of London Lying-in Asylum 1 Lambeth Infirmary 1 Chelsea Infirmary 1 Friedenheim 1 Hampstead Workhouse 1 Holborn Infirmary 1 New Hospital for Women 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 2 H.M.

The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the year's statistics, without making any corrections lor increase or decrease of population are as follows .– Birth-rate. Death-rate. All Souls 149 ... 12.5 Rectory 16.8 13.5 St,,Mary 20.0 14.5 Christ Church 26.4 18.3 St, John 17.2 16.4 The whole District 19.6 15.2 The average death-rates for ten years (1895 to 1904) for the corresponding period were as follows:—All Souls, 14.8; Rectory, 19.9; St. Mary, 18.4; Christ Church, 20.6; St. John. 19.6; the whole district, 18.4. 11 Table VI. may also be referred to; in that table a theoretical correction has been made for presumed decrease of population; the difference in the Death-rate is only fractional The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. TABLE I. SHOWING THE COMPARATIVE MORTALITY DURING THE FIFTYTWO WEEKS ENDING DECEMBER 30th, 1905, FROM CERTAIN CLASSES OF DISEASE AND PROPORTION TO 1,000 DEATHS FROM ALL CAUSES:– Total Deaths. 52 weeks ending Dec. 30th, 1905.

Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough, Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3. Includes Phthsis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. SCARLET FEVER. 279 cases of scarlet fever were notified. 84 % of these were treated in hospital. The 279 cases yielded 15 deaths, which gives a case mortality of 5.34 %. This is higher than the case mortality of 1903 and of 1904. In both of those years it was under 4%. On the other hand, the number of cases per 1,000 of the population was lower than usual, only amounting to 2'0 per 1,000, or if the incidence be calculated upon the child population (children under 13), then the rate is 10.9 per 1,000, as compared with 18 per 1,000 in 1904. Hence, although scarlet fever seems to have been slightly more fatal, the number affected 12 was small. The curve opposite page 21 traces the notifications graphically, and may be compared with the mean five-year curve. The curve shows clearly that so far as seasonal influences affect the spread of the malady, scarlet fever followed quite a normal course during 1905. DIPHTHERIA. 123 cases were notified, and of these 5 died, equal to a case fatality of 4 %. This is a low fatality, showing that as a rule either the cases were milder than usual or the antitoxin treatment has appreciably reduced the danger of this serious malady. The case fatality in 1903 was 13 % ; in 1904, 107 %. A fair number of the notifications were confirmed by bacteriological investigation. The number of specimens sent through this department to the Jenner Institute was 42; of these 14 showed the presence of the diphtheria bacillus; in the remainder the bacillus was absent, and, therefore, no certificate of diphtheria received. It must not be understood that the above were the only cases diagnosed bacteriologically, a considerable number are examined and sent for examination by the medical attendant to other institutions or laboratories. ENTERIC OR TYPHOID FEVER. There were only 44 cases, and the probable causes lay, so far as could be ascertained, outside the Borough. The cases seem to have been of a mild type, for there were only 6 deaths, equal to a case fatality of 13.5%. DEATH RATES IN THE ST. MARYLEBONE ARTISANS' DWELLINGS. So large a population of workers live in Artisans' Dwellings that it is of some importance to know whether the death-rate fives anv indication of their healthiness or otherwise. The population of the various dwellings enumerated below has been carefully ascertained. Divided into adults and children (below 12) and arranged in order of population the enumeration comes out thus:– Children. Adults. Total. Wharncliffe Gardens 981 1,072 2,053 Portman Buildings 472 554 1,026 Miles Buildings 272 484 756 East Street Buildings 219 484 703 Nightingale Street Buildings 193 364 557 Carried forward 2,137 2,158 5,095 13 Children.

Without a doubt if the death-rate was dissected up and each dwelling taken separately great differences would be found; the older type of artisans' dwellings, as shown in the report for 1903, having a higher rate than the newer type. The broad fact, however, remains that the population living in the artisans' dwellings in the district showed for 1905 a low death-rate, and of those that died 287% were children under five years of age and about 7% of the deaths were old persons over 60 years of age. These low rates are not to be ascribed entirely to ample cubic space or to exceptional healthiness of dwelling, but one of the favourable influences is that the population is a selected one. There is a certain amount of competition to get into the dwellings, and 15 consequently those who are in constant work, those who are of sober habits, and those who appear farthest removed from poverty, naturally get the best chance. Such persons as these are less liable to fatal disease than those whose work is intermittent, who are ever on the verge of poverty, or who lead dissipated lives. THE CLEANSING OF PERSONS BATHS. In June the Public Health Committee resolved to extend the use of the baths in the interests of health, cleanliness, and education to the cleansing of school children who were reported to be unfit to go to school and mix with other children on account of verminous heads. Up to the end of the year, 460 children had been in this way treated. It has also become sufficiently obvious that the existing accommodation is absurdly inadequate, and to meet the growing demand more baths will have to be provided. At the present time the Public Health Committee and Council have this matter under consideration. The cleansing process is undertaken with the active cooperation of the officers of the County Council Educational Department, whose method of working is as follows:— Nurses are appointed whose duty it is to examine very carefully every child in any particular school. She notes all that have verminous heads. The parents are notified by a white card, which gives directions for cleansing. At the end of a week, if not cleansed, the child is made to sit apart from the rest, and a red card is sent out, giving a more urgent warning. If in another week the child is still unclean, the child is excluded and the parents prosecuted for not sending the child in a fit state to school. If only the heads were unclean, the parents might and ought to take the necessary measures themselves ; but experience has shown that in the majority of cases the clothing is also infected. To cleanse woollen clothing without injury to the fabric requires special appliances, such as steam disinfection ; hence the necessity of utilising the facilities afforded by the cleansing baths at the Shelter. According to the returns of the Medical Officer to the Educational Department of the London County Council, out of 119,762 school children examined in various schools in the County of London, no less than 44,000 had verminous heads—that is, about 37 in every 100. A list of cases is sent in regularly to this department, and the parents are given the address of the cleansing baths in Grove Road. Miss Baker, the Factory Inspector, has also given valuable assistance by calling upon many of the parents and giving advice generally. The following report by the Matron (Miss Kilgallin) of the special and general work done by the shelter and cleansing baths will be of interest:— 16 27, Grove Road, N.W., January, 1906. I beg to report the following with reference to the work of the year, 1905:— The Shelter. The shelter was used four days during the year ending 30th December, 1905, accommodating for various periods 4 Adults and 3 Children. The following is a detailed statement of the occupation:— 1905.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, LILLIE KILGALLIN, Matron. DISINFECTION. The Borough disinfects free of charge after cases of notifiable disease, and also (on request) after cases of consumption. There is also a good deal of gratuitous general disinfection done. The stoving of articles infested with parasites as well as the fumigation and so forth after measles are charged for, unless the applicant is unable to pay for the same. Hence in non-epidemic years there is a large amount of work done. There was much less infectious disease in 1905 than in 1904, yet the following list shows a considerable increase in the 1905 figures of the total number of articles disinfected. List of articles disinfected during 1904 1905 Beds 249 292 Mattresses 321 334 Bolsters 334 440 Pillows 854 988 Sheets 431 693 Blankets 1,137 1,047 Sundries 1,766 3.040 5.992 6,834 i8 NUISANCES. No less than 1,282 complaints of nuisances were received. Of these many were anonymous, not a few founded on insufficient grounds, and some may be called malicious. The man who is got rid of by his landlord, the servant who is dismissed, the employee who for some reason or other thinks herself ill-used, lodges an unsigned complaint at the office of the Local Authority for the purpose of annoyance. Nevertheless, although attempts are constantly made by individuals to further their private ends by making use of the machinery of the Public Health Acts, it is recognised that it would be unsafe to ignore information from whatever source, even if inspired by obvious malevolent motives, for in a residuum of cases the evil is real, not imaginary. As in past years, so in 1905, by far the great majority of nuisances were remedied directly the person legally liable for the same was apprised of the existence of the nuisance by letter or formal intimation ; hence the notices actually issued by the Public Health Committee were only 181. Of these more than half relate to defective drainage; the rest to a variety of miscellaneous matters, such as cleansing, defective yard paving, defective sanitary appliances, and so forth. The new powers under Part 1 of the London County Council General Powers Act, which enables a local authority to enforce the proper disinfection and cleansing of a verminous room or house were put in force twice, and the writer issued his certificate as required by the Act. Before the Act came into force such cases could be dealt with more or less perfectly under the general nuisance section of the Public Health Act; but the new law is more direct, and therefore easier to enforce. Before leaving the subject of nuisances there is one class of nuisance for which there is no satisfactory legal remedy, viz., the use of dark corners and quiet places for the purposes of a urinal. The usual communication is made to the police when complaint is lodged, but the police, it appears, have no power to deal with persons committing these acts unless there should be indecent exposure. The writer has long been of opinion that this matter should be the subject for legislation. It would be simple and just to make it an offence punishable by fine, always provided that there was a public urinal within say, 4CO yards, and that there was a notice on the wall or in sight of the particular spot stating clearly that no nuisance was to be committed there under a penalty, and that there was a public urinal situated in such-and-such a spot so many yards from there. 19 HOUSE DRAINAGE. Plans properly indexed of the majority of houses exist and are in the custody of the Public Health Department; some of the plans date back from the year 1856. They can be consulted by any person interested. The new plans deposited during the year amounted to 419 and dealt with 433 premises. The length of drainage supervised and tested by the Inspectors during the year amounted to 50,440 feet. If laid out in one continuous line the pipes would reach from Westminster Bridge almost to Croydon, for the length is over nine miles. Since so much time is taken up in the supervision of drainage and such supervision necessarily requires considerable technical knowledge, the Public Health Committee adopted the suggestion that two of the staff should practically confine their attention to this matter as an experiment until the duties of the whole staff were revised and settled accordingly. Messrs. Gorniot & Perry have undertaken this important duty, the one being allotted to the district south of the Marylebone Road, the other the district north of the Marylebone Road. So far they have carried the work out to my entire satisfaction. The only defect that the author can see in the supervision of new drainage works is the sub-division between the two Committees, the Works Committee being responsible for the portion of drain between the house and the sewer and for " combined " drains, and the Public Health Department for the drain within the house and fittings generally. Hence a builder or owner has to deal with two offices and much time may be, and in fact is, occasionally wasted by this arrangement. OVERCROWDING AND THE OCCUPATION OF KITCHENS. Both these offences are the direct result of poverty. It may be taken that few persons will herd together in an uncomfortable, unhealthy fashion if they could afford to pay higher rents for superior accommodation. It is impracticable and inhuman to put the utmost letter of the law in force in the central districts of the Metropolis against overcrowding. Granted that it is not healthy to sleep in a room with shut windows with a cube of somewhat less than 300 cubic feet, yet if a person cannot afford a better lodging, the alternative may be sleeping in the open on a winter's night. The law is peculiar as to kitchens; they must not be let " separately "—that is, not in conjunction with rooms on an upper floor save they conform to a number of conditions. If, on the other hand, they are let with some room—or, for aught I know, a cupboard—upstairs, such letting cannot be called " separate," and takes the kitchens out of the Act. This is law, but not 20 common sense. In point of fact, it is really silly, for one cannot see much difference, if it is unhealthy to sleep in a kitchen, whether a person occupies the whole house if he use the kitchen for sleeping purposes. The whole of the legislation with regard to underground rooms requires much revision. There are thousands work in rooms and places, lit by artificial light, much below the level of the street, without apparent injury, and because a room or place is below the level of the pavement it does not necessarily follow that it is not a proper place to live in. With regard to ordinary kitchens, all analyses of the air show that as a rule the air is purer than in the rest of the house. It is by the kitchen and basement that most of the air enters : the usual course being through the kitchens and basement passages up the stairs ; the writer has indeed found in tenement houses the air of the upper storeys by far the worst air. On the other hand not a few of the underground rooms are dark, and many of them damp. Darkness and dampness are in themselves sanitary defects of a serious character, rendering any room unfit for separate habitation, and does not touch the absurdity of drawing out a schedule of structural conditions any one of which, however trivial, renders the room legally uninhabitable. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The following reports are by the two inspectors to whom have been allotted special duties. The reports speak for themselves and give a connected and clear account of the work which has been accomplished during the year. REPORT OF MISS BAKER. January Ist, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit the following report of work for the year ending 1905 :— Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Number of workshops on register at end of year 1904 2,260 " " " " " " 1905 2,404 ,, additional workshops during the year 292 „ removals 148 ,, businesses represented 1,957 ,, re-inspections made 736 There is a marked improvement in the general conditions of workshops where women are employed. The complaints 21 received during the year number only 66, against 107 of the previous year ; and many of these were anonymous ones which were not substantiated by investigation. All kinds of trades are represented, dressmaking and ladies' tailoring being by far the most prominent. Hand laundries are few in number; three premises out of a total of 28 have ceased to be used for laundry work. Outworkers. Number on the register at end of year, 1904 625 „ of removals during the year 1905 43 • „ added to register 222 Making a total on the register of 804 This district forms a great centre for the tailor's trade, and the number of workers engaged therein increases yearly. Owing to the greater attention given to this subject by neighbouring Boroughs, the number of new names entered on the register during the past year was almost double that of the year 1904. The homeworkers' families have been entirely free from any infectious disease. Cleansing and repairing of the premises occupied have been enforced where needed. Births Attended by Registered Midwives. Since the end of the month of November, lists of these Birth Returns have been received weekly from the L.C.C. Out of 66 cases visited it has been found that the children, with only three exceptions, were breast fed and apparently healthy. Two have died at the age of two and three weeks respectively from bronchitis. Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. Verminous Children. Lists have been received periodically from the L.C.C. of children attending schools in the Borough and found on inspection by the Nurse appointed by the L.C.C. Education Department to be bodily verminous. I have visited the mothers of 80 such children, and left a card for each child, offering facilities for the use of a hot bath at the Shelter. Of course in many cases the parent disavows any such statement against her child, and while only a comparatively small number has up to the present availed themselves of the use of the bath, yet these visits, as also in the case of the Birth Returns, opened up possibilities for suggesting improvements in the too-often unhealthy and ill-kept homes of the poorer people. 22 Women's Underground Conveniences. These have been under regular inspection, and there has been no reason to complain of any work neglected by the Attendants. The repairs which are constantly needed have been done. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Frances A. Baker, Inspector. REPORT OF MR. RICHARD PHILLIPS. January 1st, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present a report of my work during the year, 1905 :— Factories and Workshops. There are in the Borough 166 registered workrooms which are occupied exclusively by men. The principal trades engaged in are Tailoring and Outfitting. These workrooms and shops have been regularly inspected, and where necessary cleansing has been done and insanitary conditions remedied. All new workrooms have been cubed up and registered in accordance with the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Bakehouses. There are at present 84 Bakehouses in use; of this number nine are on ground level and 75 are underground. Two Bakehouses above ground in St. John's Wood have been demolished during the year. Smoke Nuisances. The number of Smoke Nuisances detected or complained of during the year is 49. All chimnies accused of sending out black smoke have been diligently watched and observations made. Intimation Notices have been sent out and where the nuisance continued Statutory Notices followed. The Central Electric Supply Company was summoned for permitting black smoke to issue from the chimney shaft in Lodge Place. The summons was returnable for January 13th, but was not heard until January 27th. A prohibition order was granted and a penalty of £10. 23 Trade Nuisances. Complaints of three Trade Nuisances have been received and upon proof of the case they have been abated in every instance. « Underground Conveniences. I have supervised the work of the Attendants at the Underground Conveniences, and constantly inspected the premises, day and night, on Sundays and all Bank Holidays. Some repairs, alterations and painting have been done during the year. I have always found that the Conveniences were clean and well kept, and I am able to report satisfactorily on the work done by the Attendants, whose duties are chiefly arranged by me. Public Urinals. The 23 Public Urinals in the Borough situated above ground have been constantly inspected and all repairs attended to, and I have found the Urinals well flushed and clean, both week-days and Sundays. The Shelter, Grove Road. I have frequently inspected the Baths and Disinfector, and several alterations and repairs have been done during the year. I have found everything kept very clean and well attended to by the men in charge. Hotels, Restaurants, Coffee Shops and Dining Rooms. Of these, I have made inspections of 220 premises, special attention being given to the kitchens and all places where food is stored or kept. The lavatory accommodation has also been well inspected. Appended is a statement of such of my work as admits of tabulation :— Workshops ... ... ... 870 visits made Bakehouses ... ... ... 270 „ „ Restaurants, etc. ... ... 468 „ „ Smoke Complaints ... ... 298 observations made Home Workers' Premises ... 156 visits made Domestic Workshops ... 106 „ „ Public Urinals ... ...

The Clerical Work of the Department has been most efficiently performed by Mr. H. E. Curtis, the Chief Clerk, and Messrs. Howe and James. The correspondence relating to various health matters has been exceptionally heavy during the year, and the evening Committee meetings have necessitated from time to time work after the ordinary office hours. The following tabular statement summarises, as far as practicable, the clerical labours of the Department:- 1905. Number of Notifications of Infectious Disease, entered in Register, copied and sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board and Schools, receipt acknowledged and filed 700 Number of Complaints of Nuisances received acknowledged, entered in Nuisance Register and filed 1,282 Number of letters despatched from the Department 3,723 Number of Council Orders issued 181 Number of Meetings of Public Health Committee prepared for, attended, and Minutes drafted and prepared for Printer 25 Number of Meetings of Public Health SubCommittees prepared for, attended, and Reports drafted and written 41 Plans Registered and approved by Public Health Committee 419 Number of Cowkeepers, Dairymen, and Purveyors of Milk Registered 343 THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. The Mortuary and Coroner's Court, a building which St. Marylebone has good reason to be proud of and which has been taken as a model by other places, was cleansed, painted and generally done up during the year at a cost of .£33 by direction of the Public Health Committee. The Report of the Mortuary Keeper, Mr. Ellis, is as follows:— 25 REPORT OF MORTUARY KEEPER FOR THE YEAR 1905. Number of bodies received from January 1st to December 31st, 1905. Males. Females. Males.

Six hundred and seventy samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, have been analysed during the year. The greater proportion of the articles analysed consisted as usual of dairy produce. A systematic sampling was instituted ; every milk seller whose name appears on the register was visited and a sample taken in the same manner as an ordinary purchaser would buy ; if the sample was found to be adulterated, a second sample was then taken with all the formality of dividing into three parts, and so forth, laid down by the Act. In this way, and in this way only, can an accurate judgment be formed of the real amount of adulteration in the district; for the vendor in the first instance has no suspicion that the quality of the article purchased is going to be investigated. The inquiry was confined to traders having shops within the district; there still remain to be systematically investigated a number of traders who have no place of business in the Borough but sell milk in the streets. From 343 milk vendors on the register, 351 samples of milk were taken, and 56 of the 351 samples were below standard. There were not, however, 56 prosecutions, because 45 of the 56 were test samples, and on taking the official divided sample at a subsequent date, these 45 samples were found to be up to the standard. Still, so far as the public is concerned, the fact remains that of 351 half-pints of milk, 56 or about 16% were adulterated. PROSECUTIONS UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1905. Name. Address.

The official standard for milk is 8'5% solids not fat, which means milk sugar, casein and mineral matters, and 3% milk fat, which is practically butter fat, and the samples ranged from as low as 6'75% solids not fat, to as high as 9 96%, or just under 10%. The milk fat ranged from 2"5% up to 6% milk fat, but the mean or average composition of the whole is equal to 9'o6% solids not fat, and 3'57% milk fat, thus showing that save from the few offenders against the law, quite a good milk is sold in the district. One hundred and sixty-six butters were examined, 13 of which were found to be adulterated, that is to say, no one of the 13 were samples of butter, they were all margarines. These were purchased in the ordinary way, and the vendors had no suspicion that the samples were intended for analysis. In nine of the cases when the Inspector arrived on a second visit with bag and wrappers, the samples purchased were found to be butters ; in two cases the shops were closed, and in the remaining two margarine was sold as butter and the vendors prosecuted and fined. A very instructive history, showing that official sampling under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act only imperfectly protects the public. A list of the samples analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts is to be found in Table III. 28 TABLE III.—SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. Samples Analysed during the Year. 1905. Genuine.

PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE COUNCIL. Vol. XXV. 3, Upper Gtloucester Place W., Feb. 9th, 1905. No. I.

During the five weeks ending February 4th there have been registered 271 births and 203 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the five sub-districts as sey forth in Table IV. Fifty-nine of the deaths were extra-parochial, as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 46 Children's Hospital, Paddington 2 St. Mary's Hospital 2 North-Western Hospital 1 University College Hospital 1 Middlesex Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 1 Norwood London County Asylum 1 Ilford London County Asylum 1 London Temperance Hospital 2 In the streets 1 Total 59 The birth and death-rates, as deduced for the four weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 15.9; death-rate 14.1.

Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes 4 Health of the District during the month of January The absence of long-contiuued frost and cold wet weather has exercised a favourable influence on the death and sickness rate. The infectious diseases notified as shown by the curve facing page 6 are far below the average. These combined causes sufficiently account for the fact that January of 1905 has been, in respect of both fatal and infectious maladies, quite exceptional. Prosecutions under the Public Health Act. The Central Electric Supply Company was summoned for permitting black smoke to issue from the chimney shaft in Lodge Place. The summons was returnable for January 13th, but was not heard until January 27 th. A prohibition order was granted and a penalty of £10. The owner of 65 Mortimer Street was summoned for neglecting to obey a notice to re-drain. The Magistrate granted an order for the work to be done within 21 days, and costs. The owner of 52, North Street, Edgware Road, was summoned for a similar offence, and a similar order was obtained. Housing of the Working Classes. The Artisans Dwellings, erected by Lord Portman on the site of Nightingale Street, are about to be opened for occupation. The Dwellings consist of 9 blocks, lettered from A to J, each block containing from 15 to 20 tenements, the total number of tenements being 165. The character of the tenements is as follows:—40 oneroom tenements, 100 two-roomed tenements, and 25 threeroomed tenements. The average size of the one-roomed 5 tenements is 162 square feet super, and 1,356 cubic feet, hence they will accommodate man, wife, and child. The probable population of the whole buildings when occupied will be 450. The following is a schedule of the rents to be charged Rent Per Week. Estimated Kate. Total. 1-roomed tenement 2/8 8d. 3/4 to 3/- 8d. 3/8 2-roomed 4/6 1/- 5/6 to 5/4 1/2 6/6 3-roomed „ 6/2 1/4 7/6 to 7/- 1/7 8/7 The population of the old Nightingale Street, as determined by successive censuses taken by the Sanitary Inspectors, varied from 390 to about 40!). The number of families being 130. In 1884 it was found that 97 of the families occupied single rooms. The death-rate was over 24 per thousand, the sickness rate high, infective maladies spread rapidly, nuisances abounded and constantly recurred. It is, therefore, a subject of considerable moment and one for congratulation that, mainly owing to the public spirit of Lord Portman, so useful a block of habitations has taken the place of a slum, and that the rents to be charged will be within the means of a considerable section of the displaced population. 6 TABLE II.-TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.

Health of the District during the month of February. The health of the district generally compares favourably with the corresponding seasons of previous years save in a slight increase of fatal pulmonary complaints. This is apparently due to a wide diffusion of a species of catarrh probably the direct descendant of the serious epidemic of true influenza which prevailed in 1890-92, and since that period has reappeared in a modified form during the winter seasons. 16 TABLE II.–Giving the Causes of Deaths during February, 1905, at the Middlesex Hospital, Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, the Workhouse, the Hospital of St. John and Elizabeth, and the Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, W.

The mean death-rate for the corresponding period during the last five years was 21.4 per thousand. Quarterly Summary. During the March Quarter there have been registered 668 births and 581 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the five sub-districts as set forth in Table V.; 201 of the deaths were extra-parochial, as follows: — St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 136 North-Western Fever Hospital 7 London Fever Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 14 Children's Hospital 5 Belgrave Children's Hospital, Clapham Road 1 West London Hospital 2 University College Hospital 2 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 1 St. Thomas's Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 1 German Hospital, Hackney 1 Middlesex Asylum 1 London County Asylum, Norwood 7 Leavesden Asylum 2 London County Asylum, Colney Hatch 1 London County Asylum, Ilford 1 St. Peter's Hospital, Covent Garden 1 Whitechapel Infirmary 1 Home Hospital, Fitzroy Square 1 London Temperance Hospital 3 Craven Hill Creche 1 Salvation Army Maternity Home, Hackney 1 St. Joseph's Home 1 St. Luke's Home 1 Royal Hospital for Incurables 1 Royal Chest Hospital 2 Other addresses 2 In the streets 2 Total 201 25 Births and Deaths.

The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. TABLE I.

Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 26 Water Supply to Tenement Houses. Sections 2 and 48 of the Public Health (London) Act provides that where there is a constant supply of water, absence of proper water fittings shall be deemed a nnisance, and that an occupied house without a proper and sufficient supply of water shall be a nuisance, liable to be dealt with summarily, and if it is a dwelling house shall be deemed unfit for human habitation. It has hitherto been considered that a single tap. accessible to all the inmates of a tenement house, satisfied the statute. In a case, however, heard at the Woolwich Police-court the owner of a three storied tenement house was summoned for not providing the tenants with a proper water supply, although there was a tap in the yard, and the Magistrate made an order against the defendant with £5 5s. costs. The London County Council, by a circular letter, call the attention of the Borough Councils to this case, and express a hope that the various authorities will take all possible steps to secure the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water for the tenants of every floor of a tenement hotise. The writer does not think that the decision of a single magistrate on a case which was no doubt selected carefully can be applicable to all the tenement houses of the metropolis, nor have magisterial decisions to be taken as precedents. Any attempt to carry out the suggestion of the London County Council in a wholesale manner is to be deprecated; each case must be judged on its particular merits. It is no doubt inconvenient for the tenant of the upper floor of a high building to have, to carry water from the basement, and in some cases dirty conditions may for this reason prevail. On the other hand cleanly tenants will not let the distance of a water tap be a bar to getting a sufficient supply to keep their rooms in a proper state. The expense of improvements of this kind ultimately falls on the tenant, and the 27 enhancing of rents in this district is a greater evil than to have to descend a flight or so of stairs for a pail of water. Experiment shows that in the majority of three-storied tenement houses in St. Marylebone, a leisurely descent from the top story to the yard tap occupies 60 seconds. It may be difficult to convince most stipendiary magistrates that one minute's distance from a water supply is improper and insufficient. It has also been pointed out that if it is desirable to afford facilities for obtaining clean water on every floor it is equally desirable to provide sinks and down cast shafts to empty away refuse waters from every floor. It is difficult indeed to know where to stop when the matter of " convenience " is made the subject of legislative control. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. (see table IX). There have been 153 samples analysed during the quarter, 9 of which were found to be adulterated, these were all samples of milk. No preservatives were detected, but in 5 samples there was a small amount of artificial colouring matter. A considerable number of infants' foods were examined. In several cases there were statements on the labels not completely borne out by analysis. Much attention has lately been paid to the composition of brandies, and several prosecutions in other districts have taken place with varying results. The chief substance the analyst relies upon to form a judgment whether the brandy is a true French product distilled from the grape, is the proportion that the esters bear to the alcoholic strength. The brandies examined this quarter gave esters in the proportion of from 107 to 133 per 100 litres of alcohol, which is a fair proportion. All the tinned goods, the jams, and the sweets were tested for arsenic with a negative result. 28 The following vendors were prosecuted : Robert Burnside of 32, Salisbury Street, was summoned for selling milk diluted with 10 per cent. of water, and fined 5s. and 12s. 6d. costs.

Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 42 General Health of the District. The general health continues good, the mortality being low, and the brunchitic and influenzal winter affections subsiding. There is an epidemic of measles now prevailing and scarlet fever, as the curve shows (opposite page 44) is somewhat more prevalent than usual. On the other hand it is satisfactory to be able to report absolute freedom from small pox, a disease which when epidemic, is apt to show an increase in April, reaching its seasonal maximum in May. The Cleansing of Persons Act. An important report has just been issued by the London County Council on the Administration of the above Act. From this report it is shown that St. Marylebone took the lead in 1898, Hackney followed in 1902, and St. Pancras in 1904. In other Boroughs of the Metropolis tramps and dirty persons can be cleansed in baths, either attached to the casual wards or forming some part of the poor law machinery. In the report the fact is clearly brought out that success in the cleansing of dirty persons is only to be obtained by making such baths popular, in dissociating them from poor law administration, and in not worrying applicants with a number of restrictions. An important extension of the use of such baths has been initiated by St. Pancras in cleansing school children affected with lice. It is quite obvious that since the law compels each child to go to school, clean children must be protected from contamination by vermin, and every mother with any experience knows full well that a chance infection of any child leads to a marvellous multiplication of such parasites. The chance of this infection is by no means remote, for according to a return of two of the St. Marylebone Schools, out of 1,378 children examined, no less than 297 had verminous heads— that is, about 21.5 per cent. It may be these schools were exceptional; if they were not, it follows that of the 18,797 Marylebone children going to school, about 4,000 have dirty heads. 43 The Medical Officer of the School Board has organised a complete scheme of inspection by a qualified nurse or nurses in order to detect infested children and to prevent their attendance until cleansed. In St. Pancras a hand bill is distributed to the school teachers setting forth the fact that the Council of St. Pancras has provided baths and steam chambers for cleansing purposes, and the teachers suggest to the parents the utilisation of such facilities. The Public Health Committee of St. Marylebone after due consideration of these facts has sanctioned the experimental trial of the same system. It may indeed be affirmed that such children being bona fide residents have a right to avail themselves of the baths; certainly a greater right than persons whose residence is of such a shifting and migratory character as to be difficult of localisation. 44 TABLE II.—Giving the Causes of Deaths during the month of April, 1905, at the Middlesex Hospital, Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, the Workhouse, the Hospital of St. John and Elizabeth, and the Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, W.

The defendants pleaded guilty, stating that they have since deposited plans and had also remedied the faulty work. The Magistrate imposed a penalty in each case of 10s. with costs. Miss A. Woolfe, of 67, Maryland Road, Wood Green, was summoned for disobedience of an order to drain 18, North Street, Lisson Grove. The works having been commenced, the Magistrate adjourned the hearing for one month. Mr. H. J. Brown, of Mapesbury Road, was summoned for illegally letting kitchens, he having obtained a certificate under the Inland Revenue Act on the understanding that the said kitchens would not be let separately. The defendant was fined £1 and costs. 55 TABLE II.—Giving the Causes of Deaths during the month of May, 1905, at the Middlesex Hospital, Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, the Workhouse, the Hospital of St. John and Elizabeth, and the Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, W.

The mortality from infectious diseases is somewhat higher than the average, entirely owing to a widespread epidemic of measles. Although measles is not a notifiable disease, yet by Order all other statutory obligations as to preventing spread of infection are in force. It has been necessary to partially close several of the most affected schools, yet, up to the present the disease does not show definite signs of abatement. There is no hospital provision for measles; although such provision might not materially diminish the spread, it would certainly diminish the mortality; at present the majority of cases get unintelligent nursing, are housed under defective hygienic conditions, and are not effectively isolated. All other infectious maladies are below the average. (See curve opposite paye 66.) Prosecution under the Public Health (London) Act. The owner of No. 42, Lisson Grove was summoned for disobedience of a notice to drain the premises. The house is let on lease, and there was a dispute between the lessor and the lessee as to liability. Both parties were represented at the hearing. The fact of bad drainage was not disputed, and the lessor consented to an order for the work to be done within 28 days. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. A new departure has been taken during the last quarter. The Inspectors have had directions to take samples systematically from every milk and butter shop by means of agents, without dividing the samples or going through the red tape provided by the Act. It has long been 65 suspected that samples taken officially do not give any idea of the actual loss by adulteration inflicted on the Public. An Inspector starts on the war path with a bag containing a number of sample bottles, sealing wax, labels, and other paraphernalia, and after the first one or two samples, the news spreads with the same rapidity as in the case of motor traps arranged by the police. Subtle signs are exchanged from shop to shop, and the quality of the milk improves directly the Inspector with his bag heaves in sight. Out of 60 samples of milk taken by agents, and in such a manner that it is not likely any one of the vendors had a suspicion that the quality of the milk was to be investigated, no less than 20 were found wanting, either deficient in fat or watered. Of these 20 thirteen of the more flagrant cases were selected and the samples taken officially, but only six could be certified as adulterated. This experience is not peculiar to St. Marylebone ; in other districts numbers of unofficial samples have been taken, and when an attempt has been made to get from the same vendors official samples of a similar quality, only a few have been found adulterated. The remedy lies in the hands of the public. If the public require their milk pure they should themselves not only take samples, but take them in a manner rendering possible a prosecution. The official way of taking a sample is simple, although troublesome. The buyer must say to the milkman that he is going to have the sample analysed by the Public Analyst, and proceed to divide the sample into three parts, giving one part to the milkman, keeping one himself, and sending the third to the Analyst. Hence all that a householder need do is to lay in wait for the advent of the milkman with three 4-oz. bottles, provided with corks, sealing wax, and labels; it is also advisable to have a witness. If the procedure of the Act is strictly followed and the milk found adulterated, I do not see why the Local Authority should not relieve the householder of the cost and trouble of a prosecution and take up the case but this is only a possible suggestion. 66 So far as a small number of samples are concerned, it appears to be the same with butter as with milk; out of 54 samples of butter taken and bought as an ordinary purchaser would buy, two were found to be adulterated; attempts to get officially from the vendors of these two samples butter of similar quality failed. The divided samples were perfectly genuine. The following vendors were prosecuted:— Mr. H. S. Fryer, of 139, Seymour Place, was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of at least 67 per cent., and fined £1 with 12s. 6d. costs. Mr. F. P. Wallace, of 32, Burne Street, was summoned for selling milk diluted with at least 13 parts per cent. of water, and fined 19s. and with 12s. 6d costs. Mr. Wellington Green, of 7, Eamont Street, St. John's Wood, was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 10 per cent., and fined 10s. with 12s. 6d. costs. Mrs. Florence Havard was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 8 per cent., and fined 5s. and 12s. 6d. costs. JUNE, 1905.

The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes.

Tubercular 58 141 1.74 1.78 88 Cholera Contacts, Some apprehension was felt that owing to the general diffusion of cholera in certain parts abroad, the disease might be introduced into this country. Accordingly, the Medical Officers of the different English ports have ascertained the addresses of each passenger arriving from an infected port, and these addresses have been duly forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health for the several districts. A considerable number of Russians, Poles, and others with German names, have given addresses in East Marylebone. Of 14 such addresses no less than 7 could not be verified, although every effort was made by the sanitary staff to do so. One cannot help coming to the conclusion that in most of these cases a fictitious address was designedly given. The system would be excellent if in practice it could he carried out, but as it is, the most undesirable aliens and those most likely to import cholera, are the very persons who, on landing, disappear from all official control. This year the climatic conditions have, fortunately, been unfavourable for the propagation of cholera ; had it been otherwise, localised outbreaks would probably have occurred of greater or less extent according to environment. The reason for taking the address and verification of the same is that the contact may be visited, and the state of health observed; it is obvious that when no visit can be paid owing to a false address the whole object of the elaborate system fails of attainment. This being a matter of national concern, some better system of control will have to be devised. Prosecutions under the Public Health Act The owner of the Clifton Hotel, Clifton Hill, was summoned for neglecting to replace defective drains by new drains. The summons was adjourned by consent for one month, and the work at the present time is practically complete. The owner of No. 22, Little North Street was summoned for a similar offence, and an order obtained to do the work within 28 days, with one guinea costs. sy Changes in the Distribution of Duties of the Sanitary Staff. The suspension of Mr. Yeo necessitates a re-distribution of the districts of the Inspectors. Quite apart from the merits of the particular case, there are practical inconveniences resulting from a sudden suspension of an important and active officer, the more especially when no limit of time is fixed, and no one knows whether the suspension is to be for weeks, months, or years. In order for the time to cope with the routine work, the Public Health Committee has sanctioned the temporary employment of an additional Inspector, and, as an experiment the work of the district has been specialized, Messrs. Gorniot and Perry taking all the new drainage works, Mr. Perry supervising drains north of the Marylebone Koad, Mr Gorniot, drains south of the Marylebone Road. Ordinary nuisances and complaints being dealt with by Messrs. Andrews and Hodges, and the temporary Inspector. The Laboratory—Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. One hundred and twenty - six samples have been analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The system detailed in the last Chemical Report has been consistently followed, the Dairies of the district having been methodically visited and samples taken in the first place undivided, and, should the analysis show adulteration, this is followed up by taking a sample in the exact manner laid down by the statute. Eleven samples of milk which proved to be adulterated were mainly deficient in milk-fat. Up to the present five of these vendors have been visited, and samples taken sti'ictly under the Act. Four 011 the second visit sold milk of quite high quality. One was found wanting; this case was prosecuted ; Mrs. S. Pryer, of 102, Carlisle Street, being fined £2 with 12s. costs, for selling milk deficient in milk-fat to the extent of 7%. Two samples sold as butter (undivided) were found to be margarine. A second visit was paid and the samples taken officially, the result pure butter. 90 A sample of coffee was taken (undivided) and found to be coffee and chicory ; an official sample from the same shop was found to be pure coffee. This, added to the evidence of the former report, conclusively proves to the writer that a large number of vendors " spot" an inspector or his agent, and supply a different article to that they sell to the general public. 91 TABLE II.- TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OE INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.

Health of the District during November. The health of the district has been exceptionally good during the four weeks of .November. The mortality from pulmonary, tubercular and zymotic maladies has been lower than the average of the last live years The general death rate almost exactly the mean of the same period. 222 Amalgamation of St. Mary and the Rectory Districts. The Registrar-General has combined for registration purposes the districts of St. Mary and the Rectory. These two districts will henceforth be known as the district of St. Mary. Doubtless there is good reason for the change, but it is obvious that it would have been more convenient if the alteration was to take effect on the 1st of January, 1906, rather than the end of November, 1905. The writer proposes still to allocate the statistics of this district as • before until 1906. Iron Drainage versus Glazed Earthenware. The vibration from heavy motor traffic and from underground railways is affecting this district, and indeed, the whole metropolis, more or less seriously along the main channels of traffic. There have recently been instances of absolutely new drainage becoming defective from fracture of the pipes, and in the writer's opinion, in certain situations in which vibration is to be expected the only safe way will be the construction of iron instead of earthenware drainage. Drainage is a costly matter and when once put down should not require renewal for at least a quarter of a century. Prosecutions under the Public Health London Act. The owner of 30, Union Street, was summoned for disobeying a notice to' renew a defective soil pipe. The Magistrate granted an order for the work to be done within 14 days. The owner of 241, Marylebone Road, was summoned for not constructing, according to notice, a new drain through the premises, and the summons was adjourned. The owner of 10, Gresse Street, was summoned for letting a kitchen illegally, and the summons was adjourned on a promise that it would be vacated at a particular date. The owner of 43, Upper Rathbone Place, was summoned for re letting, after notice, a kitchen illegally, and fined 5s. with 9s. 6d. costs. NOVEMBER, 1! 05.
