Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1 have the honour to submit the Annual Report for the year 1948 in view of the fact that Dr. M. A. G. Ward, who was the Medical Officer of Health during this period, has now resigned on taking up his appointment as an Area Medical Officer of the Kent County Council. The vital statistics for the year under review are satisfactory and would lead one to believe that conditions of life in the Urban District are, generally, conducive to the health and longevity of its citizens. For examplei the Death Rate at 7.5 per 1,000 of the population compares favourably with the Death Rate of 10.8 for the whole of England and Wales, a state of affairs) which has been noted, annually, during past years. The Infant Mortality Rate, that sensitive index of social conditions, at 19.9 per 1,000 live births is the lowest ever reqorded in the area. The Birth Rate at 18.4, although lower than the rate of 22 per 1,000 during 1947, has shown only minor variations during the past 25 years and has consistently been above the general level for the country as a whole. During the year there were no deaths of mothers as a result of childbirth and a maternal mortality rate of nil may be regarded as an indication that ante-natal and midwifery services in the locality are satisfactory. During 1948, also, there was only one case of diphtheria, the first to occur since 1942—a very remarkable record and one which may not be unconnected with the success of the immunisation campaign. There were also no deaths due to measles or whooping cough, the number of deaths in the previous year being 1 and 3 respectively and there were, further, no deaths from infantile diarrhoea which is one of the reasons for the low Infant Mortality Rate. 3 The year was, of course, remarkable in that the National Health Service Act, 1946, came into operation on July 5th, and the District Council ceased to be a Welfare Authority on the transfer of the Maternity and Child Welfare Services to the County Council. It is well known that these services have been well administered on a local basis in the past and it is appropriate to remark that the figures for Infant and Maternal Mortality, the lowest ever recorded, are an indication of this fact While there is natural regret at the loss of these services there may also be a legitimate pride in the achievements of past years. As in previous years, the housing position of the area has, in common with the country as a whole, been. the most important health problem to be encountered and will continue to demand and to receive the most urgent attention of the Council. One of the greatest problems has been the urgent need to rehouse families where there was an open case of tuberculosis and the importance of this, especially where there are young children, cannot be exaggerated. Housing priority has been given in a number of cases referred to the Housing Committee. During 1948, two other events occurred which are directly connected with the promotion of the health of the area, one being the extension of the open spaces available to the public through the opening of Mayplace and the second being the arrangements for the opening of a community centre at the Manor House. There can be no doubt that developments of this nature must beneficially affect the health of the district and their value cannot be over estimated. I am sure that Dr. Ward would wish me, on his behalf, to thank the Council for the unvarying help and encouragement which the Health Department enjoyed during the year and also to thank the members of the Health Department who have worked loyally and well during this period. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and| Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

A Civic and Industrial Exhibition was organised by the Council during the week 14th and 21st February, 1948. The exhibition was a great success and approximately, seven thousand adults attended. In addition, parties of school children visited the exhibition under the supervision of their school teachers. The display by the Council dealt primarily with Public Health and Housing. A "Design of Houses" exhibition was on view. The Health Department's exhibits included domiciliary midwifery, showing a scale model room with facilities for Gas and Air analgesia, ideal bathing and cot equipment for babies, improvised playing materials for 14 toddlers, and models and posters demonstrating safety in the home. Diphtheria immunisation technique was displayed. A room in the Health Department was devoted to the varying aspects of life in a day nursery. The Sanitary Section of the Health Department included food inspection, disinfestation, disinfection, and smoke abatement. An item which proved of great interest to the younger visitors was the section on rodent control which included actual specimens of the various household pests. United Dairies provided a display stand emphasising the necessity for the proper cleansing of milk bottles before return. It may be significant that during the year only one complaint has been received regarding the condition of a milk bottle. Other exhibitors were as follows— Kent County Council, Post Office Savings Bank, National Fire Service, Co-operative Education Department, Public Utilities and the Crayford Industries. A fine spirit of co-operation was shown by all the exhibitors and the tastefully arranged stands were both educational and attractive. LABORATORY FACILITIES.

PUBLIC MORTUARY. The Public Mortuary maintained by the Council is situated to the left of the Town Hal1 Buildings. The Mortuary was in use on 6 occasions. CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Diphtheria Immunisation. Continuous propaganda was carried on as in previous years. The results of the work is reflected in the high percentage of Children immunised, and in the fact that only one case of Diphtheria has occurred in the area since 1942. Children are now immunised at the age of 8 months, receiving two injections of A.P.T. with an interval of four weeks between them. A further injection is given at the age of 5 years. The total number of children immunised during the half-year was as follows:— Under 5 years of age 272 Children receiving a further injection at the age of 5 years 164 The percentage of Child population Immunised at the end of the year cannot be given, as figures are no|t available. The number of children considered immunised at the end of 1947, was as follows:— Under 5 years 78 per cent. Over 5 and under 15 years 89 per cent. 16 Notifiable Diseases (other than Tuberculosis) during the year.

The following samples of food were submitted fi r examination and analysis during the year :— Tinned Minced Beef Loaf—reported to contain 2,400 parts iron and 206 part tin per million—Unfit for food. The remainder of the consignment, 27 tins were surrendered by the retailer. Beef Suet'—-reported on as being affected with fat necrosis.

In the case of the Grade 4 sample arrangeimenta were being made to take samples at the manufacturer's premises, in course of transit and at the retailer's premises. In the case of places like Crayford where so much of the Ice Cream sold is manufactured outside the district it is often difficult to obtain samples early enough to get them delivered to the Laboratory the same day. Milk. The fojlowing Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) Orders :— Principle Licences :— Pasteurised milk 4. Supplementary Licences :— Pasteurised milk 6. Tuberculin tested milk 6.

Whilst it is known from the particulars supplied by housing applicants that overcrowding does exist it is impossible to state the extent of such overcrowding. Only when a proper survey is carried out will the extent of overcrowding be revealed. The attention of the Housing Department was drawn to seven cases of overcrowding amongst housing' applicants. Notice under Section 66 of the Housing Act, 1036, was served on the occupier of a house, who was guilty of an offence under the Act. The overcrowding was subsequently abated. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water. The supply to the Crayford district is a mixture of water from Bexley, Crayford, Dartford, D a re nth,, Deptford, Wansunt and Wilmington wells and River Thames filtered water from Walton works. All thewater is chlorinated before it leaves the works. Bacteriological analyses were made five times per week of all supplies and consistently satisfactory resiilts were obtained. In the case of Bexley, Dartford, Darenth, Deptford, Wansunt and Walton filtered water was also tested before chlorination, but owing to the conditions of treatment at the other stations this is not possible. All new and repaired mains were chlorinated before being restored to use and samples of water from them tested bacteriologically. None of the supplies was plumbO' solvent. Two samples of well water taken by the Sanitary Inspectors were sent for bacteriological examination. 25 One was found to be satisfactory and in the other case where repeated samples were proving unsatisfactory arrangements were made to connect the premises to the M.W.B. supply. Water Supply. Extensions to the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board at Housing Schemes No. 20 (Martens Avenue Culde-Sac), and No. 29 (Maiden Lane—Cray Close) were carried out. Drainage and Sewerage. In a number of cases minor defects were discovered in sewers and drains during the course of sjewer' maintenance treatments for rodent infestations and steps were immediately taken to have these put right. A number of defective drains were also discovered in areas where bombing incidents had occurred and one is left wondering to what extent damage to house drainsl does exist. Rivers and Streams.
