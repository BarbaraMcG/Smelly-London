To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the Borough for the year 1904. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on April 6th, 1901, was 137,289, having increased from 113,781 during the previous five years. The population in the middle of 1904, estimated on the assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed between 1896 and 1901 has been maintained since, was 152,482, and on this figure the statistics in this report are based. 2 The following table shows the increase of the population of the Borough during the last 50 years.

The marriages registered during the year numbered 1,227, compared with 1,182, 1,123 and 1,139 in the three precedingyears. The marriage-rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 16.8, the average for the last 10 years being 16.3. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The total number of births registered in the borough during the year was 4,905— 2,512 of males and 2,393 of females. This is equivalent to a birth-rate of 32.2 per 1,000, which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The continued decline in the birth-rate of Fulham of recent years, which is shared by nearly every part of the United Kingdom, will be seen on reference to table II. The birth-rate of the County of London was 27-9, being lower than in any previous year, the rate in the preceding 10 years averaging 29.0 per 1,000. Among the various metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 14-8 in the City of London, 16.4 in Westminster, 16.6 in Hampstead and 19.3 in Kensington, to 32.7 in Poplar, 34.9 in Bethnal (xreen, 36.4 in Finsbury and 37.0 in Stepney. In 75 provincial towns the birth-rate averaged 29.6 per 1,000. 3 TABLE II. Vital Statistics of whole District during 1904 and 'previous years. Year. Population Estimated to Middle of each Y ear.

The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7,corrected by the substraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non.residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or Infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term " Residents " is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have tiled in public institutions elsewhere. The "Public Institutions" taken into account for the purposes of these tables are those into which iiersons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses, and lunatic asylums.

Corrected for these the birth-rate of Margravine Ward was 84.1, and that of the Borough 31.9. . Illegitimacy. The illegitimate births numbered 207—139 males and 12 8 females—forming 5'5 per cent, of the total births. Still-born Children. 188 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 26 living Excess of Births over Deaths. The actual increase of the population of the Borough by the excess of births over deaths was 2,559, compared with 2,417, 2,302 and 2,743 in the three preceding years. 5 DEATHS AND DEATH.KATE. The deaths of 2.332 persons—1,129 males and 1,203 females —were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 300— 166 males and 134 females—were of persons not residing in the district, who died in public institutions within the borough; while the deaths of 314 persons—174 males and 140 females—belonging to Fulham occurred outside the district, chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 2,346 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham—1,137 males and 1,209 females—being in the proportion of 15.4 deaths per 1,000 persons living, the rate for males being 15.9 and for females 14.9. The death.rate is higher than last year, when it was only 13.9, but with this exception is the lowest recorded in Fulham. The death.rate of the County of London in 1904 was 16.6, the rates in the various boroughs ranging from 10.2 in Hamp. stead, 12.0 in Lewisham and 13.3 in Stoke Newington, to 20.1 in Southwark, 20.4 in Shoreditch and 21.3 in Finsbury. The death.rate of England and Wales was 16.3, and that of 76 large towns 17.2. Distribution of Deaths. Table IV., which is prepared in accordance with the instructions of the Local Government Hoard, gives the causes of, and the ages at, death. In table IV. will also be found the numbers and the causes of the deaths in the several Wards of the Borough, and the following table gives the death.rates of each Ward for 1904 and the eight preceding years. 6 TABLE IV.

The Medical Officer of Health of the County of London, Sir Shirley Murphy, has published a factor for the correction of differences in the age and sex constitution of each metropolitan borough. This is arrived at by obtaining the age and sex distribution of the population of a borough at the last census, and after ascertaining the death-rate for each sex, at each age period, in England and Wales during the last ten years, a calculation is made of the number of deaths which would have occurred in the district had similar rates prevailed, and a "standard" death-rate is obtained. The difference between this rate and that of England and Wales is assumed to be due to differences in the ages and sex constitution of the population of the district, and by dividing the latter by the former a factor is obtained for correcting the crude death-rate of the district. 9 Corrected in this way the death.rates of Fulhara, the County of London and the adjoining boroughs were as under:— TABLE VI. Crude Death.rate. 1904. Corrected Death.rate. 1904. Fulham 15.4 16.1 Kensington 14.3 15.4 Hammersmith 15.7 16.4 Chelsea 16.5 17.1 County of London 16.6 17.5 Seasonal Mortality. The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under:— Deaths. Death-rate. 1 st Quarter 598 15.7 2nd „ 522 13.7 3rd ,, 626 16.4 4th „ 600 15.8 Mortality in former years. In table II. will be found the number of deaths and the death-rate for each of the ten preceding years. The difference between the rate for 1904 and the average rate for the ten preceding years, which was 17.3, represents a saving of 282 lives. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. Of the 2,346 deaths registered 752, or 33 per cent., were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was 153 per 1,000, being 26 per 1,000 in excess of that for 1903, but 7 per 1,000 below the decennial average. The corresponding rate of the County of London was 144 per 1,000, the decennial average being 154 per 1,000. Among the metropolitan boroughs the lowest rates were 94 in St. Marylebone, 104 10 in the City of London, 109 in Holborn, and 113 in Hampstead, while the highest rates were 157 in Bethnal Green, 172 in Bermondsey, 174 in South wark, and 188 in Shoreditch. In England and Wales the rate of infantile mortality was 146 per 1,000, and in the 70 great towns it averaged 160 per 1,000. In the several wards of the borough the infantile mortality was as under:— TABLE VII. Deaths of Infants under one year. Deaths of Infants under one year of age to 1,000 births. Haron's Court Ward 39 186 Lillie Ward 104 143 Walham Ward 73 191 Margravine Ward 121 158 Munster Ward 184 145 Flurlingham Ward 36 162 Sands End Ward 158 157 Town Ward 37 122 The Borough 752 153 Infantile mortality in Fulham is always high, and as will be seen from the following charts, although the mortality at all ages is usually lower than that of the County of London, the infantile mortality has, excepting in 1900 and 1903, been always above that of the metropolis. The question of the advisability of providing a municipal milk depot in the Borough, with the view of endeavouring to reduce the infantile mortality, and especially that from Diarrhoea, has been under the consideration of the Public Health Committee, but in view of the fact that judging from the experience of places where they have been tried the cost to the rates would amount to some £600 or £700 a year, the Committee have not felt justified in recommending the Council to establish one at present. Of other methods of endeavouring to reduce infantile mortality the plan which has been adopted by some sanitary * - - — , , t M , ,, , ,, -l„ , . DEATH-RATES AT ALL AGES, COUNTY OF LONDON & FULHAM, 1886—1904. INFANTILE DEATH-RATES COUNTY OF LONDON & FULH AM, 1886 - I904. 11 authorities of appointing lady inspectors, who may be reinforced by voluntary assistants, to pay nursing visits, deserves serious consideration, as the results appear to be most encouraging. The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras has drawn attention to the success attained by this method in Preston, where infantile mortality has always been notoriously high. Here since the appointment of lady inspectors to advise mothers, there has been a marked fall in the mortality, which compares most favourably with that of towns where milk depots have been established, as the following figures for 1897 and 1904, in which years the meteorological conditions were similar, show. Deaths of Infants. Decrease per 1,000 births. 3rd Quarter, 3rd Quarter, 1897. 1904.

Deaths of Children under five years of age. Between the ages of one and five years 315 deaths were recorded, so that the deaths of children under the age of five years numbered 1,067, or 45.5 per cent. of the total number. These deaths were equivalent to an annual rate of 53.9 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age. Insurance of Infants Certificates under the Friendly Societies Acts were issued in respect of 558 children under the age of five years, 52.3 per cent. of the children dying at this age period being insured. 12 Mortality at School Aye. At the ages of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 68 deaths, or 2.9 per cent. of those at all ages, representing a mortality of 2.1 per 1,000 of those living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. Between the ages of 15 and 25 years, 73 deaths, or 3.2 per cent. of the total number, were recorded; the rate of mortality being 2.7 per 1,000. Mortality at Maturity. 764, or 32.5 per cent. of the deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65, the mortality at this age-period being at the rate of 11.0 per 1,000. Mortality at Decline. At the age of 65 and upward 374 deaths were registered, or 15.9 per cent. of those at all ages, corresponding to a death-rate of 74.7. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. To the seven principal zymotic diseases 380 deaths were ascribed, viz:— TABLE VIII. Smallpox — Measles 64 Scarlet Fever 4 Whooping Cough 58 Diphtheria 24 Enteric Fever 6 Diarrhoea 224 380 These deaths correspond to a death-rate per 1,000 living of 2.51 per 1,000. 13 During the past 10 years the deaths and death-rates from the seven principal zymotic diseases have been as under:— TABLE IX. Year. Deaths.

Among the various metropolitan boroughs the lowest rates were 0.60 in the City of London, 0.66 in Hampstead, 0.87 in Westminster, and 113 in Stoke Newington; while the highest rates were 3.13 in Southwark, 3.20 in Shoreditch 3.35 in Poplar, and 3.52 in Bermondsey. In England and Wales the death-rate from these diseases was 1.94 per 1,000, and in the 70 great towns it averaged 2.49 Distribution of Deaths from Zymotic Diseases.

Fatality.—The disease was again of a very mild type, the four deaths representing a ease mortality of 1.4 per cent., the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The following table shows the comparative prevalence of Scarlet Fever in the various wards of the Borough and in the County of London during the past nine years:— TABLE XVII.

Fatality.—The disease terminated fatally in 24 instances, the proportion of deaths to notification being 8 per cent. The reduction of recent years in the fatality of Diphtheria, due mainly to the use of antitoxic serum, will be seen from the following table:— TABLE XVIII. Year. Number of Cases. Number of Deaths.

Of those certified to be suffering from the disease, 29, or 77 per cent., were removed to hospital for treatment. In six instances the disease was contracted outside the district, and in two cases there were strong grounds for suspecting shell-fish as the origin of the infection. Fatality.—Six cases proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 15.4 per cent. '22 The incidence of Enteric Fever in Fulham during the preceding 10 years is shown in the following table:- TABLE XX. Number of eases notified per 10,000 inhabitants.

Of the patients notified as suffering from Scarlet Fever 13, or 4.5 per cent.; from Diphtheria 27, or 9 percent.; and from Enteric Fever 5, or 11 per cent., were subsequently ascertained not to be suffering from those diseases. Puerperal Fever. Eight cases of Puerperal Fever, or 1.7 per 1,000 births, were notified, of which four proved fatal, or 0.85 per 1,000 births. Erysipelas. 131 persons were certified to be suffering from Erysipelas, which was the assigned cause of seven deaths. Chicken-pox. In consequence of the increase of Small-pox in some parts of London, the London County Council, with the approval of the Local Government Board, extended to Chicken-pox the 23 tion of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requiring the notification of certain infectious diseases, for a period of seven months from April 8th, 1904. During this time 358 cases of Chicken-pox were notified in Fulham. DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. The epidemic which commenced in July, 1903, and affected in that year only the northern portion of the borough, extended in 1904 to the southern portion, and in the first six months of the year that part of the Borough was severely affected. The deaths from Measles in the four quarters of the year were:— 1st Quarter 29 deaths. 2nd „ 26 „ 3rd „ 6 „ 4th „ 3 „ 64 The premises in which the cases occurred were disinfected by the Council, excepting those in respect of which a certificate was received from a medical practitioner, that they had been disinfected to his satisfaction. The cases which were reported to the Medical Officer of Health by the teachers of the Schools numbered 831, and were distributed as under:— Cases reported. Barons Court Ward 32 Lillie „ 71 Walham „ 58 Margravine „ 51 Munster „ 140 Hurlingham „ 21 Sands End „ 441 Town „ 17 831 24 The deaths and the death-rate from Measles during the preceding 10 years are shown in the following table:— TABLE XXI.

Diarrhoea. Under the heading Diarrhoea are included several different affections confounded with one another on account of the presence of Diarrhoea as a symptom, hut there is no doubt that Summer Diarrhoea, which is so fatal to infants, is essentially a specific disease. The deaths ascribed to Diarrhoea, Epidemic Enteritis or Zymotic Enteritis, numbered 224, corresponding with a death-rate of 1.47 per 1,000, or 0.32 above the decennial average of 1.15. 183 deaths, or 8.5 per cent., were of infants under one year of age, and 33of children between one and five years of age. In addition to the deaths due to Diarrhoea or its synonyms, 31 deaths were ascribed to Grastro-Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis, &c., the majority of which were doubtless of the same nature. 25 The deaths in each quarter of the year were:— 1 fit Quarter 9 2nd „ 14 3rd 177 4th ,, 24 During the first three weeks of August no less than 116 deaths were registered from Diarrhoea or Enteritis, representing for this period an annual death-rate per 1,000 of 13.0. The diarrhœal mortality in Fulham compared, as is always the case, unfavourably with that of other Metropolitan Boroughs, only three boroughs, viz., Shoreditch, Poplar and Bermondsey, having higher rates. The excessive diarrhœal mortality of Fulham, as compared with the adjoining boroughs, will be seen from the following table:— TABLE XXII.

Tubercular Diseases. Phthisis was the assigned cause of 217 deaths, the decennial average corrected for the increase of population being 221, while 78 deaths were ascribed to other tubercular diseases, such as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica, and General Tuberculosis. In the several Wards of the Borough the death-rates from Phthisis and other tubercular diseases were as under:— TABLE XXIII.

The voluntary notification of cases of Tubercular Phthisis, which was begun in 1902, has been continued, and 165 notifications were received—45 occurring in private and 120 in public practice. 27 The cases notified in the various Wards were as under:— Barons Court Ward 12 Lillie „ 28 Walham „ 20 Margravine „ 24 Munster „ 31 Hurlingham „ 8 Sands End „ 24 Town „ 15 165 In all cases in which permission could be obtained the rooms, bedding, &c., were disinfected after the removal or death of the patient. Influenza. 18 deaths were registered from Influenza, the numbers for the three preceding years being 15, 36 and 17. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 128 deaths, being 26 in excess of the average of the past 10 years, allowing for the increase of the population. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases there were 403 deaths, or 17.2 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 117 below the corrected decennial average. Alcoholism. 41 deaths were directly attributed to Alcoholism or to Cirrhosis of the Liver, against 27, 39, and 28 in the three preceding years, and in twelve cases the disease to which death was attributed was stated to have been accelerated by alcohol, but these represent but a small proportion of the actual number. Certification of the Causes of Death. Of the 2,346 deaths registered, 2,131, or 91 per cent., were certified by registered medical practitioners, and 215 by the coroner after inquest. 28 Inquests. At the 215 inquests held on inhabitants of Fulham, the following verdicts were returned:— Deaths from natural causes 95 Deaths through accident or negligence— Run over 16 Falls 25 Burns or Scalds 10 Drowning 2 Suffocation of infants in bed 15 Want of attention at birth 11 Ptomaine poisoning 1 Lead poisoning 1 Other injuries 18 99 Suicide 17 Homicide 1 Open verdict:—found drowned 2 Cause of death not ascertained 1 215 DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. Although the two Boroughs, Fulham and Hammersmith, which formerly constituted the Fulham Union, are now separated for poor law purposes, the poor of Hammersmith are still, pending the completion of the Hammersmith Workhouse and Infirmary, accommodated in these institutions. In 1904 the deaths of 563 persons occurred in the Infirmary and of 24 in the Workhouse. Of these 384 belonged to Fulham and 203 to Hammersmith and other districts. Western Fever Hospital. 108 deaths occurred in the Western Fever Hospital, of these 18 belonged to Fulham and 90 to other Metropolitan Boroughs.+ 29 Deaths occurring outside the Borough among persons belonging thereto.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The facilities afforded by the Council for the bacteriological examinations of suspected material, as an aid to diagnosis continue to be much appreciated by medical practitioners, and the following specimens were examined during the year. Number of Specimens. Material from cases of suspected Diphtheria. Klebs Loffer or true Diphtheria bacillus isolated 38 Pseudo Diphtheria bacillus of Hoffman isolated 13 Negative result 127 178 Examinations of blood from cases of suspected Enteric Fever.

All infected articles were disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station, Townmead Road. The total cost of the station for the year was £1,054, including £217 for interest and £110 for repayment of principal. During the three last years the work was done by a contractor the cost averaged £1,257, and at that time disinfection was not carried out after Measles or Tuberculosis as is now the case. FOOD SUPPLY. Milk. There are now 258 milkshops on the register, which have been systematically inspected by Inspector Jones. Ice Creams. 121 premises in which ice creams are made or sold have been registered and were frequently inspected. Cowsheds. The licences of the undermentioned cowsheds were renewed by the London County Council in October, no objections being raised by the Borough Council. PREMISES. LICENSEE. NO.

The stalls and shops where food is stored or sold have been regularly inspected. Proceedings were taken against a tradesman in King's Road in respect of some unsound haddocks which were exposed for sale, and a penalty of £25 was imposed. 67 cases of fruit and seven boxes of fish examined at the request of the owners were condemned and destroyed. Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The following samples were taken for analysis in 1904:— Article. N umber of Samples. N umber certified to be Adulterated. Number certified to be of inferior quality. Percentage of Adulteration. Milk 245 41 35 16.8 Butter 369 57 6 15.5 Coffee 14 6 — 42.9 Brandy 24 11 2 45.8 Whisky 2 — - — Potted Meat 8 — — - Cayenne Pepper 2 — — — Cod Liver Oil 1 — — — Camphorated Oil 1 — — — Jam 2 — — - Cheese 1 — — - Baking Powder 1 — — — Cinnamon 1 — — — Cream of Tartar 1 — - — Honey 1 — — — 673 115 43 17.1 In the four preceding years the samples purchased for analysis were as under:— Number of Samples.

It was evident that some tradesmen were careful to supply a genuine article to any chance customer who might prove to be acting on behalf of the Inspector, but reserved their adudterated goods for regular customers, as at certain shops the Inspector's Deputy was at first always supplied with genuine butter, but when after several visits he became known as an ordinary customer he was then supplied with margarine. Unfortunately the fines inflicted by some magistrates are quite inadequate to check systematic fraud of this character, which, as will be gathered, is very difficult to detect. Thus in one case after genuine butter had been sold on five occasions, the customer was supplied—when he had become known—with margarine on three successive purchases, but on the prosecution of the vendor, the last sample having been purchased with the usual formalities, he was only fined £2, although he had been on four occasions previously convicted for a similar offence. In February, 1904, the Council resolved that the work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act should be carried out by one Inspector alone, and Inspector C. B. Jones was directed to undertake this duty. This arrangement has in my opinion worked admirably, Inspector Jones has shewn great energy and tact in the execution of his duties, and the Acts are now administered in Fulham in a most efficient manner. 35 Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts were instituted by the Council in the following cases:— DEFENDANT.

At the end of 1903 there were 316 workshops on the register, and during 1904 102 have been added and 38 removed, so that at the end of 1904 there were 380 registered workshops. Underground Bakehouses. Certificates of suitability have been granted by the Council in respect of 50 underground bakehouses. Proceedings were taken against the occupier of an underground bakehouse, whose certificate was refused, as he had failed to comply with the Council's requirement to instal electric light in his bakehouse, and a nominal penally of £1 imposed on his undertaking to light his bakehouse as required. This was done, and a certificate was then granted by the Council. The existing bakehouses have been kept under regular observation, and notices served in respect of two of them were promptly complied with. WORKPLACES. Places where Food is Prepared. 83 premises, such as coffee-houses, &c., where food is prepared, have been registered. 176 inspections were made of them, and 45 notices served in respect of various defects found. Sanitary Conveniences at Workplaces. Proceedings were taken against an Omnibus Company for failing to provide in compliance with the Council's notice sufficient sanitary conveniences at their stables, but the summons was withdrawn on the payment of the costs, and an undertaking that the Company would provide the conveniences required by the Council. The following is a summary of the work done in connection with the inspection of factories, workshops and workplaces in tabular form, as suggested by His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Factories. 39 TABLE A.

During the year the following drainage plans of proposed new buildings were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee:— Houses and Shops 200 Factories, &c. 9 Blocks of Flats 1 School 1 Nurses Home 1 Additions to existing buildings 25 237 COMBINED DRAINAGE. Twenty-two systems of combined drainage, for portions of which the Council was liable, owing to certain of the pipes which received the drainage of more than one building, forming "sewers" within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were reconstructed during the year at a cost to the Council of £269 l1s. 7d., the work being carried out by a contractor at a schedule of prices. The sum of £77 18s. 9d. was also paid to owners in respect of work, executed by them in compliance with notices served by the Council at 10 houses in connection with house drains, which were "sewers" as defined by the Metropolis Management Act. A decision with regard to a combined drain was given in the Court of King's Bench by Mr. Justice Channell in the case of Heaver and Others v. The Mayor, &c., of Fulham. The action was first, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from entering upon the premises, 29, Rosebury Road, and breaking open, altering, or in any way interfering with the drain or sewer thereon; and secondly, for a declaration that the pipe draining the house was a "sewer." The Borough Council had served upon the defendants notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Metropolis 42 Local Management Act, 1855, to relay and ventilate a defective drain at 29, Rosebury Road. The plaintiffs appealed against the notice served under the Metropolis Management Act to the London County Council, who adjourned the matter sine die for proceedings to be taken in a court of law. With a view to raising a legal issue, a notice was served by the Council upon the plaintiffs, under Section 83 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, to disconnect the drain of 27, Rosebury Road, from the drain of 29, Rosebury Road, with the result that the plaintiffs brought the above-mentioned action. The facts with regard to the drains of the houses were as follows. The Vestry of the Parish of Fulham had in 1887 approved a plan for the drainage of the houses in Rosebury Road in pairs. The plan merely showed for each pair of houses two straight lines (one under each house) meeting at an acute angle in front of the houses; and another straight line drawn from the point of junction of the other two, and meeting the sewer at right angles. At 27 and 29, Rosebury Road, the drainage was carried off by two pipes, one under each house, which joined, as shewn in the plan, in the forecourt, and reached the sewer by a single pipe. The pipe, however, under 29, Rosebury Road, took the whole of the drainage of that house together with that from a sink at the back of 27, Rosebury Road, this connection having been made at the time the houses were built. The trustees of a settlement were owners of both houses, who derived their title without any purchase for value from the original owner by whom the houses were built. Mr. Justice Channell held that there was an order for the houses to be drained in pairs, and that as no details were shewn in the plans, it might be interred that these had been left to the Surveyor to deal with, and that he had approved of the connection of the drain from the sink gulley of 27 with the drain of 29, consequently he held that the drainage as laid was a combined system of drainage, laid with the sanction of the authority, and, therefore, the pipe in question was a "drain" and not a "sewer." 43 Mr. Justice Channell further held that even if the connection had been made without authority, the present plaintiffs, not being purchasers for value, could get no higher rights than the original owners had as against the public; and the pipe would still remain a drain, as it was impossible to say that the wrongful act of the owners could make the drain a sewer. HOUSING. The Council decided not to proceed with the scheme for the erection of a block of dwellings on their land in Townmead Road. plans for which had been prepared by the Borough Surveyor. Houses Let in Lodgings. The Local Government Hoard have expressed their willingness to sanction some new bye-laws which have been framed to meet the difficulty caused by the decisions of the Court of King's Bench in the cases of Stiles v. Galinski and Nokes v. The Mayor, &c., of Islington. Certificates under the Revenue Acts. Applications were made for certificates in respect of 487 dwellings, of which 304 were granted, 137 were given after certain specified works had been completed, and 46 were refused, REMOVAL OF MANURE. Complaints were received respecting the nuisance arising during the removal of the manure from the stables of the Star Omnibus Company in Filmer Road and Grimston Road. At these stables, both of which are in populous localities, the peat litter was first placed in fixed receptacles and thence transferred into vans for removal, and by the turning over of the refuse a most abominable stink was caused. Proceedings were taken by the C ouncil against the Company under Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, which provides "that where any building used for any trade or business causing effluvia is certified to be a nuisance, proceedings shall be taken by the sanitary authority, and if it appears to the Court that the trade or business carried on by the person complained of is a nuisance, then, unless 44 it is shown that such person has used the best practicable means for abating the nuisance, or Preventing or counteracting the effluvia, the person so offending shall be liable to a fine. The summons was withdrawn on the payment of £3 3s. costs and an undertaking by the Company that the peat refuse should in future be deposited in vans immediately on its removal from the stalls. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Twelve intimations and seven statutory notices under the Public Health (London) Act were served in respect of chimneys (not being chimneys of private dwelling houses) sending forth black smoke in such quantities as to be a nuisance. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. The following is a summary of the sanitary work of the year:— Complaints received 1,460 Intimation notices served 2,491 Statutory notices served 832 Nuisances abated.
