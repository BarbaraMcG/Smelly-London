The Vestry of Bermondsey. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISH OF BERMONDSEY, for the year 1898. BY JOHN DIXON, M.D., Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, Licentiate in Midwifery, etc. Fellow of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. Medical Officer of Health for the Parish. London: FREDERICK SHAW & CO., Printers, Dockhead, S.E. 1899. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical officer of health To the Vestry of Bermondsey— Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, My Twenty-third Annual Report on the sanitary condition and vital statistics of the Parish of Bermondsey relates to the period of 52 weeks which commenced on the 2nd day of January, and ended on the 31st day of December, 1898. The births were 86, and the deaths 112, fewer than the numbers recorded in the previous year. The prevailing zymotic diseases were diarrhœa, measles, whooping cough, and diphtheria, but the mortality from each of these diseases was less than it was in 1897. There were also fewer deaths from scarlet fever and enteric fever. Diseases of the respiratory organs were less fatal, and those of the tubercular order were not more so. The deaths from cancer, which had been steadily increasing in number during the last five years, were 5 less than in 1897. The number of deaths of parishioners which took place in hospitals and outlying public institutions was further increased by 31. The majority of these deaths took place in Rotherhithe Infirmary. The deaths in asylums numbered 29. The number of institutions in which the extra parochial deaths are distributed is nearly 40. In September the registration districts of Leather Market and St. James' were united, and the registration area is now one district for the whole of the parish. The population, at the middle of the year, is estimated to be 85,738 persons. This is probably an under-estimate, as the number of artisans' dwellings increases year by year, and the demand for small houses is not in the least abated. I am strongly of opinion that the present density of 137 persons per acre is quite sufficient to affect the death-rate unfavourably, and that any further crowding of more people on a limited area, which is destitute of open spaces, is not desirable from a sanitary point of view. The question of overcrowding has been exaggerated and misrepresented. The fact that a person with a large family is unable to find a house or a room in the parish to suit his requirements is no proof whatever that a single house is overcrowded, or has not the necessary cubic space for its inmates, but, on the contrary, it is a proof that overcrowding is not permitted in Bermondsey, that the Vestry's By- Laws are stringent, and are carried out with due vigilance by the Inspectors, and that without such By-Laws and constant inspection a lamentable amount of overcrowding would very rapidly take place. Whether the area of the parish, is or is not already crowded with houses is an entirely different matter. The existence of 30 blocks of model lodging-houses and artisans' dwellings, with 1,597 tenements, has had no effect in reducing the competition for small private dwelling-houses, or lowering their rents. BIRTHS. The number of births registered in the Parish during the year was 3,090, which is 86 less than in 1897. The boys numbered 1,544, and the girls 1,546. The total births are 581 less than they were 23 years ago. The proportion of the sexes has become reversed. In 1876 there were 110 males born to 100 females. The annual birth-rate was 35.1 per 1,000 of the estimated population. The London birthrate was 29.5, being the lowest on record. For several years the birth-rate has been steadily declining in the country generally, as well as in London. The number of children born in the first quarter of the year was 832; in the second quarter 732; in the third quarter 770; and in the last quarter 756. The excess of births over deaths was 1,319, but the increase of population is only estimated at 158. If the average birth-rate in London had prevailed in our Parish there would have been 2,529 births instead of 3,090. We had therefore an excess of 561 infants. As the death-rate of children under one year of age was 15.7 per cent., the mortality on 561 infants would be 88 additional deaths, quite irrespective of any insanitary conditions, and would add 1.3 to the general death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants. DEATHS. The deaths registered in Bermondsey during the year numbered 1,268, being 143 fewer than in the previous year. The deaths of parishioners in hospitals, asylums, and other public institutions were 503, an increase of 31. The total deaths were therefore 1,771, corresponding to an annual rate of mortality of 20.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. The death-rate in the Metropolis, as a whole, was 18.7. The male death-rate was 20.4, and the female death-rate 17.1. The number of deaths in the Parish during the first quarter of the year was 356; in the second quarter 262; in the third quarter 310; and in the last quarter 340. The number of deaths of children under one year of age, inclusive of deaths in hospitals, was 485. The proportion of these deaths to 1,000 registered births was 157. The like infantile deathrate in London was 167. This was a rather high rate, as the mean of 10 previous years was 151. This rate is very much affected by the/ prevalence of summer diarrhœa, which is excessively fatal to young children. The amount of diarrhœa depends, in a great measure, on the temperature of the air at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. CAUSES OF DEATH. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 258 deaths, against 371 in the previous year, 328 in 1896, and 270 in 1895. Inclusive of hospital cases, there were 59 deaths from measles, 19 from scarlet fever, 44 from diphtheria, 47 from whooping cough, 9 from enteric fever, and 80 from diarrhœa. There were no deaths from small-pox or typhus. The death-rates per 1,000 of the population were:— Measles, 0.69; scarlet fever, 0.22; diphthera, 0.51; whooping cough, 0.55; enteric fever, 0.11; diarrhœa, 0.94. The total zymotic death-rate was 3.02. From scarlet fever there were 4 deaths in the Parish and 15 in hospitals; from diphtheria, 16 in the Parish and 28 in hospitals; from enteric fever, 4 in the parish and sin hospitals. Twelve death were attributed to influenza, generally in association with other diseases. In the class of septic diseases there were 4 deaths from syphilis, 7 from erysipelas, 2 from septicæmia, 1 from carbuncle, and 3 from senile gangrene. Only 2 deaths were directly attributed to alcohol, but in a large number of the inquest cases the deaths were said to have been accelerated by alcohol. Rheumatism and rheumatic fever caused 10 deaths, gout 1, and rickets 4. The deaths from cancer were 60; of these 49 were in persons upwards of 45 years of age. The deaths from this disease in the previous year were 65; in 1896, 58; in 1895, 50; in 1894, 42; and in 1893, 37. In the tubercular order of diseases there were 274 deaths, against 278 in the previous year; 266 in 1896; and 297 in 1895. They were 15.4 per cent, of the total deaths, and equalled a death-rate of 3.17 per 1,000 of the population. There were 9 deaths from tabes mesenterica, 57 from meningitis rate in Registration London was equal to 1.77 per 1,000. In Bermondsey, inclusive of deaths in hospitals and infirmaries, it was 2.15. " The death-rates from this disease in the Metropolitan sanitary areas ranged from 0.74 in Hampstead, 0.88 in Lewisham, 1.13 in Wandsworth, and 1.16 in Lee, to 3.06 in St. Saviour, Southwark, 3.17 in Holborn, 3.18 in St. George, Southwark, 3.22 in Strand, and 3.34 in St. Giles." In Newington it was 2.43, in St. Olave 2.22, and in Rotherhithe 1.81. It is quite obvious that this rate is lowest in the districts where open spaces are extensive, and highest in those where there is the greatest density of population. In the class of developmental diseases, 135 deaths were recorded, viz., of premature births, 44; of atelectasis, 5; of congenital malformations, 6; and of old age, 80. Of the latter 65 were between the ages of 65 and 85 years, and 14 were above 85 years of age. Diseases of the brain and nervous system caused 160 deaths, or 9.0 per cent. Seventy-nine deaths were attributed to apoplexy and paralysis, 4 to epilepsy, 42 to convulsion, 4 to dementia, 29 to various forms of brain disease, and 2 to disease of the internal ear. From diseases of the heart and circulatory system 131 deaths were registered, or 8.5 per cent, of the total deaths, and equal to a death-rate of 1.5 per 1,000. The number is 9 less than in 1897. The important division of diseases of the respiratory organs accounted for 336 deaths, or 18.9 per cent, of the deaths, and a death-rate of 3.8. In the previous year the deaths were 376, the percentage of deaths 20, and the rate 4.3. There were 10 deaths from croup, 188 from bronchitis, 123 from pneumonia, 3 from pleurisy, 5 from asthma, and 7 from congestion or other lung diseases. Diseases of the digestive organs contributed 80 deaths to the general mortality. This class includes a number of disorders, as dentition, quinsy, gastritis, enteritis, peritonitis, hernia, and liver disease, etc. Prom diseases of the liver there were 14 deaths, and from infantile jaundice 3. From diseases of the kidney and urinary organs there were 45 deaths. Five persons died from diabetes. The various forms of wasting disease in young children caused 87 deaths. From violence there were 85 deaths, of which 67 were the result of accident, 9 of suicide, and 9 were persons found dead or drowned without sufficient evidence as to the cause of death. The accidents included 5 persons run over, 21 deaths from falls, 3 from burns and scalds, 27 from accidental asphyxia of infants, 2 from suffocation by impaction of food in the throat, 2 from poison, and 7 from drowning. The cases of suicide were: By poison, 4; hanging, 2; drowning, 2; cut throat, 1. The number of inquests held in the parish was 102. Of these 47 deaths were due to violence and 55 to natural causes. The uncertified deaths numbered 37, the majority of which were infants. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year 868 certificates were received from medical practitioners that patients under their care were, in their opinion, suffering from one of the several diseases. enumerated in the public Health Act as "dangerous infectious diseases." In the previous year 922 such certificates were received; in 1896, 857; and in 1895, 610. Copies of the certificates were sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and notifications were sent to the various Board Schools which were attended by children residing in a house where an infectious disease was believed to exist. The cases included 460 of scarlet fever, 254 of diphtheria, 94 of erysipelas, 50 of enteric or typhoid fever, 6 of membranous croup, and 4 of puerperal fever. In the first quarter of the year there were 10-3 notices; in the second, 152; in the third, 272; and in the fourth, 341. Certificates which are not strictly and literally expressed in the terms of the Act are returned by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In cases where the medical superintendent of the hospital to which a patient has been removed is of opinion that the patient is not suffering from the disease specified, or from any other notifiable disease, he sends me a certificate to that effect. The medical officer at a hospital has. not only had an experience beyond that which falls to the lot of most medical men, but he has the opportunity of watching the case for several days before forming an opinion, while the medical attendant is often required to. decide at a moment's notice, under circumstances which are unfavourable for a careful examination of the patient, and without the delay which he would consider necessary for further observation if the question of prompt removal did not arise as a matter of urgency. The number of houses in which the existence of a dangerous infections disease was reported was 889, all of which were inspected by the sanitary staff. All the cases which admitted of removal to hospitals were removed as speedily as possible. The premises were disinfected either by the officers of the Vestry or to the satisfaction of the medical attendant. Infected articles of bedding and clothing were purified in the disinfecting chamber provided by the Vestry. The number of such articles which. were submitted to the action of the hot-air chamber was 14,788. The number of persons removed to hospitals was 726. SANITARY WORK. The total number of houses and other premises inspected during the year ending Lady-day, 1899, was 5,209, against 5,222 in the previous year, and 3,606 in 1896-7. The reinspections numbered 11,984. The notices and intimations served for the execution of sanitary work were 2,482. The number of houses in a dirty and dilapidated condition which were caused to be cleansed and repaired was 415; of houses disinfected, 786; and of houses closed as unfit for human habitation, 13. Overcrowding was abated in 57 instances. In the previous year there were 81 cases. The number of dead bodies which were removed from rooms to the Parish Mortuary was 34, and 97 post-mortems were made in the room provided for that purpose. The slaughter-houses inspected numbered 5, the cow-houses 6, and the bake-houses 83. Among the articles seized and destroyed as unfit for the food of man were 78 barrels of salted pigs' livers, which were in a thoroughly decomposed state, and from which it was intended to prepare a cheap extract of meat for the sustenance of the working man and the nourishment of the sick. In this case the maximum penalty of £50 was inflicted, with full costs. The list of condemned articles of food also includes 25 cwt. of German sausages, 760 turkeys, 46 rabbits, 50 barrels of sardines, 123 eggs, fish, crabs, fruit, etc. Thanking the Vestry, the Sanitary Committee, and my colleagues for the support and assistance I have received, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN DIXON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 133 Jamaica Road, Bermondsey.

As will be seen by the following list the Inspectors throughout the year have persevered with their house to house inspections, and I may perhaps be allowed to add, in my opinion this systematic inspection must have a beneficial effect in keeping the district in a sanitary condition, in discovering and remedying nuisances which are found to exist, and must tend to improve the health of the inhabitants, The house to house inspections were as follows:— Rouel Road Kintore Street London Street Martin Street Stephenson's Court Galleywall Road Willow Grove Cadbury Road Woolf Street Aberdour Street Macks Road Anchor Street Loftie Street Rosebery Street Ambrose Street Channel Row Linsey Street Millstream Road Linsey Grove Guinness' Buildings, Vienna Road Page's Walk Napoleon Court Lucey Road Elim Street Hargrave Square Hanover Buildings Willow Street Cloyne Row Alexis Street Eldridge Road Peabody Buildings Fort Buildings (twice) Rock Grove Camilla Road Henry Place Arnold's Place Marshall's Place George Row Beatrice Road Queen's Place Woodland's Place Fort Passage (twice) Alderminster Road Fendall Street Lynton Mews Lynton Road Pansy Place Welsford Street Ferrand Street Drappers Road Wolseley Buildings Oxley Street Yalding Road Kipling Street Turner's Retreat The Grange Ness Street Enid Street Hanover Buildings Rudyard Place Eckett Street Spa Mansions Medley Place Garfield Terrace (twice) Limasol Street Prince's Place Neckinger Street FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS INSPECTED DURING THE YEAR.

Notices have been served for cleansing passages, floors, wash-houses, water-closets, and the remedying of other sanitary defects. The following registered houses have been pulled down:— 15 Bermondsey Square, 20, 21 Druid Street, 9, 11 Stephenson's Court, 14, 16, 17, 18 19 Marigold Court, 24, 25, 26, 30 Minto Street. No. 117 Spa Road has been closed. The total number of houses now on the Register is 292. MEETINGS OF SANITARY COMMITTEE The Sanitary and Public Health Committee held 20 meetings, besides making visits of inspection in different parts of the Parish when occasion required. SMOKE NUISANCES. Reports have been received of upwards of 154 cases where chimneys and shafts have been kept under observation. Four statutory notices have been served for the abatement of smoke nuisance; one summons was taken out, and fine of £2, and 2s. costs, inflicted. BAKEHOUSES. There are 80 Bakehouses in the Parish, 15 of which are at the present time unused. The whole of these have been inspected, and, where necessary, notices have been served for cleansing, etc. COW AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have from time to time been inspected. After certain requirements were complied with at three of the cow-houses no objections were offered to the renewal of any of the licences TEMPORARY SHELTER. I have again to call attention to the necessity of a temporary shelter or house accommodation as required by sec.60, sub-sec. 4, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, where it states the "Sanitary Authority shall provide temporary shelter or house accommodation for persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority." During the year 78 families, consisting of 116 adults and 157 children, were turned out of their homes to enable disinfection to be properly carried out. The absence of such shelter caused a great hardship on the persons thus displaced, and in my opinion tends to spread infectious disease, as out of sympathy they are frequently taken in by their neighbours or have to remain in the public street, often during very inclement weather. Efforts have been made in past years to secure accommodation, but without success, and the only way I see to succeed is for the Vestry to purchase land near the Depot and erect a suitable reception house. BILLS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE PARISH. In July, large bills were posted and small ones delivered throughout the Parish, requesting the public to adopt measures of precaution against the possible occurrence of cholera and other contagious or infectious diseases. OVERCROWDING. Fifty-seven cases of overcrowding were reported, and very carefully investigated by the Committee. In 18 instances it became necessary to institute legal proceedings in order to enforce the orders of the Vestry, and fines and costs amounting to £4 5s. inflicted. MORTUARY. Thirty-four bodies were removed from houses to Parish Mortuary as compared with 47 last year, being a decrease of 13. Seven infectious cases were deposited in room in mortuary set apart for that purpose. EXPOSURE-SCARLET FEVER. One person, was fined 10s. and 2s. costs for exposing her child in the public street whilst suffering from a dangerous infectious disease. OFFENCES-LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL BYE-LAWS. Fourteen summonses were taken out for breaches of London County Council's Bye-laws for removing offensive matter through public streets during prohibited hours, and fines and costs inflicted amounting to £12 2s. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. Notices were served in September, 1898, requiring the houses, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Stephenson's Court to be made fit for human habitation, and in November orders were made by the magistrate at Southwark Police Court for them to be closed. By the closing of these houses 13 families were displaced, consisting of 80 persons, 46 adults and 34 children. DIARRHŒA MIXTURE. During the summer months 259 persons made application and were given doses of diarrhœa mixture. COLLECTION OF HOUSE REFUSE. The dust, etc., continues to be collected twice a week, the inhabitants being supplied with a pail or pails according to the requirements of each case. The dust bins in the model lodging-houses are also cleared twice a week, thus reducing to a minimum the nuisance caused by storage of dust, etc. The last of the public dust bins has been abolished and pails supplied to the tenants. MARGARINE FACTORY. In July last application was made by Messrs. Hudson and Co., of 251 Long Lane, asking to be placed on the Register as a Margarine Factory in accordance with section 9 of the Margarine Act, and the Vestry granted such certificate by resolution dated 19th September, 1898.

The attention of the proprietress was called to the fact and the number of scholars were reduced so as to comply with the Code. LLEWELLYN GROVE. Twelve houses and buildings in this Grove have been closed by the owner in preference to draining and paving the footway and carriageway. For years this property has been in an insanitary condition. TYPHUS FEVER. In February and March of this year eight cases of typhus (which were imported from an adjoining parish) were reported, at 3 and 5 Minto Street, 84 and 166 Weston Street.

The re-vaccination was not successful, and no smallpox has appeared within three weeks. There are three large marks of original vaccination on the child's arm.

At the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, I have inspected the common lodging house, No. 76, Bermondsey Wall, with the object of ascertaining whether the condition of the house is such that it ought to be dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. At my request Mr. Sumner, the Vestry's surveyor, has inspected the premises, and reports that the structural condition of the house is fairly good. In my opinion the state of the premises would not warrant their being closed as unfit for human habitation, but there are certain sanitary defects to which I have directed the attention of the officers of the London County Council, under whose supervision and regulation houses of this kind are placed. 27th June, 1898.

Complaint has been made of offensive smells in the neighbourhood of Laxon Street School. I believe they arose from some sea-damaged rabbit skins on the premises of Mr. Lee, in Crosby Row. These premises were in an offensive condition. I have visited Alaska Factory in regard to the nuisance complained of in Willow Street, but the process from which the offensive odours arise was not in work, and I have arranged to call again when the process is being carried on. July 11th, 1898. During the week that ended on the 2nd day of July 67 births and 26 deaths were registered in the parish.

Fourteen notices of infectious diseases were received. They were of scarlet fever 7, diphtheria 1, erysipelas 4, and typhoid fever 2. I have attended at Alaska Works and witnessed the process complained of. The evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen gas is very decided, but the smell is not perceptible outside the building in which the process is carried on. Some time ago the firm, at my suggestion, not only covered in with corrugated iron the place where this operation is done, but carried a zinc chimney to a height of several feet above the building—which is a lofty one —and placed therein a gas jet to ensure an upward draught. This, however, has not been found a sufficient remedy, for on testing the vapour which escapes from the top of the chimney the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen gas was clearly proved. This gas, although much diluted with atmospheric air, may be found a nuisance at some distance from the premises and be highly objectionable, although probably not so very injurious as many persons would consider it to be. The firm are anxious to adopt all possible means to prevent a nuisance, and an endeavour will be made to decompose the gas before it passes up the chimney. 12th September, 1898.

The Registrar is Mr. Chas. Hy. Hurst, whose office is at 21, Grange Road. I have inspected the houses in Stephenson's Court, and certify that their structural and insanitary conditions render them unfit for human habitation. On the 20th of August I accompanied the Sanitary Inspector to examine several casks which, were said to contain pigs' livers, and which were lying at the rear of the houses Nos. 23, 24 and 25, Salisbury Street; also 44 others at No. 53, Fort Road. The whole of them were in such a state of decomposition as to render them quite unfit for human food. 26th September, 1898. During the week that ended on the 17th day of September 62 births and 25 deaths were registered in the parish, indicating an annual birth rate of 37.6, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.2 per thousand of the estimated population. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 13, of persons aged 60 years and upwards 3, and of parishioners in outlying public institutions 10. In the class of zymotic diseases there were 13 deaths, all being due to diarrhœa. Bronchitis, phthisis and tabes mesenterica each caused one death, heart diseases 3, and erysipelas 1. Two inquests were held, one on a case of suicide and one on a person found dead. The notifications of infectious diseases received numbered 22, viz.: of scarlet fever 11, diphtheria 4, erysipelas 5, and typhoid fever 2. In the week ending- September 24th 06 births and 31 deaths were registered in the parish, corresponding to an annual birth rate of 40.0, and an annual death rate of 18.8 per thousand inhabitants. The deaths of children under one year were 15, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 6. Two deaths occurred at the advanced age of 87 years.

One inquest was held, and 1 death was uncertified. Thirty-five notifications of infectious diseases were received, viz.: of scarlet fever 24, diphtheria 10, and erysipelas 1. 10th October, 1898. During the week that ended on the 1st day of October 50 births and 19 deaths were registered in the parish, indicating an annual birth rate of 30. 7, and an annual rate of mortality of 11.5 per thousand of the estimated population.

Prom diseases of the respiratory organs there was one death from bronchitis and one from pneumonia, There was one death from phthisis, 1 from cancer, and 1 from influenza. Three inquests were held. All these deaths were due to violent causes —2 being attributed to the consequences of fall and one to accidental suffocation in bed. Twenty-seven notifications of infectious diseases were received, viz.: of scarlet fever, 14, of diphtheria 10, of erysipelas 2, and of enteric fever 1. In the week ending October 8th 51 births and 25 deaths were registered in the parish, corresponding to an annual birth rate of 31.3, and an annual death rate of 15.3 per thousand inhabitants. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 11, and of persons aged upwards of 60 years 4. Zymotic diseases caused 4 deaths, viz.: whooping cough 1 and diarrhœa 3. From pulmonary diseases there were 4 deaths—two from bronchitis and 2 from pneumonia. Tubercular diseases caused 4 deaths, viz.: phthisis 2 and meningitis 2. There was 1 death from old age. Three inquests were held. One death resulted from accidental suffocation in bed. One death, that of a child aged 2 days, was certified as due to "natural causes." The notifications of infectious diseases numbered 32, viz.: of scarlet fever 19, diphtheria 12, and typhoid fever 1. In reply to the enquiry respecting the alleged prevalence of diphtheria in Yalding Road and Cadbury Road, I report that during the last 12 months, viz., from October 1st, 1897, to September 30th, 1898, I have received notices of one case of membranous croup at No. 43, Yalding Road, and of one case of diphtheria at No. 19, Cadbury Road. I have again inspected Stephenson's Court respecting which I certified on the 12th September last, "That their structural and insanitary condition rendered them unfit for human habitation." This court is situated on the west side of Bermondsey Street, and is approached through a covered passage, 4 feet wide and 30 feet long, opening out to width of 5 feet between the premises 122 and 123, Bermondsey Street. The total length of the court is 150 feet. The cottages, 13 in number, consist of two rooms, one on the ground floor and one on the first floor. The size of the rooms is 9 feet wide, 9 feet long 1 , and 6 feet 9 inches high. Each house has a small backyard in the rear, 11 feet by 3 feet 8 inches, in which is placed the W.C. and water tap. The height of the cottages is about 18 feet from paving to coping. They are badly constructed, built of inferior materials, and in a dilapidated state. The front walls have deviated very much from the perpendicular, and in one house the party wall has separated from the front and back walls, so that daylight is seen through the corners of the room. The population consisted of 13 families— 80 persons, 40 adults and 34 children. Rather more than half of the present occupiers earn their living outside the boundaries of the parish. The notifications of infectious diseases received respecting inmates of this court during the last twelve months were 2 cases of erysipelas in October and December, 1897, and 3 cases of diphtheria in July and August of the present year. The deaths during the same period were a child from cellulitis on 13th November, 1897, a child from marasmus on July 5th, and a child from whooping cough on July 9th of the present year. I am of opinion that the area is too small and not of sufficient importance for the London County Council to include it in any scheme for a public improvement; that the condition of lighting and ventilation is not so bad as that of other premises which have been represented to the London County Council, and with which that Council did not think proper to deal; and further, that there are no sanitary statistics which would support the contention that it is an unhealthy area. As to the Vestry dealing with the matter under Part IV the Parish would bear the entire expense, unless the London County Council, the Secretary of State, and an Arbitrator were of opinion that the case was one "of general importance to the County of London. In the most favourable view there must necessarily be considerable delay in any action to be taken by the London County Council under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. It appears to me that prompt action is desirable, and that a closing order should be applied for forthwith, the final decision resting with the Magistrate. 31st October, 1898. During the week that ended on the 15th day of October 59 births and 25 deaths were registered in the parish, indicating an annual birth rate of 36.0, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.2 per thousand of the estimated population. The like death rate in London was 18.5. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 6, of persons aged upwards of 60 years 8, and of parishioners in outlying public institutions 12. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 5 deaths, viz.: diphtheria 1 and diarrhœa 4. In the class of pulmonary diseases there was 1 death, from bronchitis. Tubercular diseases caused 4 deaths, viz.: phthisis 3 and tabes mesenterica 1. There were 2 deaths from age, 1 from cancer, and 2 from heart disease An inquest was held in the case of a man 64 years of age, who was suffocated by the impaction of a piece of sausage meat in the larynx. Thirty-five notices of infectious diseases were received, viz.: of scarlet fever 27, diphtheria 5, erysipelas 2, and typhoid fever 1. In the week ending October 22nd 64 births and 35 deaths were registered in the parish, corresponding to an annual birth rate of 38.9, and an annual death rate of 21.3 per thousand inhabitants.

One death was uncertified —referred to meningitis. Twenty-eight notices of infectious diseases were received, viz.: 10 of scarlet fever, 15 of diphtheria, and 3 of typhoid fever. I have inspected Medley's Place and Bell's Court. There were some sanitary defects which, have been remedied. The structure of the houses is still fairly good. 1 have examined all the causes of deaths in these buildings during the last twelve months, and also the register of notifications of infectious diseases during the same period. I have not found any evidence which would indicate that they are an unhealthy area. The Medical Superintendent of Brook Hospital reports that three cases—one which had been certified as scarlet fever, one as enteric fever, and one as diphtheria, were not suffering from those diseases, or any other notifiable disease. I have written to each of the medical men who had sent notifications relating to the cases in question informing them of the above facts. In the week that ended on Saturday last, October 29th, 68 births and 29 deaths were registered in the parish, corresponding to an annual birth rate of 41.3, and an annual death rate of 17.7 per thousand inhabitants. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 13, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 6. The only deaths from zymotic disease were 2 from whooping cough.

Two deaths were uncertified, one was referred to acre, the other to infantile convulsions. Forty-five notifications of infectious diseases were received. They included 21 of scarlet fever, 15 of diphtheria, 6 of erysipelas, 2 of typhoid fever, and 1 of membranous croup. A case which was notified as diphtheria at 209 Lynton Road, on October 3rd, and admitted to the South Eastern. Hospital on October 4th, is reported by the Medical Super- intendant of that hospital "as not suffering from diphtheria or any other notifiable disease." 14th November, 1898. During the week that ended on the 5th day of November, 52 births and 23 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth rate of 31.8, and an annual rate of mortality of 14.0 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death rate in London was 16.1. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 7, of persons aged 60 years and upwards 2, and of parishioners in outlying public institutions 18.

They were of scarlet fever 6, diphtheria 17, erysipelas 2, and typhoid fever 1. In reply to the question as to the number of cases of infectious disease in Wolseley Buildings during the fortnight ending October 29th, I find there were two cases of scarlet fever, 1 at No. 48 and lat No. 21. The dates were October 22nd and 25th. Both cases were removed to hospital on the same days the notifications were received, and the houses were disinfected on the same or the following day. 28th November, 1898. During the week that ended on the 19th day of November 72 births and 22 deaths were registered in the parish, indicating an annual birth rate of 43.7, and an annual rate of mortality of 13.3 per thousand of the estimated poulation.

During a period of four weeks the death rate in London has averaged 2.8 per thousand below the mean rate in the corresponding period of the last ten years. A considerable increase may be now expected from the greater fatality of diseases of the respiratory system. December 12th, 1898. During the week that ended on the 3rd day of December 62 births and 25 deaths were registered in the parish, indicating an annual birth rate of 38.2, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.2 per thousand of the estimated population.

Twenty-three notifications of infectious diseases were received, viz.: of scarlet fever 10, diphtheria 10, erysipelas 2, and enteric fever 1. The letter from the Clinical Research Association, which was referred to me, is to the effect that it would be more economical for the district boards to join that Association than to undertake to pay a yearly subsidy for the support of a Municipal Bacteriological Laboratory under the control of the London County Council. I have no doubt this Association has done valuable work and that its staff consists of eminent scientific men. The question, however, is the advisability of establishing a public institution under municipal control, and on this point the Committee have already expressed an opinion.
