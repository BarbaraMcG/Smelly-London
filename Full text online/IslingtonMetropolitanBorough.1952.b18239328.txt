1 Mrs bogne DW 5B ACU361 2 Mis Knowhs this its 2 library 1952 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITIONS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON • VICTOR FREEMAN, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health E. S. Ellis & Sons, Willow Street, Chingford, E.4 1 Public Health Department, Town Hall, N.l. To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. In presenting my Twelfth Annual Report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington for the year ended 31st December, 1952, it is gratifying to record continued improvement in many important matters of public health. Uniform progress over the whole field of public health cannot be expected, but in some matters dramatic and striking improvements have occurred within the space of a very few years. It should be borne in mind that these changes have probably been brought about as a result of continuous work and effort, frequently during disappointing years before improvements began to be manifest. The personal health services were initiated, developed, and built up into efficient organisations by the Sanitary Authorities, mainly between the two World Wars, before they were eventually transferred on 5th July, 1948, to the County Council as Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. It is exceedingly gratifying that the Borough Council's organisation of Welfare Centres, Medical Officers, Health Visitors, Immunisation Clinics, etc. which had already by 1948 contributed so much to the health of the people of Islington, especially the mothers and children, has continued under the Local Health Authority to carry out these fundamental measures of prevention and health education which have contributed to produce some of the extraordinarily good results for 1952 which are recorded in this Report. To take one example, it has been noted with pleasure that the infant mortality rate for 1952 was only 22 per thousand infants born alive ; the best survival rate for infants to be recorded in the public health history of this Borough by quite a substantial margin. This rate is only about a third of what was regarded as a relatively satisfactory rate in the years immediately prior to World War II—and we have by no means arrived at the lowest possible rate, whatever that might be. When this low infant mortality rate is taken in conjunction with the congested housing conditions, where so high a proportion of all families share water-supply, kitchen, and water closet accommodation, as shown in the Registrar-General's Census Return quoted in this Report, it is indeed a testimony to the improvement in the standard of mothercraft. The Report for 1952 also records another highly satisfactory feature, to which many years of work by the Public Health Department have contributed. For the first time on record there has not been a single confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough during the year. Whether this remains so will depend to a considerable extent on the continued response of parents to the immunisation facilities offered by the Local Health Authority. Tuberculosis, unfortunately, still remains a major problem. The number of new case of tuberculosis of the lungs reported during the year was actually greater than 2 in the previous year, but it must be remembered that the Mass X-Ray Unit of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board was in operation throughout the year, and was taken advantage of by many thousands of Islington residents and many case of tuberculosis were thereby brought to light much earlier than would otherwise have been the case. This enabled treatment to be commenced earlier, with greatly improved hopes for the patients—and the patients themselves, through their knowledge of the illness, took precautions much earlier than might have been done otherwise to safeguard other members of their families and others with whom they might be in close contact. Thus it is hoped that a temporary increase now in the number of known cases will be the means of hastening a true reduction in the number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in future years. I have also referred in the Report to the fact that cancer of the lungs is now responsible for more deaths than tuberculosis, which is the reverse of the position only a very few years ago. The fact that we do not yet know how lung cancer arises is not necessarily an indication that nothing can be done until the cause is discovered. Cholera was satisfactorily dealt with in London before the cholera organism was discovered by taking action which appeared to be logical as a result of the follow-up of cholera outbreaks through epidemiological enquiries. Cholera was attacked on the assumption that it was caused by polluted water-supplies. Pollution of the air we breathe seems to be a very important pre-disposing factor, if not the ultimate cause of cancer of the lung, whether such pollution is done personally by heavy tobacco smoking, or communally through the smoke we allow to be discharged from chimneys, domestic and industrial, burning bituminous coal. Pollution of the air in this way is a man-made factor which can be tackled with the necessary will to do so. In addition to the long-term effects of air pollution, Islington, in common with other parts of London, suffered from the dense fog which commenced in the first week of December. The Report records a sudden and tremendous jump in the number of deaths due to bronchitis and pneumonia in the period immediately following the fog, more especially among elderly persons. What cannot be included in this Report is the vast amount of temporary but unrecorded invalidism due to respiratory illness brought on by the fog which affected children and adults at all ages. There is no reason to think that the conditions which produced this deadly fog could not recur in any future winter, and the public must recognise that the problem of air pollution is one which should be tackled with some urgency. I have referred in previous Annual Reports to the high proportion of multistorey out-of-date houses in which the majority of Islington people must continue to live for many years to come. It is pleasing to record, as noted in the body of the Report that the Council's Slum Clearance Programme, necessarily suspended on the outbreak of war, has now been resumed. During the year, the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed, after Public Enquiry, a Compulsory Purchase Order in respect of part of Whadcoat Street. Slum clearance in Islington has been the subject of discussion with the London County Council, and there is no doubt that the programme will develop. 3 In the meantime, sanitary complaints in regard to old housing continue to be received in the Department in great numbers, and the great majority are dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The difficulties of a number of owners, particularly small owners, are exemplified by the number of cases, as cited in the Report, in which there was failure to comply with Abatement Orders made in the Courts. The supervision of food and food premises continued to be given as much attention as was possible. The Bye-laws for the Protection of Food came into operation towards the end of the year, and should materially assist with raising the standards of food premises and food preparation. Another item of food legislation the Public Health (Meat) (Amendment) Regulations, 1952, which also came into operation during the year, made it necessary for slaughterers of horses to give prior notice of slaughter for human consumption to the Local Authority. In view of this trade being carried on in the Borough, it is a matter of some local interest. The appointment of a Deputy Medical Officer of Health in the previous year permitted some extension during this year in the health publicity and educational programme. The maintenance of good health and hygiene standards can only be effected in conjunction with an informed and knowledgeable public. Frequent film shows formed the basis of much of the Department's health publicity and it is gratifying to be able to record that all these shows were very well attended. It is believed that there is increasing interest on the part of the public in all aspects of health and hygiene education. The Census revealed something of the problem or potential problem of elderly persons in this Borough. It is estimated that about eleven per cent. of the total population is over the age of 65, of whom a high proportion live alone. The Borough Council itself has limited powers to deal with many of the problems which arise in connection with elderly persons, but it will be noted from the Report that nevertheless over four hundred old people's cases were brought to the notice of the Department for investigation because of a variety of difficult and unsatisfactory circumstances. In twenty of these cases it was found necessary to take Statutory action. The individual circumstances of these twenty cases are recorded in the Report and it is thought, may constitute an interesting social commentary. Apart from the limited assistance which the Council itself may be able to give, the Department's Officers are able in a high proportion of the cases brought to their notice, to act as a liaison for the various agencies—medical, social, welfare, voluntary, and local authority— which can be called in to assist with one or other of the many problems which may beset elderly people, and to which so many of them appear to have some difficulty in finding a satisfactory personal solution. The Council during the year increased its grants to voluntary organisations, with benefits to those who found 'Meals-on-Wheels' of use, and to the greater number of old persons who could be given a holiday for a week or a fortnight in the country or at the seaside, which would otherwise have been impossible. 4 The Public Health Department is a team to which all contribute in the public health work for which the Borough is responsible and my thanks are due to all members of the team for their work done during the year. In particular, I have pleasure in mentioning Dr. A.M. Ison, Deputy Medical Officer of Health, Mr. W.C. Bartlett, Chief Sanitary Inspector, and Mr. E.J. Sharp, Chief Clerk. The resignation of Mr. B.J. Ashcroft, Deputy, Chief Sanitary Inspector, at the end of the year, will be a loss to the Department, but he carried the Department's good wishes on his promotion to the position of Senior Sanitary Inspector, Borough of Leyton. I also have pleasure in again expressing my thanks to the Chairman, Councillor Mrs. F.H. Cantwell, and to the Public Health Committee ; and to the Chairman, Councillor D. McArthur Jackson and the Housing Committee for their courtesy and consideration in the many matters which had to be reported to the respective Committees. V.

For the first time since 1947, there has been no fall in the birth-rate as compared with the previous year. The 1952 rate at 16.56 per thousand population was fractionally higher than the 1951 rate at 16.45. Whether this is only a local temporary halt in the downward tendency, or whether the birth-rate is becoming stabilised around this rate only the future will show, but it is unlikely that it is the beginning of a reversal with an increase in the rate to follow. The proportion of births classified as illegitimate remains fairly constant at 7.8 per cent. of all the 1952 births. Principal Causes of Death. The death-rate of 12.22 per thousand population shows a return to the average of the death-rates in the post-war years. Infants under One Tear. The infant mortality rate of 22 per thousand live births shows a substantial decrease over the corresponding rates for the three previous years. It is the lowest infant mortality rate in the history of the Borough, and in the light of the many adverse housing and other environmental circumstances in Islington, can only be considered as a remarkable achievement. In the main this very favourable survival rate for infants must be regarded as an indication of the very rapidly improving standard of mother care and knowledge, assisted, of course, by the continuing activities of the Local Health Authority medical staff and health visitors at the Welfare Centres, by the General Medical Practitioners, and by the more general educational services, including broadcasting. A good survival rate also means that the survivors are healthier children. Even with this low infant death-rate there is no reason to think that the best has yet been achieved, and mothers should confidently look forward to even more greatly reduced risks for their infants ; such results have already been achieved in some other districts and there is no reason to think they could not also be achieved here. Of the total of 88 infant deaths, 31 occurred within 24 hours of birth, and 60 within the first seven days. In infants over the age of four weeks the main causes for the decrease were fewer deaths due to bronchitis and pneumonia, which is associated with a good standard of maternal care and resort in good time for medical attention ; and also in the group of deaths due to congenital malformations, birth injuries, etc., which were 18 less than the previous year, and where the reduction is probably associated with efficient ante-natal care and attention. There were only four deaths of infants between the ages of six and twelve months. Contrary to the tendency over the last three or four years, the infant mortality rate for illegitimate infants increased to 46, which is a little over double the rate for all infants. Deaths from Other Causes. Respiratory Tuberculosis. Deaths from this cause, at 71, were 2 more than in the previous year. Of this total of 71, 31 were in men aged 45 to 65 ; this indicates the economic hardship caused to families by the loss of the principal breadwinner at an age when he would probably otherwise be receiving maximum income. Malignant Growths of Lung and Bronchus. Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus at 127 as in the previous year, continue to be very substantially greater than pulmonary tuberculosis deaths. 107 of the total were in males, as against 20 in females—thus giving a male/female ratio of over five to one. Nearly 50% of the male deaths, or 52, were in men aged 45 to 65 which is, of course, the same age-group as that principally affected by tuberculosis of the lungs. 11 There is good evidence that the principal cause for the increase in lung cancer is due to long-continued and heavy cigarette smoking; a contributory factor may also be atmospheric pollution. Both these factors are preventable—the decision in the former case being in the hands of the individual concerned, while action in the latter case rests with the community. If the individual chooses to take the risk because of the personal satisfaction given to him by smoking, he should, at any rate, not be blind to the possible consequences, which may only ensue after many years. Diseases of the Respiratory System. There were fewer deaths in 1952 from influenza (7 as against 50), but deaths from pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases remained much about the same. Accidents This cause accounted for 48 deaths, of which 24 were in persons over the age of 65. There were 22 deaths from this cause between the ages 25—65, of which 19 were in men. Examination of these deaths show that the male deaths were mainly due to causes associated with occupational risks whereas in the elderly age-groups over the age of 65 most of the accidents occurred at home, frequently due to fractures through falls in the home, with men and women more or less equally affected.

No cases of smallpox were recorded, but visits were paid to five smallpox contacts who lived permanently or temporarily in the Borough and who had been in contact, in one instance, with a case which had occurred in an area outside the Borough. Information was also received from the Medical Officer of Health of another London Borough that a family of three persons who landed at London Airport had come from an infected area in West Africa and were now living at an address in this Borough. On investigation they were found to be in good health, but precautionary action was taken in notifying Medical Officers of districts subsequently visited by members of this family. In another case, the Army Authorities notified this Department that a contact of a smallpox case was on leave in this Borough. It was ascertained that this man had called at an Islington address and proceeded to Eire, information to this effect was transmitted to the appropriate authority. In four other cases visits were paid by the Medical Officer of Health or Deputy Medical Officer of Health to suspect cases on a request by the general practitioner. These cases were not confirmed, but such measures constitute part of the precautions which have to be taken when the slightest suspicion of smallpox has arisen. Useful help can now also be given by the Virus Research Department of the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, which has undertaken the examination of pathological specimens in suitable cases.

The Vaccination Acts were rescinded under the National Health Service Act, 946, as from 5th July, 1948. 13 Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation—Authentication—Ministry of Health Circular 60/48. During the year the Medical Officer of Health dealt with 175 requests for authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation against smallpox, cholera, typhoid, etc. Measles and Whooping Cough. Measles and Whooping Cough became generally notifiable in London at the end of 1939. Prior to this there was only a limited notification. Measles. The number of measles notifications, at 2,885, was the second highest recorded in the history of the Borough, being exceeded only by the 3,199 which were notified in 1951. There were two peak periods in 1952, the first with a sharp increase in the measles cases beginning about mid'May and reaching a peak in the latter part of July and early August, then dropping to fairly low levels by September. The next rise began in October and continued at very high levels throughout December and well into 1953. It will be noted from the Table below that the number of children of school age who contracted measles was almost equal to the number of children aged 1—5 years ; whereas in 1951 there were approximately 2,000 children in the younger age-group, and only approximately 1,000 in the school-age group.

Whooping Cough. Whooping cough in 1952 was considerably less prevalent with 564 cases less than in the previous year. The distribution of whooping notifications according to their ages was as follows : Under 1 year 1—5 years 5 years and upwards No. of Notifications in 1952 79 273 152 Percentage of total notifications 15.7 54.2 30.1 No. of Deaths 1 1 — Fatality Rates (per thousand) 12.66 3.66 — 14 The following chart shows the measles and whooping cough position since 1943 :— Fatality Rates per 1,000 notifications each age group Percentage of notifications (1943—1952) (1943—1952) Under 1 1—5 5 & upwards Under 1 1—5 5 & upwards Measles 8.02 0.64 — 5.3 58.3 36.4 Whooping Cough 43.91 3.08 — 13.4 60.4 26.2 Over the ten-year period 60.4 per cent. of all cases of whooping cough and 58.3 per cent. of all cases of measles were in children one to five years of age.

It will be noted in the Table above that there were only 5 cases in the whole of London, and for the first time on record in the history of the Borough there was not a single confirmed case of diphtheria during the year, and of course, no death. In fact, the number of cases for the whole of England and Wales in 1952 was less than occurred in Islington alone in the years immediately prior to the war. The first diphtheria immunisation Clinics under the control of the Borough Council were begun in 1936. The number of children who attended at first was not large, but within a few years many thousands of parents were persuaded of the necessity for safeguarding their children against diphtheria, and the safety of the procedure, and brought their children to the immunisation Clinics. A great stimulus was given to immunisation in the Borough by the National Campaign against diphtheria which the Ministry of Health sponsored in the early days of the war. As the proportion of immunised children has grown, so has the incidence of diphtheria fallen until the present happy position in 1952 has been reached. It can now be said correctly, that diphtheria is a rare disease; it will only remain so if the great majority of children continue to be immunised. It is too soon as yet to permit relaxation in the immunisation campaign. 17 The following table, shown in the 1951 report is repeated to emphasise the relative risks of diphtheria in children immunised and not immunised. Diphtheria Cases and Immunisation state 1947-1952 (inclusive) Immunised Non-Immunised Unknown Total Deaths Age Groups 0—5 5—15 15 + Age Groups 0—5 5—15 15 + 1952 - - - - - - - - 1951 1 2 — 8 5 1 - 17 7 years—Not immunised 1950 — 5 — 3 7 4 — 19 7 years—Not immunised 1949 1 3 - 2 8 3 — 17 4 years Not immunised 1948 1 2 1 1 — 2 — 7 Nil 1947 — 5 1 2 4 5 2 19 16 years—Not immunised Totals 3 17 2 16 24 15 2 79 5 deaths (None immunised) 22 55 In comparing diphtheria in immunised and non-immunised children over the six-year period 1947-52, it is probable that over the period, slightly more than half the children under five were in an immunised state and at least three quarters of the school children. The 24 non-immunised school children who contracted diphtheria, therefore, belong to a group numbering not more than one third of the immunised school children. It therefore seems that over this period, a non-immunised child was about five times more liable to contract diphtheria than an immunised child. Further, of the 79 Islington children who have had diphtheria over the past six years, five have died, and none of these five was immunised. This is in agreement with all previous extensive experience of immunisation in Islington. It has not been possible, in spite of careful records having been kept (although these cannot be quite complete) to trace the death from diphtheria of any child immunised in the Borough who has satisfactorily completed an immunisation course since 1936. With regard to the immunised children who contracted diphtheria, examination of the records shows that in nearly all cases immunisation had been completed three, four or five years previously, and a booster injection at about school entry age might have diminished the subsequent risk still further.

Dr. B. E. Sharpe, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, has kindly supplied the following figures in respect of Islington children for the current year. 18 Under 5 yrs. 5—15 yrs. Estimated proportion of Children Immunised at 31.12.52 55.4% 96.8% Total Attendance at all Clinics 11,517 Sessions Held 365 Average Attendance 31.5 Number of Children who received Full Course of Immunising Injections :— Under 5 years 2,826 5—15 years 118 Number of children who were Primary Schick Tested with negative result and therefore did not require immunisation — Number of children re-tested with a negative result 490 Number of children Post Schick Tested with a negative result 1,889 Boosting Injections 1,261 Influenza and Pneumonia It will have been noted from the Table on page 11 at the beginning of this Section, that the notification of acute primary and influenzal pneumonia during the year, at 246, were approximately double those of the previous year. This was very largely contributed to by the great increase which occurred at the beginning of December. In common with the rest of London, there was heavy fog from the 5th to 8th December inclusive, and there can be little doubt that the presence of this fog is very closely connected with the great increase both in the number of deaths due to respiratory infections, as shown in the Table below, and also in the number of notifications received. Respiratory Diseases Deaths and Notifications November: December: 15 22 29 6 13 20 27 Deaths— Bronchitis 1 1 2 9 60 27 11 Pneumonia 1 2 3 5 16 11 9 Other forms 15 11 Notifications of : Acute Primary Pneumonia and Acute Influenzal Pneumonia 7 13 2 11 21 11 13 Deaths and Notifications in age groups for Week ending 13th December, 1952 Total 0— 1— 2— 5— 15— 25— 35— 45— 55— 65— 75 + Deaths— Bronchitis 60 1 — — — — 1 — 4 13 21 20 Pneumonia 16 — — — — — — — 1 3 111 Other forms 5 — — — — — — — 1 1 1 2 Notifications of : Acute Primary Pneumonia and Acute Influenzal Pneumonia 21 — 1 2 1 — 1 — — 5 4 7 It will be noted from the Tables that the majority of those affected during the week ended 13th December were elderly persons, but whilst elderly persons may succumb more easily, there can be no doubt that a very considerable amount of illness 19 of the same nature, but most of it not notified, was caused to younger people. The harmful mixture of fog and smoke, now commonly and conveniently called smog, is largely of our own making. At least 50 per cent. of smoke in a borough such as Islington is due, during the winter, to smoke from household fires. Apart from the industrial aspect, the only method of dealing with the domestic side is to increase, as a matter of urgency, the burning of smokeless fuels, and the substitution of alternative and cleaner means of space heating. Against the increased costs of such changes, must be off-set the great economic losses causes by illness due to smoke, as well as dislocation of transport, etc. Food Poisoning Number of notifications received 1947 7 1948 10 1949 55 1950 104 1951 148 1952 58 It will be seen from the above that there was a very considerable reduction in the food poisoning cases notified in 1952. There were no outbreaks during the year to be reported to the Ministry of Health in accordance with Circular 2/50. The campaign for safer food is dealt with in the Health Publicity section of this Report. Dysentery Whereas I had to report in 1951 that 995 notifications of dysentery had been received during the year, the highest number to be recorded, this position, fortunately, did not continue. The dysentery cases notified in 1952 numbered 216. The routine arrangements previously reported for the follow-up of dysentery cases and their contacts continued to be followed. All notified cases were visited by a Sanitary Inspector or Infectious Disease visitor, and arrangements made, unless otherwise desired by the General Practitioner attending, for examination of stool specimens at the Archway Group Laboratory, except in those cases where the patient was attending hospital. Of the 216 notified, 187 were found to be suffering from dysentery due to B. Sonne ; which in general does not give rise to severe illness. As mentioned in the 1951 Report, Day Nurseries continued to offer a special risk of dysentery and particular attention is given to this aspect by the London County Council medical and nursery staff. Homeless families in a Part III Welfare Authority Home also constituted something of an additional dysentery risk requiring constant observation by all concerned . Scabies and Vermin The number of cases of scabies treated continues to decrease. Benzyl benzoate continues to be the treatment of choice for scabies and proprietory 2 per cent. D.D.T. emulsion for the treatment of verminous heads. Both of these preparations have given extremely satisfactory results for their respective purposes. 20 Complicated cases of scabies and special cases referred by the General Practitioners continue to be seen at the Scabies Clinic, Seven Sisters Road. In view of the relatively small number of cases now referred, it was decided that it was no longer necessary to continue the services of Dr. Marre as Consultant Dermatologist at the Clinic, but arrangements were made for cases referred for medical opinion to be seen bv the Council's Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Treatment for scabies and vermin was carried out at the Public Health Department, Seven Sisters Road (Cleansing Station), as under:— Scabies Vermin Children under 5 years Number treated 20 49 Number of baths given 69 — Number of treatments — 53 L.C.C.

It has always been known that there must be some people who, knowingly or unknowingly, are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, possibly in an early stage, and who have not sought medical advice, and are therefore undiagnosed. Such persons, not taking any personal precautions, can be a dangerous source of infection to others who may be closely associated with them, especially within the family. It is therefore highly probable that the additional new cases reported during 1952 are part of this reservoir of unknown cases. The fact that they came to light and do not represent a genuine increase is an excellent advance from the public health point of view, since these patients now that they are known can receive early treatment and supervision and can be advised as to how best to safeguard both themselves and others with whom they must live. At the same time, the warning against complacency still holds good. The number of deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis showed no decrease in 1952, and although some of the new cases have undoubtedly come to light because of the increased attention drawn to this condition through the presence of the Mass X'Ray Unit in the Borough, it is impossible to say that there has not been a true increase in the number of new cases, as compared with previous years. It was noted in the Annual Report last year that in spite of some decrease in the notification rate for new cases in the previous two years, nevertheless the number of cases of tuberculosis on the Register has continued to increase. It is thought that this is due to the more hopeful outlook for the individual tuberculous patient, and the increased expectation of life of each case. This process has continued, and the total number of cases on the Tuberculosis Register at the end of 1952 was 2,575 as against 2,404 in 1951, and 2,368 in 1950. Of the total of 208 new cases of tuberculosis of the lungs in women, 130 were between the ages of 15 and 35; probably the most difficult and disheartening agegroup in which this illness can be contracted. Of the 310 new cases of lung tuberculosis in men, 43 were aged 15 to 25, and 69 aged 25 to 35; again extremely serious from the point of view of career, family responsibility and earning capacity. Tuberculosis and Housing. It is accepted by most authorities that bad housing conditions have an adverse effect upon pulmonary tuberculosis. Certainly this would seem to be so in the case of Islington. Islington is one of the most congested boroughs, confirmed by the extracts given in Section C of this Report from the Registrar General's 1% Sampling Analysis of the 1951 Census. The pulmonary tuberculosis death rate and notification rate is also higher in Islington than the London averages. Many families with a tuberculosis patient live in overcrowded conditions which do not permit of a separate bedroom for the patient; or if a separate bedroom is provided, this causes excessive congestion for other members of the family. Sufficient housing accommodation is, therefore, even more important for such families than for families in normal health, and considerable priority for re-housing is given both by the Islington Borough Council and the London County Council as Housing Authorities where there is a case of active pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1952 both these Authorities rehoused 130 such families, but unfortunately, even with the priorities given, the waiting list is such that many households with tuberculosis will have to continue to live in unsatisfactory conditions for a considerable time to come before alternative accommodation can be offered, and from the point of view of the community, as well as other members of the family involved, this must be considered extremely undesirable. 22 New Cases and Mortality during 1952 Ages New Cases Deaths Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory espiratory M.

The Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1952, came into operation on 1st May, revoking the former Regulations of 1930. These Regulations place tuberculosis in the same position as other notifiable infectious diseases, and the Medical Officer of Health is no longer required to keep a Register of tuberculosis notifications. He is, however, requested to keep a record, and this is being done so far as this Department is concerned, so that, in effect, the Register is being maintained as far as possible. Unfortunately, however, it is not likely to be as complete and up-to-date as the former Register, since interchange of information between different Authorities, including hospitals, is not now required, and not all desirable changes in regard to patients can be noted. The total number of cases of tuberculosis on the Register of the Department, as at 31st December, 1952 was :— Pulmonary Males 1,224 Females 1,043 Non-Pulmonary Males 139 Females 169 2,575 Tuberculosis Dispensaries. The Tuberculosis Dispensaries of the Regional Hospital Board continue to function at the Royal Northern and Royal Chest Hospitals, with Dr. J. Wallace Craig as Chest Physician-in-charge. 23 Cases on Dispensary Registers Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Total Grand Total Adults Children Adults Children Adults Children Number of definite cases of tuberculosis on Dispensary Registers N.

Although the responsibility for care work has passed under the National Health Service Act, 1946, to the London County Council as the local health authority, the Islington Tuberculosis Care Committee remains in being, working in conjunction with the Islington Chest Clinics at the Royal Northern and Royal Chest Hospitals, and members of the Borough Council and the Medical Officer of Health serve on the Islington Tuberculosis Care Committee and the Divisional Care Committee for the Co-ordination of care work in the three Boroughs of Islington, Finsbury and Holborn. Loans of bedding or medical appliances were made to 34 patients; others have been referred to various organisations for assistance. I am indebted to Dr. B. E. A. Sharpe, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, for the 1952 figures in connection with vaccination, diphtheria and whooping cough inoculations, and tuberculosis dispensaries.

The 1951 Census Returns (Registrar General's 1% Sample Tables) provide valuable confirmation of this situation. The following extracts from the Returns give similar information for the Metropolitan Boroughs of Islington, Lambeth and Lewisham, the latter two Boroughs being included for purposes of comparison since the respective populations in all three cases are fairly close. 24 It will be noted from Tables given below that the Social Class distribution in Islington shows a preponderance of the economically lower groups, a much higher proportion of households in dwelling shared with others, much greater density of persons per room, and much greater proportions of households without their own exclusive use of W.C., bath, stove, and sink.

Owners, finding property uneconomic, were in many cases not prepared to incur expense in order to comply with the requirements of notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and Abatement Orders were obtained in a large number of cases. Many of these were not complied with and the owners were proceeded against and fines and costs imposed. The owners, of course, would have been well advised to have spent the money paid into the Court on the property in the first place, and thus in many cases have obviated the necessity for the institution of legal proceedings. In certain urgent cases the Council carried out work in default in order that the occupants should not suffer undue hardship. A number of houses in the Borough were found to be occupied as hostels, many of which were overcrowded and lacked the essential sanitary amenities. The tendency to use property for this purpose is increasing, and consequently there is an urgent need for Byelaws to be made governing this type of residence. In the case mentioned in my 1951 Annual Report where legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of a basement bakehouse being used contrary to Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937, the Magistrate agreed to adjourn the matter sine die, as the work necessary to transfer the bakery from the basement to the ground floor had already commenced. It was completed during the year and no further action was necessary. In the second case where a notice had been served under Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937, specifying that the existing Certificate of Suitability would cease on a certain date, the Magistrate, upon hearing further evidence, allowed the appeal. The Company concerned, however, were successfully prosecuted in respect of five offences under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. A scheme for the employment of Student Sanitary Inspectors was re-introduced by the Council, as a result of which two students commenced training in the Department during the year. The legislation passed during the year which affects the work of the Public Health Department includes the following: London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1952. Section 26 extended the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and provided that "no rag and bone dealer or a person who deals in old clothes or similar articles shall sell or deliver, whether gratuitously or not, any article of food or drink to any person or any article whatsoever to a person under the age of 15 years." In certain cases warning letters have been sent to persons concerned, and the practice stopped. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, was passed during the year under review, but the appointed day for its coming into operation had not been fixed up to the end of 1952. The Act empowers the Secretary of State to make Regulations requiring gas fires, electrical fires and oil heaters of specified descriptions to be fitted with fireguards, with a view to reducing or preventing the risk of fire or injury from accidental contact with flames or heating elements from the appliances. The Council delegated its powers and duties under this Act to the Public Health Committee. The Poisons List Order and Rules were consolidated and revised. 26 The Public Health (Meat) (Amendment) Regulations, 1952, by virtue of which horses, asses, mules, etc. are now included for the purpose of Part II of the main Regulations, came into force, thus bringing the slaughter of these animals into line with the slaughter of other animals for human consumption. Notice of the slaughter of horses intended for human consumption must now be given to the Local Authority with a view to their being inspected. The London County Council Byelaws for the Protection of Food made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, received the approval of the Ministry of Food, and came into force on 3rd November. Unlike the previous Byelaws which have now been repealed, no exemption from Byelaw requirements is given to the Metropolitan Cattle Market. Following negotiations with the City Corporation, who own the Market, and representation to the Ministry of Food, it was considered that there were no grounds to perpetuate the exemption. The Council, however, has agreed with the City Corporation the method by which the Byelaws should be enforced at the market. Summary of Work done by District Sanitary Inspectors.

Consequent upon Notices served by the Sanitary Inspectors under Sections 40 and 109 respectively, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the Council, in pursuance of their powers under this Act to carry out urgent sanitary and drainage work in default, executed work amounting to a total of £1,451. Issue of Licences. In May of this year, the issue of licences became the responsibility of the Borough Engineer consequent upon the retirement of the Council's Licensing Officer. I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following information in respect of the total number of licences issued during the year, together with details of the number of licences issued in respect of Statutory Notices served by this Department. The value of the licences issued is also submitted. The total percentage of licences issued in respect of Nuisance Notices was 19% of the total allocation. No. of Licences issued Value of Licences issued No. of Statutory Notices issued Value of Licences issued against Statutory Notices 1952 1574 £680,146 17 5 284 1130,134 14 10 On the 1st July, the free limit was raised to £200, thus enabling owners of property to spend more on houses, and this fact should assist property owners in complying with notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936.

A total of 1,371 rooms were treated for vermin, of which number 489 were disinfested free of charge. The majority of free cases were on behalf of elderly or infirm persons. The Council make a charge of 7s. 6d. for the first room and 5s. 0d. for every additional room treated for verminous conditions. The furniture and bedding of families moving to new Council dwellings were treated in situ with a preparation of D.D.T. before removal and again when families took up residence in the new accommodation. The effects of 308 families were so treated as a precautionary measure. In addition, 34 cases were treated, upon request, for infestation by wasps, ants, cockroaches, flies, etc. 3 Bombed sites, 3 static water tanks and 1 air-raid shelter were also treated for flies. In order to meet the requirements of the South African Authorities, the Council agreed to arrangements being made for the treatment with formalin of second-hand stockings for export. A suitable room at the factory concerned was allocated for this purpose, and the Sanitary Inspector supervised the treatment at all stages. Static Water Tanks. Complaints continued to be received by the Department in respect of accumulations of water in and the tipping of debris and organic matter into static water tanks. By arrangement with the Cleansing Superintendent, organic and other debris such as bedding, mattresses, etc. is removed upon request from this Department. The London Fire Brigade also co-operated by pumping the stagnant water from static water tanks, upon request. Ashburton Grove Depot—Blowfly Infestation. The treatment of the sidings at Ashburton Grove Refuse Disposal Depot with D.D.T. continued throughout the summer months, with good results. The blowfly nuisance at this Depot is now well under control, and the number of flies migrating from this area is kept to a very low level. In conjunction with representatives of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Cleansing Superintendent, visits were paid to the Council's Refuse tips in Hertfordshire by the Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, in order to investigate the infestation by flies at these tips. During the year, the Council gave approval for certain experimental work on blowflies to be carried out by the staff of the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory, Slough, at Ashburton Grove Depot and other places in Islington. The object of this particular experimental work was to trace the rate of spread of blowflies—released from a particular point. Blowflies specially bred at the Laboratory were fed on very small amounts of radio-active food material so that after release, any blowflies caught in the traps provided could be examined for radioactivity. Traps were set both in Islington and in neighbouring Boroughs at points which it was considered might attract the blowflies, and it is understood that the Operators conducting experimental anti-blowfly treatment at Ashburton Grove Depot. (Crown Copyright). 37 traps were successful in collecting a coniderable number of the marked flies released. The flies caught were taken back to the Laboratory, and sorted under a geiger counter. Results showed that such flies spread over the district at the rate of at least one mile per day, and infested all types of premises at which traps were placed. In view of the local interest, Mr. A. A. Green of the Pest Infestation Laboratory of the D.S.I.R. gave a talk, illustrated by slides to members of the Council in November of this year. The experiments carried out during last and this year have proved most satisfactory, and the findings of the Pest Infestation Laboratory will no doubt result in benefit not only to this Council but to other Local Authorities throughout the country who are faced with a similar problem. Thanks are due to the Cleansing Superintendent, to the Representatives of the D.S.I.R. and to Dr. B. Hobbs of the Central Health Laboratory, Colindale, for their co-operation and for the assistance given in order that the treatment and experiment may be carried out satisfactorily. Steam Disinfection. 32,390 articles of clothing or bedding were subjected to steam disinfection at the Disinfecting Station(17,348 for clothing contractors.) In addition 4 tons 2 cwts. of material was disinfected for clothing contractors. Public Health (London) Act, 1936—Emission of Smoke. The public is becoming increasingly interested in and concerned with pollution of the atmosphere. It should be appreciated that Local Authorities have no powers to take any action to deal with the emission of smoke from domestic fires, which it is estimated is responsible for at least 50% of the total smoke emission in a Borough such as Islington during the winter months. The possible effects of smoke, and smoke combined with fog on health have been the subject of comment on page 11 (Malignant Growths of Lung and Bronchus), and page 18 (Influenza and Pneumonia). The Council appointed two representatives to serve on the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Advisory Council for this year. Factory owners and their staffs continued to co-operate as much as possible, and in one case the whole boiler plant and stack was overhauled and on the recommendation of the Fuel Research Station, special doors were fitted to the Lancashire Boiler, which were designed to eliminate the emission of smoke. As a result the nuisance, which was a major one, has been mitigated. Complaints of smoke nuisance caused by the discharge of excessive smoke from the chimney of a Government store in the Borough were received during the year. These were confirmed and the attention of the appropriate Minister was drawn to this nuisance, as provided for under Section 154 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. As a result, the necessary steps were taken and no further nuisance was reported. Thanks are due to the Ministry of Fuel and Power for the assistance of its representatives who have readily given to factory proprietors and their staff the benefit of their experience and advice. 38 In order to assist the staff engaged on boilers, the attention of factory owners in the Borough was drawn to evening classes in Boilerhouse Practice, held in various technical colleges throughout London. These courses were designed to improve the proficiency of the staff concerned, and included courses for firemen, boiler attendants and other interested persons. The syllabus for the several courses included instruction, laboratory work, boiler tests and visits to typical power plants. These courses prepare the student for the examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute, and the Smoke Inspector's Certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute respectively. Number of complaints received during year 36 Number of observations made 150 Number of inspections and revisits 187 Number of notices served 4 Number of notices complied with 3 Requisitioned Property. Requisitioned property continued to be inspected and the attention of the Council's Housing Manager was drawn to any nuisances or major difficulties which were found to exist, in order to ensure that the premises were kept free from statutory nuisance. The number of requisitioned properties on the 1st January, 1952, was 1,362, and the number derequisitioned was 87 during the year.

Number of premises registered under Section 2 for upholstery 30 Number of licences under Section 7 for the storage of rag flock 1 Diseases of Animals Acts. The occurrence of two outbreaks of foot and mouth disease brought this Borough within the infected area. The authority for the administration of the Diseases of Animals Acts being the London County Council, this Department was not affected. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The Pet Animals Act, 1951, came into force on 1st April this year, and provides, inter alia, that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted by the local authority in accordance with the provisions of this Act. The licence, for which a fee not exceeding 10s. 0d. is paid, is issued subject to compliance with certain specified conditions. Such conditions vary in respect of individual premises. The Council, in determining whether a licence should be granted, must have regard to the need for securing: (a) that animals will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable with respect to size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness; (b) that animals will be adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and (so far as is necessary) visited at suitable intervals; (c) that animals being mammals will not be sold at too early an age; (d) that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious disease; (e) that appropriate steps will be taken in case of fire or other emergency. 45 It is an offence under the Act for any person to carry on a business of selling animals as pets in any part of a street or public place except at a stall or barrow in a market, and no person shall sell any animal as a pet to a person who he has reasonable cause to believe to be under the age of 12 years. The term "animal" is defined in this Act as including any description of vertebrate. As a vertebrate is an animal having a backbone, the term includes fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds and mammals. It is provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed to keep a pet shop by reason only of his keeping or selling pedigree animals bred by him, or the offspring of an animal kept by him as a pet. The number of licences issued during the year was 19. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Details of the work performed by the Rodent Control Section are given as follows:— Number of complaints received 1,495 Number of investigations carried out 1,704 Number of infestations found 1,050 (Comprising 142 business premises, 6 local authority premises, 902 dwellings) Number of premises baited 1,014 Number of smoke tests carried out to drains 123 Treatments carried out:— Dwellings 902 with 6,314 baits being laid Local Authority premises 6 with 36 baits being laid Business premises 106 with 954 baits being laid Post-bait treatment in respect of dwellings, business premises and local authority premises 2,659 with 16,144 baits being laid 3,673 23,448 Number of agreements sent out 120 Number of agreements returned 106 Percentage of ships rats: 1.143 per cent. of the infestations found. Where business firms employ their own staff or servicing companies in order to rid the premises of rats, the premises are kept under observation, in order to ensure satisfactory treatment, by the Rodent Control Staff of this Department. Bombed sites and derelict buildings continued to be a source of trouble, particularly when drains have been disconnected but unsealed. Redevelopment of the sites is the only answer and gratifying results have been been obtained where the sites have been laid out by the Council under the War Damage Sites Act, 1949. Due to a disused connection to the sewer and to a disused drainage system not being effectively sealed off, rats gained access to one of the Council's blocks of flats. Upon investigation, the drains were discovered and sealed, since when no further trouble has been experienced. 46 Many other cases could be cited to indicate the very difficult problems which arise from time to time and which call for time and patience before the source is traced and the premises completely disinfested. There were 12 ship rat infestations which were dealt with. Four workable area Committees were held during the year at which representatives from this Department attended. Sewer Treatments. Two routine sewer treatments were carried out during the year as well as a series of special sewer treatments in connection with the investigation into Leptospirosis which was carried out in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The co-operation of the Borough Engineer and his staff was appreciated. Details of the treatment are as follows:— Treatment No. Dates Manholes baited Pre-bait Percentage of poison takes Estimated kill Complete take Takes No takes Bodies seen CT. PT.

(1) Water supplies to tenement houses. 85 Notices were served, pursuant to this Section, requiring the provision of water supplies to tenement houses. During the year 105 water supplies were provided. In one case, the Council carried out the necessary work to provide a water supply to a tenement house, the cost being recovered from the owner. 7 Prosecutions were taken for failure to comply with statutory notices, details of which are as follows:— 47 Date Address Magistrate's Decision 10.1.52 58 Lough Road Ordered to abate within 28 days.

(2) 22 Applications were received for water certificates and 22 certificates were issued in respect of 434 separate dwellings. There are 28 bore-holes or wells known to exist in the Borough, 19 of which are abandoned and effectively sealed. Of the remaining 9, 3 were out of commission during the year. Samples of the water were taken from the 6 at present in use, and from the results obtained, no exception could be taken to the use of the water for domestic or washing purposes. None of the water is used for dietetic purposes. It is therefore considered that the position relative to underground water supplies in the Borough is satisfactory. Details of the samples taken are given as follows:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological 6 6 6 6 - - Swimming Bath Water. The number of samples of swimming bath water taken during the year is as follows:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological Chemical Bacteriological 2 4 2 4 - - In addition to the above, 2 samples of sub-soil water were taken. Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951. Regent's Canal. Two samples of the Regent's Canal water were taken, one where the canal enters the Borough, and the other before its entry into Shoreditch. The Public Analyst reported that no deleterious or poisonous matter was detected in either sample, and in his opinion the water was dealing satisfactorily with such effluents as may be discharged into it. 48 SECTION D HOUSING The Public Health (London) Act, 1936, was the principal Act operated to ensure the maintenance of property in a state free from nuisance. As mentioned in previous Reports, houses in Islington are mainly between 80 and 100 years old, and have been affected considerably by war-time conditions. Recourse had to be made to prosecutions in many instances, and owners, finding the properties uneconomic, had to be summonsed—in many cases repeatedly—for non-compliance of Abatement Orders obtained from the Court. In certain cases, where owners were able to show that compliance with Notices in respect of underground rooms would have been uneconomic. Closing Order procedure under the Housing Act, 1936, was adopted, the families in occupation being re-housed. Difficulty continued to arise in respect of houses which were structurally sound but uneconomic to repair and put into a fit state for human habitation due to the high cost of labour and materials. Such properties cannot be dealt with under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, and therefore can only be dealt with by demolition procedure. Action under Sections 11 and 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, was taken, resulting in the closing of part or the demolition of whole houses as the case may be, in a number of instances, and in certain cases undertakings were accepted from the owner not to re-let until the Council were satisfied that the property had been made fit for human habitation. The housing situation being so acute in the Borough, and having regard to the fact that over a thousand cases of overcrowding were brought forward on 1st January this year, it is impossible to anticipate any improvement in the situation in the foreseeable future. It is difficult, if not impossible, to enforce by recourse to the Courts the statutory housing standard as provided for in Part IV of the Housing Act, 1936. Arrangements existed with the Government of Cyprus whereby the Borough Council is notified of the address at which an immigrant from Cyprus intends to stay upon arrival. On receipt of this information, an inspection is carried out to ascertain whether or not the proposed accommodation is sufficient, in accordance with the requirements of the Housing Act, and the Commissioner is notified accordingly. In spite of these arrangements, there is nothing to prevent Cypriots moving about, having once entered the Country via the accommodation address, and cases of overcrowding arising as a result of such movements have had to be investigated. Pursuant to Part III of the Housing Act, 1936, the area known as the Metropolitan Borough of Islington (Whadcoat Street—Part I) Compulsory Purchase Order was represented to the Council and later, after public enquiry, was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. This area, which is approximately 1.5 acres in extent, includes the portion of Whadcoat Street lying between Biggerstaff Street and Lennox Road, and comprises the following properties:— Nos. 54 and 54a Whadcoat Street. Nos. 56/60 (even) inclusive, Whadcoat Street. Nos. 68/104 (even) inclusive, Whadcoat Street. Nos. 79/110 (odd) inclusive, Whadcoat Street. Nos. 61/67 (odd) inclusive, Whadcoat Street. Views of Whadcoat Street. 49 In addition, there were a number of vacant sites, the houses which originally stood upon them having been demolished previous to representation. The area contained 31 occupied houses and 7 in a vacant and derelict condition. Most of the occupied dwellings contained more than one family, holding separate tenancies, and overcrowding existed in respect of 17 lettings. All the houses were of a terrace type, were aged and worn out, and with few exceptions, in a deplorable state of repair. Approximately 271 persons will be displaced and the London County Council have agreed to provide 50% of the re-housing accommodation required. It is proposed to redevelop this site for housing purposes. Re-housing. The number of new applications (L.C.C.) referred to this Department during year 1,356 The number of above families living in overcrowded conditions 278 The number of above families not living in overcrowded conditions 132 The number of overcrowded families re-housed by the L.C.C. during year 132 The number of overcrowded families rehoused by the Islington Borough Council during year 421 (In addition, a number of families have been re-housed from sites acquired for redevelopment in connection with the Council's Housing Schemes. Further families have been re-housed from properties in respect of which Closing or Demolition Orders have been made). The total number of letters sent concerning housing conditions during year 2,460 The number of dwellings erected by this Council during year 272 The number of dwellings in the course of erection at end of year by this Council 444 During the year the following action was taken under the Housing Act, 1936:— Section Number of Dwellings represented 9 — 11 (unfit houses) 11 12 (parts of buildings) 2 12 (underground rooms) 25 Total 38 50 Resulting from these and previous representations and like proceedings during the year the following action was taken:— Section Action Number of Dwellings 11 Demolition orders 3 11 Undertakings accepted 2 12 Closing orders made 22 (42 underground rooms) 12 Undertakings accepted 8 (This figure includes 14 basement rooms) 12 Closing order made 2 (Part of dwelling) (13 rooms) Total 37 Sec. 11 Sec. 12 Undertakings cancelled upon completion of the necessary work 2 — Licences authorising temporary overcrowding. Five licences were granted under Section 61 of the Housing Act, 1936, authorising overcrowding; 2 for a period of six months and 3 for a period of one year. In 3 cases these constituted renewals of licences which had expired, and the total number of dwellings affected was therefore 2. One application for a renewal of licence was not granted.

SECTION E SUPERVISION OF FOOD The inspection of food and food premises continued to receive the constant attention of the Inspectors. Typical complaints received included an alleged screw in a loaf, maggoty toffee, glass in milk and jam respectively, foreign matter in stewed steak, fly pupae in flour, wire in sausage, razor blade in cake and dirty interiors of bottles of milk. Reference to the list of prosecutions taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, and the Labelling of Food Order, 1950, will enable the legal action taken by the Department to be readily observed. In November of this year, the London County Council By laws for the Protection of Food came into operation. These were made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, with the object of securing the observance of sanitary 51 and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food sold or intended for sale for human consumption, and in connection with the sale or exposure for sale in the open air of food intended for human consumption. The By-laws, which replace previous ones, cover many of the aspects of food handling at different stages from its manufacture or preparation to the delivery of the finished product. Consequent upon an administrative arrangement being agreed between the City Corporation and this Council, the exemption of the application of the By-laws to the Metropolitan Cattle Market which existed under previous By-law was discontinued. By virtue of the Public Health (Meat) (Amendment) Regulations, 1952, which came into operation on 31st August, the definition of "animal" in the principal Regulations (Part II—governing slaughterhouses and slaughtering) was amended to include horses. It is, therefore, now necessary for slaughterers of horses to give prior notice of slaughter for human consumption to the Local Authority in order that the carcasses may be examined. Publicity in regard to food hygiene formed an important part of the educational work of the Department during the year. Difficulty continues to be experienced where new shops are erected and occupied for the manufacture, storage or sale of food for human consumption. In many cases the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and the relevant By-laws, have not received the necessary attention by the Architect who in fact may have been unaware of the use to which the shops would be put. Upon completion and occupation, it is found necessary for structural alterations to be carried out in order to comply with the statutory requirements. Such work could have been obviated had the Public Health Department been consulted earlier, and neither the occupier or the owner is particularly keen to carry out additional work after considerable expense has been incurred both in respect of the erection and the adapting of the interiors of the shops concerned.

Most of the above food was condemned upon request by the respective owners. 54 Sampling. 723 samples (294 formal, 429 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of these 13 (or 1.79 per cent.) were adulterated as shown in the following summary:— Formal Informal Roast Chicken (canned) 1 Alcoholic Wines 2 Figs (dried) 1 Ground Nutmeg 1 Milk Bottle (contained mineral NIL matter—lime and silicate) 1 Bread 2 Split Peas 1 Coconut in syrup (canned) 1 Meat (consisted of horseflesh) 1 Meat (canned) 1 Chocolate Toffee 1 13 Meat and Other Foods. The Metropolitan Cattle Market is under the control of the Ministry of Food, and no visits were necessary during the year for the purpose of inspecting imported or other meat. In accordance with the requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924/1952, 61 notices were received in the period from 31st August until the end of the year in respect of the intended slaughter of horses for human consumption. Details of action taken are as follows:— Number of horses slaughtered 79 Number of carcasses inspected 79 Weight of horse-flesh condemned 25 lbs. Description of horse-flesh condemned 1 liver 1 lungs None of the above carcasses was exported. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933. Slaughtermen's Licences. During the year 4 new licences were issued, making a total of 24 in force. Inspection of refreshment and coffee stalls. The Inspectors carried out 9 evening inspections of refreshment and coffee stalls and general conditions were found to be satisfactory. Free Washing Facilities in Public Conveniences. The Council continued to provide free washing facilities in public conveniences in order to encourage cleanliness amongst food handlers and, particularly, street traders who have no convenient personal facilities. 55 The following table given through the courtesy of the Cleansing Superintendent provides details of the weekly average number of persons who availed themselves of the Council's facilities, and it is encouraging to note that in the main, the number of persons taking advantage of these facilities has increased from last year.

Supervision of the Manufacture and Distribution of Ice-Cream. During the year the H.T.S.T. (High Temperature Short Time) method was approved by the Minister of Health. This provides for the heat treatment of icecream mix at a temperature of not less than 175°F. for at least 15 seconds. In accordance with the principal regulations, the mixture must be reduced to a temperature of not more than 45°F. within l½ hours and be kept at that temperature until the freezing process is begun. By virtue of the Food Standards (Ice-Cream) (Amendment) Order, 1952, the permissible minimum fat content of ice-cream, with certain exceptions, was reduced to 4% fat and 5% milk solids other than fat. During the year 259 visits were paid to ice-cream premises. Number of premises registered: (a) for the manufacture/sale/storage 90 (h) for sale and storage 164 (c) for sale only 246 (d) for storage only 6 506 56 Bacteriological examinations. 39 samples of ice-cream were sent for bacteriological examination. The gradings of those submitted to the methylene blue test were reported to be as follows : Grade 1 21 Grade II 9 Grade III 4 Grade IV 0 34 The samples graded in I and II of the methylene blue test are considered satisfactory, and samples graded III or IV unsatisfactory. One of the remaining five samples not submitted to the methylene blue test was found to be unsatisfactory. 10 ice lollies were examined bacteriologically and all were reported to be satisfactory. 25 milky lollies were submitted for bacteriological examination, 4 of which were found to contain faecal coli. At the beginning of the summer some reports were received from the Health Departments of some Local Authorities in the Home Counties of undesirable bacteriological contamination found in the sampling of ice lollies manufactured by a firm in this Borough but sold by vendors in the respective districts from which the complaints originated. Owing to technical difficulties, there are no bacteriological standards for icecream and ice-cream products. Ice lollies, consisting mainly of water-ice and flavouring, are fairly safe bacteriologically, since the acid in the product discourages bacterial growth. If, however, a small proportion of ice-cream is added to the lolly, then the same risks may arise as in the case of ice-cream. After much investigation and sampling in full co-operation with the firm concerned, the source of contamination was found to be the ice-cream mix, which was obtained from a firm in another area. In view of the growing popularity of ice lollies, it is important that the requirements of the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations should be fully complied with, and the Department's Sampling Officers pay particular attention to all these products. Chemical examinations. 18 samples of ice-cream were submitted for chemical analysis, none of which was reported to be unsatisfactory. 8 of the samples were also examined for fat content, details of which are as follows : Fat Content Less Than— 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% 12% 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 ice lolly samples were also submitted for chemical analysis and no objection could be taken to the results obtained. 57 MILK Milk Samples.

Leaflets, Etc. Leaflets on various health topics have been distributed from various offices in the Town Hall and from the Public Libraries. In addition, the Official Journal of the Central Council for Health Education, "Better Health" has been supplied each month for public distribution, without charge. Posters. Posters have again been displayed from various Council establishments with particular concentration on the following :— Dogs in Food Shops. As a result of a recommendation from the Ministry of Food in Circular M.F.20/51, acoloured crown folio pictorial poster was produced and distributed for display at food establishments in the Borough. Mass Radiography. Publicity was given to the static unit in the Borough and a section of the Department was used as a booking centre for appointments. CLEAN DOGS ARE DIRTY DOGS PLEASE KEEP DOGS OUTOF FOOD SHOPS metropolitan borough of islington CLEAN DOGS ARE DIRTY DOGS PLEASE KEEP DOGS OUTOF FOOD SHOPS metropolitan borough of islington Four-colour Poster (original size 20" x 15"). 59 Flies. An opportunity arose for the linking up of propaganda designed to encourage the destruction of flies with the title of a film show in May at a local cinema. The film was "Wings of Danger" and, although having no connection with the pests, the title obviously lent itself very readily to this type of publicity. In connection with this particularly activity, the Mayor attended the cinema in question on the occasion of the first showing of the film, and addressed the audience. Venereal Diseases. The Ministry of Health requested the assistance of local authorities in a publicity campaign to combat venereal disease. In this connection copies of posters were distributed for display in the Council's public conveniences and those of all Licensed premises in the Borough. Film Shows. During the year health films were shown from various premises. Public Libraries. Nine shows were given in the Libraries and the policy of including a feature film in each programme was continued. Once again the shows have been attended on almost every occasion by capacity audiences, and the Public Health Committee agreed, for the season which began in October, 1952, to double the number of shows. On each occasion the programme was introduced by a member of the Public Health Committee and the audience was addressed by the Medical Officer of Health or his Deputy. Town Hall. During the autumn and winter months, the Council's Director of Entertainments has organised fortnightly film shows of general interest. The opportunity was taken to include a health film on eight such occasions during the year. Welfare Centres. On four occasions film shows on nutrition were given at Welfare Centres in the Borough. These were accompanied by talks given by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Films Exhibited: — "The Nose Has It" "Surprise Attack" "Mass Radiography" "Defeat Tuberculosis" "Fly About the House" "Your Children's Play" "Another Case of Poisoning" "Unwanted Guests" "A New Beginning" "Your Children's Meals" "Your Children's Eyes" "Your Children's Teeth" "The Fight Against Disease" "Behind the Menu" "Vitamin D" "Family Circles" "Defence Against Invasion" "Human Body" "Mary's Birthday" "They Do Come Back" "Streptomycine" "Tuberculosis" "Your Children Walking" 60 Exhibits. In September the Islington Chamber of Commerce organised a Festival of Trade, and with the Co-operation of Store Managers four exhibits were shown by the Department in shop windows in the Borough, for one week. The subjects covered were :— Clean and dirty lcitchens. Rat and mouse infestation. Cafe and canteen hygiene. Clean food. Lectures and Talks. A request was received from a store in the Borough for trainees to be allowed to attend the Department to receive instruction in subjects relating to environmental and food hygiene. The trainees were addressed by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and time allotted for questions and answers. Towards the end of the year, the Divisional Medical Officer asked for the co-operation of this Department in giving talks to school children with particular reference to hygiene of milk. The Committee agreed to co-operate and to allow its officers to attend schools for this purpose. It is hoped that the programme will be commenced early in 1953. CARE OF ELDERLY PERSONS According to the 1951 Census, the number of old people in this Borough, that is over the age of 65, comprised 9,000 men and 16,500 women, which is 25,500 out of the total population of 235,600, or about 11%. It is estimated for the Country as a whole, 12½% of old people live alone, and if this figure is applied to Islington, it would mean that approximately 3,200 old persons live by themselves. It is quite possible that in a Borough such as Islington the proportion may be even greater. Old persons are brought to the notice of the Public Health Department usually because of a combination of unsatisfactory sanitary circumstances, together with difficulty in obtaining reasonable care and attention required, whether this is of a medical or general nature. Information is passed to the Department from a great variety of sources, including the police. It is almost invariably necessary to make a visit before any opinion can be passed as to what action and assistance, if any, can be rendered through the Department. During the year 427 old people's cases were reported to the Department and visited but in only a relatively small proportion of such cases was it necessary to consider the possibility of compulsory action under the National Assistance Acts. From the particulars given, however, of the twenty cases which had to be dealt with through legal action, it is obvious that there are some old people who live alone and almost forgotten in the most unsatisfactory circumstances, but whose sturdy independence makes them loth to seek or accept help from others. 61 National Assistance Acts, 1948 and 1951—Section 47. Authority for proceedings under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, was obtained during the year from the Public Health Committee in 32 cases. "The following provisions of this section shall have effect for the purposes of securing the necessary care and attention for persons who— (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. the court may, if satisfied on oral evidence of the allegations in the certificate, and that it is expedient so to do, order the removal of the person to whom the application relates, by such officer of the appropriate authority as may be specified in the order, to a suitable hospital or other place in, or within convenient distance of, the area of the appropriate authority, and his detention and maintenance therein: Provided that the court shall not order the removal of a person to any premises, unless either the person managing the premises has been heard in the proceedings or seven clear days' notice has been given to him of the intended application and of the time and place at which it is proposed to be made." The result of action taken may be summarised as follows:— Court proceedings instituted 17 Removal to hospital or welfare home on a voluntary basis 7 Conditions improved to such an extent as to render court action unnecessary 8 32 In addition, one further case was taken to Court with Committee approval obtained the previous year, and in two instances it was found expedient to invoke the procedure for the removal of persons to suitable premises without delay (and without giving interested parties seven days' notice) in accordance with the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. "An order under subsection (3) of section forty-seven of the Rational Assistance Act, 1948, for the removal of any such person as is mentioned in subsection (1) of that section may be made without the notice required by subsection (7) of that section if it is certified by the medical officer of health and another registered medical practitioner that in their opinion it is necessary in the interests of that person to remove him without delay." From the foregoing it will be observed that statutory powers were instituted in 20 instances, and I give details of these in the following statement which has been compiled in the form required by the Ministry of Health:— 62 Aged and Infirm—Action taken under Statutory Powers Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mrs. Q. (73 years) Mrs. Q's. clothing was a mass of rags; she lived by herself in one room which was verminous, with walls and ceiling covered with cobwebs. The contents of the room consisted mainly of rubbish and bundles of rags. A gas stove was used mainly for heating, and the tap was sometimes left on without a light. This patient was neglected and unattended, and was in need of urgent treatment for a fractured wrist. Refused removal.'It was undestood she has a daughter, whose whereabouts were not known. Voluntary admission to suitable premises refused. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Content to remain in Home as voluntary patient. Miss P. (84 years) Miss P. was infirm and suffering from arterio sclerosis, malnutrition and and general senility. The contents of the room occupied were filthy and insanitary and too bad for outside help. A smell pervaded the house. Miss P. refused voluntary admission to a Welfare Home and at the tame Court proceedings were taken, the other tenants of the house were in a distressed condition. No relatives known. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Content to remain in Home as voluntary patient. Mrs. K. (82 years) The bad home conditions of Mrs. K., were a source of concern both to relatives and to the other tenants in the house. Mrs. K. was partially blind, infirm and suffered from arterio sclerosis, general debility and malnutrition, and had a habit of wandering round the house with naked lights and sitting in front of the fire with her clothes almost in the flames. She was unable to cook for herself, or purchase food, and was unable to cleanse her person or rooms. Her personal habits were most unhygienic. Voluntary removal refused. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Deceased within a month of removal. 63 Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mrs. W. (81 years) Mrs. W. lived in a 3-roomed flat with the accumulated filth of years. There was no evidence of food or cooking facilities and like many other acute cases of this nature, the home conditions were too bad for a Home Help to operate. This aged person suffered from malnutrition, anaemia and general senility and had a complete lack of physical strength. Refused to go away on her own volition. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Further period of detention not exceeding three months obtained from Court as old lady very poor in health but quite definite she wanted to return home. Died during this period. Mrs. O. (83 years) This case arose out of a reference from the patient's doctor, and a petition from the other tenants of the house. Mrs. O. was found to be suffering from senility, arterio sclerosis and cardiac disease, and her room was indescribably filthy. The stench from it pervaded the house. On one occasion the Fire Brigade was called to deal with a fire in her room. Voluntary removal refused. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Subsequent action was Oaken for a further period of detention not exceeding three months. Patient subsequently content. Deceased nine months after first admission. Mr. B. (78 years) This aged person lived in a top floor room and the mother of young children in the house was convinced that her children's illnesses were due to the bad conditions in which Mr. B. was living. He was suffering from atheroma of arteries and malnutrition, was partially blind, was unable to prepare meals or cleanse his room, and incapable of maintaining personal hygiene. Urine soaked through the floor and stained the ceiling of the room below. His son supported Court proceedings as he would not go away on his own volition. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Warden of Home reported that patient was happy and con2 tent and wished to remain in Home. Mr. W. (67 years) Mr. W., who suffered from mental senility and arterial degeneration, had a mania for collecting cigarette ends, spent matches and tin boxes. He was quite unable to care for himself and went to bed fully clothed. A Son was unable to exercise any influence and agreed to Court proceedings as his father refused to leave home. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient subsequently settled down. 64 Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mrs. B. (89 years) After the death of her husband in 1947, Mrs. B. lived in the hope of going to Canada to spend her remaining years with her daughter. This did not, however, materialise. Her mind was very agiile but a gradual deterioration in health took place and with bad legs Mrs. B. was dependent upon a Home Help and the good offices of neighbours. Mental deterioration occurred and the Home Help, who had assisted for two years, found the task of caring for Mrs. B. beyond her resources. There was a constant fire risk and Court proceedings were subsequently instituted as this aged person refused to enter a Home on her own volition. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient subsequently settled down. Mrs. B. (76 years) Home Help was refused by Mrs. B., who had practically no bedding and little clothing. She was unable to cook food, was unwashed for months and in a verminous condition. The room occupied was filthy, dirty rags were fixed over the windows, and the room was filled with rags, papers and filthy objects. The odour from the room pervaded the house. This aged person suffered from osteo-arthritis and severe malnutrition, and refused to leave her home. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient subsequently settled down. Mr. C. (86 years) Mr. C. refused all assistance and wished to remain by himself in a dark, dirty basement with the accumulated filth of years. There was no evidence of food, he was clothed in verminous rags, and the bed clothes consisted of ragged, verminous material. For 8 months before the Sanitary Inspector called, a married daughter did what was necessary, but was unable to continue owing to subsequent ill-health. The patient who refused to leave home, suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, arteriosclerosis, and was mentally senile. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient subsequently settled down. 65 Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mrs. B. (72 years) Mrs. B. had been cleansed by District Nurses, but they found they could no longer cope with the situation. Room cleansing was beyond scope of Home Help. The room occupied was in a most insanitary condition with decaying scraps of food and excreta about the place. Dirty floors and bed rags im2 pregnated with urine were further examples of bad home conditions. This aged person whose cloth2 ing consisted of rags, suffered from arterio-sclerosis, mental senility and malnutrition, and refused to go away in her own interests despite pleadings from her also aged hus2 band. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home There was no likelihood of this patient getting better. Wished to remain at Home as voluntary patient. Miss W. (85 years) Miss W. was a most determined character and was a source of concern to her relatives, who agreed to the Council seeking a Magistrate's Order in her own interests. The home conditions were revolting, with a mass of rubbish, excreta in room, and the bedding a mass of verminous rags. The patient, who would not avail herself of a Home Help's assistance, or leave home, suffered from severe malnutrition, mental senility and arterial degeneration. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home No likelihood of getting better—wished to remain at Home as voluntary patient. Miss L. (84 years) This case was brought to our notice through Miss L. collapsing in the street and being admitted to hospital for a short time due to neglect and under-nourishment. The home was in a very dirty state, with no cleansing of floor and furniture for months. The bedding consisted of rags. There was a bucket of stale excreta in evidence and the odour of the rdom was appalling. Miss L. was unco-operative, refusing Home Help, and was not willing to go away voluntarily, although incapable of caring for herself. Besides a severe degree of malnutrition, this aged person suffered from hypertension. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Content to remain in Home as voluntary patient. 66 Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Miss B. (85 years) Conditions here were so acute that it was necessary, in co-operation with the patient's doctor, to invoke the procedure under the Amendment Act of 1951. Some attention had been given by the landlady of the house, who left on a specified date to take her aiiling husband away for a rest, leaving Miss B. in a helpless, and infirm state. Not more than three weeks L.C.C. Welfare Home Upon removal, Miss B. regretted the trouble she had caused to all concerned, and was content to remain in this Home as a voluntary inmate. Mrs. K. (82 years) Miss K.'s home conditions were kept under review for over a year before statutory action was taken. The room occupied was almost filled by a double bed and a gradual deterioration had occurred when the facts were submitted to the Magistrate. A sour stench pervaded the room and passage, the floor was covered with grease, the room was littered with unwashed crockery, dirty bottles and dirty rags, and was far too bad for a Home Help to operate. There was a danger to the health of two young children living on the floor above. Miss K. suffered from arteriosclerosis, partial blindness and senility and would not leave home on her own free will. Not more than three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient transferred to hospital and died a fortnight after initial removal to Home. Mrs. L. (65 years) Mrs. L. also refused Home Help and lived in indescribably filthy conditions in two ground floor rooms which were in a verminous, mice-ridden and insanitary state with decaying food and excreta about the place. There was a putrid odour evident. This aged person, who was unable to care for herself, suffered from osteo-arthnitis and bouts of memory lapses, and refused to divulge her children's addresses, or was incapable of giving this information. She also refused to go away for her own benefit. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient settled down. 67 Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommodation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mrs. H. (85 years) Mrs. H. at one time had been a good needlewoman, but when complaints as to her condition were received from the owners of the premises, she was found to be dressed in dirty clothes with her hair and body caked with dart. Mrs. H. suffered from arteriosclerosis and urinary incontinence, was living without proper food, in a small self-contained flat, one room of which was completely filled 'with an accumulation of old rags. An odour from the flat was apparent from the landing. Voluntary admission to a welfare home was refused. One relative was known, a sister, also of course aged, whose whereabouts could not be found until after Mrs. H. entered a Welfare Home. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Patient settled down. Mrs. R. (84 years) At the urgent request of the patient's Doctor, action was taken under the Amendment Act of 1951, and following successful treatment, discharge took place six days after the day of admission. On the latter date, this aged person was suffereing from a septic throat and was living in very squalid and unhygienic conditions in a basement room with little sunlight, in company with one dog and two cats. A niece agreed statutory action was for the best but wanted animals safeguarded during aunt's temporary absence. This was done. Not exceeding three weeks Local General Hospital Patient rehabilitated at home. Visited by Health Officer from time to time, when conditions vary. Satisfactory on last visit. Mr. D. (89 years) Two sons were unable to assist in the future wellbeing of their aged father, whose home conditions were unsatisfactory with an acute danger from fire, and accumulations of dirt. The bedding was impregnated with urine and Mr. D. was unwashed for months. He suffered from arterio-sclerosis and incontinence and refused to go away. Not exceeding three months L.C.C. Welfare Home Deceased one month after admission. 68 Name and Age Reasons for Council's Action Period Named in Court Order Type of accommbdation to which removed Ultimate Result (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Mrs. K. (74 years) This aged person had a habit of collecting all kinds of articles, and when she went away two cartloads of rubbish were removed from her two rooms, including 27 frying pans congealed with grease. Mrs. K. had a bad heart and was physically incapable of looking after herself. She was not properly nourished and was clothed in rags. Voluntary admission to a Welfare Home was refused. There were no known relatives. Not exceeding six weeks L.C.C. Welfare Home After undergoing hospital treatment as a voluntary patient, Mrs. K. was successfully rehabilitated in her own home after assistance from the Cleansing Dept. in the removal of rubbish and the provision of a bed by the N.A.B. This rehabilitation was co-ordinated by the Council's Health Officer for old people. Some degree of the work entailed may be estimated from the following figures:— Sanitary Inspectors— 286 cases investigated. 397 repeat visits made. Old Peoples Health Officer— (Period 13th October—31st December, 1952) New cases visited 141 Revisits 249 Cases compulsorily removed under Magistrate's Order 6 References to other Authorities and Voluntary Associations, re Home Help, National Assistance, Meals on Wheels, etc 163 The Health Officer maintains close touch with the London County Council Divisional staff, especially in respect of Home-help assistance, with the National Assistance Board, with the Duly Authorised Officer of the London County Council, with the Welfare Officer at Hillside, as may be appropriate. She also attends meeting of voluntary committees connected with the welfare of old persons, old persons clubs, etc., and is steadily building up a valuable register of old persons dealt with through the department. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 31. Under this Section of the Act, which permits local authorities to make contributions to the funds of any voluntary organisation whose activities include the provision of recreation or meals for old people, the Council in 1950 approved a grant to the Women's Voluntary Services to enable the W.V.S. to set up a 69 "Meals-on-Wheels" service. Hot mid-day meals were to be supplied on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, after enquiry, for old people, and particularly those having difficulty in leaving their own homes to get a meal or make purchases of provisions. Information regarding possible recipients was obtained from many sources, including Medical practitioners, District Nursing and Family Welfare Association workers, National Assistance and Local Health Department Officers, and Voluntary Organisations. During the year the number of meals supplied, etc., are given in the following table:— Total number of names brought to the notice of the Department 405 Number recommended to W.V.S 133 Number of meals delivered during the year 4,902 Weekly average 94 The Council gave considerable assistance to old people's Clubs for the provision of meals on the Clubs' premises, and also contributed to old people's voluntary organisations, including Clubs, to assist with holidays for old people and crockery, furniture, games, etc. for the Clubs. PUBLIC MORTUARY By agreement with the St. Pancras Borough Council the use of the Council's Mortuary was discontinued as and from 31st March, 1949, all bodies being received at the St. Pancras Mortuary, Camley Street, N.W.I, after that date. ISLINGTON CREMATORIUM The Medical Referee or the Deputy Medical Referee certified a total of 290 applications for cremation at the Council's Crematorium, East Finchley. 70 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES The Maternity and Child Welfare services are, of course, the responsibility of the London County Council as the Local Health Authority. Islington is included in Division 3 of the L.C.C. Services and I am indebted to Dr. B. E. A.
