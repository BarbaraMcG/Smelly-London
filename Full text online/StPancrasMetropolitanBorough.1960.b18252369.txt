September, 1961. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to you the Annual Report upon the conditions of health in the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras for the year 1960, Population The population of the Borough as estimated by the Registrar General mid 1960 was 127,710, as compared with 128 ,700 for the previous year, thus continuing the steady decrease year by year since the Census in 1951 Births and Deaths Births to St, Pancras residents during 1960 were 2,344, giving a birth rate of 18 3 per 1,000 of estimated population, which is the highest since 1947. Deaths were 1,354. the rate being 10 6, and showed a decrease of 58 from the figure for 1959 The main causes of death were, heart disease 391 and cancer 330, showing an increase of 51 and 17 respectively on last year Pneumonia and bronchitis at 192 was the third highest classification although showing a reduction from the previous year's figure of 243 It is pleasing to note that the 13 deaths from tuberculosis, in keeping with the 1959 figure, is the lowest recorded in St. Pancras It is perhaps difficult to realise that only 11 years ago the comparable figure was 105. In 1924 it was 271. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicle accitdents, none of which occurred in persons under 15 years of age. All other accidents accounted for 26 deaths and of these 3 were in children under the age of 15 years Infantile deaths at 57 were 4 less than for the previous year, and whilst this does not give the lowest rate recorded for the Borough, it is nevertheless the lowest since 1957 No less than 41 were of infants in the first four weeks of life and of these 10 were premature babies and 5 had congenital defects There were no maternal deaths or deaths from causes which could be associated with childbirth i Infectious Diseases I am pleased to report that the incidence of infectious disease was low There were five cases of poliomyelitis as compared with fourteen in 1959, but no deaths resulted There were 520 measles notifications, the lowest since 1940 with the exception of the year 1954, and for the ninth year running there were no deaths from this disease Tuberculosis notifications were 209 pulmonary and 15 non-pulmonary, a total of 224, which is the lowest in any one year since 1939 and probably the lowest ever recorded in the Borough Moreover, 67 of the 224 notifications were transfers from other districts, which means that although they are recorded in St> Pancras as notifications they were in fact persons who had contracted the disease prior to moving into the Borough Out of the total of 224 notifications, only 32 were in young persons under the age of 20 The largest number (131) were of persons between the< agesof 20-44 years and 61 were of persons over the age of 45 years. Tube rculosis is no longer primarily a disease of young people and an increasing number of young persons are being inoculated against it. This, together with the discovery of drugs which can cure patients of the disease, has so improved the prospects of conquering tuberculosis that one can look forward to the not too distant time when the number of notifications of new cases will be in single figures, not the hundreds they have been for so many years 75 visits were paid by members of the Public Health Department to persons who had been in contact with a case( of small pox The patient concerned had travelled by air from the Par East and was staying in a neighbouring borough. The speed of air travel makes it only too easy for persons to arrive in this country during the incubation period of small pox I would like to emphasize the importance of everyone being vaccinated against this disease General Practitioners I have continued throughout the year to send to the medical practitioners of the Borough a weekly statement of the number of cases of notified infectious disease and including notes on any aspects of the health of the Borough that are of particular interest at the time These weekly bulletins help in the co-operation between the Public Health Department and the family doctor which continues on the happiest lines I am grateful for this friendly relationship for it is an essential factor in achieving our mutual object of maintaining a good standard of health for the citizens of St Pancras 11 Clean Air Act The volume of work involved in establishing a smoke controlled area has proved to be greater than was at first anticipated Often several additional visits have to be made by staff from the Public Health Department before a satisfactory conclusion can be reached with the owner or occupier on the changes needed to comply with the Smoke Abatement Order Nevertheless the work of making St Pancras a smoke controlled area within 10 years proceeded steadily throughout the year The St. Pancras (No.2) Smoke Control Order became operative on the 1st December, 1960, and hy October 1961 the whole of St Pancras south of Euston Road will be a smoke control area. St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged The work of this Association has continued steadily throughout the year, So important and use ful are these activities that I feel that a further summary of them would not be out of place. 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 Number of visits by Health Officers 1,461 2,494 3,776 4,383 6,120 5,662 8,518 8,397 10,086 10,512 Meals supplied to old people in their homes 9, 335 9,914 9,447 9,074 9,396 9,889 9,501 7,510 20,739 38,584 Meal vouchers issued issued 788 3,498 4,136 6,815 6,703 8,060 7,353 (a) 7,158 7,724 8,617 Wireless sets supplied or re-issued 22 46 34 30 39 26 29 39 21 (b) Chiropody No. of clinics 32 121 198 317 352 413 387 437 4 35 458 New cases 136 138 215 287 282 237 181 317 219 196 Re-attendances 215 1,198 2,534 3,159 3,886 4,741 4,5 30 4,939 4,852 4,088 Persons seen by doctor 266 521 509 543 452 389 459 468 357 Nil(c) Holidays Persons sent away each year 136 128 134 140 143 129 139 135 151 149 (a) 1,872 by Invalid Meals for London: 5,638 by S.P.A.C.A. - no dinners were supplied for the 4 months prior to S.P.A.C.A. taking over. (b) A total of 115 were on loan at the end of 1960. (c) This clinic has now been resumed. There are five health officers on the staff of the Association, all trained nurses. Starting with one in 1950, a second was appointed in 1952, a third in 1954, a fourth in 1956 and a fifth in 1958. The number of visits shown in the above table gives but small indication of the true value of these officers. Of greater significance is the knowledge that the work they do not only brings comfort to the old people, but often makes it possible for them to remain in their own homes rather than enter a "home" or institution The distribution of amenities and gifts such as clothing, furniture, hot water bottles, food parcels, fruit and vegetables, has been a feature of their work. iii Much assistance is given in securing help in the home, home nursing aids, fire guards, and helping with applications for pensions. Parties are arranged for various outings during the summer and entertainment during the winter, especially around the Christmas period. The work of supplying meals to old people in their own homes was carried on until 1958 in conjunction with the Invalid Kitchens of London. Midway through that year, however, S. P. A.C A.'s first Meals Van was purchased. The second and third vans were purchased and put into operation on the 29th June, 1959, and the 15th February, 1960, respectively. The first two were purchased through the Lord Mayor of London5 s Air Raid Distress Fund of 1939-40. The third was presented by Mrs. Gwen Geffen in memory of her husband, the late Dr. Dennis Geffen, whilst the "Hotlock" container for it was purchased from funds collected by Councillor Mrs. Louise Arabin. The work carried out by the Borough Librarian and members of his staff in providing books to old people in their own homes in many cases where they are unable to journey to a branch library, provides a valuable contribution ancillary to the aims and objects of S.P. A C. A. During 1960 they supplied no fewer than 900 books to ninety elderly housebound St. Pancras residents, whilst a further 1,200 books have been loaned to old people living in special hostels in the Borough. The International Voluntary Service, whose.members are volunteers of many nationalities undertake to clean up and redecorate rooms in the homes of elderly people who are unable to do the work themselves. No less than 44 St. Pancras old people have benefited by this service. The I.V.S. charge only for materials used, and such charge is generally met by the National Assistance Board. I acknowledge with gratitude the splendid assistance and co-operation, in this connection as well as in multifarious other ways, which has at all times been available from officers of the National Assistance Board. iv The following table shows the sources from which funds have.been obtained in each financial year since 1951, and indicates clearly the voluntary aspect of the Association Financial year 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Council grant £ 1,500 1,200 1,200 1,200 1,700 4,000 4,500 4.500 5, 500 7,000 8,000 Voluntary aapecta Annual Ball 148 157 225 230 200 188 156 156 121 * 300 Alexandra Rose Day (donation received) _ 75 150 205 195 185 195 130 _ _ 125 Lord Mayor's Distress Fund _ _ 1.500 . _ _ _ _ _ Sunday Cinematograph - - - 100 100 150 150 150 135 135 130 London Parochial Charities _ _ _ 100 100 _ 200 _ _ _ Lieut-Col.Hal ford exors _ . . 100 _ Eleanor Palmer Charity - - - - - - - - 150 270 300 Union of Post Office Workers - - - - - - - - 50 60 100 Financial year 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Voluntary aspects - contd.

Similarly, the 1961 Ball was held at the beginning of the 1962 financial year and showed a profit to S.P.A.C.A. of about £400. Conclusion In conclusion I should like to express my deep appreciation to your Worship, the Aldermen and members of the Council, especially the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and members of the Public Health Committee for the help and co-operation given to me throughout the year. I also wish to record my gratitude to the other Chief Officers of the Council and their staffs for their ready help at all times. My sincere thanks are given to all the staff of the Public Health Department for their continued support and loyal service. I beg to remain. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Six of these had been known to the Health Officers, St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged but were reported for special investigation owing to the rapid decline of the person, whilst the remaining one was reported by a District Public Health Inspector, In three cases the old person was still being kept under observation at the end of the year, with frequent visits from the S.P.A.C.A Health Officer and the provision of various kinds of domiciliary help. In two cases the person became so ill removal to hospital was necessary and both patients were agreeable In the following two cases it was necessary to invoke the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 - Case No.251 - Mrs. T. aged 75 years This case had been known to the Department for some time and it had been possible to keep the woman in her own home with District Nurse and Home-Help assistance. The woman s health suddenly deteriorated to such an extent that her medical practitioner recommended immediate removal to hospital. She was not agreeable, however, and it became necessary to secure her compulsory removal to University College Hospital on the 9th April. 1960 Case No.257 Miss H.„ aged 82 years This woman's home conditions were quickly deteriorating and she was generally unkempt and dirty in appearance, Many complaints were made to the Public Health Department about her condition by her neighbours and by the local shopkeepers. Arrangements were made for her to have a bath at the Public Health Annexe, be provided with clean clothes and to stay with a niece in the country. She returned within a few days however, and it was obvious that she could not devote to herself proper care and attention and could not be allowed to live alone. In her own interests it became necessary to secure her immediate removal to "Hillside". The Order was carried into effect on the 16th December 1960. 39 Section 50 Burials During the year 1960 the Department carried out 79 burials at a gross cost of £162. 8s. 4d which represents an average of £9 13s.

Area No.2 includes the remainder of ward 7, was confirmed by the Minister on the 26th May 1960 and became operative on the 1st December, 1960. The third area consists of ward 8, and after confirmation by the Minister on the 18th January, 1961 will become operative on the 1st October, 1961.

Section 110 requires the occupier of every factory and every contractor employed by him to send to the Borough Council during the months of February and August in each year, lists showing the names and addresses of all outworkers employed by him outside the factory, and the places where they are employed. Failure to comply with this requirement renders the occupier liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council is required to forward the name and address of any outworker in this list whose address is not in St. Pancras to the local authority concerned. Section 111 applies to premises where work is carried on which, in the Council's opinion, is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein, and in such cases the Council is empowered to give notice of the circumstances, in writing, to the occupier of the factory. If, after the expiration of ten da^s, the occupier continues to give out work to those premises, he is guilty of an offence. A Schedule to the Act states that if the occupier of a factory knowingly allows a woman or girl to be employed therein within four weeks after she has given birth to a child, he shall be liable to a fine. If the occupier of a factory or his contractor allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired in any place where an inmate is suffering from scarlet fever or small-pox, and cannot prove that he was unaware of the existence of the disease, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding AO. The Council has power to forbid work being given out to premises where an inmate is suffering from an infectious disease, and an occupier or contractor upon whom such an order has been served shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10 if he contravenes such order.
