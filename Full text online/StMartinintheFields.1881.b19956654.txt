Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields, for the Year 1881. Gentlemen,, I have the honour of submitting to you my Twelfth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. In the spring of this year, 1st April, 1881, a Census of the inhabitants of London was taken. This Parish numbered 17,447, whereas in 1871 the Census return was 21,238. This falling off in the population of the Parish is owing to the wholesale demolition of houses which have been palled down under the "Artizans' Dwellings Act" and for public improvements. When all the land now vacant is rebuilt upon, I have no doubt the population of the Parish will attain its former standard. b 18 The Peabody Buildings, Bedfordbury, not being finished at the time of the taking of the Census, and therefore not occupied, did not come within the Census. This year was remarkable for the epidemic of Smallpox, of which I shall speak farther on. Births. The Births registered in the year 1881 were 418. This number is lower than the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month of the vear:— Males. Females. Total. January 20 16 36 February 20 12 32 March 20 14 34 April 12 19 . 31 May 16 8 24 June 18 28 46 July 21 12 33 August 20 19 39 September 14 18 32 October 11 20 31 November 20 30 50 December 14 16 30 206 212 418 19 Deaths. The Deaths in the year 1881 numbered 451. This mortality was 40 less than in the previous year. This decrease is due to a certain extent to a diminished population, from the pulling down of houses as previously mentioned. The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring- in each month of the vear :— Males. Females. Total. January 23 18 41 February 16 19 35 March 22 17 39 April 21 11 32 May 25 18 43 June 24 17 41 July 29 15 44 August 23 13 36 September 14 10 24 October 25 13 38 November 36 13 49 December 19 10 29 277 174 451 Of the above 451 deaths, 148 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in the Hospital, 128 were non-residents in St. Martin-in-the- b 2 20 Fields. These 128 deaths deducted from the total deaths will form a basis on which to estimate the deathrate of the Parish. It may be said I should not deduct the deaths occurring in the Charing Cross Hospital in estimating the death-rate, they should be included to counter-balance those residents who die out of the Parish in other institutions; but it would be almost impossible to ascertain this information. However, as I calculate the death-rate on the same basis every year, a tolerably clear estimate of the health of the Parish may be formed by comparing the death-rate of one year with that of previous years. Deaths, 1881 451 Deduct non-residents who died in the Hospital 128 323 Death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1881, 18*5. Ratio of Deaths to population, 1 in 51. By the above figures the death-rate for St. Martin-inthe-Fields for the year 1881, was 18.5 per 1,000. This death-rate exceeds that of the previous year, 1880, owing to the calculations being based this year, 1881, upon a lower population. Notwithstanding this increase, it is a satisfactory death-rate. The death-rate for the whole of London in the year 1881, was 21.2 per 21 J ,000. The Registrar-General in his Annual Summary for 1881, adds "Only once since civil registration began had a lower death-rate than this been recorded in the Metropolis ; namely, in 1850, when the rate was 21.0." Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields during the last ten years :— 1872 18.7 1873 20.2 1874 18.6 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 1878 17.5 1879 18.6 1880 16.8 1881 18.5 Ages at Death. Of the 451 deaths, 71 occurred under 1 year, 67 from 1 to 5 years, 40 from 5 to 20 years, 86 from 20 to 40 years, 99 from 40 to 60 years, 82 from 60 to 80 years, and 6 above 80 years. Causes of Death. Zymottc Diseases.—The seven principal Zymotic Diseases, the diseases most influenced by sanitation, caused 60 deaths. The above figures represent all the 22 deaths from those diseases which actually occurred in the Parish, no cognizance being taken of the cases of infectious diseases removed to hospitals beyond its limits. Smallpox.—One death was caused by 1 his malady in an infant unvaccinated. It is only fair to the Vaccination Officer of the district to state this child was not born in the Parish, therefore he could not be cognizant of the fact of the child not having been vaccinated. The Relieving Officer informs me he sent 13 cases of this complaint to the Smallpox Hospitals during the year 1881. The deaths registered in the Metropolis from Smallpox during the year 1881, were 2,371. These periodical outbreaks of Smallpox are due to the neglect of vaccination and re-vaccination : if the public generally would only take advantage of this great safe-guard and boon, Smallpox, in my opinion, would in time be stamped out. Many have a dislike to vaccination from their fear of introducing disease other than Cowpox into their systems, but if proper care and discrimination be exercised bv the medical man, this accident need not happen. In the year 1881, I vaccinated about 500 persons of all ages, and in no single case did I hear of any bad result; and again not one of that number suffered to my knowledge from Smallpox. Surely such facts as these ought to banish all doubt from the minds of unbelievers as to the value of vaccination. 23 Dr. Aitken, Professor of Pathology in the Army Medical School, Netley, states in his " Science and Practice of Medicine" "The actual extent of the security against death from Smallpox enjoyed by vaccinated, compared with unvaccinated, persons, has been calculated by Mr. Simon from various sources; and it appears that the death-rate from Smallpox amongst the vaccinated varies from an inappreciably small mortality to 12½ per cent.; that amongst the unprotected the death-rate from Smallpox ranges from 14½ to 53¾ per cent." " The average per centage mortality from Smallpox, stated by Mr. Marson, to occur amongst the vaccinated, is 5.24 ; but when vaccination is known to have been perfectly performed, as shown by the cicatrices, the mortality is uniformly found to be reduced to less than half of one per cent." Isolation by means of Smallpox Hospitals is the only effectual means of checking the progress of this disease, more especially amongst the poor. About the middle of the year 1881; there was a great dearth of hospital accommodation in the Metropolis, consequently the malady very much increased. I will cite an instance to show the necessity of these Smallpox Hospitals. Towards the end of May a case of Smallpox came under my notice in one of the courts of the parish, the Relieving Officer was unable to remove the patient in consequence of all the Smallpox Hospitals being full. The result was, three more cases 24 very soon cropped up in the same house, had the first case been removed at once in all probability the three others would not have occurred. Whenever a case of Smallpox came under my notice I at once gave instructions for the room and clothing to be disinfected, and advised the re-vaccination of all the inmates of the house. By a resolution passed at one of your meetings you appointed me to vaccinate all persons who might he desirous of being re-vaccinated; in accordance with your wishes I vaccinated about 100. At the suggestion of the Vicar, I inspected all the children at the St. Martin's National Schools, with the view of ascertaining whether any of them required vaccinating. Those children in whom the cicatrices of the former vaccination were not well marked I re-vaccinated, with the consent of the parents. In some few instances I found vaccination had been entirely neglected. Measles.—There were 7 deaths from this disease, this is 2 more than in the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—12 deaths were due to this disease, the same number as in the previous year. Diphtheria caused 7 deaths, this is three in excess of the previous year. 25 Whooping Cough was fatal to 7. This number is 13 less than in the former year. The RegistrarGeneral, in his Summary for the year 1881, says "The death-rate from Whooping Cough was the lowest on record in London; only 1,961 deaths having been attributed to it, whereas there would have been 3,144 had the mortality been at the average rate of the; preceding 10 years." Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever and Remittent Fever. 16 deaths were registered from this class of disorders. 1 was due to Typhus Fever, 13 to Typhoid Fever, and 2 to Simple Continued Fever. Diarrhœa.—10 deaths were caused by this malady, all in young children. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 117. This number is 33 less than in the preceding year. Diseases of the Heart.—30 deaths were due to this complaint, against 38 of the previous year. Cancer proved fatal to 10 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed in the table at the end of my Report. 26 Inquests. In the year 1881, there were held 74 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 29 Run over or knocked down in the street 12 Burns and Scalds 4 Pistol-shot wound (accidental) 1 ,, „ (suicide) 1 Suffocation 6 Injuries received from falling down stairs 3 ,, ,, by a lift at 28, Haymarket 1 „ ,, from fall from a scaffold 2 ,, ,, from fall from window 2 ,, „ from fall from ladder 1 „ „ at District Railway, Charing Cross 1 „ „ from being crushed between a cart and a stack of bricks 1 Injuries received from explosion of kitchen boiler 1 Injury to throat (suicide) 1 Poisoning with Cyanide of Potassium (suicide) 2 Congestion of Lungs from exposure (newly born infant) 1 Drowning (suicide) 1 „ (No evidence how deceased came into the water) 4 74 27 Sanitary Work. In the year 1881, 90 formal notices were served upon the owners or occupiers of property, besides numerous verbal recommendations to remedy sanitary defects. In conclusion, I must again bear testimony to the zeal and intelligence of your Inspector in the discharge of his duties, and also to acknowledge the promptitude with which the Relieving Officer of the district keeps me informed of all infectious diseases coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street, September, 1882. 28 Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1881.
