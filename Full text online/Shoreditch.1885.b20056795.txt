4849 VESTRY OF THE Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, MIDDLESEX. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACTS. THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 25th, 1886. PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18th & 19th VIC., CAP. 120. LONDON: A T. Roberts, Son & Co., Steam Printing Works, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1886. A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended Lady-day, 1886. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Acts." REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1886, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £67,986 13s. 3d.,; the amount in the pound levied for the four Quarters was 2s. 5d., being for the Quarter to Midsummer, 8d.; to Michaelmas, 9d.; to Christmas, 6d.; and to Lady-day, 6d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 3d. The amount of the Guardians' calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1885, was £50,600; and for the last year, £60,200; and for the Half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1886, is £22,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1886, was Nil. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last year were— s. d. General—in the £ 2 1 Sewers ditto 0 9 2 10 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £78,777 4s. 2d., an increase upon the previous year of £1,663 1s. 8d. 6 Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has on control. Thus, in addition to the £60,200 paid to the Guardians, out of which the Comity Rate and Metropolitan Asylum's Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £12684 16s. 8d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £651 19s. 10d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £16,538 17s. 2d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £21.763 7s. 11d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £2,156 5s. 11d, All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, nor for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes, as corrected by the Assessment Sessions is, compared with the corresponding period of the previous Quinquennial valuation in 1881, as follows:— List in force—April, 1881 April, 1886. Increase. Gross rental £718,614 £790,080 £71,466 Rateable value 586.275 642,329 56,054 The number of Assessments and the Rateable Value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, as are included in several Wards, are as follows:— Number of Assessments. Rateable Value Moorfields Ward 1,375 95,764 Church Ward, North 1,995 66,824 Church Ward, South 1,230 68,248 Hoxton Ward 2,419 77,004 Wenlock Ward 1,785 62,035 Whitmore Ward 2,319 57,553 Kingsland Ward 1,729 45,348 Haggerstone Ward 1,620 36,591 Acton Ward 1,758 41,445 7 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows:— Railways £70,334 Gras Company 30,275 Water Companies 7,741 Tramway Company 2,960 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 10,665 Hoxton House Asylum 1,063 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 1,571 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 21,008 The Workhouse and Infirmary belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only. The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not Assessed. The total of the above is £147,355, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £504,974. ASSESSMENT OF BOARD SCHOOLS. In the last Annual Report the following statement was made: "An Appeal of considerable importance was made to the Assessment Sessions by the London School Board, and in respect to the Board Schools in St. John's road. The point in dispute was not so much the value of the premises as ascertained by the ordinary methods, but the principle upon which Board Schools ought to be assessed. The amount of gross and rateable value has generally been determined upon a reference to the value of the land and the cost of building, and this was decided by the Court of Assessment Sessions some years ago to be the correct method. The School Board now contends, that neither the cost of the Schools nor the rent which the Board would have to pay if they hired the same furnish the correct criterion of value, but the Schools should be rated at a nominal figure (say £150 instead of £1000), because they are compelled to carry them on at a loss, and consequently no 8 ordinary person or body keeping such schools for profit could afford to pay more than a nominal rent. The Assessment Sessions practically confirmed the Parochial Assessments both in Shoreditch and Islington, but granted cases raising the point for decision by the Court of Appeal. The Arguments will probably be heard in November next." The appeal was heard on the 17th of May last before Lord Esher, Master of the Rolls, and Lord Justices Bowen and Fry. Mr. Arthur Charles, Q.C., Mr. Marriott, Q.C., and Mr. Ham for the School Board, and Mr. Jelf, Q.C., and Mr. Castle for the Parish. The Master of the Rolls:—In this Case, the Respondents, (? Appellants) the School Board for London, have been rated and assessed, and the value of the premises has been found, and the main and real question which has been raised in this case is whether in calculating the gross value or the rateable value you are to take into account the School Board itself as one of the possible hypothetical tenants. That is the real main question and principle, and really, as far as I can understand this case, it is the only question of principle that is brought before the Court. Now an argument was at first suggested that the School Board was not rateable at all, but that was not really pressed. The property is a property which, in the hands of somebody, is an assessable property. It is not, as it has been in other cases, put into such a position by statute as that it could not be profitably occupied or owned by anybody. It is not in that position. A School Board is not such a body as that it cannot pay rent, neither is it such a body, as I understand, as that it cannot receive rent. It is impossible to say that this property is shown to be within the doctrine of it being a property struck by the statute with what is called sterility. It is a rateable property. Then if it is rateable property, the School Board is a body which can be rated in respect of the occupation of it. The question is, how is the value of that property to be ascertained so as to rate to a certain amount the School Board, which is a body capable of being rated. The moment you have got thus far, you are put upon a peculiar mode of ascertaining the rateable value. You have not to ask yourself what is a fair rent to be paid by the actual occupier, and you have not to ask yourself what is the rent which is actually paid by the actual occupier who is to be rated, but you are driven to the peculiar mode of 9 finding out the value, which is laid down in the Act of Parliament. You are to find out the annual rent which a tenant (not the tenant who is to be rated) might reasonably be expected, taking one year with another, to pay for a hereditament, that is to pay for the hereditament, and this is to be applied, mind, where the person to be rented is only a tenant occupying, and it is also to be applied where the person to be rated is the owner in occupation, and not a tenant at all, and where there is no tenant at all. If you are to find out the annual rent which a tenant might reasonably be expected, taking one year with another, to pay for a hereditament, it seems to me to be equivalent to saying that you must look at all possible tenants, hypothetical tenants, and all tenants within bounds of reason, to find out what a tenant might reasonably be expected to pay. The very phraseology of the thing does not exclude any tenant, and it does not exclude, therefore, the consideration of the tenant, if there is one, who is in actual occupation, and if the owner is the person who is in actual occupation, it does not exclude the consideration of that very person possibly being a person who might be a tenant. A School Board may be a tenant; if you have got somebody which by statute never could be a tenant at all, that body naturally could not be brought into the question of what a tenant could give, but the moment you get a body which can be a tenant, you have no right to exclude that body as a hypothetical tenant more than any other. If it had been true to say, that by the Act of Parliament which constituted School Boards they never could be tenants, then I think you would have excluded the consideration of them as possible tenants. But that is not so. A School Board can be a tenant of a building for the purpose of a School; therefore they ought not to be rejected. Then it was said that a School Board can obtain no beneficial interest from a tenancy: be it so, and, as I understand it, therefore they never possibly would be asking to be a tenant. That is true in one sense, but they are a body which have a duty to perform which may induce them sometimes, and in some cases must force them, to be tenants. Therefore you cannot say as a matter of law, that because they will not obtain any benefit from the tenancy, therefore it is impossible to suggest that they ever can be tenants. They have a duty to perform which would induce them under certain circumstances, and in others force them, to be tenants. Therefore they are a possible tenant, and if they are a possible tenant they cannot be excluded from the question of what a tenant might reasonably be expected to give. It follows, therefore, in my opinion, from what I have said, that it would be wrong to exclude a School Board from the list of possible hypothetical tenants, and that it would be wrong to exclude a School Board which is about to be rated whether it is in fact a tenant occupying or whether it is in fact an owner in occupation. In either 10 Cases, a School Board exactly similar to that, and in exactly the same conditions with them, is a possible hypothetical tenant, and therefore ought to be included. That seems to me to be the real point of principle which is put before us, and I think that was the real question intended to be argued; but then the case unfortunately, at the end, after saying "The Court being of opinion that the Appellants ought not to be excluded," in which I think the Court was quite right, goes on to say "decided in favour of the contentions of the Respondents, and followed the methods suggested by them as fair tests." Now, we have three tests put forward, and, among others, the second test, which is the one about the Contractor. If the question of whether that second test can be used in any way were raised here before us, it would present, apparently, considerable difficulties. If it were said to be a test which was to be acted upon so as to give what has been called the commercial interest which a contractor would require, I should doubt very much whether that could be right. If all that is said is, according to its terms, that the question of what sum a contractor might demand as rent is a fact which may be given in evidence for the purpose of consideration, I do not intend to say now that it might not be given, because I do not think the question is raised before us, and we are not called upon to decide it. We find in this case it is stated as one of fact—"If the premises were not the freehold of the Appellants, but were already built and offered to the Appellants, the rent which the owner might reasonably expect to obtain would, if taken to be the rateable value, support the finding of the Court, namely, £1,100 rateable value." That, no doubt, is founded upon this, that the Court did take into consideration the fact that a possible tenant was a School Board precisely of the same kind, and with the same wants, and with the same powers, as this School Board, and assuming them to be right in taking that into consideration, then that is a right mode undoubtedly of getting at the rateable value. Then it would be the rent which the owner might reasonably expect to obtain from a tenant, including such a tenant as the School Board. No fault can be found with that, and if that would support the finding of the Court, namely, £1,100 rateable value, it seems to me impossible to say then that what the Court has done—which Court has found that £1,100 is the rateable value—can be wrong. But it leaves unsolved the question of whether it is right to receive either in evidence or for the purpose of acting upon it wholly and entirely that second test, as it is called, with regard to a contractor. On that it seems to me that we should on this occasion give no opinion at all, and we must wait until that question is so raised that the Court is actually called upon to decide it. 11 I think, therefore, that this Judgment of the Justices in Sessions must be supported, and that the appeal must be dismissed. Lord Justice Bowen:—I am perfectly satisfied that the real and the only question intended to be raised in this case is whether the School Board are to be excluded, when you are calculating the rateable value of the premises, from the class of hypothetical tenant. What does excluding the School Board from the class of hypothetical tenant mean? In order to see what it means you must go back to the Act of Parliament, and as soon as you go back to the Act of Parliament the question ceases to be shrouded in that atmosphere of mystery which is always introduced when you depart from the language of the Act of Parliament and apply yourself to the idea of hypothetical tenant which is not mentioned in the Act. Both the general Statute of William, and the Act of Parliament under which this present case arises, direct that you are to arrive at the rateable value of premises by estimating the rent at which the premises might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year. What does "reasonably expected to let" mean? That must mean reasonably expected to let to somebody who wants to hire. The question we are asked to decide is whether you are to exclude from the field of possible occupiers a School Board. On looking again at the Statute one asks oneself, if you are to estimate the rent at what the premises might reasonably be expected to let from year to year for, whether you might reasonably expect, amongst other things, to let it to a School Board. A School Board is actually one of the persons who would want to take it, and how would it be possible to exclude from the field of possible occupiers the one competitor that really wants the premises, and for whose occupation it is perfectly and admirably suited. Assume, therefore, as you state the case in the language of the Act of Parliament, it answers itself and it is as plain as daylight that you cannot exclude it. It would be too ridiculous to suppose that you are to decide first of all upon a hypothesis that the one perso'n who wants the premises is never to be the person who uses them, and secondly that the real value to him of the premises is to be the one value that you are never to take into consideration. On what ground can it be suggested that this strange exclusion is to be made? Because it is said that the School Board can make no profit out of the premises. What on earth does it matter whether the School Board want these premises for the purpose of profit, or whether, when they have got them, they will make a profit out of them, provided it is certain they want them and will pay for them, and as soon as you are certain that they want them you know that they will pay for them. The criterion of whether premises are valuable is whether or no the occupier can find anybody who wants to take them from him; and if a man had got a barren rock which he could let for £100 a year, the 12 barren rock would not of course be sterile in the sense of rating law; it would not produce corn and it would not produce grass, but it would produce money, and it could not be said to be sterile. Then it is said again that you are to exclude the School Board because there are some restrictions as to where they should put a School and as to what kind of a School it should be. There again the answer seems to me to be, what have we got to do with that—if the School Board want these premises and are driven by necessity and by duty into the field of possible competition. It seems to me that the case is perfectly plain on principle, and that it ought to be decided on the ground which I have stated. As regards the contentions raised in the case, I desire to abstain from uttering a word on one side or the other, and to leave it to the future, in case the future raises the necessity to determine as to whether the contentions in this case set up on the one side or on the other are correct or not. We have the materials, as was pointed out by Lord Justice Fry during the arguments, for knowing how this figure of £1,100 was arrived at or was acquiesed in by the Court, and that principle seems to me to be a sound one. They have taken what those premises might be reasonably expected to let for from year to year, including in the calculation the possibility of a reasonable chance that the School Board would want them. Lord Justice Fry: I am entirely of the same opinion. It appears to me that this is one of those cases in which great mist has been raised from not referring to the original contract which we have to construe, but have considered, instead of that, a number of decisions in which various expressions have been used. Now, tl:e enactment we have to consider is one which defines the gross value, and the Statute provided for the uniformity of assessment of rateable property. The 4th Section of the Statute defines amongst other things the term "gross value" and it says that gross value means the annual rent which a tenant might reasonably be expected, taking one year with another, to pay for a hereditament if the tenants undertook to pay certain outgoings and so on. That description simply refers to reasonable expectation. It appears to me that the tenant there referred to may be any tenant, therefore the definition he refers to annual rental which any tenant might reasonably be expected to pay for the hereditament in question to any landlord. Now it is said that from the tenants whom we are to consider is to be excluded the actual owner and occupier of the property. It is said 13 that the School Board, that actual occupant, cannot be what has been called a hypothetical tenant. A hypothetical tenant is only the "a tenant" of this section, and when one asks why should the actual occupier not be a possible tenant, there seems to me to have been no answer given in the whole course of the argument except one. It is said that the School Board are not to be deemed a possible hypothetical tenant because although they actually occupy the property, and although, therefore, it is an object of great desire to them, yet inasmuch as they can make no profit out of it, declare no dividend and accumulate no profits, therefore they are not to be deemed hypothetical tenants. It seems to me you might just as well say that a man who occupies a house not for the purpose of a shop, and not for the purpose of making money but for the purpose of providing for his own comfort and the comfort of his wife and family is not a hypothetical tenant. The real way in which the question of sterility, as it has been called has been introduced into this section is this: Taking property of ordinary character the general reason why rent may be reasonably expected to be obtained is that there will be a beneficial ownership of the property in the hands of the person who takes it. That is the general rule. Therefore it has been said that where property produces nothing, you cannot reasonably expect that anybody will pay anything for it. But it does not follow that because property may produce no actual income in the hands of the occupier therefore no rent can reasonably be expected to be obtained for it. No better illustration of the fallacy can occur than the present case where this particular School Board has the object of its highest desire, a Board School, and they might reasonably be expected to pay a large rent for it, although they can make no profit out of it in their own hands. The fact is the section has nothing to do with the objects for which the tenants may take it, it has nothing to do with whether the tenant will or wil not make profit out of it. The only question is, is there a tenant who may reasonably be expected to take it for any motive, for profit, for the performance of his duty, for his own pleasure, for his curiosity, or for any other motive which actuates a human being? With those motives the section has nothing to do. You have merely to enquire whether there is any reasonable expectation that a tenant can be found and what is the annual rent which may reasonably be expected to be paid by that tenant. That being so the section answers itself, and the whole of this argument has been derived from a misapprehension of the suggestions which have been made in the course of the discussion in this case. But then it is said that in the present case the Court has arrived at its conclusion by certain tests, some of which at least are inaccurate and untrue. The tests suggested are three. Now those tests, according to 14 my reading of the case produce as rateable value £1,150. But there was another mode of arriving at the value which produced another result namely £1,100, and that other method is the one stated in paragraph 8. It is stated in these terms "On the other hand if the premises were not the freehold of the Appellants, but were already built, and offered to the Appellants, the rent which the owner might reasonably expect to obtain, would, if taken to be the rateable value support the finding of the Court, namely £1,100 rateable value." According to that statement the Court has taken the right mode of proceeding, and enquired what was the rent which a tenant might reasonably be expected to pay for the hereditament. That, the Court say, supports the actual finding at which they had arrived, but not the finding of the original Assessment Committee of £1,150. On that, therefore, they have proceeded. That being so, we may neglect from consideration all the other motives which may have operated upon the Court. I have come to the conclusion that this is the right ground, and therefore I express no opinion at all upon the other subordinate modes of arriving at different figures which are not now really before us. Mr. Jelf: The Appeal will be dismissed with Costs? Lord Justice Bowen: Yes. ASSESSMENTS. During the year 1885 the Quinquennial revision of the Assessments of the various properties in tho parish took place. The greater part of the valuation was made by the Valuation List Commmittee, either from actual survey, or from the returns furnished by tho owners or occupiers. The following large properties were referred to the valuers, Messrs. Castle & Son, for valuation:— Great Eastern Railway. North London Railway. London and North Western Railway. New River Company. East London Water Company. Gas Light and Coke Company's Works and Mains. North Metropolitan Tramways. The following were settled before the Assessment Committee:— Former Rating. Present Rating. Great Eastern Railway 14,840 15,370 Gas Light & Coke Company 28,344 30,275 Tramways 2,500 2,960 London & North Western Railway 21,028 21,873 15 In respect to the following, the parties appealed to the Assessment Sessions:— The North London Railway. The New River Company. The East London Water Company. The United Telephone Company. Messrs. Wells & Co., Shoreditch. The Appeal of the North London Railway Company was referred, by the Assessment Sessions, to Mr. McIntyre, Q.C., as Arbitrator. The parishes of Hackney and St. Pancras were also as Respondents in respect to the North London Railway, before the same Arbitrator. The amount contended for by the Company, in respect to the main line, was £21,198; the Parish claimed £32,000; the Arbitrator's decision was £24,891. A slight reduction was made in respect to the Haggerston Station. The increase over the Company's offer is £3,932. The Assessment Sessions ordered the Respondents to pay costs. The New River Company's Appeal, and the East London Water Company's Appeal, were referred to Mr. Stavely Hill, Q.C., as Arbitrator. After two days' hearing the New River Company made proposals for settlement, and it was agreed that the assessment should be increased from £6,000 to £6,500. The Appellants to pay the Respondents' taxed costs. The East London Water Company's Appeal was before the Arbitrator for thirteen days. Seventeen parishes in the East of London were Appellants. The former rating was £1,350; the new valuation was £1,500. The Company claimed to be reduced to £945. The Arbitrator decided that the rateable value should be £1,241, and ordered the Respondents to pay costs. The Telephone Company's and Messrs. Wells' Appeals were settled by agreement, without costs. In respect to these Appeals, it may be mentioned that great dissatisfaction exists among those who had to represent the respondent parishes as regards the efficiency of the Court of 16 Assessment Sessions, and the deoisions of the Court respecting the costs of Appeals. It is probable that the subject may, at an early date, be brought under the notice of Parliament. TRAMWAYS. The extension of the Tramways from Old Street to Shoreditoh, via Great Eastern Street, has been completed. The contribution to be made by the Tramway Company for the use of tho paving in Great Eastern Street is £2,303 8s. The Company has provided, within their limits in this street, new 3x4 Guernsey Granite Paving. The Company promoted, in the last Session of Parliament, a Bill for the continuation of tho Great Eastern Street Line through Commercial Street to join the line at Whiteohapel. The Bill passed the House of Commons and is waiting to be submitted to the Lords' Committee in the new Parliament. No other Parliamentary Scheme of a local oharaoter, affecting this Parish, was promoted in the last Session. Several Schemes have, in previous years, received the sanotion of Parliament; but towards the exeoution of the works authorised no actual steps appear to have been taken: they are — The Widening of the North London Railway and the diversion of Plough Yard. The Regents Canal Railway. The Columbia Market Railway. NEW MAIN SEWER. The New Sewer through the Queen's Road, Great Cambridge Street and Hackney Road, connecting with the Middle Level Sewer in Bethnal Green, has been completed. It now remains for the Vestry to alter, or reconstruct, the local Sewors, in order to give to the locality tho benefit of this provision. 17 DISORDERLY HOUSES, &c. Several places of improper character have been suppressed by indictment, and others have been dealt with summarily. In some cases the parties have quitted on notice without prosecution. DISTRESS IN THE METROPOLIS. During the recent winter the attention of the Vestry was called to the severe distress which was alleged to exist among the labouring classes in the Metropolis. Communications upon the subject were received from the Local Government Board and others; but from enquiries made there was no reason to believe that the distress in this locality was exceptionally severe. But in order to afford some relief the Vestry opened the Stone Yard, as far as possible, to all persons desirous of labour and residing in the Parish, to break up a quantity of accumulated material, and there is reason to believe that this step was attended with beneficial results. The total expenditure for this purpose was £149 11s. 4d., but of course a corresponding amount of granite and other material had not to be purchased. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 124 times ; the Council Chamber 10 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting Hall, Council Chamber, and Committee Rooms were £886 9s. 0d. YESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Yestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended June 30th, 1886, is as follows:— Number of Vestry Meetings 37 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 25 18 Sewers, &c., Committee 22 General Purposes Committee 21 Valuation Committee, including Sub-Committee 4 Town Hall Committee ditto 16 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 8 Total 96 NILE STREET IMPROVEMENTS. The joint Trustees of the Charities of St. Luke's and Cripplegate having recently acquired the reversion of a considerable site of land situate in Nile Street, (formerly Catherine Street), have with the sanction of the Charity Commissioners erected thereon a Block of Model Dwellings with Laundry, &c. A portion of this site projected into Nile Stroet, reducing the passage through a certain part to about five feet. The Trustees were desirous of widening this thoroughfare to an uniform width and agreed with the Vestry after some negotiations to surrender so much of the land on their estate as was necessary for the purpose, on condition that the Parish paved the same. A small portion however belonged to other owners which it was necessary to purchase, which the Vestry did under its compulsory powers. The works were finished and well completed by the day of the opening of the Dwellings early in June. The Metropolitan Board has consented to pay one half of the cost of effecting the improvement, but as the accounts are not yet closed the final statement of cost, &c., must be deferred till the next report. Appended are various Tables showing Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities, Loans Outstanding, Analyst's Reports, List of Contracts, &c., &c. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Town Hall, Old Street, July, 1886. 19 SUN STREET IMPROVEMENT.

The men out of employment, taken on during February and March last, broke up about 1196½cubic yards of old pebbles, cubes, &e., at a total cost of £149 l1s. 4d. One foreman and six labourers on average were employed in the yard, and on the general repairs of the unpaved roads and over trenches opened by the Gas and Water Companies ; their wages for the year amounted to £400 14s. 7½d. The sum of £1 17s. 6d. was also paid for Watchmen's wages. The Companies contributed £82 8s. 6d. for labour (exclusive of Foreman's time) and £243 15s. 8d for material required in the said repairs. 50 In consequence of the use of the Steam Holler the unpaved roads are, generally speaking, in a satisfactory condition.

Gentlemen, 4,922 births—2,595 males and 2,327 females; and 2,856 deaths were registered in twelve months ending 25th March, 1886. The rate of mortality was 22.40 per 1,000 living, being 1.81 per 1,000 above the average of the last five years. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerstone District, in which is situated Shoreditch Infirmary. The following statistics show the rate of mortality in the different Registration Districts of the Parish:— Population. Deaths. Average per 1000 living. Holywell 7,376 180 24.4 St. Leonard 14,967 277 18.50 Hoxton New Town 29,937 519 17.31 Hoxton Old Town 28,036 548 19.10 Haggerston 46,275 1,332 28.50 790 deaths occurred in the public institutions of the parish, viz:— 350 in Shoreditch Infirmary, 303 in Holborn Infirmary (situate in Hoxton New Town), 66 in the North Eastern Hospital, and 71 in Hoxton House. 78 Diseases acknowledged to be induced by cold and damp were very destructive. There were 380 deaths from bronchitis, 244 from phthisis, and 188 from pneumonia, making a total of 812 deaths registered under the above headings. 910 deaths occurred under one year of age—against 1,452 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age have decreased—1,499 against 3,238 in the previous year. 424 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age and upwards, viz.:—274 from 65 to 75; 120 from 75 to 85, and 30 from 85 to 95. In the previous year 291 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age ; 138 from 75 to 85, and 36 from 85 to 95. In childhood (from 1 to 5 years) the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease (376), comprising 157 from bronchitis, 103 from pneumonia, and 116 from congestion of lungs, &c. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility (134 deaths); convulsions 100; whooping cough 167; premature birth 85, and diarrhoea 86. From the age of 55 and upwards 171 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 97 by heart disease, and 26 by paralysis; 142 were registered under the term of "old age." ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 434 deaths, viz.:—3 by small pox; 42 by scarlet fever; 11 by enteric fever; 10 by diptheria; 82 by measles; 167 by whooping cough, 97 by diarrhæa, and 22 by other zymotic diseases. 73 of the 167 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under one year of age. The influence of age is manifest,—141 of the 167 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years of age, and 84 of the 97 deaths from diarrhœa occurred in infants under two years of age. DISINFECTION.—To arrest the spread of contagious diseases 248 houses were disinfected, the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently the windows kept open to expose the rooms freely to the oxydising influences of the open air. The walls of the rooms, where necessary, were stripped and otherwise cleansed. 79 122 cases of small pox were reported to the Sanitary Department, of which 114 were for isolation removed to Hospital; 8 could not be removed, of these 3 died. There are no data to show how many cases had occurred in private houses which were not reported. In the corresponding period of last year there were 509 cases reported. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Small Pox, for instance, has been much less prevalent, and the cases reported to the Sanitary Department were nearly all removed for isolation and treatment to the Poor Law Asylums. Here I may refer to a circular letter that the Asylum's Board sent to your Vestry, notifying that they were prepared to make arrangements in the Sick Asylums of the Board for the reception of Non-Pauper Infected Persons of the Parish, if the Vestry would undertake to pay the cost in each case. That circular it was my duty to consider and advise thereon—and I regret that I could not advise your Vestry to adopt this proposal of the Board; I could not, for the Board did not agree to receive any and all of such infected persons that the Sanitary Authority of the Parish might have to send in their endeavour to arrest an epidemic by isolating the infected. The Board made the reception of the infected contingent upon the Board having suitable accommodation for their reception. Experience has shown that in the face of an epidemic the Sanitary Authority may not have time to provide suitable Hospital accommodation for isolation purposes, but the Asylum's Board, with their large resources might reasonably bo expected to have taken precautionary steps to be ready to receive all cases—and it seemed to your Medical Officer that it would be much safer for your Vestry to know that it entirely depended upon the Sanitary Authority themselves to provide for an exceptionally severe outbreak, rather than wait on a contingency that might lead to a most dangerous waste of time. DWELLINGS IMPROVEMENT. That operation has continued, and the changes made are manifestly more advantageous for both landlord and tenant. For 80 the dwellings have been cleansed and well repaired, thereby less exposed to unremunerative decay, and the Sanitary accommodation made more suitable for the tenant's welfare. Inspector Alexander reports that he has carefully examined 1,148 premises in the year, and he found it requisite to serve "Sanitary Notices" requiring the abatement of nuisances (in accordance with the "Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Acts") in 1,0.10 of these premises. The nuisances were of many kinds;—in 346 of the premises the stack pipes, connected with the roofs and the drains of the houses, were so placed and defectively constructed that sewer gas could escape into the dwellings by the bedroom windows. In 277 the waste pipes of sinks were untrapped and allowed sewer gases to enter the dwellings. In 619 the closets were in an unsuitable condition;—they required to bo cleansed and repaired in 406 premises, and the water laid on in 619 premises. In 675 dwellings the yards were in an injurious condition;—their walls exceedingly dirty in 250; and the pavement so defective that the basements of the houses were exposed to much dampness in 425. The water supply for drinking purposes was much improved in 137 dwellings;—in the place of unclean cisterns; the tenants were enabled to draw the water direct from the main. In 511 houses the walls and ceilings required cleansing and repairing. In 146 the roofs required repairing; In 97 the floors had to be repaired to render the houses fit for habitation. All these nuisances dangerous to health have been removed; and the materials used are durable; and what work was done, has been well done. The Inspector calls more particular attention to some premises in (it. Cambridge St.; for the nuisances he found there were common instances of what ho has had frequently to deal with; the drain pipes under the houses had been constructed in the most irregular and careless manner, resulting in the basements of all the houses being largely infested with rats and impregnated with sewer gases—and owing to the pipes of the closet drains being badly fitted into each other, the ground adjoining the house had become soddened with fœcal matters. Sewer gases had escaped by 81 the stack pipes into the bed rooms; and water for domestic use was stored in cisterns placed over the closets; used both for drinking purposes and for flushing the closet pans. "Much work from time to time had been done in these premises to make them more advantageous for health, but it had been badlyconceived and executed, therefore with little beneficial result." The Inspector sets forth in his report what alterations were effected under his supervision to thoroughly remove the dangerous conditions. He also refers to the Caretaker's house on the premises of the Board School in Hammond Square—and that matter it was necessary for the Medical Officer to bring more especially under the notice of your Sanitary Committee to receive instructions thereon. An outbreak of fever in the house led to the examination of the premises. The house had only been built about 8 or 9 years ago, on the site of some old cottages. It might have been inferred that, at the time of construction, ordinary precautionary measures would have been adopted to keep the premises of the sohool from proximate contact with noxious decaying accumulations; but instead of that large accumulations of sewage matter had been allowed to remain buried within the walls of the house and as the Inspector says, when the ground under one room was opened to the depth of about three to four feet, it was seen to be made up of old bricks and other rubbish and under that was an old brick drain, further examination shewed that the wall of the house had been built over this drain, the wall being carried on a "relieving stone template" to avoid disturbing or removing the old drain. In the removal of the made up ground from within the walls of the house, by orders of your Sanitary Committee, a large cesspool was found and five loads of sewage accumulation had to be removed. These conditions had made the walls of the house foully damp. I am induced to call the attention of your Vestry to this dangerous nuisance, for it is another example manifesting the need for thorough inspection, by a responsible public Officer, of all ground on which dwellings are to be erected. If it were sufficiently 82 recognised that the sweetness of the dwellings largely depends on the sweetness of the ground under the dwellings; and that if the ground be kept dry to promote the circulation of air through it, and if it be not saturated with poisonous refuse, it becomes a most valuable disinfecting agent for houses, tending to keep the gaseous elements sweet and healthful. If on the other hand it be saturated with poisonous ingredients, that combined with the heat of the dwellings, would favor the free production of noxious powers that would hover in and around the inhabitants. The conditions of this dangerous nuisance, shew that the interests of health are sacrificed to minor considerations ; and public welfare calls for some arrangement that would render this in future exceedingly difficult to say the least. Another condition risking the health of the inhabitants of the Parish that has been complained of, in the twelve mouths and many times before, is the defective working of the sewers. It is admitted on all hands that they require much alteration to prevent their defects becoming a wide spread dangerous nuisance. The only question is how can such a dangerous recurring nuisance through miles of street be usefully dealt with. The Metropolitan Board has considered the matter and issued a report embodying their conclusions and recommendations as to what should be done to lessen the risk; and that report your Vestry Clerk instructed me to carefully consider and advise him thereupon, and your Yestry further appointed a Committee to consider and report on the Metropolitan Board's recommendations. The Committee accepted the Board's recommendations, but could not see their way to advise the Vestry to carry them into operation. The Sanitary Committee had on various occasions been much impressed that the sewers required much attention; the repeated complaints from the inhabitants could point to no other conclusion. The Metropolitan Board urges that more water should be passed into the sowers; and it is difficult to comprehend how it came about that the want was not provided for sooner, and has been allowed 83 to remain so long unattended to; considering that the water carriage system, for its efficient working must have a sufficient quantity of water to prevent poisonous deposits, and must have sufficient fall in each section of the sewers to allow of an adequately rapid fall to draw the sewage away from the smaller sewers and house drains—in so doing the air travelling with the water would tend to keep the sewers emptied of sewer gases—in fact if the water carriage had been adequate, traps should have been not much needed, and gulley openings should have been openings for air to flow into the sewers, without much sewer gas escaping upwards into the streets and houses, but for those operations there must be a continous flow of water not only down the main sewers but along the smaller sewers also, and for that working a sufficient supply of water is indispensable. The Metropolitan Board had the Thames at hand for their service and requisite funds to draw upon, so that when the water carriage was adopted, the indispensable supply of water should have been arranged for in every Parish. The Committee appointed by your Vestry to consider the subject found the cost of obtaining an efficient supply of water so great that the Committee did not feel justified in recommending your Vestry to make such an annual expenditure. I venture to add that the water might be used not only for the sewers, but for cleansing the streets also, which is very much needed. In the interests of health I cannot but each year see that it is increasingly needed, in an exceedingly populous industrial centre like Shoreditch to promote, especially in the night during the time of rest and sleep, as much freshness in the atmosphere of the streets and dwellings as can possibly be obtained. In so doing the workmans nature would be supplied with more energy to render hie industry more successful. To assist that end, the streets should be well swept as soon as practicable in the evening or night, and washed with water, and whatever additional cost this might be the outlay would be compensated for by the increased aid to health, and the additional comfort afforded by the sweeter condition of the air around. 84 CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY. That service has continued to work well, and in the year there have been very few complaints of it from the inhabitants. SCAVENGING-. That operation as I have already implied requires to be made more commensurate with the health wants of the inhabitants. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 85 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST.

MISCELLANEOUS. Overcrowding abated in 16 premises Dead bodies removed from 9 „ Animals, kept so as to be a nuisance, removed from 5 „ Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 15 „ Smoke Nuisances abated in 5 „ Making a total of 4,514 separate nuisances, dangerous to health, abated in 1,148 dwellings. In addition to the ordinary notices served for the abatement of nuisances 744 letters have been written. To show the character of the work done during the year a few oases are given in detail, as follows:— THE PRIORY, GT. CAMBRIDGE STREET.— These premises consist of 6 old houses Nos. 18 to 30. They were inspected by request of the Lady Superior, and ascertained to be in a very dangerous condition. Pipe drains passing under the houses had been constructed in the most irregular and careless manner, resulting in the basements of all the houses being largely infested with rats, and impregnated with sewer gas. The water closets abutting on the back walls of basements were connected with the house drains by branch drains, composed of defective brick work, defective pipes, and pipes, which though not defective, were very badly fitted into each other; these defects caused the ground under the water closets, and the back walls of basements, to be largely soddened with foecal matters. Sewer gas was also carried up to bedrooms by rain pipes, the lower ends of which were in the drains, and the heads close to the upper windows. Water stored in cisterns placed on the top of the water closets, was used both for drinking and flushing closets. The back yards were unpaved and added 88 thereby to the dampness of basement walls. The refuse of the establishment—kept in a large open pit exposed to sun and rain—was very offensive. Much work had been done by the owners from time to time to improve the condition of the premises, but it was work badly advised, and badly executed, and therefore without beneficial result. Under my instructions the whole of the drains under the houses have been removed, and one common drain constructed extending through the back yards into the side street (Dunloe Street). Immediately within the premises this drain is fitted with an interception trap and inspection chamber, thus shutting off all danger from sewer gas, and giving facility for removal of stoppages without trouble. The filth under and around the waterclosets was removed, and its place supplied with dry lime rubbish, and the closets fitted on my improved plan with concrete floors, and open spaces under seats. Water has been laid on direct from the main. A large part of the ground at the rear of the premises has been substantially paved with cement concrete, thus protecting the lower walls from damp, and two of my improved dust bins have been constructed. The whole of these rather extensive alterations and improvements have been effeeted in the most satisfactory manner. HAMMOND SQUARE, BOARD SCHOOL. Attention having been directed to the condition of the "Caretaker's house," the following Special Report was presented to the Sanitary Committee." "Gentlemen, "On Wednesday, 23 September, my attention was called to the insanitary condition of the house occupied by the Caretaker of the Hammond Square Board School, and I beg to report, as follows:— "1.—The house was built about 8 or 9 years ago on the site of some old cottages and their water closets. 89 "2.—The ground under one room being opened, I find it composed, to a depth of at least 3 feet 6 inches of foul old bricks and other rubbish. "3.—Immediately below the floor there was found the trap of one of the old closets still in position. On digging to a depth of two feet this trap was found connected into an undisturbed old brick drain, leaving no doubt that foul gas from the drain had been added to the emanations arising from the foul matters buried within the walls, and empoisoning the atmosphere of the house. "4.—There is evidence that the position of the drain was recognized when the house was built, in the fact that, where the drain passes under the front wall, the wall is carried on a 'relieving stone template' to avoid disturbance or removal of drain. "5.—The lower walls are damp, arising from defective construction. The back wall stands on brittle and porous concrete, composed mainly of burnt clay with very little lime, or other binding material added. The front wall appears not to be built on concrete of any kind. "6.—To mitigate dampness a dry area, abutting on the footings of the front wall, has been constructed. This area is fitted with horizontal air grates, level with surface of paving. It is probable that this arrangement causes more water to be added to the foundations in wet weather than can be withdrawn by areation in dry weather. "7.—There has been much sickness in the house. One child has died of Typhoid Fever, and four others of Bronchitis. The Caretaker has suffered with Ague and sore throat on and off all the time he has lived in the house, except the first four months. His wife also suffers frequently from sore throat. "I beg to recommend that an order be made on the School Board, that the whole of the impure matters buried within the 90 walls of the house be dug out and removed. Thai the walls be underpinned on good concrete foundations laid on virgin soil, built with proper damp courses, and eased externally with impervious material. That the area within the walls under floor be coeoreled all over and properly ventilated. That the dry area, abutting on front wall be covered securely to prevent admission of rain, and properly ventilated by chambers or flues out in the front wall." In the progress of the works so recommended, and ordered by the Vestry a large portion of the walls were underpinned, but not Oil virgin soil. This was not satisfactory; a futher communication was, there fore, addressed to the Board insisting upon the brink work being carried down to virgin soil. This was eventually done, and proved to bo necessary, by the discovery under the walls newly underpinned of a large cesspool, from which live loads of excreta wore removed. The details of this ease are given because they illustrate the necessity for a thorough, as against a superficial examination of the subsoil of houses erected on old sites or made ground. Following upon the discovery of the cesspool the Hoard directed all the ground within the walls of the house to be removed down to virgin soil, the walls to be underpinned, that is, built up thereon, and the space to be asphalted and adapted for cellerage. This has been done, and the house is now in good condition. ALBERT MEWS, HOXTON STREET— The road-way and footpaths of the entrance to these premises, abutting on the roadway of Hoxton Street, had long been in a foul condition, arising from "public nuisances" and defective paving. The lower walls of the adjoining premises, No. 174, Hoxton St root, wore thereby soddened with liquid tilth. The owner on being communicated with, and without notice lining served, anting on my recommendation, has paved the roadway and footpaths in a very substantial manner with granitic 91 concrete, and protected the wall of 174, Hoxton Street, from public nuisances by the construction in the same material of a sloping plinth throughout the length of the building. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 301 cases of contagious diseases were reported to the Sanitary Department, of which 122 were cases of small-pox, as against 509 in the previous year. 114 of the small-pox cases were removed to hospital, 8 could not be removed, and 3 died. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease, by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses. ARTICLES DISINFECTED AT VESTRY'S OVEN.

SCAVENGING. The roadways have not been satisfactorily attended to by the Contractors, especially after the fall of snow in January. Reports thereon were presented to the Vestry, and each Contractor fined £100. WATERING OF ROADS. This work has been more satisfactorily done than in past seasons; the work has been facilitated by the Vestry possessing its own vans. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H.
