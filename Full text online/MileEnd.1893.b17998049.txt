VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE PUBLIC HEALTH, AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1893, BY THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY E. S. WHEATLEY, 176, MILE END ROAD, E. 1894. THE THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1893. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, It now becomes my duty as your Medical Officer of Health after the close of the year 1893 to report to you on the sanitary condition of the district, and in doing so, I may state that numerous improvements have been effected in the various parts of the Hamlet, both in construction and reconstruction of the drainage system to private houses, and also in improving the various sanitary conveniences which are requisite and form part of all premises, by substituting modern appliances in lieu of those which were of out-of-date pattern, and remedying other matters that were found to be nuisances within the meaning of the Public Health Act. The Public Health Act of 1891, although somewhat complicated, is of a very stringent character, and there is ample power in it and the bye-laws which are made by its order for a sanitary authority to remedy any nuisance which is of such a character so as to be dangerous or injurious to health. POPULATION. In what is termed the intercensal periods, it is necessary for the purpose of Statistics, that the population of any district should be as accurately estimated as possible; a simple way would be to add the excess of the births over the deaths, this would be the "Natural Increase of Population," but past experience has taught us, that in our own district, these figures would be very misleading. I find that the best system to adopt is to estimate the population by logarithms; it is by this method that the Registrar General bases his calculations, and by these means, I 4 estimate the population of Mile End Old Town in the middle of 1893, to be 108,006, and it is on these figures the rates of Mortality are calculated for the purpose of this Report. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The number of Births registered during the past twelve months was 4,186, giving a birth-rate of 387 per 1,000 inhabitants, that of last year was 38.2. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The number of Deaths registered which took place in the Hamlet during 1893 was 2,174; but as this includes those Deaths which occurred in such Public Institutions in our district as the City of London Union, the Jewish Home Stepney Green, and the Portuguese Homes, etc., whose inmates come from other districts, it does not fairly represent the number of Deaths of Mile End inhabitants, so by subtracting from the above the number of these Deaths and adding all those belonging to Mile End who died in the various Hospitals, Asylums, etc., we get the correct number of Deaths which belong to the Hamlet and this number is 2,430, and giving a death-rate of 22.8 per 1,000 for the past twelve months, that of London being 20.8 for the same period.

The Infant Mortality of any district is said to be an indication as to its healthiness; and no doubt in many country districts this is so, but in London and our large provincial towns there are many other causes that play important parts in the deaths of infants of tender years other than insanitary surroundings. It is much to be deplored that in the advance of civilization in the nineteenth century that out of every 1000 births in London there should be 182 deaths of infants under one year of age, in our own district the rate is 150 per 1000, the causes of this alarming state of things is I believe principally due to social causes, such as early and improvident marriages and consequent ignorance and carelessness in nursing, especially in improper feeding, as in the present day so many mothers never make any attempt to bring their children up per "via naturales" and therefore the deaths from Diarrhœa, Convulsions, etc., are due in a great measure to the artificial methods of feeding employed. One cannot help being struck with the number of Inquests that take place in young children whose deaths are proved to be from overlying, starvation, etc., and other preventable causes. INQUESTS. Inquests are generally held on persons that have died suddenly without medical attention either from accidental causes or otherwise. The methods of conducting these enquiries have lately much improved, and instead of being held in Public Houses as previously they now invariably take place in Public Buildings such as Vestry Halls; Coroner's Courts are provided in some districts for that purpose, and in this manner the dignity of the enquiry is much enhanced, and the friends of the deceased are treated in a better manner than having to be huddled up on a wretched staircase of a Public House waiting to be called in to a room used as a Court that frequently reeked with stale tobacco smoke and other odours. Another matter connected with inquests is the objectionable practice of having to view the bodies; whilst some jurymen are callous and do not mind this, others are more sensitive, both at private houses and mortuaries, when it is at the latter place the method might be much improved; there is no reason why the viewing could not take place through a glass partition, and so allay any fear of infection that might exist through too close a contact with the bodies. In our own district negotiations are pending as to providing a Coroner's Court and Mortuary, and I trust before my next report the matter will have been settled satisfactorily; at the present time the Coroner is using the Vestry Hall for holding his Courts. 7 Table showing the number of Inquests held during the year of persons belonging to this Hamlet.

It was generally surmised that we should have Small Pox in an epidemic form during this year, and unfortunately the prognostication has proved too true. When however it made its appearance in the early part of the year, it was not confined to our own district but occurred at about the same time in most of the London parishes on this side the River Thames. In this Hamlet the first case was notified to me on January 24, and was that of a porter at a wool warehouse; he was promptly moved to the hospital and stringent measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and no other case occurred in the same street; the next case was that of a scrubber living in South Grove February 10, the next March 6th a stableman in Maplin Street, and between this and March 28th five cases occurred all in the East Ward but these were of a sporadic character, and it was not until March 29th that what may be termed an epidemic broke out, in April we had thirty-one cases, May twenty-six cases, eleven in June, sixteen in July, two in August, four in September, one in October, two in November, and six in December, making a total of 116 persons attacked. The first cases of what may be termed the epidemic occurred in a casual who had been in the Workhouse Infirmary some little time, another inmate contracted the disease who had also been in the Infirmary three weeks; the next was a man who had been discharged from the Infirmary a fortnight he having also been an inmate of the same ward as the two previous cases; this man lived in Old Church Road and had a wife and family, three of his children contracted the disease within a month. On April 1st a case occurred at Freeman's Cottages, Old Church Road, and as this patient worked at Bright & May's sweetmeat manufactory in the same locality, I made a careful enquiry from all the employees as to whether there was any case of sickness in their homes, and ascertained that the daughter of the landlady of one of them was not well but nothing more definite than this, I visited the house and found she was and had been treated for three weeks by a local doctor for Chicken Pox, but there is not the slightest doubt that it was a case of Small Pox from the first. I traced no less than sixteen cases from this source of infection, all of which occurred in Old Church Road and Heath Street, and which in my opinion owe their origin to this mistaken diagnosis. The Inspectors and myself at once made a house to house inspection of all the houses in Heath Street and Old Church Road to ascertain their sanitary condition and remedy the same, and also with a view of ascertaining if there were any other cases of this disease that had not been notified to me; we found one case, that of a young person, although the mother denied that anyone was ill in the house she subsequently admitted that her daughter was not well, I was allowed to see her and at once saw that she was suffering from 11 Small Pox, she was not under any medical supervision and two of her sisters were occupying the same bedroom at night and in the daytime were at business in the City. After some difficulty the patient was removed to the hospital and the house disinfected. I feel sure, had not energetic measures been adopted in this locality there would have been a much more serious epidemic. A number of other cases that occurred in our district were casuals coming from various parts of the country and other districts in London. In addition to those named we had six cases that there was no question to their having brought the disease from other localities, the remainder of the cases were not confined to one particular part of the Hamlet, but occurred in sporadic form all over the district. Each case was visited and special precautions were taken in each instance to prevent as far as possible the further spread of the disease. Out of the 116 cases 100 were removed to the hospital ships. We may fairly claim that the various precautions that were taken were the means of checking its spread, as with the exception of the Old Church Road cases the disease never assumed epidemic form, and I venture to say that had we been made aware in the first instance of the persons that were treated as Chicken Pox but which I have previously stated were Small Pox a number of the subsequent cases would never have occurred. I endeavoured to ascertain in each particular instance if vaccination had been carried out; where the patients were children, I had not much difficulty but with regard to the adults the information was not at all reliable. In the thirty-five cases under twelve years I found that twenty of these were unvaccinated, ten were vaccinated, and five there was some doubt about. The mortality from this disease was very small, and no doubt was due in the first instance to the majority of the cases being of a mild character, and also to the perfect isolation and treatment they received at the Asylums Board Hospital. Out of 116 persons who contracted the disease there were only eight deaths, five of which were unvaccinated. SCARLET FEVER. As will be seen by the Charts this disease was very prevalent during the whole of the year, the cause of this in a great measure being, that in a large majority of the cases the disease was of such a mild type that proper isolation was not practised for sufficiently long periods, and so the children who had partially recovered were allowed to mix with the rest of the family; in all the cases brought to our knowledge means was taken to insure isolation, and as will be seen from another part of this report a large number of them were removed to the Asylums Board Hospitals; the epidemic was not confined to our own 12 district but was very prevalent all over the Metropolis; and so acute did it become at one period that the Hospitals were taxed to their utmost, and could not admit all the cases that required removal; we had as many as a dozen cases waiting for days and they had in some instances to share the living and bedrooms with the healthy members of the same family. Seeing that we had 1,199 cases notified during the year and only 42 deaths shows the mild nature of the epidemic. In every case a notice was served on the householders calling their attention to the provisions of the Public Health Act relating to Infectious Diseases, and providing them with Postal Cards to notify to me when the patient was so far recovered as to enable disinfection to be carried out. In each case an inspection of the premises was made and the various School Authorities notified of the disease. TYPHOID FEVER. During the past year we have had 152 cases of this disease notified to us, it did not appear in an epidemic form, and was not confined to any particular part of our Hamlet. In all the cases the house drains were tested 35 of which were found to be defective, last year we had 78 cases notified and the year previous 101 cases, so that this year there is a marked increase. The fact that so many of the drains were found to be defective leads us to infer that defective drainage plays a very important part in the dissemination of this disease; where a number of houses are connected with the same drain (combined drainage) as they are to a large extent in our district, it may readily be supposed that where these drains are found to be defective, the fact of the excrete from Typhoid patients being carried away through them, that the germs of this disease are disseminated in this manner; it is therefore a matter of the greatest moment that the drainage of houses should be as sound as possible, and although the fact of ascertaining the drainage of the houses connected with the 35 cases was defective, and remedying the same, does not benefit the patients, it however for the future Prevents the escape of sewer gas into the houses which is well known to be a fertile source through which disease of this character spreads. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of this disease notified to me during the past year was 356, of which 77 were removed to Isolation Hospitals. I have strong reason to believe that a number of these cases were not true Diphtheria but what are termed Diphtheritic sore throat, which may mean anything between simple congestion and ulcerative tonsillitis; since the Notification Act came into operation the number of cases of this disease has rapidly increased and it is difficult to form a true estimate as to its reality in our district. The number of deaths registered from this disease was 71. In order however to be on the safe side Chart Shewing Week by Week the Number of Cases of Small Pox & Scarlet Fever. Notified by Medical Practilioners as having occurred in the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town during the Year 1893.

DIPTHERIA TYPHOID FEVER 13 every precaution was taken as regards isolation, disinfection, etc., and the houses were examined by the Sanitary Inspectors; where there was found to be children in the house attending school, notices were sent on to the various School Authorities notifying them of the existence of the disease; the drainage also of every house was tested with the smoke test and out of the 356, 96 were found to be defective; in all of these notices were served on the owners, and the drains made sound under the direct superintendence of the Sanitary Inspectors. CHOLERA. We have escaped another year without any ravages being made by this much dreaded disease. It shewed itself in the middle of the year at various seaports in the North of England, where a number of fatal cases occurred; and in London a number of suspicious cases were notified to the various Authorities but only four of them were found to be Cholera, all of which died; one in Westminster, one in Fulham, one in Lambeth, one in Southwark. In August we had a number of deaths recorded from Choleraic Diarrhœa in our district, but after investigating them I found that in all the cases their nomenclature would have been more accurate if the Choleraic had been left out. In June last we received a circular letter from the Local Government Board the substance of which was to be informed if we were prepared to take the necessary steps to combat with the disease should an epidemic break out in our district, and my reply to that was "that the action taken last year by the Vestry together with what could be taken at a very short notice would enable us to adopt all necessary precautions and to carry out the regulations of the Board without delay." The Asylums Board made provision for a large number of cases both at their own Hospitals and other Institutions in the Metropolis should the necessity occur, and arranged to have litters deposited, one or more in every district for the removal of cases, but happily we did not require them. I feel sure that should we in the near future find Cholera in our midst, the inhabitants of every district in London are all so alive to the necessity of taking active measures to battle with the disease that we, the Sanitary Officers would be able to enlist their cooperation, which would be a great help in dealing with a difficult and dangerous problem.

During the past year the work carried out by the Public Health Department has been very considerable, and a great deal of it is of a lasting character, the systematic house to house inspection has been going on with the result that during the last two years a very large part of the district has been inspected and the houses of some thousands have been placed in a better sanitary condition than formerly; it is to be hoped that all this will tend to elevate the masses and give them more self-respect and also more respect for the houses they occupy, as in some parts of our district it is deplorable to see the havoc that is made with the interior of the houses that have perhaps a few months previously been placed in a good state of repair. Particular attention has been paid to house drainage, during the past year a large amount of drainage work has been carried out in the most approved manner, both as regards combined and separate systems of drainage ; ventilating shafts and air chambers have been constructed and proper intercepting traps placed between the drains and the sewer; this work which it is to be hoped will be of a practically permanent character has entailed a great deal of supervision by the Inspectors, as it has been found necessary to see the work repeatedly before completion. In many cases owners were slow to carry out the requirements of the Vestry in the manner indicated above, yet eventually they will reap the benefit, and the occupants of the houses will be insured against breathing sewer gas which they were found to be doing much to their detriment in numerous instances. As will be seen in another part of my Report the inspection of workshops and that of the houses of outworkers have been carried out more systematically during the past year. The houses let in lodgings of which we have several streets in the West and Centre Wards have been systematically visited and the number of occupants taken and measures have been adopted to prevent overcrowding and also to keep these houses habitable, the class of tenants are those of our lowest type and so these dwellings need much extra supervision. The detailed Report of the Inspectors will give some idea of the work accomplished, and to be able to present such a Report will shew that they have carried out their part of the work with both industry and perseverance, and whilst in no case have they been unnecessarily severe upon owners of property they have always had the health of the public in view. In a number of cases where nuisances have not been abated as per the Vestry's order, after giving every latitude, as the dates in the Table of Proceedings will show, it has been found necessary to take proceedings against the owners of the property, and in every case either the work has been completed before the 21 hearing of the summons, or the order of the magistrate was obtained and then the work was completed later. A flagrant case was found out by the Inspector Mr. Lyon of the botching builder, who had so repaired a drain that it allowed the sewer gas to enter the house and so became a danger to the occupants. It appears that the owner, a woman had given the man carte blanche to do what was necessary, and he had scamped the work, and I regret to say that two cases of Typhoid Fever occurred in the house a short time after. The Public Health Act expressly provides by section 42 that any watercloset or drain so repaired in such a manner as to be a nuisance the person who executed the work shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £20. The matter was reported to the Vestry and proceedings ordered to be taken, this was done and after several adjournments the man was fined £5 or fourteen days imprisonment. I have no doubt this prosecution will have a salutary effect amongst this class of persons, as it is men like these who style themselves anything between a builder and sanitary engineer that cause so much trouble to the sanitary officers, and such needless and useless expense to the inexperienced houseowner. OVERCROWDING. We have and always shall have, a certain amount of overcrowding in our thickly populated district, and it is one of those evils we find very difficult to remedy; in that part of our Hamlet known as the West Ward it is supposed to exist in an acute form, a large number of the population consisting of foreign Jews who have but little regard for sanitation. In order to make an attempt to grapple with this matter in July last the Sanitary Inspector Mr. Twaits applied for and obtained a number of Warrants to enter the houses we most suspected, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., it being useless to visit these houses in the daytime for the purpose of detecting overcrowding. On July 27th, accompanied by the Inspector I visited a number of houses about midnight in Plumbers Row and Yalford Street; before an entry could be made into all the rooms the assistance of the police had to be obtained; although we found nearly every room in these houses occupied as sleeping rooms, in a very few was overcrowding apparent, after allowing 300 cubic feet for each person according to the standard adopted by the Local Government Board. It was only in a very small proportion of the houses visited, that it was necessary to serve abatement orders; it therefore seems to me that we had overestimated the amount of overcrowding in this locality, and if it does not occur here to any extent, we can be quite sure that this evil does not exist in other parts of the Hamlet to any appreciable degree. We frequently have complaints sent to us from various sources of supposed overcrowding, but on measuring the rooms we generally find they have sufficient cubical air space. 22 HOUSE OF SHELTER for persons who are temporarily displaced during disinfection of their premises after infectious disease. The Public Health Act by section 60 makes it incumbent on Local Authorities to provide a place for the accommodation of members of any families who are compelled to leave their homes whilst disinfection is carried out after infectious disease; the necessity for this in our own district has arisen from time to time since the passing of the Act, but on April 10th last whilst Small Pox was so rife the necessity of this became so urgent that I caused the Sanitary Committee to be specially summoned when I read the following report: — Gentlemen, I have deemed it advisable to specially summon you to-day in order to consider the desirability of providing as soon as possible temporary shelter for the people who are displaced from their rooms whilst disinfection is being carried out. Several cases have recently occurred where the people have had to seek shelter from neighbours, and in one case they had to walk about the street whilst disinfection was carried out. This is very undesirable and dangerous, and if we are to stamp out the present epidemic of Small Pox in our midst every means must be at once taken to do so, and in order to facilitate this a Shelter ought to be found with the necessary attendants. You may remember I have on previous occasions brought this matter before you, but now the necessity has actually arisen and I recommend you to reconsider the matter. I am, Gentlemen, Yours, &c., T. TAYLOR. The Committee at once surveyed several houses and gave instructions that one of them should be taken and the necessary furniture provided; this was done, and before the alterations were completed we were obliged to lodge two families for two days who had to have their houses disinfected after Small Pox ; the Shelter has been of great service since then and a number of families have and are from time to time being lodged temporarily generally for about twenty-four hours, the attendants are a man in the employ of the Vestry with his wife and up to the present they have given every satisfaction, and those persons who have been obliged to come there have expressed themselves gratified for the privilege. UNDERGROUND DWELLINGS. A very large proportion of these dwellings are situated in the West Ward; about two years ago we took proceedings against the occupiers of a number of them, when it was found that the law was very defective in regard to these places; it was held that some members of a family might occupy these rooms with impunity providing the parents also rented another room above ground in the same house, and so we failed to establish the cases. lam afraid until it is enacted that the fact 23 of finding people occupying these dwellings as sleeping apartments, shall constitute separate occupation, we shall not get to the root of this matter; during the past year however in a number of cases people have been found to be occupying these underground dwellings, and notices have been served which have had the effect of abating the evil in all the cases which came to our knowledge. WORKSHOPS. In my last year's Report I mentioned the fact that the duty of inspecting Workshops had been transferred from the Factory Inspector to the Local Authorities, and that we were at that time endeavouring to carry out the duties entrusted to us; since then great progress has been made as regards discovering the location of most of the Workshops in our district; and also in organizing systematic inspections and in keeping a record of work done in connection therewith; as will be seen by the detailed report, the major portion of them are in the West Ward district for which Mr. Twaits is the Inspector. The objects of inspection are, viz.: (1) seeing that all Workshops are kept in a cleanly state, (2) the detection of overcrowding, (3) the provision of suitable sanitary conveniences for both sexes. The whole of the Workshops on our register is now over 200, and they have been inspected twice during the past year, in a number of instances various orders for cleansing and the abatement of overcrowding, &c., have been enforced. The particulars of such works are set out in the list of Workshops annexed, which will also be found to contain details of the position of the various Workshops and the number of persons each will accommodate allowing 250 cubic feet for each person, and also the trade carried 011 by the occupier. In addition to the half-yearly inspections many of the Workshops have had to be inspected on numerous occasions other than those set out in detail in the tables, principally with a view to detect and prevent overcrowding and also to enforce the Vestry's orders relating to cleansing, etc. In the early part of this year a printed report was sent to the various Authorities, and also to the Press, from the Medical Officer of the London County Council, upon a number of Workshops in various districts in the East of London which had been inspected by his assistant. A list of the Workshops inspected in this district was also forwarded to us. On going into the report I found that as regards our own district it only related to 40 out of the 200 which we have under periodical inspection, and these were of the worst type being in some cases merely a back room at the top of a house. The workshops mentioned in the report were immediately visited by the Inspector and myself, with the result that we found at this time the over- 24 crowding was much less than that stated in the report. As a matter of fact under 10 per cent, of these Workshops were found to be overcrowded at the time of our visits, whereas the report stated that 61 per cent, were overcrowded. I maintain that to get a reliable estimate of the condition of the Workshops in any district, the greatest number possible should be inspected and these at intervals, in order to formulate statistics, it being a well proved fact that statistics based on small numbers are unreliable. During the past year a separate office has been created by the Secretary of State, viz.: that of Inspector of Workshops, together with the appointment of a number of Assistant Inspectors, whose chief duties are the carrying out of the Factory and Workshops Act, so far as relates to seeing that proper records are kept of overtime made by the employees, preventing employers from working young persons too many hours per week, and seeing that the necessary forms are posted up in the Workshops, etc., during these visits when the Inspectors observe any insanitary condition such as overcrowding, etc., reports of these are sent on to me by the Chief Inspector. I have received a number of such reports during the past year, most of which were already receiving our attention, the remainder, which did not relate to such trivial complaints as accumulations of dust, the Workshops were immediately inspected, and the matters reported to the Vestry and subsequently dealt with. I might point out here that the machinery we have under the Public Health Act is much more cumbersome than that possessed by the Inspectors under the Factory and Workshops Act; whilst we have to first send an intimation then wait for the Vestry's order and after this give a certain latitude for nuisances to be abated, whereas the Inspector under the latter Act takes proceedings at once, if a breach of this Act is detected. When in the course of our inspection of Workshops we find a child, young person, or women employed in a Workshop H.M. Inspector of Workshops is immediately notified of the fact as per section 27 of the Public Health Act. We have endeavoured during the past year to work in harmony with the department concerned, and I feel sure by doing so the community at large have benefited. Out of a number of cases of overcrowding dealt with it was only found necessary to take legal proceedings in one case, and that was a gross case of overcrowding in a Workshop in New Road, the owner was allowed every latitude to abate the evil but it was found necessary to enforce the Act, a Summons was therefore taken out and the magistrate made an order to abate the overcrowding and fined the owner £3.

In my last Annual Report I drew your attention to the fact that an order had been made by the Local Government Board in November, 1891, by which employers of labour who employ persons in making at their own homes wearing apparel, cabinet furniture, upholsterers' work, and the manufacture of electro-plate and files, that it was their duty to keep a list of such employees, and that these lists must be open to our inspection, and the order further requested that the homes of these outworkers should be frequently visited, with a view to their workrooms, being kept in a sanitary condition. In the early part of this year I addressed a circular letter to all employers of labour of this description in our district, drawing their attention to this order, and requesting to be informed of the homes of these outworkers; most of them responded, and we were thus placed in possession of something like 620 addresses where work was being done at their homes, they were scattered in various parts of our district as well as the adjoining parishes, the addresses of the latter with their employers were sent on to the various District Boards; in our own area there were 377 different outworkers' homes all of which were visited and in almost all cases the workrooms were found to be in a cleanly condition ; where sanitary defects were discovered notices were served and the nuisances remedied. This work of inspection took up a considerable amount of time of the Inspectors. One may regard this work as serving a very useful purpose to the community at large, as it ensures their wearing apparel being made in cleanly and properly ventilated workrooms, and in the event of infectious diseases taking place in these houses we are enabled to communicate the fact directly to the employers, and so proper precautions can be taken before the clothing is either sent to the shop or sold to the public, during the last year numerous instances of this has occurred; in one case the outworker had some hundreds of coats stored on the same premises where a case of Scarlet Fever had occurred. I find that we are one of a very few of the authorities that have made any attempt to grapple with this work; this is to be regretted, as we know that unless it is undertaken all over London their must necessarily be many hundreds of houses in every district that escape observation, as where work is given out by employers outside the area of one's district to employees inside the district, it is impossible for us to become aware of their existence unless all the local authorities carry out the order of the Board in a like manner. It is thought by some that work of this magnitude ought to be carried out by a central body which would co-operate with the local authorities ; with this I agree, as unless we have a considerable increase in the staff of Inspectors the order cannot be carried out in its entirety. In our own district with only one year's experience I find that it involves a large amount of extra work, and these outworkers' homes will 42 not be able to be visited as frequently as one could wish and at the same time keep up the regular work of our department. I am at the present time having our last year's list revised as outworkers of the class in our district are constantly moving from one part to another. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. Under section 30 of the above Act I have made sixty-four representations to the Sanitary Committee of houses that were found to be in my opinion unfit for human habitation, the Sanitary Committee having had the power delegated to them by the Vestry to take all proceedings under this Act, with the exception of those requiring the Seal of the Vestry, so that it is only through this Report that the Vestry is made aware of the proceedings that are taken from time to time. It will be seen by the Table annexed we have been obliged to apply for Closing Orders on a number of houses that were not rendered fit for habitation. In dealing with houses under this Act we find that we are able to get the work done more thoroughly than by any other means as the provisions are very stringent, no half measures are of any avail, the owners must either make the premises fit for human habitation or else have them closed. I have not thought it necessary to report any area under the Act as an insanitary one during the past year. I hoped that before this something would be done with the Knott Street area, to which I have called attention in past Reports, but as it appeared that the Vestry would probably have to pay all the cost of this improvement the matter has been deferred. I think if the worst part of the area referred to, viz.: Lomas Buildings were dealt with, we should get rid of one of the worst blots we have in the Hamlet. I have brought the matter repeatedly before the Sanitary Committee and at the present time details are in course of preparation with a view of a scheme being submitted to the Vestry. I may say with reference to these buildings that all the houses have been dealt with either under the Public Health Act or the Housing of the Working Classes Act repeatedly, and yet in spite of this owing to their situation, their structural condition, their surroundings, and the habits of the tenants, this area is still in an insanitary condition, which in my opinion there is only one course to deal effectually with it and that is demolition of the present buildings.

During the past year the Vestry has made Bye-Laws relating to the cleansing of cisterns, waterclosets, &c., they are drafted on the lines of the Model Bye-Laws of the Local Government Board and have received the sanction of that body, and they are now in operation. Bye-Laws have also been made by the London County Council under the Public Health Act, 1891, which apply to the whole of London, these are now operative having been sanctioned by the Local Government Board ; they are of a very stringent character and relate to such matters as the removal of manure, dust, offal, etc., and prescribe the kind and size of the receptacle to be used, also to waterclosets, soilpipes and the proper accessories in connexion with buildings. It is the duty of Local Authorities to enforce these Bye-Laws, and in our district we are endeavouring to have them carried out. In the case of the receptacles for manure now used both by horsekeepers and cowkeepers there is scarcely one of them that comply with the regulations ; we shall however have little difficulty in getting the latter to amend their present receptacles so as to comply with the requirements, as all cowkeepers are obliged to have their licenses renewed annually, and it may be taken for granted that unless they carry out the Bye-Laws by that time the Council will not renew the licenses. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. The question of the efficient ventilation of the great drainage channels in our district is one of no slight importance, and although we cannot positively say to what extent the present system plays on the health of its teeming thousands we may readily assume that it is not conducive to their welfare, and many cases of sceptic sore throat, etc., no doubt owe their origin to this very crude way of simply allowing the gases to escape in the middle of our crowded thoroughfares ; where the roadways are wide the danger is much less than in our narrow streets, owing to the gases being diluted with fresh air and being in the centre of the roadway have less liability of being an offence to foot passengers and of gaining an entrance to houses; but in our narrow streets some better mode ought to be adopted, such as carrying ventilating shafts up the gable ends of houses or factories and sufficiently high to enable the gases to mix freely with pure air ; in a number of our sewer ventilators we have an apparatus fixed for the gases to pass through a chamber before coming into the open air, at the present time experiments are being carried out to test its efficacy as a disinfecting as well as a deodorising agent, which if it proves all we hope it will, I shall feel it my duty to recommend its use all over the Hamlet. Another danger of ventilation of the sewers into the open air is by inefficient trapping of street gullies, and this is by far the 47 most danger to the passenger traffic, situated as they are close to the kerbstone, and when the air in the sewers becomes warmer than the surrounding atmosphere then an inefficient gully trap acts as a ventilator from the sewer and so the passenger traffic gets the full benefit as many can testifiy. During this last year my attention has repeatedly been called to the smells from our gullies, in fact in many cases during the hot weather householders often placed sacks or other covering over the gratings; we used powerful disinfectants to prevent the decomposition of the solid matter repeatedly, and this checked the smell to a small extent, but after going into the matter and inspecting a large number of our gullies I am convinced that the stench arises mainly from the imperfect trapping of the same, the trap principally used is what is called a flap trap and consists of a flap of iron that allows the water to go to the sewer and prevents its return, for this purpose and also preventing vermin from coming from the sewers it acts well, but for preventing the escape of sewer gas from the sewers it is useless, and 110 trap can, without having a quantity of water to act as a seal between the air in the sewer and the open air, be said to be effective ; when one sees as I have done in numbers of instances this flap of iron propped open by bits of wood, paper, etc., that have accidentally been swept into the gullies, one need say little more to show the cause of the offensive smells given off from these gratings. With a view of ascertaining the kind of gullies used in other Metropolitan Parishes I addressed a circular letter to 25 other districts and had 19 replies 15 stating that traps having a water seal was now being used in their district whilst two only were using the same kind that we were ; I reported the matter to the Sanitary Committee and they have inspected several kinds of gully traps having the proper water seal and several of these have been laid down with a view to try which acts the best, and I trust it may not be long before means are taken to replace all the old ones now in use and substitute others of more modern construction. This, gentlemen, is a matter which plays a very important part in the healthiness of any district as common sense tells us that in crowded districts like our own we can well do without noxious gases emanating from openings that are connected with our sewers. COW-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. The owners of these premises are licensed by the County Council annually, and before the day of application duplicate copies of application are sent on to the various Local Authorities and it is the duty of such Authorities to ascertain the sanitary condition of these buildings. The Sanitary Inspectors and myself have visited the whole of them and we found them generally to be kept in a cleanly condition, the receptacles for 48 the manure left much to be desired, but probably during the year 1894 all these will be remedied according to the Bye-Laws. It was not found to be necessary to oppose any of the licenses being granted. I have now given you a resume of the work carried out under my direction during the past twelve months which I trust will be appreciated by all the Members of the Board; I hope the good feeling which has hitherto existed between the Board and myself may continue, and with your co-operation in the future as in past years our Health Department may by its work go on improving the sanitary condition of the district, and so add to the comfort and longevity of the inhabitants of Mile End Old Town. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health.
