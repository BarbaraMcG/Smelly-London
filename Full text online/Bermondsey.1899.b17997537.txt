Man Inidag Bermandas ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Vestry of Bermondsey:— Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen. I have the honour of submitting my Twentyfourth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the parish of Bermondsey. The period included is one of 52 weeks, beginning on the 1st day of January, and ending on the 30th day of December, 1899. The births were 27 less, and the deaths 261 more than the numbers recorded in 1898. The prevalent diseases of the zymotic class were diphtheria, summer diarrhœa and measles, all of which were attended by an increased mortality, especially among young children. Whooping cough was less fatal. One death was attributed to typhus. Prompt and vigorous action was taken to prevent the spread of this very infectious disease, with the result that it was limited to the family in which it first appeared; in which, however, no less than seven persons were affected. Diseases of the respiratory organs, those of the tubercular order, and affections of the brain and nervous system, all caused more deaths than in the previous year. The number of deaths of parishioners occurring in hospitals, asylums, and other outlying public institutions further increased from 503 to 534. Assuming that the population has increased at the same rate as it did in the five years preceding the Census in 1896, the estimate for the year is 85,951 persons, but this is probably an underestimate, as the ground which was formerly occupied by a number of small houses is now covered by large blocks of artizans' dwellings, which provide superior accommodation for a vastly increased number of persons. BIRTHS. The number of births registered in the parish during the year was 3,063, which is 27 below the number in 1898. The total births are now 600 fewer than they were 24 years ago. The excess of births over deaths was 1,000, The annual birth-rate was 35.6 per thousand of of the estimated population. The London birthrate was 29.4, which is the lowest on record. The number of children born in the first quarter of the year was 842 ; in the second quarter, 727; in the third, 739; and in the last quarter, 755. In the first quarter alone there was a slight increase, while in each of the other quarters a reduced number of births took place. DEATHS. The deaths registered in the parish during the year, numbered 1,529, being 261 more than in the previous year. The number of deaths of parishioners in outlying public institutions was 534, being an increase of 31. The total deaths were therefore 2,063. The death-rate before distribution of the hospital deaths was 17.9, and after such distribution 24.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. The London death-rate was 19.8; that of males being 21.5, and that of females 18.2. The number of deaths in the parish during the first quarter of the year was 392 ; in the second quarter, 307; in the third, 401 ; and in the last quarter, 429. Compared with the previous year there was an increase in each quarter. The number of deaths of children under one year of age, inclusive of deaths in hospitals, was 574. The proportion of these deaths to 1,000 registered births was 187. The like infantile deathrate in London was 167. This is a much higher rate than the mean of ten previous years. This rate is very much influenced by the greater or less prevalence of summer diarrhœa, which is excessively fatal to infants. The occurrence of diarrhœa, in an epidemic form, seems to depend in a great measure on the temperature of the air at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, and especially on the temperature being much in excess of the average for several days in succession. CAUSES OF DEATH. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 296 deaths against 258 in the previous year: 371 in 1897, 328 in 1896, and 270 in 1895. The deaths from zymotic diseases were 14.4 per cent. of the total deaths from all causes, and equalled a death-rate of 3.4 per thousand inhabitants. Inclusive of hospital cases there were 68 deaths from measles, 10 from scarlet fever, 88 from diphtheria, 29 from whooping cough, 1 from typhus, 18 from enteric fever, and 82 from diarrhæa. One death of a child was certified as "cholera." It was probably a rapidly fatal case of zymotic diarrhœa. The total number of deaths from diarrhœa exceeds that here given, as many of them are certified as due to enteritis, mucoenteritis, gastro-enteritis, &c. The death-rates from zymotic diseases were :—measles, 0.79 ; scarlet fever, 0.12; diphtheria, 1.03; whooping cough, 0 34; fever, 0.01 ; and diarrhœa, 0.96. Cases of diphtheria have not been traced to any defective sanitary condition of houses. I am inclined to think that the use of the same cup at drinking fountains may be a means of spreading the disease among children. Diseases of the septic class caused 28 deaths. Four were referred to congenital syphilis, 4 to erysipelas, 2 to carbuncle, 2 to gangrene, and 16 to other forms of septic disease, mostly in hospital cases. Alcoholism caused 11 deaths; but there were many others in which the deaths were indirectly due to this cause. In the constitutional class there were 7 deaths from rheumatism, 8 from rickets, and 66 from cancer. The deaths from cancer in the previous year were 60 ; in 1897, 65 ; in 1896, 58 ; in 1895, 50; in 1594, 42 ; and in 1893, 37. Of the deaths from cancer 33 took place in the parish, and 33 in hospitals. There were 9 deaths between the ages of 25 and 45 years, and 57 between 45 and 85 years of age. In the tubercular order there were 289 deaths, or 14.0 per cent. of the total. In the previous year these deaths numbered 274; in 1897, 278; in 1896, 266; and in 1895, 297. These deaths included 21 from tabes mesenterica, 58 from meningitis, 174 from phthisis, and 36 from general tuberculosis. The phthisis death-rate in Bermondsey before distribution of the hospital cases was 1.24, but after such distribution, 2.14. In the developmental class 164 deaths were registered. They included premature birth 66, atelectasis 2, congenital malformations 8, and old age 88. Of the latter, 12 died at ages exceeding 85 years. There is a very considerable increase in the number of deaths ascribed to premature birth. Of the local diseases the largest and most important division is that of the respiratory system. Bronchitis caused 218 deaths, and pneumonia 207. The total deaths numbered 449, being an increase of 13 above those of 1898. They equalled 21.5 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, and a deathrate of 5.1. From diseases of the brain and nervous system there were 184 deaths, being 24 more than in the previous year. Apoplexy caused 68 deaths, paralysis 14, epilepsy 9, convulsions 47, and brain diseases, insanity, &c., 46. Diseases of the heart and circulatory organs accounted for 149 deaths, being an increase of 18. They formed 7.2 per cent. of the whole, and equalled a death-rate of 1.8. Diseases of the digestive organs contributed 74 deaths to the general mortality. Nineteen deaths were referred to dentition and 46 to gastro-enteritis. From diseases of the liver, &c., there were 23 deaths; from those of the kidney and urinary organs 37, and from diabetes 3. The various forms of wasting disease included 51 from marasmus, 40 from inanition of infants, and 27 from debility, mostly congenital. One death, in which a verdict of "starvation" was recorded by the coroner, appears to have arisen from ignorance and improper treatment on the part of the mother "without felonious intent". From violence there were 84 deaths, of which 73 arose from accidents, and 8 were cases of suicide. The accidents included 28 of fractures and contusions, 14 of burns and scalds, and 19 of suffocation. The suicides were 3 by poison, 3 by hanging, 1 by drowning, and 1 by cut throat. The number of inquests held in the parish was 141, being an increase of 39 above those in 1898. The uncertified deaths numbered 46, being 9 more than in the previous year. The majority were infants who died shortly after birth. I have no reason to believe that if an inquest had been held on these cases any further information would have been afforded as to the cause of death. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year 1,150 certificates were received from medical men under the Public Health Act. In the previous year I received 868 such certificates; in 1897,922; in 1896,857; and in 1895, 610. The notifications included 398 cases of scarlet fever, 544 of diphtheria, 91 of erysipelas, 102 of enteric fever, 7 of typhus, 3 of puerperal fever, and 5 of membranous croup. The total number is an increase of 282. In the first quarter of the year there were 201 notices; in the second, 223; in the third, 367; and in the fourth, 359. The number of houses in which the existence of a dangerous infectious disease was reported was 1,046, being an increase of 157 over those of last year. The premises were inspected, cleansed and disinfected with the least possible delay. Every effort was made to obtain the prompt removal of patients to hospitals. The number of persons so removed was 874, being 148 more than in the previous year, and 373 more than in 1896. Infected articles of bedding and clothing were disinfected in the hot air chamber provided by the Vestry. The number of lots so treated was 929, being an increase of 172. TYPHUS. Typhus is fortunately a rare disease. Many medical men have never seen a case of it. On Jan. 30th, a young man, residing in Minto Street, died at King's College Hospital. The cause of death was certified as "septic absorptim from bowel." The body was brought home to the house in Minto Street, and the bandages in which it had been enveloped were removed by the mother. Within a fortnight the mother, a brother of the deceased, and a lodger in the house were admitted into Guy's Hospital and reported to be suffering from typhoid fever. The father of the deceased was next admitted. It was then decided that the cases should be regarded as cases of "typhus". Steps were immediately taken to arrest the progress of the disease. With the consent of the owner, the house was cleared of its inhabitants, thoroughly disinfected, and kept unoccupied for a month. Bedding and all possibly infected articles of clothing were destroyed. The late inmates of the house were kept under observation, and desired to abstain from following their respective employments for a time. Three other cases subsequently occurred among the members of the same family but there was no spread of the disease. The cost to the Vestry was as follows: Compensation for destruction of bedding and clothing, £18 2s. 11d., cost of stripping and cleansing rooms, £7 12s. 10d., compensation for loss of wages, &c., £7 10s. 6d., total, £33 6s. 3d. As the extreme infectiveness of typhus is so well known, the result of the action taken by the Sanitary Committee must be regarded as eminently satisfactory. SANITARY WORK. The total number of houses and other premises inspected during the year ending Lady-day, 1900, was 4,513, against 5,222 in the previous year. The re-inspections numbered 10,564. The notices and intimations served for the execution of sanitary works were 2472. The number of houses in a dirty and dilapidated condition which were caused to be cleansed and repaired was 460. Four houses were closed as unfit for human habitation. Thirty-nine cases of overcrowding were abated. The number of dead bodies which were removed from rooms to the Parish Mortuary was 47. 136 Post-Mortems were made in the room provided for that purpose. The slaughter houses inspected numbered 5; the cow houses 6; and the bakehouses 80. Among the articles of food which were seized and destroyed as unfit for the food of man was an enormous quantity of fruit, intended for making preserves. This had become so decomposed by the extreme heat of the weather, and possibly through delay in transit, as to appear to your officers to be unwholesome and unfit for the purpose intended. I do not think any moral blame could be attached to the owners who had no doubt acted bona fide. I am not able to say the same with regard to 181 cases of condensed milk—containing about 7,000 tins—which were seized and condemned as unsound. In this case a heavy penalty, ,£78 fine, was inflicted. The other articles seized included pickled cabbage, haddocks, crabs, rabbits, potatoes, tomatoes and pig's livers. Thanking the Vestry, the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, and my fellow officers for the support and assistance I have received, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN DIXON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 133, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey.

As will be seen by the following list the Inspectors throughout the year have persevered with their house to house inspections, and I may perhaps be allowed to add, in my opinion this systematic inspection must have a beneficial effect in keeping the district in a sanitary condition, in discovering and remedying nuisances which are found to exist, and must tend to improve the health of the inhabitants. The house to house inspections were as follows: — Strathnairn Street Kipling Street Monnow Road Javen's Buildings New Place Neckinger Street Paulin Street Alice Street Fort Road Parker's Building's (twice) Royal Oak Yard Wood's Place Freda Street Cherry Garden Street Edmond's Place Trothy Road Tranton Road Ferrand Street Snowsfields Victoria Place Active Place Dix's Place Esmeralda Road Marigold Place White's Grounds Musk Court Hickman's Court Pleasant Row King's Arms Place Virginia Row George's Court Longley Street Garfield Terrace Russell Scott Buildings Porlock Place Elim Street Warford Place Lockyer Street Richardson Street (part of) Wolseley Buildings Woodlands Place Reverdy Road Frean Street Wright's Court Marigold Court Vauban Street Long Lane (part of) Southwark Park Road Willow Grove Dunlop Place Tower Bridge Buildings Turner's Retreat Queen's Place Joiner's Court Caroline Court Gutteridge Court The Grange (part of) Page's Walk Anthony Street Hanover Buildings Clove Place Flockton Steeet Rose Court Gedling Street Walker's Court Rothsay Street (part of) Spa Mansions London Street Fort Buildings Fort Passage Aberdour Street Leroy Street Pansey Place Alma Road West Lane Peabody Buildings Bantry Place James Place Clyde Buildings Union Place Balaclava Road FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS INSPECTED DURING THE YEAR.

The following registered houses have been pulled down:—6 and 8 Gedling Street, 34 Long Walk. The total number of houses now on the Register is 293. MEETINGS OF SANITARY COMMITTEE. The Sanitary and Public Health Committee held 17 meetings, and two Sub-Committees were appointed, one to view reception houses in the Metropolis, and the other to view Bacon's School and 11, Grange Road. SMOKE NUISANCES. Reports have been received of upwards of 147 cases where chimneys and shafts have been kept under observation. 93 A Notices, 1 Intimation and 1 Statutory Notice were served. It was not necessary to take any further proceedings. BAKEHOUSES. There are 80 Bakehouses in the Parish, 15 of which are at the present time unused. The whole of these have been inspected, and where necessary, notices have been served for cleansing, etc. One Bakehouse above-ground has been pulled down, and one erected above-ground. COW AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have from time to time been inspected. After certain requirements were complied with at two of the cow-houses no objections were offered to the renewal of any of the licences. TEMPORARY SHELTER. On the 5th February, 1900, the Vestry decided to provide a temporary shelter for the accommodation of persons displaced whilst their rooms were being disinfected in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act 1891, and land has been secured for the purpose near the Town Hall. The necessity for such a convenience has long been felt. During the year 82 families, including 101 adults and 132 children, were so displaced, in the majority of cases from model dwellings where the rooms communicate directly with each other, the whole family having to be turned out for the purpose of effectual disinfection. The Public Health Committee appointed a Sub-Committee which visited several shelters provided by other Vestries in the Metropolis, and considerable time and trouble was taken to suggest one of the most suitable design. In considering what accommodation is required it should be remembered that neither Rotherhithe nor St. Olave's have suitable shelters, and it would therefore be desirable to provide accommodation which would be sufficient for the requirements of the new Borough. UNWHOLESOME FOOD. In July last I seized large quantities of fruit in Rouel Road and Green Walk, which was intended for the manufacture of jam. The larger portion of the fruit came from Holland, and some raspberries were of English growth. The whole were unwholesome and quite unfit for human food, and were destroyed under a Magistrate's order. Proceedings were taken under the Public Health (London) Act, and with one exception penalties were inflicted. I am pleased to note that these seizures have had a beneficial effect upon the Growers, Dealers and Jam Manufacturers, greater care now being taken in the packing of the fruit, and improved supervision exercised in the selection of fruit used and in the manufacture of jam. I also seized, in November last, 156 cases of unwholesome condensed milk, which was stored in a dark railway arch in Rouel Road. The defendants contended the milk was intended for the manufacture of caramels. Proceedings were taken and penalties inflicted with costs. BILLS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE PARISH.
