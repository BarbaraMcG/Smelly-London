The Board during the year ended 31st March, 1884, obtained the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works to the following Loans:— £2500 advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the purpose of defraying the cost of Wood Paving Works in King Street West, from Shaftesbury Road to Young's Corner £950 advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for defraying part of the expense incurred by the Board in carrying out the improvements at the Western end of Grlenthorne Road. £900 advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for defraying part of the cost of carrying out the Improvement in Queen Street, Hammersmith. £2000 advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works for defraying part of the expenses incurred in carrying out certain Street Improvements in Dalling Road, Blyth Lane, Ann's Terrace, Crown Road, High Street Fulham, King Street West, (Vine), and for reconstructing Creek Bridge, Street Nomenclature. By Section 87 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, it becomes the duties of Vestries and District Boards to carry out the orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works for re-naming streets, abolishing subsidiary names, and re-numbering the houses, and in pursuance thereof the Board has carried out the orders of the Metropolitan Board for the following:— For abolishing the subsidiary names and re-numbering the houses in: Shepherd's Bush Road Queen's Road Brook Green (part of) St. Peter's Road Starch Green Road Chancellor's Road Bradmore Park Road Wharf Road Havelock Road Sterne Street Ceylon Road Askew Crescent Adelaide Road Wilton Road East Gay ford Road Wilton Road West Becklow Road Nasmyth Street Cobbold Road Church Road Great Church Lane Redmore Road Beavor Lane Victoria Road, now incorporated with Starch Green Road.

At the request of the Post Office Authorities, the Board has during the year, granted permission for the erection of Pillar Boxes upon the public path at the following places:— Brook Green—Removal to opposite corner. Corner of Shepherd's Bush Road, and Goldhawk Road. Poplar Grove. Paving of New Streets. Under the provisions of the 18 & 19, Victoria cap. 120, 25 & 26, Vic., cap. 102, the Board has during the year taken to the following "New Streets." HAMMERSMITH. EULHAM. Starch Green Road Clialdon Road Elorence Gardens Aspenlea Road Aldensley Road Effie Road Grove Mews Eelbrook Gardens Rivercourt Road Hetley Road. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. The Board in June 1883, re-appointed Mr. R H. Davies as Public Analyst for this District, and a Summary of the various articles of food submitted to him for analysis, with the result of the examination will be found annexed (see Appendix No. 68.) Cartage Scheme. The work of slopping and watering the roads, general cartage, and removal of dust, ashes, and domestic refuse, has been carried out during the past year under the direction of the Cartage Committee. The question of the disposal of the materials collected, is becoming more difficult yeary by year, in Hammersmith; at present, the "shoot" is upon the borders of Acton Parish, and the only "shoot" available in Eulham is at Wandsworth Bridge Road, near the River. The time is rapidly approaching when the Board must of necessity provide wharf premises, where the dust and domestic refuse and slop can be dealt with, or forthwith removed by barge. In July, 1883, it was deemed necessary that every possible precaution should be taken against the possible outbreak of epidemic disease, and it was ordered that there should be an immediate thorough removal of every sort of house refuse, and the Board further ordered that the dust and house refuse should be removed from the houses and premises in the district once in every week, for a period of about four months, and that each dust bin or ash pit be deodorised after the removal of the contents. The number of loads of dust removed, and the horses employed during the year was:— 22 Loads of dust Horses employed. removed, Fulham 9281. 2488. Hammersmith 14,027. 3989. The question of watering the roads on Sundays has again occupied the attention of the Committee, and information was obtained from the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, as to the practice adopted by them: after having received and considered the replies of the Vestries and District Boards, the Board decided not to water on Sundays. The only alteration in the Stud by casualty, sale, purchase, &c., that has has taken place during the year is:— One horse died frtm lockjaw. A post mortem examination was made with a view of endeavouring to ascertain the cause of the disease, but nothing definite was discovered. The total number of horses now in the Board's stables is 51 cart horses, and 3 nags, being an increase of 1 cart horse, and a decrease of 1 nag. The value of the cart horses as per Register, is £3677. The following shows the total consumption of fodder for the year:— Oats 1115 Quarters. Beans 27¼ „ Bran 527¾ Cwt. Linseed 2 Quarters. Clover 9711/12 Loads. Hay 491/ 9 „ Straw 1551/3 „ Mixture 18½ „ The total cost of the above was £2384 9s. 7d., being an average of 15s. 8d. and a fraction per week for each horse.

In The year 1882, the late Sir William Palliser made a proposal to construct a bridge over the District Railway to connect that portion of Fulham, known as the Baron's Court Estate, and the large tracts of building land adjacent thereto, with the main western road at Hammersmith, and the matter was duly considered by the Board, upon the application of Sir W. Palliser for a contribution towards the cost of the works. In consequence of the death of Sir W. Palliser the matter stood in abeyance for some considerable period, and it was not until March, 1883, that the subject again came before the Board. Messrs. Gibbs and Flew (limited), then applied to the Board, stating that they had taken the matter of the proposed bridge in hand, and were prepared to carry out the work, which would involve an expenditure of about £4000, and asking the Board to contribute towards that sum. The Board again carefully considered the matter, and seeing the great improvement that would be effected, and the vast importance the bridge will be to the best interests of the District, resolved to contribute the sum of £1600 towards the cost, provided that the Metropolitan Board of Works consented to contribute a moiety of that sum, and to grant a loan for the remainder. The Metropolitan Board ultimately resolved to contribute the sum of £800, and to grant the Board a loan for the remaining £800, and Messrs. Gibbs and Flew (limited), are now engaged in perfecting the necessary arrangements with the Railway Company. Wood Paving (Hard Wood Blocks.) The Board having had the track of the Tramway through King Street West paved with the creosoted hard wood paving determined to try an experiment as to the wear of the said paving, and have paved the whole surface of the carriage-way of that portion of the Broadway from the commencement of King Street West to the crossing opposite the " Sussex " Hotel, and between the entrance to Queen Street and the road leading to Hammersmith Station with the creosoted beech wood blocks, the result has been up to the present time very satisfactory. The old wood paving blocks that were taken up when the Tramway was constructed in King Street West, have been utilised for paving the other part of the Broadway, and some distance down Brook Green Road, thus greatly improving the carriage-ways. Bakehouses. Under the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Acts, 1878 and 1883, it has become the duty of the Board to inspect all the Bakehouses in the district, and to take proceedings against persons not complying with the requirements of the Acts. For the information and guidance of Bakers and others the Board has issued a notice as follows:— c 26 Board of Works for the Fulham District. Regulations for Bakehouses. Factory and Workshop Acta, 1878 and 1883. 41 Vic. c. 16, and 46 & 47 Vic. c. 53. 41 vic.c. 1.

By order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk, NICHOLAS CONSTANTINE COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. Imperial Road. Information having been received that the Gas Light and Coke Company were constructing camp sheathing works at the end of Imperial Road, which the Board considered would, when completed, cause an obstruction to the public highway, and prevent free access to the river. A notice was served upon the Company calling upon them to discontinue the works, which they however declined to do. The Solicitors were then instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain an injunction to restrain the Company from interfering in any way with the free access of the public to the River Thames. The AttorneyGeneral's fiat was obtained in due course, and certain further proceedings taken, when the Company opened negotiations for an arrangement of the matter, and stated their willingness to carry out the work in such a manner as not to create any obstruction or interfere in any way with the rights of the public. The Company submitted a plan shewing how this could be done, and the plan being considered satisfactory it was arranged that the work might be proceeded with, subject to the Company agreeing to conform to the plan, and to give up to the public the land reclaimed by their works from the river, so far as it extended across the end of the Imperial Road. The Board were saved a considerable expense by the Company thus undertaking the work which the Board would otherwise have had to do under the Thames River Prevention of Floods Act, 1879. Drinking Fountain, Fulham Road. An application was made to the Board, through the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, for permission to erect a very handsome Memorial Drinking Fountain, upon the footpath at the junction of Moor Park Road and Fulham Road, the whole of the cost to be borne by the donor, Mr. H. J. Veitch, the Board cordially granted permission for the erection of the fountain, and the thanks of the Board were conveyed to Mr. Yeitch. 28 New Sanitary Offices. In order to moot the requirements of the rapidly increasing work in the Sanitary Department, the Board has found it necessary to enlarge the office accommodation of Broadway House, and has a suite of offices for this department. The work was carried out by Mr. Bendon, of Hammersmith, under a contract for the sum of £332 5s. 4d. Line of thoroughfare from Uxbridge Road to Harrow Road. This thoroughfare, Wood Lane, and Scrubs Road, is now open for traffic. Certain parts of Scrubs Road have been widened and rendered more commodious for the traffic. The total cost of carrying out the works is £8250 18s. l1d. towards which the Board is entitled to receive certain contributions under the terms of the arrangement made with the Metropolitan Board of Works, and certain of the landowners whose property abuts upon the Road, the Board has in contemplation the further improvement of this highway, by the construction of a new bridge of the canal. Tablets on Lamps. On the application of the Metropolitan Board the Board granted permission to the Fire Brigade department to affix Glass Tablets in the street lamps, indicating the positions of the street fire plugs, and shewing the direction and distance of the nearest plug from the lamps. This has been done in order that there may be as little delay as possible in discovering the whereabouts of fire plugs in cases of fire. Recreation Grounds. In July, 1883, the Board received a letter from the Bishop of London offering to surrender to tho Board (subject to the consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners), the Meadow lying between tbe Palace Moat and the River, upon certain conditions, as to laying out and maintaining the space as a public recreation ground. The Board cordially accepted the Bishop's offer, and tho Metropolitan Board have been asked to accept and lay out the meadow as an open space, at tho cost of the Metropolis, and the matter is still under consideration by that Board. About the same time a communication was received from Mr. R. Pearce, transmitting copy of resolutions passed at a public meeting of tho Inhabitants of Fulham and Hammersmith, held at Beaufort House, Walham Green, and a deputation attended and presented a memorial, praying the Board to take steps for procuring a Public Park and Recreation Ground for the Inhabitants of the district. (See Parliamentary schemes.) Steam Rollers. The boilers of the Steam Rollers have been insured with the London Mutual Boiler Insurance Company, against accidents, in the sum of 29 £500 each, the premium being £3 per annum each boiler. This charge covers a periodical inspection and report upon the condition of the rollers. Thames Floods Works. Pursuant to the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act, 1879, the Metropolitan Board have served notices upon the Board to carry out the following works : Broomhouse Dock.—To raise summit of drawback to level of 18 feet above Ordnance datum. Steps, near Fulham Bridge.—To raise steps to same level, Fulham Dock.—To fix Strong Tide Gates at head of Draw Dock, Crab Tree Dock.—To fix strong Tide Gates at head of Draw Dock. Hammersmith Dock.—To fix strong Tide Gates at head of Draw Dock. The Mall (Opposite Cedar House), Parish Boundary.—To raise the road to a summit 18 feet above Ordnance datum, and form steps on either side with a gradient of 1 in 15. Steps, Hammersmith Terrace.—To raise steps to 18 feet above Ordnance datum. Broomhouse Embankment.—To raise a portion of Embankment to above level. Hammersmith Malls,—To raise River Wall to the above level. All the foregoing works, with the exception of the Hammersmith Malls, have been carried out, and tho latter works so far as the Board is liable are in progress. Projection, Great Church Lane Parochial Mission Room. The Board is unable at present to settle terms with the authorities for the removal of the iron railing projecting in front of the Parochial Mission Room in Great Church Lane, but it is hoped that somo arrangement may shortly be made, and this improvement carried out. Queen Street Improvement. The Board has been able to carry out the long contemplated improvement of Queen Street, Hammersmith—a faculty having been obtained from the Consistory Court of London, enabling the Vicar and Churchwardens to surrender a portion of thechurchyard for the purpose of widening the highway. When executing this work the Board also improved and paved the broad approach to the Church, leading from the Bridge Road, and the Board has in contemplation the further improvement of this line of thoroughfare, extending some distance along the Fulham Palace Road. Public Lamps. In May, 1883, the Board were paying the Brentford Gas Company at the rate of £4 15s. per lamp per annum, for supply and maintenance of columns and lantern, supply of gas, lighting, extinguishing, &c., each lamp burning at the rate of five cubic feet per hour for 4327 hours. Annually the charge for gas being at that time 3s. 9d. per 1000 feet= £4 1s.; add to this 18s. 6d. for lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, and repairs, makes a total of £4 19s. 6d as against £4 15s. charged. 30 In order to reduce the cost of public lighting the Board conferred with the Gas Company upon the subject, and ultimately it was resolved to rearrange the schedule of hours for lighting and extinguishing the street lamps, reducing the period of burning to 3635 hours 20 minutes per annum under this arrangement, and having regard to the general reduction in the price of gas at that period, from 3s. 9d. to 3s. 6d. per 1000 cubic feet, the company undertook the supply of lighting, extinguishing, cleansing, and repairing the 1079 ordinary lamps supplied by them at the rate of £4 2s. each per annum, as shewn below:— Lamp burning 3635 at 5 cubic feet per hour= £ s. d: 18,175 feet at 3s. 6d. per 1000 3 3 8 Add for lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, and repairs 0 18 6 £4 2 2 Thus lessening the expenditure for lighting by One Company alone by the sum of £507 18s. per aunum. Having completed the arrangements with the Brentford Gas Company, the Board negotiated with the other Companies supplying the district, viz., the Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Londou Gas Light Company (now amalgamated with the Gas Light and Coke Company) with the result that the same schedule of hours was agreed upon, and the price per lamp reduced by the Gas Light and Coke Company from £4 16s. 1d., and by tbe London Gas Company from £4 14s. 8d. to £3 10s. per annum in each case, reducing the payment to these companies yearly by £1134 12s. 6d.

The Board's requirements were stricty complied with by tho nurse, who was compensated for loss of time. Stamford Brook Road. Tho now road across Stamford Brook Common has boen constructed by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The Board has supplemented the improvement by purchasing a portion of the forecourts of Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, Stamford Brook Road, and 31(5, Gold Hawk Road, the fences of which will bo set back in a a line with the fence of the St. Mary's Church Grounds, thus forming a wide bold approach to the Stamford Brook Road from tho Gold Hawk Road. Walham Green Pump. The old pump at Walham Green has been removed. It had been in use for the last eight years, the water from the well being impregnated with sewage.

Nuisance at rear of Bradmore Lane. The Board in March, 1883, received a Memorial signed by many influential ratepayers, complaining of the nuisance and annoyance caused by a large wax work show, and other exhibitions, and caravans located on a piece of vacant land at the rear of Bradmore Buildings. There being no offence that could be dealt with under the provisions of the Nuisances' Removal Acts, or the Metropolis Local Management Acts, the Board communicated with the Police Authorities, and the various shows were removed. Shortly afterwards an itinerant menagerie, with the usual accompanimeut of other itinerant shows, settled upon the land, the owners and occupiers of the surrounding property were proceeding to apply to the High Court of Justice, for an injunction against the owner of the land in question, whereupon the shows were removed. In January, 1884, the Board, in conjunction with other Vestries and District Boards, adopted the following Memorial, which was forwarded to the Home Secretary:— TO THE EIGHT HONORABLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT. The Memorial of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal. Sheweth, That great nuisance and annoyance are frequently occasioned to the householders of the District of Fulham in consequence of itinerant showmen and others who reside in caravans and pay no rates, but move about from one part of London to another and occupy any vacant ground which appears to them available for the purpose of exhibiting thereon in Booths or Caravans, Exhibitions of a kind which attract large numbers of the lowest orders of the people, or for the purpose of erecting and setting up thereon large Swings and Wooden Horses set in motion by steam power, such as are seen at Fairs, the performances being usually accompanied by the music of a powerful organ often worked by steam, and the ground lit up by flaring oil lamps, the amusement of which is kept up to a late hour of the evening, often until midnight, creating a disturbance and nuisance exceedingly offensive to the neighbourhood. That the state of things described is not confined to the District of Fulham alone, but as your Memorialists are informed and believe occurs in many other Parishes within the Metropolitan area. That the Local Authorities of the Metropolis do not possess statutory powers to enable them to deal summarily with, or to control the holding of such exhibitions and amusements, so that the same may be carried on in a decent and orderly manner and without being a nuisance and annoyance to the neighbourhood. That attempts have been made from time to time by various local authorities before the magistrates sitting at the Metropolitan Police Courts, to deal with these cases on Sanitary (as well as on other) grounds 34 under the Nuisances Removal Acts, but in each instance as far as is within your Memorialists' knowledge, such attempts have failed for want of sufficient statutory powers. That it will be for the general benefit and welfare of a large portion of the Metropolitan Ratepayers that the local authorities should be empowered to deal summarily with cases of this description, in order that they may control the holding of such exhibitions and the erection of such swinge, &c., so as to prevent the nuisance now complained of. Your Memorialists therefore humbly pray, That you will be pleased to obtain powers in the next Session of Parliament enabling local authorities in the Metropolis to deal summarily with and exercise control over persons setting up shows or exhibitions, and carrying on such amusements as are above described, in localities where the same constitute a nuisance to the respectable householders who are at present unable to obtain redress except at a great personal cost. Sealed by Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 9th January, 1884. A similar Memorial was presented to the Home Secretary by a deputation of representatives from the several local authorities, and after hearing the deputation, the Home Secretary in reply, expressed himself decidedly unfavourable to the views of the deputation. He said he had often been asked why he did not prevent ragged little boys playing in the Green Park, where respectable people liked to walk, and did not like to see those dirty, noisy little boys. But, after all, the respectable people had plenty of places and opportunities of enjoying themselves, whereas these poor children had very few places, and he would therefore be sorry to restrict such healthy enjoyment or harmless entertainment as they could get. That was the point of view from which he looked at these matters with which the memorial dealt. If the cheap entertainments in question really led to serious evils, or were demoralising and led to breaches of public order, Parliament and the police might interfere, but so long as they gave occasional amusement without any serious harm, to those who had too little enjoyment, he had not the heart to promise interference. In many districts where poor people could not go to regular places of amusement, these caravans came, and finding more spare, vacant places, they opened some entertainment for humble patrons, "Why should we grudge this? A member of the deputation remarked that these travelling shows often caused a nuisance to shopkeepers and to the ratepayers in private houses. Sir William Harcourt said it often happened that individuals had to suffer more or less, for the advantage of the vast majority, and after all, most residents in private houses had a great deal of comfort and en- 35 joyment in their lives, whereas the poorer folk who patronised "merry go-round," bad too little enjoyment. One of the deputation : Then why don't you lend them your garden ? (A laugh.) Sir William Harcourt: Unfortunately, I haven't a garden at my present house. (Laughter.) The deputation then withdrew. Expenditure of the School Board for London. The Board has received many communications from other Local Authorities in the Metropolis, drawing attention to and complaining of the continued increase in the demands made by the School Board for London, and in April, 1883, the Board passed a resolution protesting against the increase in the amount demanded for the past year, and a copy of the resolution was sent to the School Board. The Board desires to call the special attention of the ratepayers to this matter. The precept of the School Board for London for the current year demands payment from this district of a sum ot £21,307 14s. l1d., which requires a rate of 73/8d. m the £,and over this large amouut which is included under the charge for "General Rate," this Board has no control whatever. Starch Green Road. Acting under the advice of counsel the Board has prepared an estimate of the cost of paving the paths in the Starch Green Road, from the Gold Hawk Road to the junction with Askew Road, and apportioned the amount upon the owners of the houses and land abutting on the road, under the provisions of the 105 sec., 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, and 77 sec., 25 and 26 Vic., cap. 102. Summonses were issued against certain of the contributors wbo had failed to comply with the notice for payment of the apportioned cost, and after a long argument at the Hammersmith Police Court, counsel appearing on both sides, the Magistrate made an order for the amount claimed in the case of one, Mr. Angelo Jelli. Counsel for Mr. Jelli then asked the Magistrate to grant a case, which was agreed to, but after many ineffectual attempts to agree upon a case to be submitted to the Magistrate, and after a long delay, Mr. Jelli paid the amount demanded. The remaining summonses were then set down for hearing, and the Magistrate again made an order for payment; again a case was asked for and granted. The time within which the case can be taken up by the defendant has not yet expired. Costermongers. In the early part of the year the Board resolved to take proceedings for the removal of the nuisance, and annoyance caused by the congregation of costermongers and itinerant traders obstructing the highways of the district, and a special printed notice was issued,cautioning tbe costermongers and others, and drawing their attention to the provisions of the Act of Parliament, against which they were offending. 36 These notices were issued for several weeks in succession, and verbal notices were given to each person by the officers employed by the Board. These steps not being found effectual the offenders were summoned to appear before the Justices, sitting in Petty Sessions at Kensington. After several hearings the Justices declined to inflict a penalty, and a case was stated for the opinion of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice. The Court held that the offences complained of constituted a nuisance, which the Act intended to suppress, and that the Act applies to this district, thereupon at the next hearing of certain summonses the Justices inflicted fines, varying from five to forty shillings, and proceedings are now being taken for the recovery of the amounts. Corporation Water Bill. The Corporation of London having introduced a Bill into Parliament to make provision for the supply of water by measure, within the limits of the Metropolis, to define the value of premises upon which Water Rates should be based; providing special provisions for the supply of water to small class property, and other purposes. The Board presented a Petition to Parliament in favour of the Bill, which was, however, thrown out on the second reading. Parliamentary Schemes, Session, 1884. HAMMERSMITH AND FULHAM RECREATION GROUND. This Bill was introduced into Parliament this Session, and proposes "To provide for the Formation and Maintenance of a Public Recreation Ground at Fulham, for the use of the Inhabitants of Fulham and Hammersmith, and for other purposes." In consequence of the peculiar nature of the proposed method of raising and administering the funds required for the purchase of the land and maintenance of the Recreation Ground when formed, the Board deemed it absolutely necessary for the protection of the Ratepayers, that they should oppose the Bill as introduced. On tbe 9th of January the Board decided to petition against the Bill as it stood, and on the 20th of February tho following petition, which fully sets out the proposal of the Bill, and the Board's objection thereto, was sealed and deposited in the Private Bill Office on the 21st of February. In Parliament.—Session, 1884. Hammersmith and Fulham Recreation Ground. Petition Against: on Merits. By Counsel. To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, in the County of Middlesex, under their Common Seal. Sheweth,— (1.) That a Bill has been introduced into and is now pending in your Honourable House, entitled "a Bill to provide for the 37 formation and maintenance of a Public Recreation Ground at Fulham, for the use of the Inhabitants of Hammersmith and Fulham, in the county of Middlesex, and for other purposes," which Bill is hereinafter called "the Bill." (2.) That the preamble of the Bill alleges among other things that the formation of a Public Recreation Ground at Fulham, in the county of Middlesex, to be devoted to the use and recreation of the public, would be of great public advantage and conducive to the health and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the Metropolis:— That there is in the parish of All Saints, Fulham, in the county of Middlesex, a large tract of land abutting on the River Thames, well suited for the purpose of a public recreation ground, but unless the same is shortly acquired for that purpose, it may be entirely built over and a large poor and densely populated district be left without any open space for purposes of recreation within a convenient distance: That it is expedient for the purpose of the formation and maintenance of the Recreation Ground to constitute a body of persons to be called "The Conservators of the Hammersmith and Fulham Recreation Ground," and to empower the said Conservators to enter into and carry into effect any contract, agreements aud arrangements for the formation and maintenance of such Recreation Ground: That it is expedient that the Conservators should be empowered to acquire the tract of, land aforesaid, and to obtain from the Metropolitan Board of Works the funds for the purchase thereof and for the formation of the Recreation Ground: That it is expedient that the Conservators should be empowered to obtain from the Fulham District Board of Works or other authority hereafter having charge of the district in which the Recreation Ground is situate, the necessary funds for the maintenance thereof: (3). The Bill proposes to enact that there shall be appointed a Board of Life Conservators of not more than nine persons, as a body corporate, with a common seal, with power to take, dispose of, grant and demise land and property, who shall consist of: the Right Reverend The Lord Bishop of London for the time being; the Vicar of Fulham for the time being ; the Vicar of Hammersmith for the time being ; tbe Member or Members of Parliament for the time being of the Parliamentary Borough ; the Member for the time being of the Metropolitan Board of Works representing the Fulham District; a person to be from time to time appointed by the Metropolitan Board of Works; two persons appointed by the Fulham District Board of Works. (4.) That byclause 9 of the Bill the Conservators may raise the moneys necessary for the purchase of the said tract of land and the formation of the Recreation Ground by requiring payment of the same from the Metropolitan Board of Works. (5.) That by clause 10 of the Bill the Conservators may require that the Charity Commissioners shall allot to such extent as the said Charity Commissioners may think desirable, a sum or sums of money not less 38 than fifty thousand pounds, or annual income not less than one thousand five hundred pounds per annum, to be payable to the Metropolitan Board in aid of the moneys to be provided by them for the purposes of this Act. (6.) That by clause 11 of the Bill the Conservators may raise the money necessary for the purpose of maintaining the recreation ground and for defraying the establishment and other current expenses of the Conservators under the provisions of this Act by requiring payment of the same from the District Board. (7.) That by clause 12 and clause 13 of the Bill powers are given to the Corporation of London and Charitable Trustees to subscribe. (8). That by clause 14 of the Bill the Conservators may for the purpose of obtaining payment from the Metropolitan and District Board respectively of the sum to be required from time to time from them respectively, issue requisitions to the Metropolitan Board or District Board respectively stating the sum to be paid by such Board, and requiring such Board within the time limited by the requisition (being not less than one calendar mouth) to pay tbe sum therein mentioned to the Conservators or to such other persons as the Conservators may direct. (9.) That by clause 22 of the Bill the Conservators may take, use and maintain in perpetuity for public recreation only not less than one hundred and twenty-five acres, and they may appropriate the whole or any part of the residue for private recreation purposes, and may sell, mortgage, charge, exchange or otherwise dispose of and rearrange tbe said lands or grant leases of tbe same or any part thereof for such periods, on such terms and subject to such conditions as they think fit; and may take down any of the buildings situated on such lands, aud may sell aud dispose of the materials thereof, aud may lay out the said lands anew and in such way and manner as they may deem best, and may provide for tbe making of approaches in, through, over, or to such lands, houses and buildings. (10.) That by clause 23 the Conservators may lop timber, plant trees, dig, turf, and gravel, drain lands, abate nuisances, enclose new roads, erect buildings and lodges for officers, impound cattle and appoint officers, keepers, and bailiffs. (11.) That your Petitioners, the Board of Works for the Fulham District, are constituted the local authority over the Parish of Fulham, and vested with various powers under the Metropolis Local Management Acts, and are the District Board which are by the aforesaid clause 11 of the Bill to be required to pay for the maintenance of the said recreation ground, and for defraying the establishment and other current expenses of the Conservators, and your Petitioners' district forms part of the area under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works and would have to coutribute towards any sum that the Conservators may require from the said Metropolitan Board of Works. (12.) That although your Petitioners fully recognise that the formation of a public reception ground at Fulham would be of great public advantage and conducive to the health and enjoyment of the 39 inhabitants of the Metropolis, the burden that would be imposed upon the ratepayers of your Petitioners' district, if the scheme were carried in to effect under the provisions of the Bill, would cause such an enormous addition to the present heavy rates that your petitioners view with great alarm the proposals of the Bill. (13.) That it appears upon reference to the deposited plans and Books of Reference that about two-thirds of the area of the lands proposed to be dealt with under the Bill is public property under the care and control of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England aud Wales. (14.) That your Petitioners strongly object to the Bill for the following:, among other reasons:— (i.) That the body of Conservators proposed to be established by the Bill will not adequately represent the interest of your Petitioners' district, and that the said Conservators if established as proposed will be an absolutely irresponsible body. (ii.) That the Bill proposes that the Conservators may raise the monies necessary for the purchase of the land and the formation of the recreation ground (the amount is not specified in the Bill but is estimated by your Petitioners to reach a sum of nearly £400,000) by requiring payments of the same from the Metropolitan Board of Works, towards which payment your Petitioners would have to contribute their rateable proportion, (iii.) That by the Bill it is proposed to raise the money necessary for the maintenance of the recreation ground "and for defraying the establishment and other current expenses of the " Conservators " by requiring payment from your petitioners, which would inflict upon the ratepayers of your Petitioners' district a threefold taxation, inasmuch as such ratepayers have now to contribute, firstly, their rateable proportion of the cost of purchase and maintenance of public parks and open spaces in the Metropolis, secondly, their proportion of the cost of purchase of the land proposed by the Bill to be purchased, and, thirdly, they would have to bear in perpetuity the whole cost of the maintenance of the said recreation ground together with the expenses of the establishment and current expenses of the Conservators. (iv.) That hitherto the cost of the land purchased by the Metropolitan Board of Works and the maintenance thereof as parks and open spaces for the public advantage and health and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the Metropolis has been borne by the ratepayers ot the Metropolis at large. (v.) That it is not expedient that any irresponsible body should be empowered to raise money from the Metropolis or of your Memorialists' district for the purposes of the Bill. That the preamble of the Bill is incapable of proof. Tour petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that this Bill may not pass into a law, and that they may be heard by themselves, their counsel, agents, and witnesses against the same and the preamble thereof, and in 40 support of their objections thereto, and that they may have such other relief in tho premises as to your Honourable House may seem meet, And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 20th February, 1884. At the same time the Board passed the following resolution: — Moved by Mr. Glen, Seconded by Mr. Martiudill, and resolved:— "That this Board recognising (as stated in the Petition), that the formation of a Public Recreation Ground at Fulham would be of great public advanatage and conducive to the health and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the Metropolis, will be prepared to reconsider their opposition to the Bill, in the event of the promoters so altering their scheme as to provide that the cost of establishing and maintaining the Recreation Ground should be borne in like manner to the cost of establishing and maintaining other public parks and open spaces in the Metroplis, now under the care and control of the Metropolitan Board, and that the Recreation Ground when established, and tbe establishment thereof, should be vested in the said Metropolitan Board of Works, and that the Board of Conservators should then be dissolved." A copy of which was transmitted to the promoters. Subsequently the promoters of the Bill attended, and had an interview with the Law and Parliamentary committee, but no satisfactory arrangement could be made. On the Bill coming before a Committee of the House of Commons, the promoters having regard to the formidable opposition offered by the Board, in conjunction with the Metroplitan Board, consented to withdraw from the Bill all reference to the Board as to the Metropolitan Board. Cromwell Road Bridge. This Bill proposed to authorise the construction of a Bridge over certain Railways near the western end of Cromwell Road, Kensington, with the necessary approach roads, &c. The Bridge, when constructed, will open a short and convenient line of communication between the important thoroughfares and districts of North End Road, Fulham, West Kensington, and Hammersmith and Cromwell Road, West Kensington. The Board, in order to obtain clauses for the protection of the interest of the district petition against the Bill, and having obtained the required protection, the petition was withdrawn, and tbe Bill passed unopposed. Great Western Railway, No. I. This General Powers Bill included provision for the acquisition of a triangular piece of land, adjoining tbe "Sussex" Hotel, the Broadway, but the clause in question was subsequently withdrawn from the Bill. 41 Metropolitan District Railway (Hammersmith Junction). This was a Bill for conferring farther powers on the Metropolitan District Railway inter alia, to make and maintain a Railway 3 furlongs eighty links in length, commencing by a junction at the north end. of the Company's line at Hammersmilh Broadway, and terminating by a junction with the Hammersmith and City Railway on the east side thereof, at or near the Hammersmith Station of that Railway. Subsequently this part of the Bill was withdrawn. London, Reigate, and Brighton Railway Bill. This Bill was for the construction of a new Railway from Reigate to London, passing over the River Thames, entering the parish of Fulham, near Broom House, and terminating by a junction with the West London Extension Railway, near Addison Road. The Bill was thrown out for non-compliance with Standing Orders. West Metropolitan Tramways Extension.—Western District Tramways. These applications were amalgamated, and one scheme proposed for the accommodation of the district. The Board resolved to consent to the application, subject to certain terms and conditions, as agreed with the promoters, but upon the application coming before the Metropolitan Board of Works, they declined to sanction the construction of any extension of tramways at present. United Telephone Company. The Board resolved to petition against this Bill, as affecting the District generally, and the following Petition was deposited:— In Parliament—Session 1884.

That the Fulham District comprises an area of over four thousand acres, and your petitioners have at present under their care and control upwards of sixty-four miles of "streets," that there are existing very many miles of new roads or "streets," not yet under the care and control of your petitioners, that building operations are progressing at rapid rate in the Fulham District, aud that very shortly there will be very many miles of streets added to those at present under the control of your petitioners. (11.) That your petitioners strongly object to the Bill for the following, among other reasons:— (i.) That the erection and suspension of Telegraph and Telephone wires overhead, along or across any street, land or building, will become a source of great danger to the inhabitants' of your petitioners' district and to the public generally. (ii.) That the erection and suspension of Telegraph and Telephone wires overhead, along or across any street, land, or building, and the erection of posts in the said streets, will create obstruction, annoyance and inconvenience in the streets, and will restrict and injuriously interfere with the free use of the said streets by the inhabitants of your petitioners' district and by the public generally. (iii.) That no periodical or other testing or inspection of Telegraph and Telephone wires can be carried out so as to ensure the efficient protection of the inhabitants of your petitioners' district, and of the public generally, from the dangers arising from the erection and suspension of such overhead wires, (iv.) That no provision is made, should the Bill pass into a law, enabling the company to erect and suspend Telegraph or 44 phone wires, to give power to the local authority to remove any wires erected or suspended without the consent of the local authority, or erected or suspended contrary to the requirements of the local authority, and there is no provision for penalties to be paid by the company for non-compliance with any requirements of the said local authority. (v.) That the provisions of the Rill are wholly inadequate to safe-guard and protect the inhabitants of your petitioners' district and the public geuerally from the danger, annoyance, and inconvenience which will result from tbe erection and suspension of Telegraph and Telephone wires and the posts and works connected therewith. (vi.) That the marginal note to clause 17 of the Bill is misleading, inasmuch as it states such clause to be " Regulations as to wires, &c., along, over and across streets," whereas such clause proposes to give the company power to suspend Telephone wires along a street at a height not less than that of the fronts of the houses, abutting upon the street and over a street at the points of the crossing of such streets, and such power is proposed to be conferred without any consent from the local authority, and your petitioners most strongly object to any power being given to the Company to suspend wires at all over any street or part of a street, but if the Bill passes into a law it should be amended by requiring the consent of the local authority to be given in all cases to tbe erection or suspending of wires. (vii.) That the marginal note to clause 25 is also misleading, inasmuch as it states "Board of Trade may make and enforce rules for prevention of danger from tbe company's works,'' whereas the said clause proposes to give power to the Board of Trade from time to time to make, alter, and repeal rules to be observed by the local authorities and other persons whose consent is required to the company's works, aud to impose penalties for any breach of such rules, and your petitioners strongly object to any such clause or any such power being given to the Board of Trade. That the preamble of tbe Bill is incapable of proof. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that this Bill may not pass into a law, and that they may be beard by themselves, the counsel, agents, and witnesses against the same and the Preamble thereof, and in support of their objections thereto, and that they may have such other relief in the premises as to your Honourable House may seem meet. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. 20th February, 1884. London Government Bill.

Broadway House, Hammersmith, September, 1884. To the Fulham District Board of Works. Gentlemen, During the past year it has been my duty to present to you four Quarterly Reports. In these reports 1 have laid before you at the end of each quarter, a statement as to all matters relating to the sanitary work of my department, together with other statistical details of the state of the public health of this district. It is yet my duty, in accordance with the Metropolis Local Management Acts (18 and 19 Yict. c. 120, sec. 198, and 25 and 26 Vic., c. 102, sec. 43), to present to you an Annual Report, containing an account of the vital statistics for the past year, together with a statement as to the sanitary work carried out under my advice, with the sanction of your Board. Last year was a very healthy one, and a very successful one as regards sanitary work. Many serious nuisances which had existed for a great many years were done away with, besides which a great improvement has taken place in the way the sanitary work was performed. With the present system properly carried out, we may hope for a great improvement in the sanitary condition of the district, and more particularly so in reference to the dwellings of the poor. Sanitary officers who perform their duties zealously, must expect to receive for their reward great unpopularity. So many are the vested interests that they are obliged in the performance of their duty to interfere with, that they must be prepared to meet with injustice and opposition in almost all directions. They must only hope for one reward — a reward not to be despised by any means, the conscientiousness that they have done their dutv, and have been the means of benefitting their fellow creatures. It is not at all surprising that the dwellings of the poor in London should be in an unsanitary condition, seeing the great obstacles public sanitary officers have in the performance of their duties. 73 As in previous Annual Reports it will be of advantage for me to briefly describe the district. The Fulham district comprises an area of 4003 acres, and in the middle of last year its estimated population was 138,000 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three sub-districts, namely Fulliam, which is the parish of Fulham, and St. Peter's and St. Paul's which together constitutes the parish of Hammersmith. These three sub-districts are hereafter designated as Fulham, St. Peter's and St. Paul's. Fulham contains an area of 1716 statute acres, St. Paul's 2102, and St. Peter's 185. In the middle of last year there were 20,379 inhabited houses in the whole district, against 19,523 for the middle of the previous year. On the estimated population in the middle of last year there was an average of 6 8 persons to each house Of the inhabited houses in the middle of last year there were 12,879 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 7500 in the parish of Fulham, against 12,250 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 7273 in the parish of Fulham, in the middle of the previous year. During the whole year therefore there was an increase of 856 in the number of inhabited houses in the whole district. On the estimated population in the middle of last year, there was an average of 34.5 persons to each acre in this district, while there was an average of 52.5 persons to each acre in the whole of London. A great many new houses are every year being constructed, although there is a very considerable number of the old built houses unoccupied. No doubt the large number of new houses which are built and occupied has the effect of drawing people from the old ones. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in this district last year was 2607 (males 1265, females 1342), being one death to every 52.9 inhabitants against 2499 in the previous year which equalled one death to each 50 0. The average number of deaths registered in the past ten years was 2176. Making an allowance for the increase in the population the deaths last year were 387 below the corrected decennial average. The above figures represent the total number of deaths as registered in the district. The annual death rate, taking the deaths as registered was 18 9 per 1000 persons living, being 1.5 less than the death rate of all London, which was 204. The mean death rate in this district in the last ten years was 217, while that in all London during the same period was 21.9. Of the deaths registered last year, 108 took place in St. Peter's, 1262 in St. Paul's, and 1237 in Fulham, against 132 in St. Peter's ; 1247 in St. Paul's, and 1120 in Fulham in the previous year. The average number of deaths registered in the three sub-districts during the last ten years was, St. Peter's 125, St. Paul's 1082, and Fulham 958. There was, therefore, last quarter, as compared with the last decennial average a decrease of 17 deaths in St. Peter's, an increase of 180 in St. Paul's, and an increase of 279 in Fulham. 74 TABLE I. The following table shows the deaths registered in three sub-districts in the years 1882 and 1883; also the average number in the ten years 1874—1883. Sub-District. Year, 1882. Year, 1883. Mean of 10 Years. 1874—1883. St. Peter's 132 108 125 St. Paul's 1247 12G2 1082 Fulham 1120 1237 958 The number of deaths of infants at one year of age and under was 838, against 766 in the previous year. Of those occurring last year, there were 25 in St. Peter's, 393 in St. Paul's, and 420 in Fulham; against 26 in St. Peter's, 394 in St. Paul's, and 346 in Fulham in the previous year. The deaths of infants last year were equal to 321 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and to 167 per cent, of the total registered births. The deaths of infants at one year of age and under in the whole of London last year were equal to 24-2 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and to 14.6 per cent, of the total registered births. In the three sub-districts, the per centages of these deaths to the total deaths and total births respectively were St. Peter's 231 and 10.9, St. Pauls, 31.1 and 15.8, Fulham 339 and 18.4 This mortality rate, therefore, was, as compared with the total deaths and total births, greater in St. Paul's and Fulham and less in St. Peter's, than in all London. The mortality rate among infants is always greater in this district than in the whole of London. This is owing to there being a greater proportion of poor class inhabitants in this district than in all London. It is among the poor class inhabitants that the largest number of deaths of infants always take place. The infaut mortality rate was slightly greater in this district last year than in the year previous. The number of deaths of persons at 60 years of age and upwards was 504, of which there were 35 in St. Peter's, 252 in St. Paul's, and 217 in Fulham; against 38 in St. Peter's, 260 in St. Paul's, and 194 in Fulham, registered in the previous year. These deaths were equal to 19.3 per cent of the total deaths registered, while the per centage of the same in all London was 21.7. The senile mortality rate, therefore, was lower in this district last year than in all London. This is owing to the district being, to a large extent, a new one. In all districts in which the population is rapidly increasing, and in which a large number of new houses have been lately built and occupied, there is always a very large proportion of young inhabitants, and, consequently, the proportion of deaths of elderly persons is much less than it otherwise would be. 75 TABLE II. The following table shows the mean temperature, the population, the number of persons to each acre, the number of births, the proportion of births to each 1000 persons living, the number of deaths, the proportion of death to each 1000 persons living, and the proportion of persons living at each death:— Year.

When we take into consideration the fact that the mortality rate in the district last year was 2.8 below the decennial average, and l.5 less than the death rate in all London, although the density of the population has increased from 195 to 34.5 persons in an acre in the same decade, it may with safety be said that the state of public health in this district is not deteriorating.

The number of deaths in each quarter was considerably below the average owing to the temperature of the atmosphere being comparatively high for the time of the year in the first and last quarters, and comparatively low for the time of the year in the second and third quarters. Very high temperatures in summer and very low temperatures in winter always cause an increase in the number of deaths. The deaths of females exceeded those of males by 77. The proportion of deaths of males to males living is always much greater than the proportion of deaths of females to females living. The actual number of deaths of females being greater than that of the males was owing to the very much greater number of females living than males. It is owing to the much greater mortality among males that there are so many more females living, as the average number of births of males is greater than of females. Births. The number of births registered in this distrct last year was 5008 (males 2473, females 2535), against 4637 on the previous year. The number of births of females exceeded that of males by 62. Of the births registered last year there were 230 in St. Peter's (males 123, females 107), 2493 in St. Paul's (males 1241, females 1249), and 2285 in Fulham (males 1106, females 1179). The birth rate in the whole district was at the rate of 36'3 births per 1000 persons living per annum, being one birth to each 27 6 persons. The birth rate in the whole of London was equal to 33'9 births per 1000 persons living per annum. The births exceeded the deaths in this district last year by 2407. Estimating that the population has increased 13,000 in the year, 2401 of this number was due to excess of births over deaths, and 10,599 to immigration. TABLE IV. The following table shows the quarterly number of births of each sex registered in the three sub-districts during the year, 1883:— Qtr. Sub-district of St. Peter's Sub-district of St. Paul's.

There was, therefore, a comparative decrease of 145 in the number of deaths of parishioners registered in this district last year, as compared with the year previous, but taking into consideration the increase on the population there was a comparative decrease last year of 194 deaths from these diseases. The total deaths from zymotic diseases, as registered last year, were equal to 137 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 2"6 deaths per annum per 1000 persons living. The deaths from these diseases in the whole of London were equal to 13'4 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 2 7 deaths per annum per 1000 persons living. There was, therefore, in this district last year a greater proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases than in London, as compared with the total number of deaths registered, but a less number as compared with the population. This district contains so many poor class inhabitants that the death rate from zymotic diseases is sure to be rather high. Of the 342 (the corrected number) of deaths from zymotic diseases which occurred last year there were, 11 in St. Peter's, against 19 in the previous year, 156 in St. Paul's, against 215 in the previous year, and 175 in Fulham against 253 in the previous year. There was, therefore, a comparative decrease of 8 in the number of these deaths in St. Peter's, 59 in St. Paul's, aud 78 in Fulham. TABLE V. The following table shows the deaths from zymotic diseases (exclusive of those of non-parishioners that took place at the Western District Hospital at Fulham), registered in the Fulham district in the years 1882 and 1883:— 78 Disease.

Smallpox. During last year no case of smallpox was reported in this district. The total number of deaths from smallpox, which took place in London last year was 134. This represents about 1340 persons attacked with the disease. Of the deaths which occurred there was only one in the western group of districts, the disease being confined to the north and south districts of London. The cases of smallpox reported in the Fulham district during the last seven years, 1877 to 1883, were 1877=328, 1878=266, 1879=166, 1880=51, 1881=327, 1882=16, and in 1883=0. Since I presented to you my last Annual Report no new Act has been passed in reference to the notification and isolation of infectious diseases occurring in London. A very great improvement of late years has taken place in this district, with regard to the way in which outbreaks of smallpox have been dealt with, but it will never be possible to deal with outbreaks of this disease in a satisfactory manner until some such Act shall have become law. Chicken Pox. During last year four cases of chicken pox were reported in this district, two in the parish of Hammersmith, and two in the parish of Fulham, against no case in the previous year. The four cases last 79 year were all certified as smallpox, and were removed, 2 to the Deptford Smallpox Hospital, and 2 to the Stockwell Smallpox Hospital. It is very common for medical practitioners to-mistake chicken pox for smallpox, and smallpox for chicken pox. The latter mistake is often the cause of serious outbreak of smallpox. Scarlet Fever. During last year there were 172 cases of scarlet fever; males 71; females 101 reported in this district, against 248, 180, 152, 228, 281 cases reported in the five previous years, from 1878 to 1882. These numbers do not at all represent the actual number of cases which occurred in the district, as a very large number of cases of scarlet fever are alwavs treated at home, and never reported at all. The above figures represent, however, about the relative proportion of cases occurring in the last six years. Of the 172 cases reported last year there were 92 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 80 in the parish of Fulham, against 106 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 175 in the parish of Fulham, reported in the previous year. There was, therefore, last year, as compared with the previous year, a decrease of 14 cases in the parish of Hammersmith, and a decrease of 95 in the parish of Fulham. The number of deaths of parishioners from scarlet fever, registered in the whole district last vear, was 43 against 85 in the previous year. In all London there were 1989 deaths registered last year, against 2108 on the year previous. The 43 deaths of parishioners last year were equal to 1'7 per cent, of the total deaths of parishioners registered in the district, and were equivalent to an annual rate of .3 per 1000 persons living. The death rate from scarlet fever in all London was 2.5 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and was equivalent to an annual rate of .5 per 1000 persons living. In 36 out of the 43 deaths which occurred last year no information was obtained of the cases until after the death wasregistered,and then only through the death returns. 35 cases were not reported till after the recovery of the patients. In 43 cases an offer to remove the patients to an hospital was rejected, although in many of them the accommodation for the effectual isolation of the patients was not satisfactory, The accommodation for the treatment of the patients was not so bad that a Magistrate's order could have been obtained to enforce removal. In two cases the patients were in too bad a condition for it to be safe to remove them. 55 cases were removed to the Western-District Hospital at Fulham by your Board. No case was removed by the Fulham Board of Guardians. In all of the cases reported, a most careful system of disinfection was carried out by and at the expense of your Board. From the number of deaths, 43, we may estimate that there were about 860 persons attacked by the disease in this district last year. When we take into consideration the fact that there were only 172 cases reported, it is not all surprising that the course which was adopted by your Board 80 was not sufficient to stop the disease from breaking out from time to time in different parts of the district. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet fever that were reported in each parish of the Fulham district duriog each of the twelve months of the year, 1883, also the number of cases treated at hospitals, and those treated at the homes of the patients:— Parish of Hammersmith.

This is the reverse of what generally occurs in the case of smallpox. Smallpox, when epidemic is nearly always more prevalent in the tirst half the year. Scarlet fever generally attacks more persons in the second half of the year. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet fever reported in each parish of the Fulham district during the year, 1883; the date when each case was reported, the localities where they occurred; the number of cases in each street, and the number of infected houses. 81 Parish of Hammersmith.

Of the cases in the parish of Fulham, 32 occurred within half-a-mile radius of the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Fever Hospital at Fulham, while 48 occurred outside a half-mile radius of the Hospital. Western District Hospital. During last year the Metropolitan Asylum Board's hospital at Fulham was used for the reception of scarlet fever, typhus fever, and enteric fever cases. The cases of typhus fever were removed there by mistake, but were the following day re-moved to the South-Western District Hospital at Fulham. The Metropolitan Asylum Board has established an Ambulance Station at the Fulham Hospital. A wharf station has also been established for the conveyance of cases of smallpox up the River Thames to the hospital ships. Diphtheria. There were 17 cases of diphtheria reported last year, 9 in the parish of Fulham, and 8 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 29 cases in the previous year, of which there were 14 in the parish of Fulham, and 15 in the parish of Hammersmith. All of the cases last year were first reported in the death returns. The deaths from diphtheria in this district were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.12 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 0.64 per cent. of the total deaths registered. The deaths from diphtheria in all London were equivalent to an 84 annual rate of 0.24 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 1.20 per cent, of the total deaths registered. In all of the cases reported in this district last year, the house where the patient resided was carefully inspected as to its sanitary state, and where practicable a proper system of disinfection was carried out. Whooping Cough. There were 62 cases of whooping cough reported last year, 32 in the parish of Eulham, and 30 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 208 registered during the previous year, of which there were 127 in the parish of Fulham, and 33 in the parish of Hammersmith. These 62 cases were all reported in the death returns. They were equivalent to an annual rate of 045 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 2.38 per cent, of the total deaths registered. The deaths from whooping cough in all London were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.40 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 1.90 per cent, of the total deaths registered. Typhus Fever. During last year 36 cases of typhus fever were reported in this district against no cases in the previous year. 31 of the cases last year occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 5 in the parish of Fulham. The 31 cases in the parish of Hammersmith occurred at Nazareth House. One of the cases in the parish of Eulham occurred at the Western District Hospital. The patient was a nurse. She contracted the disease through attending upon the other cases, which were in mistake taken into the hospital. The other five cases in the parish of Eulham occurred at private dwelling houses. The particulars of the outbreak in the parish of Hammersmith were laid before your Board in a special report. Of the 36 cases which occurred in the district 17 were not reported until after the recovery of the patients, and one till after the death of the patient. 14 cases were removed to hospitals, 7 were taken by your Board, first to the WesternDistrict Hospital at Eulham, and afterwards to the South-Western district Hospital at Stock well, 3 cases were removed by your Board direct to the Stockwell Hospital, 3 cases were removed to the Fulham Hospital, two by your Board, and one by the Fulham Board of Guardians. The difficulty to diagnose typhus fever when patients are first attacked, would appear to be somewhat great, as not one of the 14 cases removed was certified as suffering from typhus fever at the time of the removal. There were 3 deaths registered from typhus fever in this district last year, one of which occurred in the parish of Fulham, and two in the parish of Hammersmith, against no death registered in this district in the previous year. The deaths in this district last year were equal to 0 12 per ceut. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0'02 per 1000 85 sons living. The deaths from typhus fever in all London were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.0l per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 0 07 per cent, of the total deaths registered. Enteric or Typhoid Fever. There were 39 cases of enteric fever reported last year, of which there were 17 in the parish of Fulham, and 22 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 31 in the previous year, of which there were 9 in the parish of Fulham, and 22 in the parish of Hammersmith. There were 28 deaths registered from this disease in this district last year. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 0.20 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 1.07 per cent, of the total deaths registered. The deaths from this disease in all London were equal to an annual rate of 0.24 per 1000 persons living, and were equal to 1.16 per cent, of the total deaths registered. Of the cases reported in this district last year 28 were not reported till after the death of the patients. Two cases were removed to the Western-District Hospital by your Board; one case was removed by the Fulham Board of Guardians to the Fulham Union. In three instances the offer to remove the patients to an hospital was refused, and 4 cases were not reported till after the recovery of the patients. Measles. During last year 54 cases of measles were reported in this district, 23 in the parish of Fulham, and 31 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 69 cases reported in the previous year, ol which there were 26 in the parish of Fulham, and 43 in the parish of Hammersmith. There were 50 deaths registered from this disease in the whole district. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 0 36 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 1.92 per cent, of the total deaths registered. The deaths from this disease in all London were equal to an annual rate of 0.61 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 3.00 per cent, of the total deaths registered, 3 cases were not reported till after the recovery of the patients, and one cases was removed by and at the expense of your Board to the Islington Fever Hospital. Simple Continued Fever. There were 4 cases of simple continued fever reported last year, all of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, against 3 cases in the previous year, which also occurred in the parish of Hammersmith. All 4 of the cases last year were reported in the death returns. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 0'03 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 0.15 per cent, of the total deaths registered. The deaths from this disease inall London were equal to an annual rate of 0.02 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 0.10 per cent, of the total deaths registered. In all of the cases reported a careful system 86 of disinfection was carried out by your Board, and the houses where the patients had resided were carefully inspected. Diarrhœa. Of the 130 deaths from diarrhoea reported last year, 75 took place in the parish of Fulhatn, and 55 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 72 in the previous year, of which there were 25 in the parish of Fulham, and 47 in the parish of Hammersmith. These deaths last year were equal to an annual rate of 0'94 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 498 per cent, of the total deaths registered. The deaths from diarrhœa in all London were equal to 0.68 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 3.28 per cent, of the total deaths registered. In all of the cases reported last year, the houses where the patients had resided were carefully inspected, and where unsanitary conditions existed, the owner of the premises was called upon to remedy them. English Cholera. Of the 5 deaths registered, as from English Cholera last year, 3 occurred in the parish of Fulhatn, and 2 in the parish of Hammersmith, agaiDst 2 cases in the previous year, both of which occurred in the parish of Fulham. These deaths last year were equal to an annual rate of 0.03 per 1000 persous living, and were equivalent to 0.19 per cent, of the total deaths registered. The deaths from English Cholera in all London were equal to an annual rate of 0 02 per 1000 persons living, and were equivalent to 010 per cent, of the total deaths registered. In every case which occurred in this district last year the sanitary state of the house where the patient had resided was enquired into. During last year a Bill was passed "The Disease Prevention (Metropolis) Act, 1883." The chief object of the Bill is to make further provision for the treatment of Cholera and other infectious diseases in case of necessity. Puerperal Fever. Two deaths occurred from puerperal fever last year, both cases occurred in the parish of Hammersmith. The rooms where the patients had been treated were thoroughly disinfected, and the nurses who attended the patients in their confinements were prohibited from attending any case for a period of one month, from the day they left the houses where the patients had died. Violent Deaths. There were 88 deaths from violence, of which there were 31 in the parish of Fulham, and 57 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 83 in the previous year, of which there were 22 in the parish of Fulham, and 61 in the parish of Hammersmith. The existence of a public hospital in the latter parish accounts in a great measure for the difference in the number of these deaths in the two parishes. 87 Inquests. There were 213 inquests held last year, of which there were 100 in the parish of Fulham, and 113 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 165 in the previous year, of which there were 55 in the pariah of Fulham, and 110 in the parish of Hammersmith. Deaths in Public Institutions. During last year 251 deaths were registered, as occurring in public institutions in this district, of which there were 178 in the parish of Fulham, and 73 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 214 in the previous year, of which there were 50 in the parish of Fulham, and 64 in the parish of Hammersmith. Of the 177 in the parish of Fulham, 157 (males, 77, females 80), took place at the Fulham Union Workhouse; 20 (males 14, females 6), at the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital; and one a female at the Female Convict Prison. The 73 in the parish of Hammersmith occurred at the West London Hospital, 47 of which were males, and 26 were females. Uncertified Deaths. The cause of deaths in 23 instances was not certified by a registered medical practitioner, or by a Coroner. Piggeries. There are, notwithstanding all your Board has done, about 1000 swine kept in the district, rather more than one-halt of them are kept in localities unfit for the keeping of swine. In the third quarter of last year proceedings were commenced against the pig keepers of Latimer Road to compel them to discontinne the keeping of swine upon their premises. In every case a Magistrate's order was obtained, prohibiting swine from being kept. The result of the proceedings is that 39 piggeries were removed. At the time the proceedings were commenced there was found upon the piggeries 1150 swine being kept. A great benefit has been conferred upon that portion of the district. Licensed Cowhouses. The whole of the licensed cowhouses in the district were kept under a regular quarterly inspection during last year. With some few exceptions they were found to be well-conducted, and in a good sanitary condition. Licensed Slaugher-houses. The whole of the licensed slaughter-houses in the district were regularly inspected once every quaiter during last year. They were found in most cases to be well managed, and in nearly all cases in a proper sanitary condition. 88 Bakehouses. There are 126 bakehouses in use in the district, 67 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 59 in the parish of Fulham. Uuder my instructions they were regularly inspected once in each quarter, and in many cases notices were served upon the bakers under the Nuisance Removal Act, requiring them to remedy defects in the sanitary state of their premises. During last year a new Act was passed, which relates to Bakehouses. It is named "The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883." By this Act the powers and duties conferred upon Factory Inspectors under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, are transferred to the Medical Officer of Health of the Local Sanitary Authority. It is to be hoped that this alteration in the law will have a beneficial effect, as there can be no doubt that the sanitary conditiou of bakehouses has in times past been by no means what it should be. Sanitary Work. During last year 2370 notices were served by your Sanitary Inspectors for the removal of nuisances and unsanitary conditions, 164 notices were also served by your dust Inspector for the construction of proper dust bins. Of the 2370 notices served 2041 had been complied with by the end of last December. Of the 164 notices served, 120 had been complied with by the end of the year. During the year 62 summonses were taken out in the sanitary departments. 35 of the summonses were in reference to pig keeping, in 34 of which Magistrate's order were made, as prayed for, with nominal costs. In the other case, the swine were removed by the hearing; day, and so the summons was withdrawn, without costs; 25 were in reference to nuisances on private premises, 9 were withdrawn on the payment of 2s. costs in each case, the nuisance having been removed by the hearing day. 14 were withdrawn, without costs, the notices having been obeyed by the hearing day. In two cases Magistrate's orders were made with 4s. costs in each case. There were 68 cases of infectious diseases removed to hospitals by your Inspector, and disinfection of houses and infected articles was carried out by your Inspector in reference to 239 cases of infectious disease. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that a great improvement has taken place in the working of the sanitary department; still, however, it must be owned that there is plenty of room for improvement. Houses Let in Lodgings. The Local Government Board by notice published in the "London G-azette,'' has decided that the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, shall be in force in all of the districts of London. Under this section it is the duty of your Board to make regulations for the registration regulation inspection and cleanly condition of houses which are occupied by more than the members of one family. This section gives 89 almost all the legal power that could be wished for, to place the dwellings of the poor in a proper sanitary condition. The Local Government Board has prepared suggestions for "the regulations," a copy of which has been forwarded to your Board, No action has been taken by your Board as yet to carry out the order of the Local Government Board. Public Mortuary. Nothing has been done in the past year towards providing a proper public mortuary for the district. Bodies have bt'en taken to the temporary mortuary at the wharf, Chancellor's, and to the mortuaries at the Fulham and Hammersmith Cemeteries. Your Board removed four dead bodies of persons who had died from infectious diseases to the mortuaries at the cemeteries, and 16 bodies were removed by the police and others to the temporary mortuary at the wharf, Chancellor's. Public Nuisances. Complaints were received of the nuisance from the works of the Mambre Saccharine Company, and also from the Distillery, and on several occasions I have been able to trace the odours to these works. The nuisance from neither of these works has not been anything like as bad as it was before your Board commenced the action in Chancery against the Saccharine Company. It is to be hoped that these Companies will see the wisdom of preventing a recurrence of a public nuisance, and so relieve you of the necessity of having to take proceedings against them. Meteorology. The average mean temperature registered during last year was 490.4 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 848.8; the lowest was 208.6. Rain fell on 173 days. The total quantity of rain registered, as falling in the year, was 21'90 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Tour obedient Servant. N. E. COLLIER, 28, New Cavendish Street, Medical Officer of Health.
