REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1903. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the vital statistics and sanitary work for the Registration Year 1903, 53 weeks ending-January 2nd, 1904. POPULATION. According to the Registrar-General's returns, the population for the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford is estimated at 112,455, at the middle of the year 1903. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered during the year 1903, was 3,465 (1,759 males and 1,706 females), equivalent to an annual rate of 30.8 per 1,000 of the population. The Birth-rate for England and Wales was 28.4, for the 76 great towns 29.7, and that for the County of London 28.5. MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages registered in the Borough of Deptford during the year 1903 was 629. The Marriages for the past eight years were — 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 588 687 709 735 666 746 713 629 DEATHS. The number of Deaths registered during- the year was 1,740 (males 896, females 844), of these 13 were registered in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital (exclusive of deaths of non-parishioners which numbered 108) and 436 in Public Institutions beyond the district. There were 546 belonging to the North District, 435 to the South District, and 759 to the Central District. The following-table gives the number of deaths that occurred in each Ward, and the death-rate in each Ward: — Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000. East Ward 340 15.1 North Ward 328 13.4 North-West Ward 217 9.0 South Ward 117 9.4 South-East Ward 145 11.9 South-West Ward 144 9.9 The death-rate is calculated on the census population of 1901. Deaths in outlying Public Institutions will be found in Table 2, which gives a list of the institutions in which the deaths occurred. The total death-rate was equal to an annual rate of 15.4 per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate for England and Wales was 15.4 and for the 76 great towns 16.3, whilst the death-rate for the Metropolis as a whole was 15.2. MORTALITY AT GROUP OF AGES The 1,740 deaths recorded during the year included 710 children under five years of age. The deaths of 473 children occurred under one year; 237 deaths were registered between one and five years; 62 between five and fifteen ; 72 between the ages of 15 and 25 ; 544 of persons over 25 and under 65 ; and 352 of persons aged upwards of 65 years. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Infantile mortality, that is to say, the proportion of deaths of infants under one year to every 1,000 children born was 136; the deaths for the past five years were— 18 4 169 150 138 136 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 The chief causes of death were Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Whooping , Cough, Measles, and diseases of the Digestive Organs, probably in most cases the result of improper feeding. The printed instructions upon the feeding and care of infants, which the Public Health Committee in the year 1901 recommended, should be distributed throughout the Borough, through the co-operation of the Registrars of Births, the Officers of the Deptford Dispensary of the Greenwich Union, District Nurses, and others and are still being distributed, and will, I trust, be the means of diminishing the present high death-rate of infants under one year. The infant mortality for England and Wales was 132, and for the 76 great towns 144, whilst for the County of London, as a whole, it was 130. Table No. 1. SHEWING THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS IN THE BOROUGH DURING THE YEAR 1903. BIRTHS 3465 DEATHS (including Parishioners in the South-Eastern Hospital, and 449 in the Outlying Institutions) 1740 Excess of Births over Deaths 1725 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The Registrar-General classifies under this heading—Small- I'ox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping-Cough, "Fever' , (Typhus, Enteric and Continued), Diarrhoea, Plague. The number of deaths registered from the Zymotic diseases amounted to 233, as compared with 211 and 257 for the two preceding- years. The average deaths from Zymotic diseases was 2.0 per 1,000 persons living, as compared with 1.89 and 2.32 for the previous two years, for England and Wales 1.46, for the 76 great towns 1.89, and that for the County of London 1.76. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The number of Notifications received during the year, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 1,184, as compared with 2,456 and 1,116 for the two previous years, the large increase during the year 1902 was due to the fact that Chicken-pox was made a notifiable disease during that year; this has now been cancelled, January 6th, 1903. Table No. 10 gives a detailed account of the Notification cf Infectious Diseases during the year and the number of cases notified in each district and those removed to hospital from each district. SMALL=POX. Only two cases were reported in the Borough during the year, one on June 9th, male, aged 42, from a common lodging-house ; patient had been vaccinated in childhood : there was no history as to source of infection. The other a female aged 34; this patient had been several times to the Small-pox hospital ships at Long Reach to visit a patient, the last time, June 5th. She refused on each occasion to be re-vaccinated, and was admitted herself as a patient on June 8th, suffering from Small-pox ; she was vaccinated in childhood. During the outbreak of Small-pox for the year 1902 the number of cases notified in the Borough was 143 with a death-roll of 34. CHICKEN-POX. This disease was made a notifiable disease in London on February 7th, 1902, under Section 50 (5) of the Public Health (London) Act. 1891, and cancelled January 6th, 1903 ; during the year under consideration 46 cases were notified. Chart shewing week by week the number of Cases of Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Scarlet Fever notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the Borough of Deptford during the 53 weeks ending the 2nd January, 1904. SCARLET FEVER. Of this disease 516 certificates of notification were received, representing 501 cases, of these 434 were removed to Hospital. Six persons were returned from the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospitals as not suffering from Scarlet Fever. The deaths were 23, equal to a rate of 0.20 per 1,000 persons living. The number of " return cases " was 21. The infant's department of Alverton Street Board School was closed in consequence cf the prevalence of this disease from October 2nd to October 10th, by order of Dr. Kerr, the Medical Officer to the School Board for London. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANOUS CROUP. There were received 478 certificates during the year, representing 460 cases ; 25 persons were returned from the Hospital as not suffering from Diphtheria or Membranous Croup, the deaths were 45, equal to an annual rate of 0.40 per 1,000 persons living. 86 Bacteriological Examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association, with the result that 38 were positive and 48 negative. In consequence of the number of cases of this disease amongst the children attending- Alverton Street Board School, I had the infants department closed from July 7th to the end of the summer holidays, during which time the rooms were disinfected by the Council's staff. TYPHUS FEVER. Two cases were notified, one imported from Bermondsey on January 23rd, notified as Enteric Fever and removed to the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Brook Hospital, January 27th, and reported by the hospital authorities on January 31st as a case of Typhus. The other case was admitted to the South- Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital from the Greenwich Union Infirmary, May iith. and discharged on May 16th as not Typhus. ENTERIC FEVER OR TYPHOID FEVER The number of cases notified during , the year was 31 ; the deaths amounted to 4 only, equivalent to an annual rate of 003 per 1,000 persons living , . Nine persons were returned by the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital authorities as not suffering from any infectious disease, being , errors in diagnosis. Bacteriological examinations were made in 16 cases by the Clinical Research Association in which 9 were positive and 7 neg-ative. Five of the cases reported were traced to the consumption of shell-fish (oysters and cockles); no case could be traced to eating watercress. ERYSIPELAS. Of this disease 134 certificates were received, whilst last year 147 were notified; four deaths only were registered. PUERPERAL FEVER. Seven cases were notified and two deaths were registered, the nurses and midwives connected with these cases were warned not to attend any other confinement for a period of at least 14 days, and in each case the clothing of the attendant was disinfected by the Council's staff. MEASLES. As this disease is not notifiable under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, it is impossible to form an exact idea of the extent of an outbreak, except by means of the death returns and school certificates. In accordance with the regulations of the School Board for London, certificates were received from the school teachers to the number of 273 as against 715 for the previous year. The deaths registered were 72, of these 71 were children under five years of age. In April the London County Council made an order applying the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1891 to Measles as a dangerous infectious disease ; such provisions, however, did not include compulsory notification. A leaflet on "Precautions against the spread of Infection of Measles" was freely distributed as recommended by the Public Health Committee in 1901. PHTHISIS, CONSUMPTION OR TUBERCULOSIS Phthisis and other Tubercular diseases occasioned 204 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 1.81 per 1,000 persons living, as compared with 1.55 for London as a whole. This death-rate is much too high for a disease which is classed as a preventable disease. Overcrowding, dampness of habitations, and general insanitary condition of dwellings are the principle causes of the propagation of tuberculosis. According to the Census returns of 1901, the number of tenements in the Borough was 24,615. During the year under consideration 1,739 house to house inspections were made, with the result that only 15 cases of overcrowding were discovered. The masses are gradually being educated to the necessity of taking every precaution to prevent the spread of this disease, to this end notification as "an Infectious Disease" under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, would tend to give the Sanitary Authority more power than it possesses at the present time, to secure isolation and disinfection. Compulsory notification does not seem to be very popular, voluntary notification however, is being adopted with some success in the following Metropolitan Boroughs, viz. : —Westminster, Bermondsey, Finsbury, Greenwich, Hammersmith, Hampstead, Kensington, Lambeth, Southwark, Stoke Newington, Wandsworth, and Woolwich. The following resolution on this subject was unanimously passed by the Members of the National Association for the prevention of Consumption at their Annual Meeting, in March, 1903:— "That in the opinion of this Council spitting on the floors of public buildings or platforms, corridors, and in public carriages or passenger boats, or in any covered place or public resort, should be forbidden by law." In the Autumn of 1903, the London County Council added the following Clause to their bye-laws:- "No person shall spit on the floor, side, or wall of any public carriage or of any public hall, public waiting-room, or place of entertainment, whether admission thereto be obtained upon payment or not." Any person who shall offend against this bye-law shall be liable for each offence to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and other diseases of the respiratory organs; 293 deaths were registered, 96 of these were children under one year of age, and 145 under the age of five. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The Council renewed the arrangement with the Clinical Research Association, Limited, of I, Southwark Street, London Bridge, for making Bacteriological Examinations and Reports upon doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid, cases of Diphtheria having been notified to the Council and the patients removed to hospital, where it has been subsequently ascertained that they have not been suffering from the disease, and have accordingly been sent home again. In these cases the Borough and the Metropolitan Asylums Beard have been put to certain unnecessary expense, and persons so removed have had their feelings unnecessarily shocked, besides having been exposed to the risk of infection during their temporary stay at the hospital. Having regard, therefore to these circumstances, the Committee was of opinion it would be of great assistance to the medical men in the Borough, who have not the apparatus necessary to make a bacteriological investigation in order to decide doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid, and it would also result in a great saving , of expense to the Council in detecting and preventing epidemics of the above-mentioned diseases, and would prevent the unnecessary removal of any person to the hospital. Every medical practitioner in the Borough has been supplied with necessary apparatus for sending specimens for examination and many medical men have availed themselves of the opportunity thus afforded to them. During the year ending December 31st, 1903, 102 examinations were made of blood and membrane for Enteric Fever and Diphtheria—16 for Enteric Fever and 86 for Diphtheria—with the result that for Enteric Fever.

A steam disinfecting , apparatus (Washington Lyons) is provided at the Council's Yard, in which all articles of clothing and bedding are disinfected. The building is divided into two rooms, into each of which the apparatus has an opening. One side is reserved for receiving articles about to undergo disinfection, the other for removing them from the apparatus after the process is completed. There are two vans employed, one for use in collecting , infected articles, the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is ever made. During the year 1,164 rooms were disinfected, and 8,462 articles were subjected to steam disinfection at the Council's Yard. Only a few complaints were received during the year as to damage done to bedding, &c.; every care is taken by the disinfectors. Most of the articles destroyed was by desire of the owners. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis, where required, by the staff. Table No. 3 gives detailed account of the work done during the year. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD. Table No. 3.

The Public Health (London) Act, 1891 Section 60, Sub- Section 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings, for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. The premises are situated in Watson Street, and were used but once during the year. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. The site in Watson Street having , now been purchased, the Public Health Committee trust that there will be no delay in the erection of the building , and that the scheme will embrace the opening out of Baildon Street, making a thoroughfare into Douglas Street, and so improve one of the worst streets in the Borough. The dead bodies received into the present mortuary during the year numbered 95. The Coroner held 98 inquests, with the result that 38 were found to have died from natural causes, 56 from accidental causes, and 4 from suicide. REVENUE ACT, 1903. In 189O Parliament passed the Customs and Inland Revenue Act (53 Vict. Cap. 8), in which (Section 26, 2) they granted exemption from inhabited house duty, for houses used solely for providing separate dwellings at rents not exceeding seven shillings and sixpence a week for each dwelling, provided that a certificate is produced from the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the house is situated, to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, with due provision for their sanitary requirements. The Medical Officer of Health must examine such premises on request for the purpose of ascertaining whether such certificate can properly be given. In 1891 Parliament extended the benefits of the Act, and in 1903, the provisions were again extended and embodied in a new Section (Revenue Act, 1903, Sect. 11), the previous enactments being repealed except with regard to the mode of obtaining the certificate. The exact words of the Section are: — II. (i.) Where a house, so far as it is used as a dwelling house, is used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings:— (a) The value of any dwelling in the house which is of an annual value below twenty pounds, shall be excluded from the annual value of the house for the purposes of inhabited house duty; and (b) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual value of twenty pounds, but not exceeding forty pounds, shall be reduced to three pence; and (c) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual rate exceeding forty pounds, but not exceeding sixty pounds, shall be reduced to sixpence. During the year 40 dwellings were inspected in Whiteher Street and Trundley Road, of these 36 received certificates, the remaining 4 were unsatisfactory. Certificates were also granted in respect of the London County Council's buildings, Sylva Cottages in Mill Lane, which comprise 24 tenements, each cottage is self-contained, and consists of living rooms, scullery, water-closet, and two bedrooms, with a small garden in the rear, accommodation is provided for 144 persons, and 33 certificates were also given to the tenements recently erected in Church Street, after certain sanitary defects had been remedied, making a total of 93. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The total number of samples purchased during the year 1903 and submitted to the Public Analyist for the borough, was 302. The following is a list of the samples taken, with the number found to be adulterated:— 21 Table No. 4 SAMPLES TAKEN DURING THE YEAR 1903. Article. Total No. of Samples. No. of Samples Genuine.

The bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, made by the Council pursuant to Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, viz.:— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied ; (b) for the registration of houses so let or occupied ; (c) for the inspection of such houses ; (d) for enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses ; (c) for the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises ; (f) for the taking of precautions in case of infectious disease, received the sanction of the Local Government Board. November 22nd, 1902, and during the year the undermentioned premises were registered : — Nos. 1 to 75, Giffin Street, odd numbers (inclusive). Nos. 19, 21, 23, 29, 31, 33, 68 and 70, Mill Lane. Nos. 118, 120 and 122, Friendly Street. There are many houses which come within the definition of " houses let in lodgings " in this Borough, which, no doubt, will be placed on the register during the present year. COMMON LODGING-HOUSE ACTS, 1851 AND 1853. The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common Lodging-houses.

HOUSE PROPERTY INSPECTIONS, &c. A summary of the Sanitary work done during the year will be found on Table No. 6. The total number of premises inspected was 3,330, whilst re-inspections, calls, service of notices, &c, amounted to 13,130. The number of preliminary notices or " Intimations " served during the year was 1,120, whilst the number of Statutory Notices served was but 90, and in only 6 cases was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders.

This Act places a duty on "every District Council to keep a register of all Workshops situate within its district." At the end of the year 1903, the number of premises registered was 755, and the number of inspections made was 984; details of the class of workers and particulars dealt with will be found in the table in the appendix. All places where food is prepared for sale, as restaurants, cookshops, fried fish shops, coffee shops, and aerated water factories received special attention during the year, and notices served to remedy any defects that were found to exist. In no case was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the Act. DAIRIES AND MILKSHOPS. Under the London Government Act, 1899, it became the duty of the Metropolitan Borough Councils to enforce the byelaw.s and regulations with respect to Dairies and Milkshops; at the close of the year, 189 milkshops were on the register, and 315 inspections had been made during the year, for the purpose of " securing cleanliness of milk vessels used for containing milk for sale," and " for prescribing precautions to be taken for protecting milk against infection or contamination." The following letter was sent to all purveyors of milk in the Borough : — METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD. December 8th, 1903. Dairiks, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885 "Drinking from Milk Vessels." It having come to my knowledge that there is a practice existing amongst men in the employ of Dairymen and Milk- sellers, and in charge of milk rounds, of drinking from and allowing- other persons to drink from vessels in use on their various rounds, I desire to direct your attention to the alleged practice, and to request that you will give such instructions to the men in your employ as will prevent the occurrence of such a practice amongst them. Henry William Roberts, Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. ICE CREAM. According to the regulations of the London County Council (General Powers) Act. which came into force on November 1st, 1902, certain important provisions relating to the manufacture and storage of ice-cream were demanded, and a very great improvement has taken place in the ice-cream premises during the year. The number of premises registered was 98, and these have received 288 inspections, and a number of defects which were found to exist on the premises were remedied. BAKEHOUSES. There are in all 79 bakehouses in the Borough, of these 34 were underground. According-to Section 101 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, that after January 1st, 1904, no underground bakehouse shall be used as a bakehouse, unless certified by the District Council to be suitable for that purpose; during the year 27 certificates were so granted. Inspections to the number of 474 were made from time to time of all the bakehouses, to secure lime-washing and cleansing, etc., required by the Act. COW-HOUSES.

During; the year I have visited those portions of the Canal and Deptford Creek, within the Borough, for the purpose of inspection, on the following dates : — February 6th and 12th ; March 21st; April 15th ; May 11th; June 6th and 9th; July Ist and 24th; August 7th and 18th ; October 2nd and 19th; November 4th, 13th, 19th and 25th; December 3rd, 16th and 30th. Number of visits, 20. Boats were found and inspected on the following dates : - October 19th, November 4th, 13th, 19th and 25th and December 3rd. Number of boats inspected, 6. One boat, " Sarah," No. 297, registered at Brentford, inspected on October 19th, was found defective. The glazing of the hatch in roof of cabin was broken, allowing rain to enter, also defects allowing leakage into sleeping bunk and store cupboard. Owners of boat written to and the defects were remedied, and an intimation was received from the Inspector at Brentford that the necessary work was done. One boat "James," Canal No. 257, was found on November 19th, apparently used without registration. This boat has apparently been in use as a dwelling boat, but is now in use as a lighter only. The owners were cautioned that the boat must not be used again as a dwelling without registration. Very few boats within the jurisdiction of the Canal Boats Acts now ply on the Canal within the Borough ; they are principally barges, lighters, and flats carrying certificates under the Merchant Shipping Acts. This Borough is not a registration authority. Thomas Turner, Inspector. Table No. 7. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health.
