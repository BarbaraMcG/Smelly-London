To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the Borough for the year 1905. The statistics of births, deaths and infectious diseases relate to the 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1905. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on April 6th, 1901, was 137,289, having increased from 113,781 during the previous five years. The population in the middle of 1905, estimated on the assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed between 1896 and 1901 has been maintained since, was 157,210, and on this figure the statistics in this report are based. The following table shows the increase of the population of the Borough during the last 50 years. 4 TABLE 1. Persons to the Acre. Increase per cent. during previous intercensal period. Year.

The marriages registered during the year numbered 1207 compared with 1227, 1182 and 1123 in the three preceding years. The marriage-rate, i-e., the number of persons married per 1000 inhabitants, was 15.4, the average rate for the previous ten years being 16.4. The marriage-rate of the County of London was 16.9, and that of England and Wales 15.2 BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The total number of births registered in the borough during the year was 4,760-2,443 of males and 2,317 of 5 females. This is equivalent to a birth-rate of 30.3 per 1,000 of the estimated population, Which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The steady decline in the birth-rate of Fulham of recent years, which is shared by nearly every part of the United Kingdom, will be seen on reference to Table II. The birth-rate of the County of London was 27.1, which was lower than that recorded in any preceding year, and was 2.2 per 1,000 below the average for the ten years 1895-1904. Among the various metropolitan boroughs the birth-rates ranged Prom 13.3 in the City of London, 16.2 in Hampstead and 16.8 in Westminster, to 33.5 in Shoreditch, 34.7 in Finsbury, and 35.3 in Stepney.

Note.—The deaths included in Column 7 of this table are the whole of those registered during the year as having actually occurred within the the district or division. The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column 11, By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public Institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The "Public Institutions" taken into account for the purposes of these tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses, and lunatic asylums.

Corrected for these the birth-rate of Margravine Ward was 36.4, and that of the Borough 29.9. Illegitimacy. The illegitimate births numbered 262 —140 males and 122 females —or 5.5 per cent. of the total births, as against 3.7 per cent. in the County of London. Still-born Children. 150 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 32 living. 8 Escess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population of the Borough by the excess of births over deaths was 2396, compared with 2559, 2417 and 2302 in the three preceding years. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The deaths of 2,351 persons-1,190 males and 1,164 females-were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 331-181 males and 150 females-were of persons not residing in the district who died in public institutions within the borough; while the deaths of 341 inhabitants of Flham -197 males and 144 females-occurred outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 2,364 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham-1,206 males and 1,158 females-being in the proportion of 15.1 deaths per 1,000 persons living, the rate for males being 16.5, and for females 13.9. With the exception of that for 1903 this is the lowest death -rate recorded in Fulham. The death-rate of the County of London for 1905 was 15.1, being 2.7 per 1,000 below the average rate for the ten years 1895-1904. Among the Metropolitan Boroughs the lowest death-rates were 9.3 in Hampstead, 11.7 in Lewisham, and 12.6 in Wandsworth, and the highest 18.7 in Bermondsey, 19.0 in Finsbury, and 19.7 in Shoreditch. The death-rate of England and Wales was 15.2, and that of 76 large towns, i.e., towns which contained more than 50,000 inhabitants at the Census of 1901, 15.7. 9 Distribution of Deaths. Table IV., which in prepared in accordance with the Instructions of the Local Government Board, gives the causes of, and the ages at, death. In Table IV. will also be found the numbers and the causes of the deaths in the several wards of the borough, and Table V. gives the annual death-rates of each ward since 1896, when the existing division of the borough was made.

They are also, in columns 9 —16, included among the deaths in their respective "Localities" according to the previous addresses of the deceased as given by the Registrars. Deaths of "Non-residents" occurring in public institutions in the district are in like manner excluded from columns 2 —8 and 9—16 of this Table. (b) See notes on Table I. as to the meaning of "Residents" and "Non-residents," and as to the "Public Institutions" taken into account for the purposes of these Tables. (c) All deaths occurring in public institutions situated within the district, whether of "Residents" or of "Non-residents," are, in addition to being dealt with as in note (a), entered in the last column of this Table (d) Under the heading of "Diarrhoea" are included deaths certified as from diarrhoea alone or in combination with some other cause of ill-defined nature; and also deaths certified as from Epidemic enteritis Zymotic enteritis ; Epidemic diarrhoea ; Summer diarrhoea n„cD,,.nr„ j: 1 Dysentery and dysenteric diarrhcea ; Choleraic diarrhoea, cholera, cholera nostras (in the absence of Asiatic cholera) Under the heading of " Enteritis " are included those certified as from Gastro-enteritis, Muco-enteritis, and Gastric catarrh, unles from information obtained by enquiry from the certifying practitioner or otherwise the Medical Officer of Health has reason for including such deaths, especially those for infants, under the specific term " Diarrhcea " Under the headings of " Cancer," " Phthisis," and " Puerperal fever " are included all registered deaths from causes comprised within these general terms. Deaths from Diarrhæa secondary to some other well-defined disease are included under the latter. 13 12 TABLE V. Death-rate per 1,000 Population in each Ward. Barons Court Ward. Hurlingham Ward.

The Medical Officer of Health of the County of London, Sir Shirley Murphy, has published a factor for the correction of differences in the age and sex constitution of each metropolitan borough. This is arrived at by obtaining the age and sex distribution of the population of a borough at the last census, and after ascertaining the death-rate for each sex, at each age period, in England and Wales during the last ten years, a calculation is made of the number of deaths which would have occurred in the district had similar rates prevailed, and a "standard" death-rate is obtained. The difference between this rate and that of England and Wales is assumed to be due to differences in the age and sex constitution of the population of the district, and by dividing the latter by the former a Factor is obtained for correcting the crude death-rate of the district. 13 Corrected in this way the death-rates of Fulham, the County of London and the adjoining boroughs were as miller: — TABLE VI. Crude Death-rate. Corrected Death-rate. 1905. 1905. Fulham 15.1 15.8 Kensington 14.0 15.1 Hammersmith 13.9 14.5 Chelsea 14.8 15.3 Country of London 15.1 15.9 Seasonal Mortality. The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under: — Deaths. Death-rate. First quarter 601 15.29 Second quarter 570 14.47 Third quarter 605 15.36 Fourth quarter 588 14.93 Mortality in Former Years. In Table 11. will be found the number of deaths and the death-rate for each of the ten preceding years. The difference between the rate for 1905 and the average rate for the ten preceding years (1895-1904) represents a saving of 324 lives. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. Of the 2,364 deaths registered, 692, or 29.3 per cent., were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year in births registered, was 145 per 1,000, being 15 per 1,000 below the decennial average. Although lower than in any year excepting 1903, the infantile mortality was relatively very unsatisfactory, as it was 16 per 1,000 above that of the County of London, and was exceeded in six only of the 29 metropolitan boroughs, the rates in which ranged from 88 in Marylebone, 92 in Holborn and Lewisham, and 94 in Hanip- 14 stead, to 151 in Bethnal Green, 153 in Poplar, and 167 in Shoreditch. In England and Wales the rate of infantile mortality was 128 per 1,000 deaths, and in the 76 large towns it averaged 140 per 1,000. Causes of Infantile Mortality. The following tables give the causes of infantile deaths at various periods under one year in the whole of the borough and in the wards into which it is divided. Of the 692 deaths, 119 or 17 per cent. occurred in the first week of life and 189 or 27 per cent. in the first four weeks of life. In the second month 12.5 per cent. and in the third 7.4 per cent. of the deaths under one year occurred or 47 per cent. in the first three months of life. In the second three months 20 per cent, during the third three months 16.6 per cent., and during the last three months 16.4 per cent. of all the first year deaths occurred. More than half the deaths of infants in the first four weeks of life were ascribed to premature birth or congenital defects and the majority of the deaths at this age period are mainly due to the ill-health or defective nutrition of the mother. Of the deaths occurring after the first month, no less than 186 or 37 per cent. of all the deaths at the ages of one to eleven months were due to diarrhæal diseases and it is to the enormous diarrhæal mortality that the relatively high infantile death-rate of Fulham is largely due, as the proportion of deaths under one year from diarrhæal diseases was 38 per 1,000 compared with 26 per 1,000 in the County of London. As has been frequently pointed out in these reports, nearly all these deaths occur in hand-fed children, and a large proportion are undoubtedly due to ignorance or carelessness. The London County Council now forward every week a list of the births attended by registered midwives in the preceding week, amounting to about 40 per cent. of the total numbe r, and these babies are visited by Mrs. Davies, the sanitary inspector, who does what she can to secure the well-being of the child and takes steps to remedy any insanitary conditions discovered in their homes. The Borough Council has also issued a leaflet on infant feeding, which is distributed by Mrs. Davies, district visitors and others. TABLE VII. INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1905.

Deaths from all Causes at all Ages - 181. (Estimated to middle of 1905.) B 1 24 Distribution of Infantile Deaths The infantile death-rates in the several wards of the Borough since 1901, when particulars of the localities of births were first obtained, are given in the following table : — Deaths under one year per 1,000 Births 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. Baron's Court Ward 156 137 111 100 186 Lillie Ward 154 165 143 143 153 Walham Ward 201 170 147 191 189 Margravine Ward 116 136 143 158 132 Munster Ward 153 134 129 145 141 Hurlingham Ward 149 100 106 162 99 Sands End Ward 176 184 123 157 170 Town Ward 119 107 77 122 106 It will be noticed that except in 1902 Walham Ward has always had the highest death-rate, which is due to the heavy mortality among infants in the " Avenues " on the north of Fulham Road. Deaths of Illegitimate Infants. Eighty-six of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 328 deaths to every 1,000 births, compared with 132 deaths to every 1,000 births among children born in wedlock. In the subjoined table will be found the causes of and the ages at death of the illegitimate infants. It will be seen that only 21 per cent, of the deaths of illegitimate infants occurred during the first four weeks of life, compared with 27 per cent, of the deaths of legitimate, but there was a marked fall in the mortality of the latter after the first four weeks, there being nearly 30 per cent, fewer deaths at the ages of one and two months than in the first month of life, while among illegitimates there were 50 per cent, more deaths in the second and third months 25 than in the first, which must be attributed to the evils of nursing out. 29 of the deaths of illegitimate children, or one third of the total number,were ascribed to diarrhoea, representing a mortality of 111 deaths to every 1,000 births, compared with a mortality of 3O per 1,000 among legitimate infants.

Between the ages of one and five years 323 deaths were recorded, bo that the deaths of children under the age of five years numbered 1,015 or 43 per cent, of the total number. These deaths were equivalent to an annual rate of 49.6 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies' Acts were issued in respect of 630 children under the age of live years, 62 per cent, of the children dying at this age-period being insured. Mortality at School Age. At the ages of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 72 deaths, or 3 per cent, of those at all ages, representing a mortality of 2.3 per 1,000 of those living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. Between the ages of 15 and 25 years, 113 deaths, or 4.8 per cent, of the total number, were recorded; the rate of mortality being 4.0 per 1,000. Mortality at Maturity. 721, or 32.5 per cent., of the deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65, the mortality at this age-period being at the rate of 9.8 per 1,000. Mortality at Decline. At the age of 65 and upward 443 deaths were registered, or 18.8 per cent, of those at all ages, corresponding to a death rate of 90.5. 27 DEATHS FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASES. To the seven principal infectious diseases 424 deaths were ascribed, corresponding to a death-rate of 2.70 per 1,000. The death-rate from these diseases in the County of London was 170 per 1,000, being 0.72 per 1,000 below the mean rate in the ten years 1895-1904. Among the several Metropolitan boroughs the lowest rates were 0.53 in Hampstead, 0.57 in the City of London ard 0.81 in Westminster, and the highest were 2.65 in Poplar, 270 in Fulham, and 2.96 in Shoreditch. The corresponding rate in England and Wales was 1.52, and in the 76 large towns 1088. In Table IX. will be found the number of deaths from each of the principal infectious diseases in 1905 and in the ten preceding years, and in Table X. the death-rate per 1,000 of the population of eacli ward in 1905.

SCARLET FEVER. There was a marked increase in the prevalence of Scarlet Fever in 1905, 779 cases being notified as against 294 in 1904. The returns for the four quarters were: — Cases. Deaths. Ist Quarter 95 7 2nd „ 181 4 3rd „ 297 6 4th „ 206 6 There was a decided rise in the number of cases notified in May, when the disease as a rule is but little in evidence, and they continued above the average until December, and were not affected by the school holidays in July and August. As is always the case the spread of infection was largely due to the mild unrecognised cases. Thus, in the course of some enquiries into the prevalence of the disease in Kingwood Road and the neighbourhood, I found six children suffering from the disease, the nature of which had not been recognised. Isolation. —Of the 779 cases notified, 729 or 92.3 percent, were removed to hospital for treatment. Fatality. —The disease was generally of a mild type, but the case mortality, which was just under 3 per cent., was higher than in 1904, when it was only 1.4 per cent. Distribution. —In Table XII. will be found the number of cases notified in each ward of the Borough, and the subjoined table gives the proportional prevalence of Scarlet Fever in the various wards during 1905 and the preceding 9 years.

Fatality. —The disease terminated fatally in 24 instances, the proportion of deaths to notified cases being 8.4 per cent. The reduction of recent years in the fatality of Diphtheria, due mainly to the use of antitoxic serum, will be seen from the following table: — 37 TABLE XIX. Number of Deaths.

Fourteen cases of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria occurred within two weeks of the return of a child living in the. same house, from one of the Metropolitan Asylums .Hoard's hospitals, after recovery from a similar attack. ENTERIC FEVER. Fifty-six cases of Enteric Fever were notified, or 3.6 per 10,000 inhabitants, the average for the preceding ten years being 5.8 per 10,000. Of those certified to be suffering from the disease 40, or 71.5 per cent., were removed to hospital. In eight instances the disease was contracted outside the Borough. Fatality. —In ten cases the disease proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 18 per cent. 38 The incidence of Enteric Fever in Fulhara during the preceding 10 years is shown in the following table: — TABLE XX.

A circular letter was received from the Borough Council of Holborn stating that they had under consideration the reports of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the past four years, and that their attention had been drawn to the fact that during that time no less than 10,000 patients had been admitted suffering from diseases for which the Board's Hospitals were not provided, and that they had been detained on an average about three weeks at a total cost for the whole period of about .£60,000, and that, having regard to these figures, they wished to ascertain whether in the view of other Metropolitan Boroughs interested, a joint conference on the subject between the Metropolitan Boroughs and the Asylums Board could with advantage be held to discuss the matter. The letter further stated that among 39 the suggestions that had been made was one that the Medical Officer of Health should be required to confirm the diagnosis in eacli case. The Hospitals Committee of the Asylums Board to whom the circular letter was referred submitted the following report, which was adopted by the Board and forwarded to the Metropolitan Borough Councils: — "As regards the financial statement the Holborn "Borough Council seems to have been misled. The "Accountant of the Board has estimated that the extra cost "to which the Board has been put by the admission of these "patients would not exceed an average sum of £3,200 per "annum. "As regards the matter which it is proposed to discuss, "it is undeniable that in the earlier stages of many cases of "infectious disorder there can be no absolute certainty of "diagnosis, and that to detain at home every patient until "such certainty is obtained must frequently result in the "spread of infection, the prevention of which is the primary "object of the Board's hospitals. "It must, therefore, be always preferable to remove a "doubtful case than to leave it outside with the danger of "infecting others, which if done would of necessity increase "the number of admissions and thus cause a very consider"able expenditure of the rates. "The business of the Managers is to receive cases which "are certified by a qualified practitioner, provide proper "accommodation, and then leave them in the experienced "hands of the Medical Superintendents. "In our opinion the Managers would be going quite "beyond the scope of their functions if they took any step "which would have the effect of discouraging medical "practitioners from freely exercising their judgment in "seeking for their patients admission to the Board's "hospitals. c 1 40 "The suggestion that the Medical Officer of Health "should confirm the diagnosis is not one for the Board; but "in our opinion it is very doubtful whether such a proceeding "would be of any value, and it certainly would be attended "with distinct disadvantages. "We do not see that any useful purpose would be served "by such a conference as the Borough of Holborn suggest, "and we cannot recommend the Managers to take any part "therein." The Public Health Committee, who had been advised to a similar effect, expressed their agreement with the views of the Asylums Board. Isolation of Patients suffering from Infectious Diseases. Accommodation for persons suffering from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Typhus Fever, and Small-pox, is provided by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at their various hospitals, and the increasing recognition by the public of the advantages accruing from the isolation of the infectious sick, is shown by the steadily increasing proportion of patients suffering from those diseases who are removed to hospital. 41 TABLE XXI.

Puerperal Fever. 24 cases of Puerperal Fever, or 5.1 per 1,000 births, were notified, of which 9 proved fatal, or 1.9 per 1,000 births. Two cases, both terminating fatally, occurred in the practice of an unregistered woman who practised as a midwife but did not describe herself as such. By the Mid wives Act, 1902, it was provided that after the first day of April, 1905, no woman who was not certified under the Act shall take or use the name or title of midwife, and that after April Ist, 1910, no woman shall, habitually and for gain, attend women in child-birth otherwise than under the direction of a qualified medical practitioner, unitless she be certified under the Act. Erysipelas. 144 persons were certified to be suffering from Erysipelas, which was the assigned cause of 4 deaths. c 2 42 DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles.

A communication was received from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board asking for the views of the Council on a Memorial which the Managers had received from the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, on the subject of the provision by the Metropolitan Asylums Board of hospital accommodation for the treatment and isolation of patients suffering from pulmonary phthisis. The Memorial was as follows:- (1) That between 7,000 and 8,000 persons (of whom the large majority are adults in the prime of life) die every year in London from pulmonary phthisis (consumption), the mortality in the male sex being some 40 per cent, greater than in the female sex, and that a much larger number of persons (also chiefly adults) suffer from ill-health arising from the same disease. (2) That great loss accrues to the community from these deaths and this morbidity from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) and many deaths and much illness and suffering might be prevented were hospitals provided for the treatment of this disease. (3) That persons suffering from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) may be divided roughly into two classes: —(1) those in the primary stage of the disease, which is curable and not specially infectious; and (2) those in the chronic stage of the disease, which is incurable and very infectious. (4) That for those in the primary stage of the disease hospitals are required, wherein they may be treated with a view to cure, and for those in the chronic stage refuges, wherein patients may be isolated so as to be prevented from spreading the disease to others. 47 (5) That the present existing provision of hospitals for pulmonary phthisis (consumption) in London is totally inadequate, and that, in connection with such provision as there is, great difficulty and consequent delay is experienced in obtaining admittance thereto, more especially when, as usually is the case, the "letter" system prevails, rendering it necessary for patients not only to have to wait long for their turn, and so lose the advantage of special and valuable treatment in the early stage of the disease, but also to find that, when admitted, they are rarely kept in hospital long enough to obtain a cure. (6) That the pressing need for the moment is the provision of a hospital or hospitals in the country for the treatment of persons in the acute and curable stage of the disease. (7) That, having regard to the provision now made, or which could be made, in separate wards at the various Poor Law Infirmaries, the chronic cases might, for the present at any rate, be kept in town, where they could be visited by their friends. (8) That the need for sanatoria arises from the fact that it is practically impossible to treat poor persons in their own homes, or in Poor Law Infirmaries, in London with any reasonable hope of cure. (9) That the great bulk of the cases occur amongst the poor and the poorest classes of the people, who are unable to make any contribution towards the expenses incident to sanatorium treatment. N.B. —In 1899 (the only year for which reliable statistics are available) a third of the deaths in London from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) occurred in Poor Law Institutions. Many of these sufferers might have been cured, could they have obtained sanatorium treatment at the beginning of their illnesses and a large amount of poverty and charge on the rates have been thereby avoided. It is well known 48 that many persons reduced by consumption to a state of poverty drift into the workhouse, and become a permanent charge on the rates, often leaving widows and orphans in a state of destitution, whereas many such persons might be cured if sanatorium treatment were made available for them in the early stages of their diseases. (10) That whilst the deaths in London, in 1904, from the diseases admissable to the Board's hospitals (smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria and fever) aggregated only 1,415, of which 1,094 were due to scarlet fever and diphtheria, upwards of 90 per cent. being deaths of children under the age of five years, the deaths from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) alone, and exclusive of all other tubercular diseases, were 7,738 in number, and of these a vast proportion were deaths of adult men and women, more especially men in the prime of life. (11) That the money value to the community of the lives lost every year from this preventable and curable disease is enormous, and immensely transcends an y possible cost to the rates by sanatorium provision. Your Memorialists, having given all these points consideration, and believing that it would be in the best interests of the community, earnestly pray the Managers to take necessary steps, as they may think desirable, forthwith, and respectfully suggest the following:— (1) That an Order of the Local Government Board be obtained to make Section 5 of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, applicable to the case of "poor persons" suffering from pulmonary phthisis (consumption), and if necessary, (2) That an Act be obtained to make the provisions of Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, applicable to pulmonary phthisis (consumption) as if such disease was therein mentioned as well as "fever or small-pox or diphtheria." 49 On the recommendation of the Public Health Committee it was resolved to inform the Metropolitan Asylums Board that the Council is strongly of opinion that much benefit would be derived, and the health of the Metropolis would be greatly improved if steps were taken to establish institutions for dealing with cases of consumption, and therefore the Council is in favour of the adoption of the suggestions contained in the memorial of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. The Local Government Board, however, last month informed the Managers, who had applied to them for their opinion, that "the subject has received much careful consideration on the part of the Board, but that the information at present before them does not appear to afford sufficient justification for the very heavy outlay which would be involved in the proposal." Influenza. 12 deaths were registered from Influenza, the numbers from the three preceding years being 36, 17 and 18. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 134 deaths, being 28 in excess of the average of the past 10 years, allowing for the increase of the population. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases there were 468 deaths, or 19.8 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 52 below the corrected decennial average. Alcoholism. 29 deaths were directly attributed to Alcoholism or to Cirrhosis of the Liver, against 39, 28 and 41 in the preceding years, and in twelve cases the disease to which death was due was stated to have been accelerated by alcohol, but these represent hut a email proportion of the actual number. The Council during the year published placards calling attention to the baleful effects of alcohol, as set forth in the report of the Committee on Physical Deterioration presented to Parliament. 50 Glanders. Glanders was the cause of the death of a man who had been employed in some omnibus stables in Filmer Road in which several horses were found to be affected with chronic glanders. Certification of the Causes of Death. Of the 2,364 deaths registered, 2,176 or 92 % were certified by registered medical practitioners and 187 by the Coroner after inquest, only one death, that of a prematurely born infant, being uncertified. Inquests. At the 187 inquests held on inhabitants of Fulham, the following verdicts were returned: — TABLE XXVI. Deaths from natural causes 101 Death through accident or negligence— Run over 7 20 Falls 10 Burns or Scalds Drowning 3 Suffocation by food 3 Suffocation of infants in bed 14 Want of attention at birth 3 Contact with live electric rail 1 Surgical narcosis 1 Food poisoning 1 Other injuries 8 Suicide— 71 Poison 6 Strangulation 2 Gunshot 1 Hanging 1 Drowning 2 12 Homicide 2 Open verdict—found dead 1 187 51 DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. Although the two Boroughs, Fulham and Hammersmith, which formerly constituted the Fulham Union, are now separated for poor law purposes, the poor of Hammersmith, are still, pending the completion of the Hammersmith Workhouse and Infirmary, accommodated in these institutions. In 1905 the deaths of 579 persons occurred in the Infirmary and of 30 in the Workhouse. Of these 387 belonged to Fulham and 2.22 to Hammersmith and other districts. Western Fever Hospital. 137 deaths occurred in the Western Fever Hospital, of these 39 belonged to Fulham and 98 to other Metropolitan Boroughs. Deaths occurring outside the Borough among persons belonging thereto. The deaths of residents in Fulham in public institutions and elsewhere outside the Borough numbered 342, and occurred in the following places: — TABLE XXVII.

All infected articles were disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station, Townmead Road. The total cost of the station for the year was £ 1,052, including £105 for interest and £ 216 for repayment of principal. During the three last years the work was done by a contractor the cost averaged £1,257, and at that time disinfection was not carried out after Measles or Tuberculosis, as is now the case. PUBLIC MORTUARY. 165 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year, and were admitted as follows: — At the request of the Coroner 152 Brought in by the Police 12 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 1 165 Inquests were held on 164 and post-mortem examinations were made in 69 of the above cases. 54 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The facilities afforded by the Council for the bacteriological examinations of suspected material as an aid to diagnosis continue to be much appreciated by medical practitioners, and the following specimens were examined during the year: — Number of Specimens. Material from cases of suspected Diphtheria.

At the end of 1904 there were 380 workshops on the register, and during 1905 24 have been removed and 81 added, so that at the end of 1905 there were 437 registered workshops. The workshops were regularly inspected during the year, and on the whole an improvement in their condition was noted. Only 75 notices relating to cleanliness were served, as compared with 148 in 1904. Proceedings were taken against the occupier of a joinery factory for failing to comply with the Council's notice to provide suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences, and a fine of £5 was imposed. 55 Bakehouses. These were kept under regular supervision and nine notices served in respect of them were at once complied with. Restaurants and Coffee Houses. 98 restaurants have been registered and have been kept under regular observation.

The stalls and shops where food is sold or stored have been regularly inspected. 59 Thirteen boxes of fish and 40 cases of fruit examined at the request of the owners were condemned and destroyed. Proceedings were taken against a tradesman in Kings Road in respect of some unsound meat which was found on his premises, and a fine of £15 was imposed. The defendant subsequently appealed against the decision of the magistrate on the ground that the proceedings had not been authorised by the Council. In this case (Giebler v. Manning), a Sanitary Inspector under the Council visited the premises of the appellant, who was a pork and beef butcher in Kings Road, and found in the boiling house some decomposing meat which he seized and at once brought before the magistrate who condemned it and ordered it to be destroyed. A summons under Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was, on the same afternoon, granted to the Inspector on behalf of the Council, but before applying for the summons he did not report the facts to the borough council or any committee appointed by them. He had never received any express authority by resolution or in writing, general or special, from the Council or from the committee authorising him to make complaints or take proceedings on their behalf. It was contended before the magistrate that by Section 107 (3) of the Public Health Act it was necessary that the inspector should report to the sanitary authority, and that they should authorise their Inspector to apply for a summons and act as prosecutor against the alleged offender. No such report was made, nor did the Borough Council or any Committee expressly direct or authorise the Inspector to make the complaint and take the proceedings. The magistrate was of the opinion "that the reports required by Section 107 (3) were confined to (a) nuisances discovered by the Inspectors themselves under Section 1 or other sections; (b) inquiries by them into complaints, which were made as to nuisances and offences against the statute and against statutory by-laws by private individuals under (amongst other) Sections 3 and 21, and as stated in evidence at the hearing these two classes of reports were always made, and as a fact consequent 60 process was always applied for by the council's solicitor. The offence in the present instance did not happen to fall into either class. But even if it did, the language of the Section 107 (3) 'subject to the direction of the Sanitary Authority or a committee thereof' was capable at least of meaning such direction as it might choose to give, but however this might be, there was nothing in section 107 (3) or as regards committees in section 99 (4) compelling the authority to give directions in any particular form or manner and, if so, he thought that the course of business adopted by the council and committees might well justify the action of the respondent as resting upon an implied direction and authority on ratification." The magistrate accordingly convicted the appellant. On the hearing of the appeal by a Divisional Court consisting of the Lord Chief Justice of England, Mr. Justice Darling and Mr. Justice Bray, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that Section 107 (3) made it a condition precedent that the Inspector prosecuting should have the express authority of the Sanitary Authority, the case of Isle of Wight Ferry Co. v. Ryde Commissioners, 25 J.P. 454, being cited in support of the contention and it was urged that the fact that the summons was taken out on behalf of the Sanitary Authority was important as regards liability for costs. The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment, said that the appeal must fail, as the case was practically covered by authority. The really important question was whether an individual could take proceedings under Section 47 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. He agreed that section 47 operated to give only certain powers to individuals, and that for certain purposes the rights and duties of the Sanitary luspector and Medical Officer were hedged in by provisions for the protection of the ratepayers and of the sanitary authority, who were or might be their principals. If the sanitary authority were going to delegate their power to take proceedings to a particular officer they must do so under Section 123 by a resolution. If a committee was going to authorise some one on their behalf to make complaints they must do so in accordance with Section 99 (4). 61 Therefore, for the purpose of liability for costs and of the question whether any proceedings had been taken on behalf of the sanitary authority those provisions were of very great importance. But they were beside the mark in this case, the question here being whether a private individual could take proceedings under Section 47 (2). Could it be contended that the only persons who could take proceedings under Section 47 (2) were the Medical Officer of Health or the Sanitary Inspector, or the Council who authorised them? It was said that the right to take proceedings was limited by the opening words of the Section, but that contention went too far, in view of the object of the Statute, which was intended to ensure food being wholesome and to prevent diseased food from being exposed for sale. To restrict the right of any individual to lay an information there ought to have been express words to that effect. For the reasons stated in "Back v. Holmes" (51 J.P, 693), it was not open to argument that a private individual could not lay an information. It was said that in this case the information was laid by the respondent on behalf of the Borough Council, but on that point this case was covered by "Allman v. Hardcastle" (67 J. P., 440), where it was decided that the words "on behalf of the Borough Council" in the summons could be rejected as surplusage. As the power to lay an information was not limited to the persons referred to in the earlier part of Section 47, it could not be contended that because there were in the Act certain sections protecting the sanitary authority, these proceedings were had ah initio. The case of "Isle of Wight Ferry Company v. Ryde Commissioners" (25 J.P., 454), was a very different case from the present. That was a case of an alleged nuisance on a foreshore, and involved very different considerations. The statute there in question (the Nuisances Removal Act, 1855) was not a statute of the character of the Public Health Acts dealing with a matter of great public importance, and the point that a private individual could not take proceedings for a nuisance was not raised there, nor could it have been raised. The respondent in the present case was entitled as a private individual to lay an information and take out a summons, and the fact that the sanitary authority was protected as regards 62 costs was not sufficient to enable the Court to say that these proceedings ought not to have been instituted by him. The other learned Judges agreed, and the appeal was accordingly dismissed, but without costs. PKOCEEDINGS UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The following samples were purchased for analysis in 1905. Number of Samples. Number Adulterated. Number Inferior. Percentage age of Adulteration. Article.

Percentage of Adulteration. 1900 363 21 5.8 1901 366 24 6.6 1902 354 18 5.1 487 54 11.1 1903 17.1 1904 673 115 The percentage of adulteration is extremely high, being more than double that for the County of London in 1904, the most recent year for which statistics have been published. The marked increase in adulteration of late, coincides with the appointment of a special Food Inspector, and must be looked 63 upon as being due to an improvement in our methods of sampling, rather than to a sudden lapse of the honesty of Fulham tradesmen. The system of purchasing unofficial samples has been continued, and 299 were taken without the formalities prescribed by the Act. of which 73 or 24.4 per cent. were condemned. Further experience has confirmed the views I expressed last year, that it is the well known regular customer who is victimised at many shops. Another method of fraudulent trading that has been detected is that of the itinerant vendor who goes from house to house and professes to sell butter which has been sent up to him direct from farmers in the country. The Inspector obtained from customers samples of "butter" which had been purchased as Devonshire butter from a man of the above description, all of which on analysis proved to be margarine. The vendor when asked by the customer for his address gave a false one, but after considerable trouble was eventually traced to a house in Battersea, and on his next visit an official sample was taken at a customer's house, and this being returned as margarine a summons was taken out and a penalty of £10 inflicted. It was ascertained that the defendant had been in business in this way for some years, during the whole of which he had been selling margarine got up in an attractive style at the price of, and as, pure Devonshire butter. Another man, who was found to be carrying on the same fraud, apparently obtained information that the Inspector was on his track, and stopped doing business in Fulham before an official sample could be procured. Although the number of samples taken in Fulham has been increased of late years, it is still decidedly inadequate when the number of provision dealers is considered. Thus there are upwards of 300 milk sellers registered in Fulham, and there are others from adjoining districts who trade here, all of whom should be sampled at least, twice a year. At present the Council have only arranged for the analysis for 550 samples during the year ending March 29th, 1906, and as upwards of 500 were 64 taken during the nine months ending December 31st, 1905, there will be three months during which there will be little or no check on dishonest tradesmen. In my opinion, the Council should arrange for the analysis of, at any rate, not less than 1,200 samples yearly. Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts were instituted by the Council in the following cases: — DEFENDANT. OFFENCE. RESULT. PENALTY. COSTS. £ d. £ d. s. s. F. J.

New Buildings. During the year drainage plans of the following proposed new buildings were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee: — Dwelling Houses and Shops 142 Factories and Workshops 17 Blocks of Flats 3 Other Buildings 9 Additions to existing Buildings 21 192 Reconstruction of Drainage. Plans for the reconstruction of the drainage of 263 buildings also received the sanction of the Committee. Drainage of the Non-Provided Schools. The drains of the non-provided schools were examined by the Sanitary Inspectors. At Barclay Hall School and at Holy Cross School, Ashington Road, the drains were entirely reconstructed in compliance with the Council's notices, and some repairs were carried out at All Saints School, High Street; St. John's School, Dawes Road; and St. Thomas' School, Rylston Road. Combined Drainage. Fifteen systems of combined drainage, for portions of which the Council was liable, owing to certain of the pipes which received the drainage of more than one building, forming "sewers" within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were reconstructed during the year at a cost to the Council of £135 9s. 6d., the work being carried out by a contractor under a schedule of prices. The sum of £142 7s. 10d. was also paid to owners in respect of work executed by them in compliance with notices served by the Council at 24 houses in connection with house drains, which were "sewers" as defined by the Metropolis Management Act. 68 VENTILATION OF SEWERS. Ventilation shafts continue to be erected by the Council in suitable positions whenever the necessary consent of the owners of the houses against which they can he placed is obtained. Many complaints having been received respecting offensive smells from the surface ventilators of the London County Council's main sewer in Fulham Palace Road and Dawes Road, the London County Council has, at my suggestion, installed some of Reeves' sewer ventilators in that sewer, which so far appear to have answered satisfactorily. FLOODING OF BASEMENTS. The heavy rains at the beginning of June resulted in an extensive flooding of the basements in all parts of the borough. It had been hoped that the increase of pumping power at the London County Council's pumping station in Lot's Road would prevent this evil from which Fulham has suffered so much, but on this occasion it utterly failed to cope with the storm-water, as many basements were flooded which had never previously suffered. The matter was considered by the Public Health Committee, who recommended that strong representation should be made to the London County Council, pointing out the inconvenience and damage that is caused by these floodings, and the danger to health caused by the deposit of sewage, and calling upon them to take such steps as will rectify the evil. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. Nine houses in Stamford Place and seven houses in Stamford Street were represented by the Medical Officer of Health under Part II., Section 32 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. These houses, which were tenanted by 67 children under 15, and 60 adults, were in a dilapidated and neglected condition, and some were so constructed as to be practically back to back. Summonses against the owner for closing orders were taken out 69 on the ground that these dwelling houses were not reasonably capable of being made fit for human habitation, and were in such a state that the occupation thereof should be immediately discontinued. The action of the Council was vigorously opposed on behalf of the owner, and the case was before the magistrate on several days, but eventually all the houses were closed, four were demolished, and the remainder were much improved as regards light and ventilation, and put in a thorough state of repair. The summonses were then withdrawn, the magistrate allowing the Council twenty-five guineas for costs. CERTIFICATES UNDER THE REVENUE ACTS. Applications were received for certificates in respect of 409 dwellings, of which 257 were granted; 98 were given after certain specified works had been completed, and 54 were refused. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS By-laws in respect of houses let in lodgings under Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act were made by the late Vestry in 1893, and were amended so far as related to the exemption clause in 1895. It was found in administering the by-laws that the definition of the word "Landlord" led to considerable difficulties, as under them the landlord was made responsible for the annual cleansing, and he was defined as the person by whom the rooms were actually let, and in a number of cases where a poor person had taken a house and sublet some of the rooms, he was in such a financial position as to be unable to comply with the provisions of the by-laws. New by-laws, which removed this difficulty by making the owner, as defined in the Public Health (London) Act, responsible for the annual cleansing, etc., were drafted and approved by the late Vestry, in 1900. 70 These were submitted to the Local Government Board, who objected, inter alia, to their being made only applicable to such houses as were registered by the sanitary authority as lodging houses, and after considerable correspondence the Board signified their willingness to approve an amended set of bylaws made applicable to all houses below a certain rent limit. The Public Health and the Law and Parliamentary Committees recommended the adoption of these by-laws, but they were referred back by the Council in January, 1903. Amended by-laws were submitted to the Council by the Public Health Committee in April, 1903, but the Council amended them further by striking out the exemption classes, thus making them applicable to all houses in which rooms are let to lodgers, irrespective of rent limit. To this the Local Government Board refused to agree, and eventually by-laws with an exemption clause were approved by the Council in July, 1903, and confirmed by the Local Government Board. Two decisions in the Court of Kings Bench, shortly after this, were to the effect that similar by-laws made by two other Metropolitan boroughs were bad, inasmuch as they contained no provision for a notice to the owners in certain cases of infringement of them. New by-laws to meet this difficulty were framed by the Public Health Committee and submitted to the Council in April, 1905, but were referred back, objection being taken to the high rent limit of the exemption clause. The Public Health Committee again considered the by-laws, and resolved to inform the Local Government Board that they objected to any by-laws which did not allow the local authority discretionary power as to the houses which are to be registered. Councillor Palmer, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor Easton, the Town Clerk, and the Medical Officer of Health then had an interview with the representatives of the Local Government Board, who informed them that the Board would not approve of by-laws which were to be applicable only to such houses as the local authority registered as lodging- 71 houses, and suggested an exemption clause excluding houses in which there is only one lodger. The following exemption clause was then framed by the Public Health Committee and adopted by the Council. The amended by-laws were finally allowed by the Local Government Board on March 26th, 1906: — Exempted Houses. 2. In any of the following cases a lodging house shall be exempt from the operation of these by-laws, that is to say:— (a) Where the keeper himself resides on the premises and the sub-letting by such keeper is to not more than two lodgers. (b) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture is at the rate of not less than 4s. per week, and such room is occupied by not more than two persons. (c) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture is at the rate of not less than 5s. per week, and such room is occupied by not more than two persons. (d) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture is at the rate of not less than 6s. per week. (e) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture is at the rate of not less than 8s. 6d. per week. Inspection of Houses Let in Lodgings. There are 329 houses on the register, no new houses having been put on owing to new by-laws being under consideration. E 1 72 Of these houses, many of which must now be removed from the register owing to the new exemption clause, 693 inspections were made, 43 cases of overcrowding were discovered and abated, 176 rooms were cleansed, and 86 other defects were remedied. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Ten intimations and three statutory notices under the Public Health (London) Act were served in respect of chimneys (not being chimneys of private dwelling houses) sending forth black smoke in such quantities as to be a nuisance.
