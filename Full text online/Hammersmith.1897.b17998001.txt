For the Year, 1897. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hammersmith 2bth March, 1898. Gentlemen,—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. The Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Vestry during the 52 weeks ending on January 1st, 1898. BIETHS. During last year 3,139 births were registered in this Parish, against 3,007 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 17 above the average number registered during the last 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 106,016 inhabitants, the number of births registered was equal to the annual rate of 29.6 per 1,000 persons living. The birth-rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,463,169 inhabitants, was equal to an annual rate of 30.0 births per 1,000 persons living. 259 DEATHS. During last year, 1,570 deaths were registered in this Parish, against 1,556 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in this Parish last year was 156 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. Adding 291 deaths of parishioners of this Parish which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other parishes of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 161 deaths of non-parishioners which occurred, 103 at the West London Hospital, 36 at Nazareth House, 7 at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, 1 at St. Joseph's Schools, 3 at H.M. Prison, Wormwood Scrubbs, and 11 which otherwise occurred in the Parish, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners registered last year was 1,700. On the before mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 16.0 deaths per 1,000 persons living; the death-rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 17.7 per 1,000 persons living. I observed that the Registrar-General in his annual summary gives the corrected number of deaths of parishioners of this parish as 1,760 and a mortality rate therefore of 16.7 per cent. The difference of 60 is accounted for as follows:—13 deaths that occurred at the Fulham Union Infirmary, which were reported to me from Somerset House, as of parishioners of this parish, and which the Registrar General has added, upon inquiry I found were deaths of children which had been born in the Fulham Union Infirmary, and although their mothers had been parishioners of Hammersmith, they, the children, had actually never resided in Hammersmith at all. There were also 34 deaths of non-parishioners at Nazareth House, 7 at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, 1 at St. Joseph's School, and 3 at H.M. Prison, 260 Wormwood Scrubs, which are not deducted by the Registrar-General. Allowance is only made by him for the 103 deaths of non-parishioners which occurred at the West London Hospital, while he has added the 161 deaths of parishioners of the parish which occurred in general hospitals and other public institutions in other parishes of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums DEATHS OF INFANTS. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners under one year of age registered was 523. against 517 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 30.8 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and to 16.7 per cent. of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 26.7 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and to 15.8 per cent. of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered, 4.1 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London, and, as compared with the total births registered, 0.9 per cent. greater in this parish than in London. DEATHS OF AGED PERSONS. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 438, against 426 in the previous year. These deaths last year were equal to 0.41 per cent. of the total persons living, and to 25.8 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered. The percentage of deaths of persons registered at 60 years of age and upwards in London last year was equal to 0.43 per cent. of the total persons living, and 21.0 per cent. of the total deaths in London registered. This death-rate was, therecore, 0.02 per cent. less in this Parish than in London as fompared with the total inhabitants living, and 4.8 per 261 cent. greater in this Parish than in London as compared with the total deaths. These figures indicate a favourable condition of Public Health in this Parish. TABLE I.

Note 1. Medical Officers of Health of "Combined Districts" must make a separate Return for the District of each Sanitary Authority. 2. Medical Officers of Health acting for a portion only of the District of a Sanitary Authority should write, in the heading of the Table, the designation of the Division for which they act. 3. The words "Urban," "Rural," or "Metropolitan" must be inserted in appropriate space in the heading, according at the Sanitary Authority for the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The "Localities" adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population; such as parishes, groups of parishes, townships, or wards. As stated at the head of the first column in each table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 5. The deaths which have to be classified in this Table (A) and summed up in the horizontal line of "Totals," are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, e.g., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which the corrections apply, may appear in the text of the report or in supplementary tables. Area and Population of the District or Division to which this Return relates.

COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. March 25th, 1898. 264 DEATHS FROM THE 9 PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of parishioners that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases was 284, against 331 in the previous year. The deaths of parishioners last year from these diseases were equal to 16.7 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 0.27 deaths per 100 persons living. Tne deaths from the 9 principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 14.5 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 0.26 deaths per 100 persons living. These deaths were therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered 2.2 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London, and as compared with the population .01 greater in this Parish than in London. TABLE III. The following table shows the deaths of parishioners registered from the 9 principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the years 1888 to 1897. Year. Smallpox. Measles. Scarlet Fever.

There were 708 cases reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Parish against 933 in the 265 previous year. There were also 40 cases that were not notifiable under the Act, reported as due to infectious diseases, against 104 in the previous year. SMALL-POX. No case was reported as due to small-pox against one case in the previous year. CHICKEN-POX. No case of chicken-pox was reported against 5 cases in the previous year. MEASLES. Eleven cases were reported as due to measles against 74 cases in the previous year. Four cases were not reported until after death, and in 7 cases the patients were suffering from the disease at the time when information was received. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases as reported, as, no doubt, a very small proportion which occurred were reported to me. SCARLET FEVER. Three hundred and ninety-nine cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 528 in the previous year. Two hundred and twelve cases reported last year were isolated at Isolation Hospitals, 207 at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Western Fever Hospital, 5 at the London Fever Hospital at Islington, and 187 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 2.5 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. One hundred and fifty-eight cases were reported as due to diphtheria and diphtheritic membranous croup, against 217 cases in the previous year. Sixty cases reported last year were treated at the Metropolitan Asylum 266 Board's Western Fever Isolation Hospital. Five cases were treated by the West London Hospital, 5 at the Middlesex Hospital, and 92 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported in the parish was 19.6 per cent. WHOOPING COUGH. Twenty-nine cases were reported as due to whooping cough, against 61 cases in the previous year. Twenty-eight of the cases reported last year were treated at home, and were not reported until after death, and 1 case was not reported until after recovery. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as, doubtless, a very large number of cases occurred which were not known of in your Public Health Department. ENTERIC FEVER. Forty-six cases were reported as due to enteric fever, against 53 in the previous year. Five of the cases reported last year were treated at the Western Fever Isolation Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 2 at St. George's Hospital, 1 at the Fulham Union Infirmary, and 38 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 17.4 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. No case was reported as due to typhus fever, against 1 case in the previous year. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. Three cases were reported as due to simple continued fever, against 4 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. No death occurred from this disease. RELAPSING FEVER. No case was reported as due to relapsing fever against no case in the previous year. 267 PUERPERAL FEVER. Eight cases were reported as due to puerperal fever against 8 cases in the previous year. One of the cases reported last year was treated at the West London Hospital, and 7 at the homes of the patients. The mortality on the cases reported was 25.0 per cent. CHOLERA. One case was reported as due to cholera against no case in the previous year. Enquires were made and from the evidence obtained it was clear that it was only a case of summer diarrhœa. ERYSIPELAS. Ninety-three cases were reported last year as due to erysipelas, against 121 cases in the previous year. Of the 93 cases reported last year 14 were treated at the Fulham Union Infirmary, and 79 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 1.1 per cent. TABLE IV. The following table shows the number of cases that were reported as due to the undermentioned 13 zymotic diseases during the years 1888 to 1897. Year. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever.

The following Table marked (B) has been prepared by me under an instruction of the Local Government Board. NOTES ON TABLE B. (See also Notes on back of Table A.) Note 1. The present Table B is concerned with population, births, and sickness (not with mortality) in the Sanitary district or division to which the table relates. 2. As stated in the heading of Col. (a), Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the new cases of sickness in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 3. Comments on any unequal incidence of notifiable disease upon the several localities, and considerations as to the local incidence of consumption and other prevalent diseases, should be made in the text of the Report.

State here the name of the Isolation Hospital used by the sick of the District. Mark (H) the locality in which such Hospital is situate; and if not within the District, state where it is situated—Western District Hospital at Fulham and occasionally other Hospitals under the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and exceptionally the London Fever Hospital at Islington, 270 INFLUENZA. Fourteen deaths were registered as due to influenza, against 5 deaths in the previous year. No official action was taken in reference to this complaint. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. During last year the Public Health Committee registered 216 "houses let in lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family." Upon the registration of the premises a copy of the Bye-laws of your Vestry under which such houses are registered, was forwarded to the landlord (within the meaning of the Bye-laws) for his guidance. At the meeting of your Public Health Committee, held on June 28th, I advised "that the District Inspectors be instructed to visit and inspect the registered premises once in each quarter, and to report to your Committee as to whether they are kept in accordance with the Bye-laws." Your Public Health Committee decided not to adopt my advice. I have no doubt that it will be found to be absolutely necessary to employ a seperate Inspector to carry out this work. VESTRY'S DUST SHOOT AT THE WHARF CHANCELLORS. With the object of preventing a repetition of the complaint which had previously been received of a nuisance from the depositing of dust and house refuse in barges at your Wharf Chancellors, on June 20th I advised "that the Surveyor be instructed to have the said refuse sprinkled with a solution of permanganate of potash as heretofore. Your Committee adopted my advice, and no complaint was made of a nuisance from the depositing of the refuse during the whole of the summer. NUISANCE AT THE ROAD CAR COMPANY'S STABLES, HAMMERSMITH ROAD. In consequence of serious complaints which I received of a nuisance from the premises of the Road Car Company in Hammersmith Road, on August 4th, I 271 attended the meeting of your Vestry, having prepared a report on the subject. The solicitor, to the Road Car Company also attended, and requested to be heard on the subject before the report was presented. Your Vestry decided to hear Mr. Norris. I then advised that the report should be received and referred to a special meeting of the Public Health Committee. Your Vestry decided not to have the report read, or referred to a special meeting of the Committee as advised. Since this period the Company has not again allowed the manure to accumulate upon the premises in such a qnantity as to be a nuisance, but I have, at times, noticed a very offensive odour emitted from the windows of the stables abutting on the main road. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 16 licensed slaughter houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the four District Inspectors. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1897, I found that 16 licenses were to be applied for, and that they were all reported to be in a satisfactory condition. At the Special Sessions at the London County Council, held on 25th October, the whole of the 16 licenses were granted without opposition by your Vestry. The following is a list of the licensed slaughter houses in the parish:— NORTH DISTRICT. Wards Nos. 4, 5, and 6. Address.

The two licensed cow-houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the District Sanitary Inspectors. At the annual inspection in October, the premises were found in a satisfactory condition, and at the Special Sessions of the London County Council, held on 2.5th October, they were both renewed without opposition by your Vestry. The following is a list of the licensed cow-houses in this parish:— CENTRE DISTRICT. Address. Name of Licensee. 15, Brook Green Road Walter Glover 115, Glenthorne Road Thomas Chas. Morse BAKEHOUSES. The whole of the bakehouses (61) in the Parish were under regular quarterly inspection by the Factory Inspector. In 3 instances it was reported that the premises were not in a proper sanitary condition. Notices were at once served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Vestry. In each instance the notice was complied with. The following is a list of the bakehouses in the Parish: — 273 CENTRE DISTRICT.

No articles of food were found to be in such a state as to be unfit for the food of man so as to justify seizure under 54 and 55 Vic., chap. 76, sec. 47. The heavy penalties obtained some years ago have no doubt had a salutary effect in preventing food being offered for sale in such a state as to justify seizure. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 3,188 notices were reported as having been served by your Sanitary Inspectors, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 3,119 in the previous year, and during last year 3,281 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 3,216 in the previous year The wise course adopted by your Vestry in appointing a House-to-House Inspector has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 3,404 houses and other premises in the parish. Altogether, since his appointment on January 20th, 1893, he has inspected 17,338 inhabited houses and other premises. The defects in premises discovered as the result of his inspection were as usual dealt with by the four District Sanitary Inspectors. 276 Your Factory Inspector has during the year served 218 notices under the Factory and Workshop Acts, and during the same period 218 notices have been complied with. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Vestry and the Public Health Committee gave authority for 26 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of your Vestry or the Public Health Committee. Before any summonses were taken out a letter was written to the person in default, informing him that the Vestry or Public Health Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he were willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In most instances the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply for a summons. It has been the object of the Department to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no single instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Vestry. SUMMONSES TAKEN OUT. During last year only 4 summonses were taken out through the Public Health Department. The following is a list of the premises in reference to which summonses were issued, with a statement as to the nature of the complaint and the result of the proceedings. 277 TABLE VI. Situation of Premises. Nature of Offence. Result of Proceedings. 22, 24 & 26, Lena Gardens Defective bell trap, &c. Dismissed—Leave to appeal given. Appeal dismissed with costs. 2. Thornfield Road No water supply to premises Defendant fined 5s. and 3s. costs, and order made to close the premises 120, Blythe Road do. do. Defendant fined 10s. and 3s. costs. Order made to close the premises 40, Batoum Gardens do. do. Order made to close the premises PUBLIC MORTUARY. During last year your Vestry removed to the mortuary at the Wharf, Chancellors, 5 bodies of persons who had died from infectious diseases, and 5 bodies of persons for whom no proper accommodation could be found at their late residences. There were 145 bodies brought to the mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police, 43 of these were taken from the West London Hospital, and included 11 parishioners and 32 non-parishioners. PUBLIC NUISANCES. During last year I brought before your Public Health Committee complaints received by me in reference to the following alleged public nuisances:— I. Nuisance from factories in the neighbourhood of Fulham Palace Road. II. Nuisance from emission of dust from the shaft of the Brook Green Carpet Cleaning Works. METEOROLOGY. The average mean temperature registered in London during last year was 50°.3 Fahrenheit. The highest 278 temperature registered was 90o.2 in June. The lowest temperature was 23°.3 in December. Rain fell on 169 days. The total amount of rainfall was 22.63 inches. It has been my object as heretofore to condense this report as much as possible and not to trouble your Vestry with a detailed report in reference to the enormous amount of routine work which is carried out through your Public Health Department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. 279 Annual Report OF THE LIBRARIAN, Year ending, 31st March, 1898. 280 LIBRARY COMMITTEE. 1897-8. Mr. G.

Gentlemen, The report for the year ended 25th March, 1898, which I have the honour to present to you, contains a record of the first full year's work of the Passmore Edwards Library, Shepherd's Bush, and on that account should prove additionally interesting. RAVENSCOURT PARK LIBRARY. Lending Department. Stock.—The number of volumes in the Lending Department is 10,152; 311 of which were added during the year, 43 being presented and 286 purchased. Notwithstanding the additions the stock is slightly less than it was last year owing to a number of books withdrawn at stocktaking not having been replaced. Issue.—The number of volumes issued was 73,220 (daily average 297). These figures show a marked falling off as compared with the issue of previous years, but there are good reasons for the decrease. The primary cause is that borrowers living in the northern and eastern parts of the parish have availed themselves of the facilities offered by the Passmore Edwards Library, of which they have not failed to take the utmost advantage, as a glance at the statistics will prove. The second reason for thedecline I attribute to the extension of time allowed for reading a book from seven to fourteen days, which was granted in August, 1896. Borrowers.—The number of borrowers enrolled was 869; 43 tickets were issued for music only; 1,314 were renewed and 122 cancelled, leaving 2,016 as the approximate number in force. Reference Department. In the Reference Department the stock numbers 3,201 volumes, 133 of which were added during the year, 282 48 being presented and 90 purchased. The number of volumes issued was 2,395 (daily average 8). The total stock in both Lending and Reference Departments is 13,353 volumes. PASSMORE EDWARDS LIBRARY, SHEPHERD'S BUSH. Lending Department. Stock.—The Lending Department contains 9,403 volumes; 155 were added during the year, 51 having been presented, and 104 purchased. Issue.—The issue reached the large number of 124,958 volumes, being a daily average of 507 for the 246 days the Library was open. Borrowers.—The number of new borrowers enrolled was 2,521; 1,042 tickets were renewed and 115 were cancelled, leaving the approximate number in force 3,448. Reference Department. The number of volumes in the Reference Library is 323, and the issue numbered 1,635 (daily average 6). The Special Library in the Boy's Room contains 231 volumes. The total in all departments is 9978. The total stock in the two Libraries is 23,331 volumes, and the aggregate issue for the year reached 202,208 (daily average 802). There have been numerous gifts, all of which will be found recorded in the report, but the donation of Mrs. William Morris, which included several volumes printed at the famous Kelmscott Press, deserves to be specially mentioned. The following is a list of the titles:— Morris, William. "Well at the World's End," la. 4 to. 1896. 283 Morris, William. "News from Nowhere," 8 vo. 1892. Caxton, William. "Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye," 2 vols., la. 4 to, vellum. 1892. Meinhold, W. "Sidonia the Sorceress," printed on vellum, la. 4 to. 1893. The usual statistical tables are given in the report. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, S. MARTIN, Librarian. 284 MEMORIAL TO LEIGH HUNT. On the 28th October, 1897, Mr. A. E. Fletcher unveiled a bronze medallion portrait of Leigh Hunt at the Passmore Edwards Library, Shepherd's Bush. The medallion, which is the gift of Mr. Passmore Edwards, was executed by Mr. G. Frampton, A.R.A., and is a companion portrait to that of Charles Keene by the same artist, erected in the vestibule of the Library in 1896. There was a numerous company present, which included the Rev. Prebendary Snowden, M.A., Mr. G. Alan Payne, Chairman of the Library Committee, Mr. J. Murray, LL.B., Vice-Chairman, Mr. G. Frampton, A.R.A., Mr. M. B. Adams, F.R.I.B.A., and Mr. Passmore Edwards. The Rev. Prebendary Snowden welcomed Mr. Passmore Edwards, and gave a short sketch of the life of Leigh Hunt. Mr. Fletcher then unveiled the medallion and delivered an eloquent address on Leigh Hunt, whom he described as "one of the gentlest and bravest of men." He said there was nothing to justify the ungenerous charges made against him, nevertheless two distinguished literary men still repeated them, doubtless through ignorance. Hammersmith had reason to be proud that such a man once dwelt within its borders, walked its streets, and looked with a poet's eye upon the sunsets on its noble river, and communed there with some of the loftiest spirits of his time. On the motion of Mr. Payne, seconded by Mr. Murray, a cordial vote of thanks was passed to Mr. Fletcher for unveiling the memorial and to Mr. Passmore Edwards for his generous gift to the Library. 285 Replying, Mr. Edwards said the memorial had been erected for two reasons. One was that he liked a balance, and as the medallion of Charles Keene was on one side of the memorial stone he thought there should be something on the other side; and secondly because Lord Rosebery told him, at the opening of the Library, that the reason why he did not refer to Leigh Hunt in his speech on that occasion was because he was under the impression that Dickens had taken him as one of his characters (Harold Skimpole) in "Bleak House." But he was sure that when Lord Rosebery and others who were of his way of thinking knew the facts their minds would be disabused of such an idea. 286 TABLE I. Library Stock—Lending and Reference.
