It will be remembered that a Sub-Committee consisting of the undermentioned genetlmen:- Mr. Vice -Chairman Bisley, Mr. Stuart, ,, F. T. Talbot, ,, Kimber. ,, Moss, ,, Veleey, and the Surveyor was appointed to inspect recently erected Dust Destructors in the Metropolis and Provices, and to report thereon to the Vestry to enable the Utter to decide upon the best and most approved pattern, And the the 5th May, 1896, the Committee reported boring visited fifteen Destructors ??? work and two in course of erection, thirteen of thorn being in Provincial towns and two in the Metropolitans, two in course of erection being also in the London district, the ??? of the furnaces varying considerably end embodying six different patents ??? by five different makers. in Addition to furnaces erected by the City Engineer. ???, and the Borough Survey, Leicester. Before presenting their detailed statement end recommendation. they desired to inform the Vestry they had had brought to their notice a recent patent which had not yet received a trial as a Refuse Destructor, but buildings were in course of erection at Lewisham. the Committee interviewed the patentee. who informed them amongst other things that the ??? from his arrangement would only amount to fire per cent, against twentyfive per cent from the best known furnaces which was most important point and worthly The patent consisted of a revolting cylinder heated to a white heat, of the same principle as the ??? Calciners, and the Committee thought it very desirable that a visit to Tavistock should be paid to we this Cylinder working. and they would then be able to piece before the Vestry fall particulars as in the case of the Destructors at work. The Committee were ??? that Lewisham District Board of Work selected this patent after visiting of the ??? to visit Tavistock, and that it be an instruction to the Committte to ??? their final report to the Vestry without reference to the Calciner at Tavistock. On 16th March,1897, the Special Committed reported having considered the following ??? of the Commmittee appointed to view Destructors in the Metropolitans and ??? 3rd July, 1896, Febuary,1897, and 2nd March, 1897:- 53 Vestry of Rotherhithe. Reports of Destructor Committee. 3rd July,1896. Your Committee have to report that they have visited and inspected the following Destructors:- Liverpool (Charter Street) This consists of two distinct sets of 12 furnaces of the "Fryer" type, in parallel, with together, to that each has its own duty to perform independently. but all pass their products of has a feeding hopper for charging it with refuse, and a furnace door for the withdrawal of clinker. One set is charged by manual labour, i.e., all the refuse it tipped from the carts on to the top the farnaces and is put into them by men with rakes, shovels and feeding irons The other set is fitted with Boulnois & Brodie's Patent Storring and Charging Apparatus, by which the refuse is tipped from the carts into the storage tanks, and is dropped from the tanks into the furnaces without being handled by the men; by this method it is claimed that a saving is effected for labour alone of fourpence per ton on every ton of refuse consumed, the relative pricegiving being— hand charging. 1s per ton; mechanical charging, 8d. per ton. Each cell consumes about 8 tons per day, the residue amounting to about 33 per cent The chimney is 170 feet high, and the heat from the furnaccs is oused for raisaing steam, the boiler bring placed in the bye-pass flue Abut 30 indicated horse-power is developed, and it is ??? for lighting the wharf by electricity, clinker crusher, mortar pan, and for rocking the LIVERPOOL (TOXTETH PARK.) This ??? is of modern contraction, having been at work only about one year It ??? of six cells of the “Fryer" type as described above, fitted with ??? & ??? Changing ??? and Henoderson's Patent Rocking Bars, It is ??? to the ??? and depts of the district and house are being erected upon all sides. The quantity of ??? from this ??? is at presrent limited, and the cells are only ??? about 7 tons of per day, The building are all of a very ??? character. the chimney being 180 ??? high and the waste ??? beat is ??? for ??? steam for ??? light ??? and for corn 54 WARRINGTON This ???, which is ??? & ??? Patent, consists of a douable cell which has ??? in ??? twelen monthss, and a single experimently cell since August,1893. The ??? back with a combostion chamber beyond the main floe common ??? in which is placed a 125-H.P. Babcock & Wilcox water tube ??? The ??? to the ??? at the opposite end to the feed opening, so that all gases through the ??? part of the fire on their way to the chimney. The cells are charged ??? so as to give as equal temperature in the combustion chamber. The fire bars are ??? mnd fixed level, and the clinker is removed by hand through an opening in the side of the cell A forced draught from a fan is introduced under the grate, the ash-hearth being ???. Each cell will burn 15 tons per day, and the residue amounts to between 17 and 22 per ???. The temperature maintained in the combustion chamber being 2,000* F., and after ??? through the boiler It is reduced to 500 * F. to 550 * F. The power development is utilised for the ??? -factory, consisting of 13 engines, water-pumping engine, repairing shop and for the ??? factory, consisting of 13 engines, water-pumping engine,repairing shop and for ??? to ??? moisture from excreta, a total of 200 to 230 H.P. The ??? are drawn at 2 a.m. on Saturday morning. and about one ton of coal is used every week to start the fires on Monday morning. The ??? is 120 high, but was not built for the present furnaces. 55 The shaft is 120 feet high, 5 feet internal diameter, lined throughout with fire-bricks with a 12-in,air space between the inner and outer shells, erected at a cost of £1,000 The cost of the works was not obtained, but the cost of burning, including the repayments of capital and interest thereon, amounts to 1s. ton of refuse burnt. The steam jet below the fire bars made a very great noise, but in the four recently ??? cells it is ??? at rear of the cell, the noise thereby being somewhat reduced. LEEDS. In Leeds we visited four Destructors as follows:- Arnley Road 16 cells. Hedacre Street 12 ,, Meanwood Road 8 ,, Beckett Street 14 ,, 50 cells. In all the Destructors the general features of both Fryer's and Horsfall's furnaces have been retained with improvement by the Borough Engineer, some of the older furances being constructed by Fryer; the grate area of the differant furnaces varying from 25 to 35 square feet. The Material to be burnt is introduced at the back and the uotlets of the producets of ??? are near the front. Both movable and fixed bars are used, the Superintendent preferring the letter and he is of opinion that the larger the cells the better The average ??? of refuse burnt per day amounts to 4½ tons, the residue amounting to 36 per cent, which is partly ground with lime to form mortar, the remainder taken to tip. Steam jets are used ??? all the Destructors the the same objection as regard the noise as was experienced at ???. The waste heat is utilised for generating steam by means of multitubular boilers, except at the Meanwood Road Destructors which commenced working on the lst January. 1896, and which has two ??? & Wilcox boilers. The steam is used for driving engines to work the mortar pass and for the jets. The shafts very in beight from 120 fact to 240 feet, the cost of the latter one, which is at ??? Road, being £2250, the works being in a deep valley. with a ??? ground upon 56 LEICESTER. Three destructors were inspected in this town, and in all cases the building were of a most ??? ...??? No. 1. Charnwood Street 6 cells. Fryer. ,, 2. Mill Lane 6,, Manlove, improved by ,, 3. Lro 6,, Biddles. 18 cells. The grate area of each cell is 25 squre feet, the bars are hand rocking bars are an ??? and natural draught is used. The Engineer is of opinion that rocking bars are an advantages as regards buring. The average quantity of refuse burnt amounts to 9 tons cell per days, the reside is ??? for generals steam by means of multilobular boilers placed in bye-pass flues, which drives ??? for supplying power to mortar mills, clinker crusher and for lighting lighting at the Mills Lane Destructors.The moster is sold at 5s. per ton, Destructors Nos. 2 and 3 being ??? from supplied from Destructors No. 1. 57 CAMBRIDGE. The Destructors visited in Cambridge is one of the most recent ??? in England, having only been work nice months, and the first of its types it consists of 6 cells know as “Bodies Patent,” fitted with Boulnosi & Bodie's Mechanical Charging Apparatus.The cells are arranged pairs,s combination of the Fryer and Horsfall types. as the materials to be burnt is introdused at the back, with the outlets of gasses in the side near the front; between each pair of cells placed a ???H.P. Babcock & ??? builer, the cells upon either side discharging their produceds of combastion under the boiler tabes immdiately above the level of, the fire-???, these latter being ;left in the boiler, together with the fire-doors, in the same manner as if the boilert were crected with the accompaniment of Destructors cellls. Each cell is arranged with double flues, one leading to the boiler, and direct into the main flue, the temperature of the gases entering the boiler 1,800* F., reduced to 550* F. in their passage through the same Only four cells were working at the time of our visit, each cell burning from 5to 7½ ??? per day; the steam generated from the two boiler being sufficient to drive the 80-H.P. engine which was pumping the sewage of Cambridge, amount to 1½ million gallons per day under a head of 55 feet, abd for the engine to drive the fan the air blast which was inserted at the back of the bars. The small quantity at present per is owing to the scarcity of refuse, but upon a 24-hour trial it was found possible to burn one ton refuse per hour per cell, and to generate sufficient steam with one boiler to the pumping engines at work. The work is continued night and day, and to raise the necessary steam to work the pumping engine on Saturdays when no refuse is obtainable, one boiler is fired in the ordinary way from 12 noon on Saturday to mindnight Sunday, about 50 cwts, of coal being used. Mechanical rocking bars are fitted to the furnaces, but were not use at the time of our visit; the ??? is closed, and below, the fire is a closed box into which the clinker d rops and cools before it is drawn. The whole of the are very ??? in charcter; the shaft is 175 feet high, ??? with square ??? lined with fire bricks for a height of 50 feet, and is 6-ft. 6-in, ??? diameter at the tops. The total cost of the works appertaining to the Dust ??? is £7,600. The cost of bearning was not gives, but the men work two shift of 12 hours, three men to cost shift: one ??? 25s. per week and home value 2s.,6d.,per week and value 2s. 6d. 58 HORNSEY. This Destructor consists of 12 cells of the type known as “Warner's Perfectus ” as ??? by ??? Goddard, ??? & Waner, of Nottingham. The cells are like fryer's, with ??? different means of charging and controlling the vapour given off. Each ??? has an opening or hopper capable of holding about 1/3 of a cart-load of refuse, the top being level with of the futnace. The contents of the hopper are discharged by means of a wrought-iron lever, worked by hand, projecting through the furnace Within each forance fine are two dampers, which are closed before the furance doors are opend for the purpose of clinkering ,so that no cold air is admitted into the flues during that operations. Steam and air blaste were fixed used when the cells were first crected, but afterwards discarded as the work could be done without them; a cremator was also erected bat not used. About 10,000 tons per annum are dealt with. During June, July and August, the fires are ??? up each night, butb for the other nine months, work is continuous from 6 a.m. Monday to 6 p.m. Saturday, Each cell is capable of burning 8 tons per 24 hours. The temperature in the main flue is 800* F. redused after passing through the boiler to 000* F: The waste heat isutilised for generation steam to drive a 12.H.P. engine which works a ??? and drill; the average pressure of steam in the boiler being 30 1bs. per square inch. The ??? consists of three in paralell lines, a Babcock boiler being fixed in one, a ??? boiler is another, and thne other acting as abye-pass. The Bacock boiler was crected with works in 1889,but is not now used: the multi??? boiler was inscreted about two years afterwards and is still work. The ??? to 25 per cent. in bulk of the burnt and consists of clinker and ??? which are used for ??? for ??? and for footpaths across filds, and for mortar ??? for their own use.The clinker is ??? sold at 2s. per one-hours load Depot. It has also been ground, ??? with ??? and made into stats with a Hydranline Press,but saly a short ??? has been laid. The ??? is done by ??? the being paid 1s. per 25 cwt. for feeding the ???..........??? ???............??? House,??? and mortar mill ??? two ??? and mortar mill with chimeny. ??? 227 ??? high ???. They are over £10,000 59 ST> LUKES. Those works were in course of construction, but at the time of our visit only the skeleton of the building was crected and t5he shaft in progress. We were informed by the Sarveor that six cells were to be crected by Messrs. Goddard & Messey of the “Warmer's Perfectus”pattern as inspected at Horsney. LEYTON. These works were in course of crection, but building was nearly finished and the cells well hand, some idea of the work when completed was obtained. They consist of cells of the “Beaman & Deas” principle as inspected by us at Warringtone, and the maker have guaranted to burn 14 tons cell per 24 hours of unscreened house refuse and compressed sewege sludge in the proportipon of refuse to one of sludge; the residue not to amount to more that 22½ per cent. The waste heat is to generate steam in two-H.P. Bobcock boilers, which is to be utilised for driverg pamping engines, lime mixes, sewage sludge presses, etc. The building consist of iron columns sheeted and roofed which corrugated iron: the chaimey is 150 feet high, square base and octagomal butt, with Ruabon Bricks: the contract sum, including road to cells, shaft (£1000). foundations, corrugated iron ??? and all complete, amount to £56000. WHITECHAPEL. The destructor consits of 16 cells, 14 of which were at work at the rof oar riait, situated in the midst of the ??? population in the world, and ecrcted upon the “Fryer” principle by Messrs, Manlove, Alliot & Co., as previously descrided. Each cell burn about 8 tons per day, and the residue amount to about 25 per cent. The clinker is sold at 8d. per ton on rails. The temperture in the flue averages 1350* F., but the heat is utilised.

The gases could also be sent to the chimney without passimg through the boiler, and the boiler are provided with anxiliary firing arrangements. Plan B,-Showing a four cell Destructor with a boiler placed between each pair of cells, arranged upon the “Wood & Brodie” system as at work in Cambridge. Each pair of cells and one boiler can be worked independentlyof the other, or gases can be discharged direct into the main fine or the boiler fired with coal independent of the Destructor fires. The committee are of opinion that good results can be obtained from either principle, ton that plan B is the better and moer suitable for this parish, and they recommend it for for the Destroctor now in course of crection at Lewisham, and that it may shortly be exepected ??? that it should be ??? at work.

Sir, Electrict Lighting We have received official intimation to the effect that your General purposes committee has passed a resolution recommending the Vestry not to ??? to our application for a provisional order under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882-1888 for the district of the vestry of Rotherhithe 74 Before your Vestry finally come to a decision on this point we trust they will further consider the question on the basis of the proposals contained in this letter which we venture to think are not unworthy their consider . In the first place we would remind you that we hold Provisional Orders for the Parish of Camberwell, St. George the Martyr, southwark and the district of St. Olave and that we are this year supplying for Rotherhithe Bermondsey and Newington with object of supplying the whole of then districts from one Generating station. We would also remark that we haw Parliamentary powers for St. lab and Clerkenwell and Wandsworth, is which districts we hare expended nearly £250,000 on buildings plant and mains. It is found is practice that is the early years of an Electric Lighting undertaking it is extremely difficult to obtain a suffcient demand for for Electricity to cover the working expense of its generation and supply, particularly in the poorer district of London. This being the case, a Campany supplying several districts and having one staff therefor, with minimum management expenses and these divided between several undertaking is naturally the one which can first offer current on a In the event of your Vestry agreeing to give their consent to the grant of an Order we would he prepared:- To enter into a Contract with the Vestry for the supply of current for all-night Public lighting on the lasts of 3½d. per Board of Trade unit for a minimum number of arc lamps to to hereafter agreed. 2. To supply Electricity for Private Lighting at a commending price of 7d per Baaed of Trade unit and 5d per unit far power purposes 3. To give your Vestry the power to ??? the undertaking as far as It is within their district at the ??? of say It years at a prise should your vestry agree to thse it would enable the residents in your district to obtain a supply of current and an early data and give the Vestry the right of ??? ??? the end of the ??? above me??? so that as the end of such ??? you could by dawn your own plant and cu??? the distribution mains to your ??? 76 In fact this Company would run all the risk of the demand being insufficent to pay expenses and interest on capital expended in your District and if result were successful your Vestry would have the full right to take it over so soon as the success of the undertaking was assured In conclusion, we desire to pint out that the grant of an Order to us would not prevent your obtaining an Order yourselves at any time should you see fit to apply to the Board of Trade for it, an we beg to assure too thai is making application for your district at bars every intention of earning oat the work at the earliest possible dale and of undertaking the apply within your district This being the care, we trust you trill again refer the matter to your lighting Committee, and that they may favour ably report upon oar application.

Sotkes, Esq., Clerk to the Vestry of Rotherhithe Dear Sir, In accordance with the instructions of the Vestry of Rotherhithe as contained in your letter to me of 21st February last, I have surveyed the several houses and premises situate between Rotherhithe Street and Paradise Street, and known as the "Fulford Street and Braddon Street Insanitary Area," as comprised in the Plan and Schedule hereto annexed, and I have made a valuation of the several interests in connection therewith. with a view of reporting to the Vestry the estimated coal of acquiring the site of the property, in furtherance of a scheme to be promoted for dealing therewith under Part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1899. I have made my valuation in accordance with the instructions as to so doing contained in section 41 of the Art referred to. As the Vestry are aware, new dwelling houses are being erected on the sites of Nos. 34 to 32. Braddon Street, which, as they will in all probability be finished and occupied before the present scheme comes into operation, I have valued as if now complete-. I estimate that the east of acquiring the whole of the property comprised in the Schedule, inclusive of all cost and charges is connection therewith, will amount to the sum of Twenty seven Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty Pounds (£27,350), To this mart be added the animated cost of making up the mads required for the new Building Scheme of constricting the requisite sewers there is and is of enclosing the site with a proper hoarding. I estimate the amount of Re???" whcih may be anticipated from the subsequent ask of the Freehold by the Vestry, at the sum of Two Thousand Eight Hundred possible (£2,8000) 80 I enclose herewith a plan, in duplicate of the property included in the valuation and as comprised in the following Schedule. The area to be acquired is tinted pink, and the roads on which the site abuts and which will have to be widened for the Roney Street.—1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and 12 Braddon street—Nos.—1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, 29,30,31,and 32 Rotherhithe Street— Noa. 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66. 67, 70, 72,74, 76, 76 and 80.

Fisher's Court.— Nos. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7and8 Paradise street.1Nos. 35and 35a, 37,39,41,43,45,47,49,and51 I am dear sir On 16th June. 1896, the Sanitary Committee reported baring bad submitted to them the plans and estimate prepared to the Surveyor of the coat of forming roads and sewers. Plan A—Slewing the existing roads founding the area, via.:Rotherhithe Street Fulford Street, Paradise Street, and seven Step Alley widened to a width at 40 feet, the remaining land being utilised for the ???tion of Block Dwellings with an Open space in the centra, about 156 lest long by 46 foot wide, at a cost, with pitched roads, of £3650 plus £250 for hoarding or a total of £3900-at a total cost with macudam roads (Rotherhithe Street only being pitched) at £3195- of all a total cost with macudam roads and granite channels of £2970 Plan B.-Showing the roads ways bounding the area above out widened to a width of 40 feet with a cross street 10 feet wide leaning through the centre of the area, 81 from Fulford street to Seven stop Alley, the remainder of the land on either life of the cross street to be utilised for the erection of small tenements at a total coat with pitched roads of £4,570, at a total cool with macadam roads —Rotherhithe Street only being pitched—of £3,715 or at a total cost with Resolved (1)—'That the estimate prepared by the Valuer of the net cost of acquiring the (2)—That Plan B, showing the existing roads bounding the area widened to a width of 40 feet, with a cross street 40 feet wide through the centre of the area from Fulford Street to Seven Step Alley, the remainder of the land on either side of the cross street being utilised for the erection of small tenements, at a total cost of £44,570, being the estimate (3)—That the Clerk be and he is hereby instructed to insert the above figures, amounting to £29,120, as the total cost of the scheme, and submit the scheme to the London County Council for approval in accordance with the resolution of the Vestry of 15th October, 1895. A sum of £5,000, being half the net cost of the scheme (the Council having agreed to pay the other half) can bo borrowed from the London County Council at 2½ per cent., and the longest term allowable is 53 years. Assuming therefore that the Vestry borrowed the sum of £15,000 for 50 yours upon the annuity system, it would represent an annual charge of about £560, equal to a three-farthing rate. On 17th November, 1896, the Sanitary Committee reported having considered the following letter received from the London County Council, returning the draft scheme prepared by the Vestry for dealing with the Fulford Street and Braddon Street insanitary area under Part 2 of the flawing of the Working classes Act:— 82 London County Council 20th july, 1896 Sir Referring to your letter of the 19th ultimo, forwarding, for the approval of the Council the draft of a scheme for the improvement of the Fulford Street and Braddon street area, I am directed to return the same to to you with certain sugges. from marked in red ink thereon. I am at the same time to point out that it appears to the Council that, having regard to the present condition of the houses Not. 24-17 Braddon Street, the Vestry would not be able to include such houses in the scheme. I am therefore to suggest that some modification of the scheme should be made be which the proposed new street might be made in a direction at right angles to that at present proposed, so that the house referred to might be omitted. I am also to suggest that a narrow strip of land, say 9 inches wide, should be left between the line of any new street that may be made and any existing frontage to the wane, to that the right of frontage may be retained by the local authority to include in a scheme under that pert any property which was not dangerous or injurious to health: that it appeared from the Minutes of the Council the this Resolve-That the be London County Council be respectfully requested to re-consider the question of including the houses in question in the scheme in as much as the Vestry desire to have be scheme carried cut in its entirety as in their opinion the exclusion of the 83 on 15th December, 1896 the Sanitary Committee reported having further considered the draft scheme prepared by the Vestry for dealing with the Fulford Street and Braddon street insanitary Area under part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, returned by the London County Council with certain suggestions marked in red ink thereon, and a letter from the Clerk to the Council as under:— London County Council Spring Gardens, S.W. 28th November, 1896 Sir Your letter of the 19th instant with respect to the question of including in the Fulford Street and Braddon Street Scheme the houses Nos. 24 to 27 Braddon Street, has been under the consideration of the Housing of the Working Classes Committer. In reply, I am directed to state that, hiring regard to the opinion expressed by the Vestry that the delusion of the houses in question would entirely spoil the scheme, the Committee do not propose to raise any further objection to the inclusion of the house in the scheme. I am. however, to remind you that there is no provision under Part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, for the acquisition of neighbouring lands, end that on that account it is probable that the Inspector appointed by the Local Government Board to bold the inquiry would sustain an Objection, if raised before him by parties interested, to the inclusion of the property in the scheme. Under all the circumstances, however, I am to say that the Committee ere of opinion that the best coarse for the Vestry to adopt would be to proceed with the scheme in its original form, end meet any difficulty which may be raised in the course of the inquiry or upon the report of the Inspector in such manner as may them appear to be advisable I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant (singed) C.

On 2nd July. 1896, the Vestry Resolved—That the Surveyor be instructed to fix a lamp column half way between the two existing lamps. Cornick Street. on 17th November, 1896, the Vetry Resolved-That a new lamp be placed opposite No. 4, the present lamp opposite No. 27 shifted midway between the new lamp and the existing one at the Gataker Street end of Comtek Street, and thai the present lamp at the Sliper's Mace entrance to the street be removed to the opposite side and in front of No. 1s Slipper's Place. Incandescent. On 16th Jane, 1896, the Surveyor reported receipt of an intimation from the Engineer to the South Metropolitan Gas Company, that the experiments with Incandescent lighting upon the Union Road had not been very successful; that new burners, fitted with spring attachments, bad bean triad, which, though found to work well in country districts, ware not satisfactory in paved roads with heavy traffic. The Engineer's ret son for discontinuing the experiments was on account of great pressure of work in that department, and he was unable to spare men to give the attention the special burners required. The Surveyor also reported that as soon as he could get a complete return from the Gas Company, be intended to present a comparative statement showing the cost as against ordinary lighting determined by the experiments, and that as there were other patterns el burners and mantles, and the recent decisions having simplified matters, it was for the Vestry to decide if they would try the others before giving up the ides of Incandescent lighting altogether. Resolves- That the Surveyor be instructed to submit a report to the next mealing of the Vestry, showing the cost of lighting by means of the Incandescent as compared with the ordinary gas burners. and that be arrange with the Gas Company lor the continuation of the experiments in Union Board in the Meantime. 93 On 7th July, 1896, the Surveyor reported as follows in reference to the lamps upon the Union Road fitted with the Incandescent burners:— 6 lampe from 14th November to 81st December, 1895—47 nights or 744 hours. 5 „ „ 1st January 17th June, 1896 169 „ 1466 „ The Gas Company were compelled to remove the burner from lamp No. 22, upon the 1st January, 1896, owing to the continual jarring and vibration canned by the heavy traffic at that point, which the mantles would not stand. The figures given below, therefore, only refer to the five lamps, from 14th November, 1895, to 17th June, 1896, a period extending over 216 nights, or 2212 lighting hours per lamp. j Consumption per hour, ordinary street burners 5 cubic fast. Ditto Incandescent burners, with pilot lights, say - 4.25 do. Having in gas, ¾ cubic feet per hour per lamp, or 15 per cent. or 8295 cubic feet for the five lamps during the above-mentioned period. Average number of mantles used per lamp - 15. Average life of mantles - 14.4 nights, or 147½ lighting hours. Cost per lamp, of mantles, forks and chimneys - 16 1½ Saving in gas per lamp at 2s. 3d. per 1000 feet -38½. Net km per lamp - 12 5 Net loss per lamp per annum- 22s. 10d. The present net cost of the burner, not included in the above figures, is 9s. 1d., to which moat be added cost of filing. Increased illumination taken from experiments mads by the Gas Company - 70 per cent present increased cost over ordinary burners for maintenance 36 per cent The Company desire to discontinue the experiments until the autumn owing to extreme Pressure of business, and as the present times is not favourable to obtain correct results, the Pressure dry weather tending to prolong the life of the mantles. In an interview I have had with Mr. Talbot, of the Gas Company, he stated that the Engineer hopes by the autumn to have perfected an arrangement that will overcomes a great many of the present difficulties. Resolved- That the Surveyor be instructed to continue the experiments in the Union Board for the percent. 93 On 19th January, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee report having considered the following report of the Surveyor:— Seeing the Engines to the South Metropolitan Gas Company, I again mentioned the question of Incandescent lighting for the public lamps and I have received a latter that the Company will be prepared to undertake the lighting, repairs, cleaning and all responsibility is connection with the same as the ordinary lamps for an additional sum of 12s. per lamp per annum. It is also pointed out that as the present patent only lasts three years longer, it is probable that period this amount will be considerably reduced. Along the Union and Lower Roads there are 46 ordinary lamps from the Mill Pond to the Deptford Boundary and to light there would cost £27 12s. 0d. per annum extra. There are also six three-light large lamps which at present cost £64. 2s. 4d. per annum for gas, cleaning etc. If these were altered to 2-light Incandescent burners I estimate they would only cost £45 9s. 0d., or a saving of £18 13s. 4d. which, if deducted from the increased cost of lighting the ordinary lamps with Incandescent burners, leaves the net increased cost at £ 8. 18s. 8d. per annum for the next three years. Resolved-upon the recommendation of the Committor-That the present lighting arrangement of the pariah be not interfered with until a more perfect system of Incandescent lighting is in use. Lower Road, Neptune Street, and Moodkee Street. On 2nd February, 1897, the Town Hall Committee reported with reference to the lighting arrangements for outside the Lower Road and Moodkee Street entrances to the Town Hall, hairing had two tenders and sketches submitted for their consideration:-1 Sketch A.— Messrs, Macfarlane & Co., Glasgow, Lamp Columns at 412 12a. 6d. each. „ B. Meters. McDowell, Steven & Co., 4 Upper Thames Street, Lamp Colomns at £9 17s. 6d. each. Recommended (1) That the tender and sketch B of Messrs. McDowell, Steven & Co., at the sum of £9 17a. 6d. per column be approved and accepted, subject to the letters "R.V." being placed upon the columns as a monogram, free of any extra charge. (2) That seven lamp columns be ordered. via.: two for such entrance and threw for the Neptune Street side of the buildings. 94 The Surveyor reported having communicated with Messrs. McDowall. Steven and Co. in the terms of the Committee's report, and he was in receipt of a reply to the effect that for placing the monogram "R V" upon the columns and affixing the required footing thereto they would hare to charge an extra 15s. per col. Resolved—(Mr. Stuart: Mr. Mortimer)—That the recommendation of the Committee be approved, and that the tender of Messrs. McDowall, Steven and Co. as amended be accepted. On 16th February, 1897, the Vestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes and Works Committee—That the before-mentioned lamps have four burners in the form of a triangle, with centre burner arranged to that the throe outer burners can be lighted from sunset until a I me to be hereafter decided upon, end that the centre or by-pass burner ten be lighted for the remainder of the night. Luxford Street. On 2nd July, 1896. the Vestry Resolved—That the Surveyor be instructed to remove the existing lamp in Luxford Street to opposite No. 11 on the east aide and to fix another lamp column on the west tide at the Rotherhithe New Road end of the street. Tenting Station. Nothing having beam done by the Gas Referees in connection with the provision of a Gas Tasting Station near the works of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, as suggested by the Vastry: It was Rasolvad on 6th October, 1896. upon the motion of Mr. P. T. Talbot, seconded by Mr. Hoard—That the Clark again write to the London County Council, asking whether they proposes doing anything further in the matter; and on 20th October. 1896, the Clerk reperted receipt of a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council, staling that a copy of his letter in referees to the provision of a Gas Testing Station in closer proximity than those at present existing to the the Rotherhithe Works of the South Metropolitan Gas company, had been forwarded to the Gas Reference. On 17th November, 1896, the Vestry had before these a Utter from the Clark to the London County Council, enclosing copy letter received by the Council from the Metropolitan Gas Beferese. copy latter refered to:- 95 Metropolitan Gas Referees. 17, Buckingham Street, Adelphi, W.C. 23rd October, 1894.

In reply 1 may refer to my letter to you of the 13th March but—stating that at certain changes teemed to be imminent which would materially affect the apparatus to be prescribed for use in the testing placet, the fiat Referees thought it pendent to postpone, for a short time, any further prescription of new testing places. The changes above alluded to are now under the consideration of the Referees, and I may repeat the assurance that they will keep the subject of your letter in mind, and will give doc attention to it at toon as they see their way to doing to. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) WILLIAM POLE. The Clerk of the London County Council. Loans. Hull Head Dock.

The Committee further reported that the buildings were exported to be completed in three Months' time, and should the application be delayed to as to include the amount required for furnishing, the loan could not be completed until after the Council's recces and they had therefore. 98 Instructed the Clerk to make an amended application for an advance of £7,000 made up as under:- Amount of Contract £15,000 Architect's Commission, etc. 1,350 Extended line of frontage and contingencies 750 17,000 Already advanced 10,000 £7,000 letters were subsequently received from the Assistant Solicitor to the London County Council, relative to the amended application of the Vestry for a loan of 4,7,000 in reaped to Town Hall, stating that the Finance Committee were sending up a recommendation to the Council for the advance of a further sum of £6,750 repayable as to £5,550 within 30 years, and as to £1,900 within 15 years at 3 per cent, and that if the Vestry wished the loan advanced before October, there was no time to consider and report as to the augmented addition of 4250: that the 41,200 repayable within 15 years represents expenditure on the Clock, Ventilator, Heating and Hot Water apparatus and the item of 4500 for contingencies and asking whether the Vestry were prepared to take up the loan upon theme terms.

Resolved—(1) That upon the Company setting back the parapet wall on the west side of the new road by Plough Road, the Vestry adjust the paving of Yeoman Street and Plough Road free of expense to the Company. (2) That the Company be respectfully requested to erect steps in Yeoman Street leading up to the new road at their own expense, inasmuch as it would not only be a benefit to the public at large, but also to the Company's own employees. On 6th October, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from Mr. J. Wolfe Barry, Engineer to the Surrey Commercial Docks extension works, stating with regard to the proposed steps from Yeoman Street to the new road (which the Vestry) suggested should constructed at the expense of the Company) that the Company would not agree to construct such steps at their own expense. On 19th January, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered the following report of the Surveyor : "I have received a plan from the Resident Engineer of the Docks showing the proposed arrangement of the gas lamps upon the new and temporary road constructed by the Company for the Plough Road diversion, and which I submit for your 162 consideration. He desires your approval as soon as possible, so that the new roadways can be completed and opened for truffle, afl they are unable to farther complete the new canal lock until the existing Plough Bridge is demolished. It is, however, a question whether the Company are yet in a position to close the existing bridge, as the Act st states they are not to close Plough Road until they have completed and opened for traffic the new road No. 2, and the road as at present constructed is only a portion of new road No. 2, that portion from the new bridge to Commercial Dock Road being a temporary road which they were bound to construct to provide for the traffic from Commercial Dock Road, until the completion of the new road No. 1 from near Lady Dock Bridge to Osprey Street, and it is a question whether after it is completed and opened for traffic it becomes vested in the Veetry the same as road No. 2 mentioned in the Act, or if the Company is liable for the maintenance, scavenging and lighting of the same." Resolved—(1) That the positions of the proposed lamps which are less than -10 yards apart, be approved. (2). That consideration of the question of closing Plough Bridge be adjourned until a formal application has been received from the Dock Company. On 16th February, 1897, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered the following report of the Surveyor relative to Plough Road diversion "I have received an application from Mr. Wolfe Barry, the Engineer for the Docks Extension Works, for permission to close portions of London Road and Plough Road as follows:— "Pending the completion of road No. 2 to Grove Street, we wish only to close the portion of London Road marked C D on the enclosed plan, forming a loop between the two ends of the new roads E F, also shown on the plan. As soon as these roads are connected and accepted by your Vestry, we shall then wish to close Plough Road, so that Plough Bridge may be removed. 163 "When the new road to Grove Street has been constructed, the remainder of London Road and the short road marked F on the plan will be closed. In answer to a letter of mine, Mr. Barry is unable at the present time to say within what period the extension to Grove Street will be undertaken, but the matter will be considered at an early date by his Directors. "An application has also been made by the Dock Company to the London County Council to the same effect, and the Engineer desires to know if the Vestry concur in the proposed arrangement, with any observations the Vestry may wish to make thereon to the Council, before sanction is given to the proposals of the Company. "When the new roads marked E F upon the plan are completed, the portion of London Road which the Company desire to close will be of no use so far as traffic is concerned, and I see no reason why permission should not be given, the only difference being that the temporary road F. has a gradient of 1 in 37 against 1 in 70 and 1 in 50 of the extension to Grove Street; but this 1 in 37 is not so steep as the approach road from Plough Road, which, according to the Act, is 1 in 35. "As regards the closing of Plough Road from Yeoman Street to Commercial Dock Road, if the Company are to complete the present section of their works, it is absolutely necessary to demolish the existing bridge, and they are only asking to do as soon as possible what they have statutory power to do upon the completion of the road to Grove Street. When the present roads are completed and opened for traffic the Company will have carried out the whole of their obligations so far as providing for the traffic from Commercial Dock Road to Plough Road, pending the completion of the new road No. 1 from near Lady Dock Bridge to Lower Road at Osprey Street, so that I have no objection to the closing of Plough Road as desired, but I think the question of the maintenance, lighting and scavenging of these temporary roads should be considered and settled as between the Company and the Vestry before they are opened for traffic, and that the Company should be asked to state a time within which they would undertake to complete the permanent roads, as their compulsory powers do not lapse until ten years from the date of the passing of the, or 1904" And also the following resolution of the London County Council:— " That the sanction of the Council be given to the closing of that portion of London Road marked C D on the plan submitted by the Surrey Commercial Dock Company's Engineer 1(54 with his letter dated 25th January, 1897, addressed to the Council's Chief Engineer, such sanction, however, being subject to the following conditions "That the road be not closed without the consent of the Vestry of Rotherhithe and the Greenwich District Board having first been obtained; that previously to the closing of the road, a temporary road be formed to join the new road with the London Road; that this temporary road and the new road in substitution for the portion of London Road to be closed, be maintained, repaired, scavenged and lighted by and at the expense of the Company, to the satisfaction of the road athorities, until the entire diversion shall have been completed by the Company and taken over by them ; and that the sanction of the Council to the present proposal shall in no way be held to relieve the Company of its obligations to construct the whole of the road diversions specified in Section 14 of its Act of 1894." Resolved—upon the recommendation of tbe Committee—That the consent of the Vestry be given to the closing of a portion of London Road, before-mentioned, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the resolution of the Council before referred to, and to the Company entering into an agreement with the Vestry to indemnify them against any loss, etc., they may sustain by reason of any accident occurring through the newness of the roads, by subsidence or otherwise.

We hare communicated with the Company 184 about it, and find as it is to be used for this one building only, they require to be paid before they will lay it on. Under these circumstances we have instructed Mr. Williams to pay the amount, and there is no alternative but to allow it to be charged as an extra in his accounts." The Clerk reported that he had been in communication with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company in regard to their charge for the proposed high pressure main down Neptune Street and along Moodkee Street, to supply the firecocks upon the Town Hall Buildings, and read a letter from the Company dated 5th October, 1896, stating that the only way for the Vestry to avoid the required payment of £50 would be for them to be content to have the firecock supply drawn from the Company's existing 9-in. high pressure main in the Lower Road, but that if a length of main were required to be driven down Neptune Street and along Moodkee Street specially for the Vestry's benefit, the Company had no alternative but to make the charge in question under the 53rd section of their Act of 1852.

The letter was referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report. On 1st September, 1896, the Sanitary Committee reported having considered the letter from the Vestry of St. Pancras, asking the Vestry to appoint two representatives on the proposed Deputation to the Local Government Board to urge the desirability of the administration of the Vaccination Acts being placed in the hands of the Sanitary Authorities. Resolved—That no action be taken thereon. 180 Vacant Land. Wyndham Road.

Summonses were subsequently taken out against Mr. Harry Chicken for damage to the fence, and also against Mr. William Chicken for failure to remove his vehicles from the public footway, after notice from the Vestry to do so, the vehicles in question having been removed from off the piece of land by the Vestry. On 2nd June, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter dated 9th May, 1896, giving notice on behalf of Messrs. William and Harry Chicken of their intention to bring an Action against the Vestry, in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, for damages, and On 16th June, 1896, writs were served upon the Clerk relative to actions in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, one on behalf of Mr. William Chicken claiming damages on account of assault, detention of goods and malicious prosecution, and the other on behalf of Mr. Harry Chicken claiming damages in respect to assault and malicious prosecution, who was instructed to take the necessary steps to defend the said actions.

The Voluntary Schools Act received the Royal Assent on the 8th April, 1897, and is an Act to provide for a Grant out of the Exchequer in aid of Voluntary Elementary Schools, and for the exemption from rates of those Schools, and to repeal part of Section 19 of the Elementary Education Act, 1876. Water Supply. On 2nd June, 1896, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered the following reports of the Surveyor, with reference to the water supply of the Parish:— "During the summer of last year I reported the failure of some of the pumps to give sufficient water for street watering purposes, and upon the 2nd July, 1895, I was instructed to have three stand-posts erected and connected with the Water Companies' mains, one near the 'Lion' p.h., and the other two in Rotherhithe Street; but owing to the terms asked by the Kent Water Company for those in Rotherhithe Street being such as I could not ask you to accept, I only erected the one near the 'Lion' p.h. I have again approached the Engineer to the Kent Water Company, and he is not prepared to supply the water by meter as in the case of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, but by the mileage of road watered, and I have succeeded in getting him to reduce the amount to £20 per mile per annum, or £50 for the miles from Surrey Bridge to Plough Bridge and the side streets. This district is watered by two carts ; and if the stand-posts are erected I shall save 8s. 10d. per day for labour now required for pumping. The average number of days the carts were out for the past two years was 105, representing a cost of £46 7s. 6d.; so taking these figures as a basis, the extra cost will only amount to £3 12s. 6d. per annum; but as this water without extra charge will be available for flushing sewers and gullies, the £3 2s. 6d. will be more than saved on that account. More efficiency will also be obtained, because at present it takes 6 hours per day to pump water, leaving only 4 hours for distribution, whereas with the stand-pipe it will only take 3 hours to fill the same number of carts; therefore, I estimate that each cart would be take to distribute one-third more water, or 24 loads per day against 18 loads, the present average quantity, if the pumps would give the water, their present yield being only about one-quarter the quantity required. "The argument set forth above is applicable to the whole of the parish, and I have to inform the Vestry that, having only one stand-pipe at the 'Lion' p.h. is a loss with no equivalent 188 advantage, but if they will give me permission to erect two, or at least, one more between that point and the Mill Pond boundary, I shall be able to save the extra labour, which in this case also amounts to 8s. 10d. per day of 10 hours; more efficiency will be obtained, and the water almost, if not quite, paid for. "It will be noticed that in the figures quoted I have not mentioned the cost of the maintenance of the pumps, which has for the past two years averaged £15 per annum. "In further reference to my report, re street watering, I have to report a further deficiency of water, and that six of the pumps are now unable to yield sufficient water for street watering purposes, and that the following stand-posts are necessary to provide an adequate supply:— Three in Rotherhithe Street, from Surrey entrance to Plough Bridge. Two in Lower Road, etc., from "Red Lion" p.h. to Mill Pond Bridge, and One in Rotherhithe New Road, near Hawkstone Road. "If these are erected the street watering can be efficiently performed, except in exceptional periods, with six vans instead of eight as at present, 19s. per day being saved in horse-hire, and 26s. 6d. per day for pumpers' labour. "I have had complaints from the men of the great difficulty that is experienced in pumping the water. They have often to continue pumping for nearly an hour to obtain one load. "After deducting a sum of £1 8s. 4d. (the cost of the use of an estimated amount of 40,000 gallons of water per day at 8½d. per 1,000 gallons) from the estimated saving of 45s. Gd. per day as shown above, I calculate there would be an annual saving of £90 2s. 6d., or 17s. 2d. per day for a season of 105 days." Resolved (1.) That the Vestry enter into an agreement with the Kent Waterworks Company for a supply of water for that part of the parish which lies within the area of supply:—From Swing Bridge, Rotherhithe Street, to Plough Bridge, Plough Road, including the side streets, being a distance of 2½ miles, at a cost of £20 per mile per annum, or a sum of £50 for the whole area. (2.) That the Surveyor be authorised to have erected three hydrants within the area of supply. 189 (3.) That the Surveyor be authorised to have erected three stand-posts connected with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company's mains, at the following points:— Hothfield Place, Culling Road, and Rotherhithe New Road. (4.) That the Vestry enter into an agreement with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company for the supply of water thereto at a rate not exceeding 8½d. per 1,000 gallons. (5.) That the Surveyor in his discretion employ a sufficient number of water carts to efficiently water the roads in the parish. On 15th September, 1896, the Sanitary Committee reported having considered a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Battersea, stating that that Vestry has had under consideration the question of the water supply of the Metropolis, and in connection therewith the Special Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the London Water Companys' Bills, dated 7th July, 1896, and had directed a communication to be addressed to Her Majesty's Government urging that effect might be given to the recommendations contained in the Report referred to, and asking this Vestry to take similar action. Copy Report referred to. "Your Committee beg to report that they have had before them up to this date the following Bills:— "The Chelsea Water Company's Bill. "The Lambeth Water Company's Bill. "The Staines Reservoirs Bill. "The New River Water Company's Bill. "The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Bill. "1. They have passed the Preambles of these four Bills, making, extensive alterations in the clauses, and in the case of the Staines Reservoirs Bill amending the Preamble. They found that the Preamble of the Southwark and Vauxhall Bill had not been proved . 190 "2. In dealing with these Bills your Committee have observed to the beat of their judgment the instruction given to them by the House, and confined the powers conferred upon these several Companies to those works, and that acquisition of laud 'which could not, in their judgment, be postponed without detriment to the interests of the public.' "8. The evidence before your Committee clearly points out that no large new source of water supply for the constantly increasing wants of these districts could be made available for at least 13 to 14 years from the present time, and that therefore the population must be supplied from sources now available for a similar period, and that as the present powers of supply of some of these companies will soon be exhausted, and the storage is already inadequate, provision must be made in the public interest for the further supply and storage of water required in the interval. "4. The population deriving their daily water supply from the companies whose Bills have been under consideration amount to no less than 3,8G3,566, "5. Whilst it has been alleged that the prevention of waste would in some cases place more water at the disposal of the water companies, on the other hand the large increase of the population, the substitution of constant for intermittent supply, and especially the decided evidence that there is a largely increased consumption per head of the population, for domestic, sanitary, and municipal purposes, far outweigh any probabilities of savings and economies that any practicable methods could introduce. "6. In addition, the imperative demand for water compels that some provision should be made for exceptional drought, floods, frosts, and those casualties to which a water supply is always liable. The storage, in the case of the three companies interested in the Staines Reservoirs Bill (except West Middlesex, which obtained considerable powers for increased storage in 1894, which are about completed), is greatly deficient, and far short of the estimate of the Royal Commission of 1803, and of the amount deemed to be necessary by the water examiner and experts, to secure a good, wholesome and constant supply, and for provision in case of even a small excess in demand. "7. It has been suggested that more water might be obtained by pumping direct from the river Thames, and thus avoiding a present outlay in storage reservoirs, but it seems to your Committee that this expedient would only aggravate the acknowledged evils and dangers of deficient storage, and might involve taking water direct from the river when it would be most unsuitable to do so, instead of obtaining it from a storage supply drawn from the river at times most suitable for pumping. 8. Your Committee have had before them the report and suggestions of the Local Government Board, and of the Board of Agriculture. They have endeavoured to embody in the Bills the suggestions made by these authorities. 191 "9. The price of issue of the stock to be raised will in all cases be settled by the Governor of the Bank of England. It will be sold subject to the Standard Auction Clauses. " 10. Any premiums will be used in reduction of the authorised amount. Powers to redeem the stock at par at the end of 25 years have been inserted. The Sinking Fund Clause has been adapted to all the money raised in each case. "11. In the Staines Reservoirs Bill a clause has been inserted, to the effect that in the event of a sale of any of the three subscribing companies within seven years from the passing of the Act to any public body or trust, the advantages conferred by this Act, shall not he deemed to have enhanced the value for purposes of sale of any of the three companies obtaining that Act. A clause has also been inserted bringing the Staines Reservoirs under the auditors appointed by the London Water Act of 1871. "12. During the course of their inquiry your Committee have frequently had their attention drawn to paragraphs Nos. 176, 177, and 180 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Water Supply of the Metropolis, dated 8th September, 1893. No regulations yet exist, as recommended by the Royal Commission, as to the processes deemed necessary before water is in a fit condition to be supplied to the consumer. No Statutory regulations applying to all Metropolitan water companies are in force as to the periods for pumping, nor as to the proper appliances and regulations for the subsidence and filtration of water. "13. The water examiner, whilst treated with the greatest courtesy by the water companies, has no legal right of entry, or power to check the quantities taken out of the rivers and springs as reported to him by the companies, or the quantities delivered into the main for the supply of consumers. "14. Whilst it is practically proved by the low rate of mortality from typhoid fever in the Metropolis (Frankland's Report, page 145,1894-95) that care is taken to ensure a good and wholesome supply of water, your Committee submit that where the health of so enormous a population confined in so comparatively small an area, is concerned, no executive Government ought to delay dealing with these most important questions. As your Committee have elsewhere pointed out, London must be supplied under any circumstances for several years to come, and probably in future in great measure, from the present sources of supply, and therefore, in any event such regulations as the above-named paragraphs recommend are imperatively necessary, and cannot be delayed without some risk to the public health. "15. Your Committee would with great deference point out that the present position of the London water supply is not in accordance with the public interest "16. By the now established mode of issuing all new stock by auction, and by theapplication of the sinking fund to all moneys required by the companies for their further development, they have no longer the stimulus of remuneiation, which is one of the wholesome 192 factors in open trade, whilst, on the other hand, the consumer is left without that care of his interests which is ensured by placing the supply under a representative body in whose election he is made personally interested. "17. In the meantime, each Session, applications to Parliament are being made which are opposed by local authorities and private persons. These proceedings arc annually costing a very large sum of money, and Committees of Parliament have the almost impossible task assigned to them of deciding what powers should be granted to water companies in order that they may provide for the wants of an ever-increasing population, and what powers withheld to avoid the water companies acquiring an increased value, in the event of a purchase by a public authority. "18. From this acknowledged anomalous position it would be greatly to the public interest that both the water companies and the inhabitants of London should be speedily freed." Resolved—That the Vestry of Battesrsea be informed in reply thereto that this Vestry is of opinion that the water supply of the Metropolis should be taken out of the hands of the water companies, and a water trust created by the Government with as little delay as possible, and the question of a supplementary supply considered. On 20th October, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Camberwell stating that a complaint having been received, a sample of water had recently been taken by a Sanitary Inspector of that Vestry from the main of one of the water companies supplying that parish. The sample, properly sealed, was taken by direction of the Public Health Committee to the Local Government Board in order that the same might be analysed, which the Board refused to do, stating that they did not "cause analyses of the London water supply to be made for local authorities," and, under these circumstances, and having regard to the faot that the Local Government Board was the only water authority for the Metropolis, asking that this Vestry would approach the Local Government Board in order that in future apparently unsatisfactory samples of water submitted to the Board should be analysed. Resolved.— Upon the motion of Mr. Beasley, seconded by Mr. Higgs, that the Clerk write a letter to the Local Government Board, urging the desirability of apparently unsatisfactory samples of water submitted to the Beard by local authorities being analysed under the Board's direction. 193 On 17th November, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Assistant Secretary, Local Government Board, stating in reply to the Vestry's letter re water analysis, that the Board had considered the suggestion made in such letter, but could not arrange for the analysis of samples of water which might be sent to them by the local authorities of the Metropolis. Water Troughs. On 19th January, 1897, the Vestry Resolved—That the water trough in Neptune Street be moved lower down the street between Messrs. Brandram's gates and Moodkee Street, and that the Clerk notify the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association accordingly. On 2nd February, 1897, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Secretary, Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, expressing the hope that the Vestry would cause the work of the removal and re-erection of the trough in Neptune Street to be done without cost to the Association, its funds being at a low ebb. Resolved—(Mr. Mortimer, Mr. Buhner)—That the Association be informed that the Vestry are prepared to incur the expense of removing the trough in question. 194 ROTHERHITHE, LONDON.

Forty-seven licenses'were granted to erect scaffolds and hoardings on the public footpaths and carriageways for new buildings, alterations, or repairs; an increase of thirteen when compared with the number granted last year. Roads and Footways. In addition to general repairs, special works have been executed, as enumerated below . Tiger Bay.—The Apportionments being paid, the road has been pitched with 4 in. by 4 in. granite setts on 6 in. concrete, with a granite kerb on each side and a footway of York flagging upon the south-east side. The total amount of the apportionment was £79 4s.; the work included 102 ft. kerb laid, 48 sq. ft. flags relay, 141 sq. ft. new (lags supplied and laid, and 96½ sup. yds. pitching. 202 Hatteraick Street.—The portion of the street extending from Adam's Gardens to the wood-yard has been paved with 4 in. by 4 in. granite setts upon a foundation of 6 in. of cement concrete, a granite kerb placed along each side, and the footways flagged. The cost was apportioned amongst the owners, and amounted to £42 17s. l0d.; the work included 103½ ft. kerb laid, 41 sq. ft. flags relay, 119 sq. ft. new Victoria, and 421/3 sq. yds. pitching. Nolan Place,—This place has been paved with tar macadam upon a foundation of hard core, with a granite channel down the centre. The cost was apportioned upon the owners and amounted to .£47 14s. 3d. The area is 1131/3 sq. yds. Galleywall Road.—A memorial, extensively signed, having been presented to the Vestry, complaining of the state of the footway in Galleywall Road, the same from Rotherhithe New Road to Lynton Road has been relaid, the existing stones refaced or new supplied where necessary, the kerb was relaid on concrete and a new three-course granite channel provided for the roadway. I have received instructions to continue the channel and relay the kerb to Southwark Park Road, but this extension was not carried out at the end of the year. Yeoman Street.—In connection with the work of connecting the New Approach Road with Plough Road and by reason of the setting back of the pier at the end of the boundary wall 20 ft. from the line of Plough Road, this road has been reformed from the latter road to Chilton Street, the kerbs and footways have been relaid, a foundation put in for the road, which has been covered with broken granite, rolled, and thoroughly consolidated. Lower Road. (Bank to Cope Street).—The condition of this portion of the main road having become such that it was impossible to satisfactorily patch it, the same has been, on the west side, entirely relaid from tramway to kerb, the whole of the atones redressed, and new supplied to make up for the waste. The total cost was £143 0s. 10d., of which sum £40 3s. was repaid by the Tramway Company for portion of the work they were liable for. Nelldale Road. The kerb on both sides of this road has been relaid to the extent of 700 ft-., and 3685 sq. ft. of flags relaid. 203 Abbeyfield Road—In this road 649 ft. of kerb and 2928 sq. ft. of flags have been relaid, 671 sq. ft. flags faced, squared, and relaid, and 17 sq. ft. of new flags laid. Mossington Road.—The footways on both sides of this road have received attention. 591 ft. of kerb and 3406 sq. ft. of flags were relaid, and 140 sq. ft. of new flags laid. Raymouth Road.—The footway in this road opposite Nos. 124-144 has been relaid to the extent of 847 sq. ft.; 153 ft. of kerb was also relaid. Cranham Road.—This road has received considerable attention during the past year ; the kerbs were relaid for a length of 1265 ft., and 4852 sq. ft. of flags relaid, 2426 sq. ft. refaced, squared, and relaid, and 76 sq. ft. of new laid. Silwood Street.—In Silwood Street the kerb has been relaid for a length of 802 ft., 3626 sq. ft. of flags relaid, 1247 sq. ft. refaced, squared, and relaid, and 127 sq. ft. of New York supplied. Pedworth Road.—Extensive repairs have been executed in this road, 557 feet of kerb and 2,940 sq. ft. of flags were relaid and 85 sq. ft. of New York laid. Hawkstone Road-—In this road the following repairs have been executed : 106 ft. kerb and 892 sq. ft. flagging relaid, 179 sq. ft. refaced, squared, and relaid, and 22Y sq. it. NewYork laid. Culling Road.—The condition of this road towards the end of last year became so unsatisfactory that extensive repairs were absolutely necessary to both footways and roadway. The kerbs were relaid for a length of 750 ft., the footways relaid for an area of 4367 sq. ft., the whole of the roadway picked over, coated, and rolled, the area being 2365 sq. yds., and 178 tons 15 cwt. of broken granite was used. IIderton Road —This road has received attention to both footways and roadway. 279 ft. of kerb and 2070 sq. ft. of flags were relaid, and 28 sq. ft. ot New York supplied. The roadway for an area of 950 sq. yds. was picked up, coated, and rolled, 59 tons 13 cwt. of broken granite being used. 204 Lower Road. (Red Lion P.H. to Boundary.)—This roadway has received attention during the past year to the extent of 604½ sq. yds., which were relaid ; the cost of the work was £'81 5s, 5d., of which sum £7 14s. 8d. was charged to the Tramway Company. Raymouth Road and Rotherhithe New Road —Repairs have been executed in these roads when necessary, and some portions have been relaid the whole width, extending from the tram lines to the kerb, the width for 3 ft. outside the rails when executed by my men being in all cases charged to the Tramway Company. In addition to the streets above enumerated, the following are the important ones that have received attention: Footways- Trident Street. Corbetts Lane. Rotherhithe New Road. Southwark Park Road.

Up to the 29th September, 1896, the Contractor was required to remove the street sweepings to a shoot provided by him outside the parish, but since that date it has been taken to the Vestry s wharf in Rotherhithe Street, and tipped into craft provided by the Barging Contractor. During the year 9,518½ cubic yards of slop have been removed from the streets by the Contractors, Mr. E. Donogan and Messrs. A. T. Hobman & Son, at a cost of £1,205 16s. 9d., but to which amount must be added the proportion of the Barging Contract. This quantity is in excess of the previous year by 1,883 cubic yards, or 23 per cent., practically the whole of such increase occurring in the last quarter (January to March). A small poition of this increase can be accounted for by the more efficient cleansing of the main loads by sweeping them with the machine brush, which commenced work on the 16th January, but the greater portion was caused by the extremely wet season, and the many endeavours made to finish the work each night, only to find that it was necessary to do the same work again next morning, and to the snow-storms which occurred 7th, 23rd and 25th January, the collections for this work being included in the total for the year, and amount to 310 cubic yards. 207 The following table gives the weekly collection of Slop, Material Carts hired, Street Watering Horses hired, and the amount of Silt removed from sewers and gullies, Horses hired and water used for flushing same.

Un employed. Except for cleansing the streets after the snow storms no especial works were undertaken for the relief of the unemployed, and very few applications were received of persons out of employment during the past winter. Steam Roller. The steam roller has been fully employed during the past year to the greatest possible benefit to the parish. Previous to the purchase of the roller, when stone was placed upon a road it was allowed to remain there without complaint for weeks, but now things are altered, and I am constantly receiving enquiries to know when the roller is coming, if it does not immediately follow the roadman, the parishioners not being satisfied until the road is thoroughly consolidated. The cost of working during the year has been as follows £ 8. d. Driving 165 days 48 2 6 Cleaning, Oil, Packing, Coke, Repairs, etc. 35 17 2 83 19 8 10 per cent, depreciation 39 0 0 £122 19 8 The total working days were 165, and if a roller had been hired for that period the cost would have amounted to £280 10s., showing a saving of £157 0s. 4d. upon the year's work by having our own roller. The amount added to the saving reported in my last annual report makes a total of £271, or 75 per cent, of the cost of the roller. It was engaged in 48 streets in different parts of the parish, and was out on hire for 6 days. 211 New Sewers. The sewers constructed during the year have been in substitution of old defective ones, and consist of the following lengths :— 15 inch pipe—Swan Lane (S. of Albion Street) 202 feet 12 ,, Swan Lane to Clarence Street, (across property) 205 12 ,, Connection W. side Swan Lane 58 9 ,, Chilton Street (rear of S. side W. of Croft Street to No. 6) 4G5 ,, Total 930 feet The old defective sewer in Swan Lane belonged to the London County Council, and consisted of a brick culvert. After correspondence they agreed to contribute the cost of constructing the new 15-inch pipe sewer in that road, as per my estimate of £115 12s. 6d., upon the Vestry agreeing to transfer all connections draining into the old culvert, into the new sewer, fill up the same and maintain and flush the new pipe ; this was done, and the amount as agreed has been paid into the Vestry's account. In all cases the new sewers have been laid to uniform gradients between the points of inspection, laid on and surrounded with cement concrete, with provision of manholes where required, and flushing manholes at the ends of the sewers whenever possible. During tho past year 279| cubic yards of deposit have been removed from the sewers. The cost of carting away the whole and the disposal of that collected to September, 1896, amounts to £48 8s. 11d. A one-horse flushing cart and two men were employed flushing the sewers upon 117 days and 1572 loads of water or 393,000 gallons were used. Three 50-feet lengths of leather flushing hose have been obtained from Messrs. J. Heathman & Co. at a cost of £16. On the 16th March the Vestry accepted the tender of Messrs. E. H. Bayley & Co. for a 450-gallon combined flushing and street watering van at a cost of £865, as recommended in my last year's report, but the same has not yet been delivered. Complaints being received as to the emission of foul gases from the open gratings in the street upon the County Council's sewer in Rotherhithe Street, consents were obtained 212 from the owners of property and up-cast shaft ventilations erected in lieu theieof by the County Council at the following places 654, Rotherhithe Street. 622, Rotherhithe Street. Nelson Dock. Lavender Wharf. A similar complaint was received as regards theVestry's sewer in Neptune Court, and an up-cast ventilator was erected at a cost of £'.2 13s. 4d. Gullies. The gullies now number 820, being an increase of 2 during the year; they have been regularly cleansed upon the same principle as previously reported. 858 cubic yards of deposit have been removed from them and a horse and cart has been engaged flushing them out on 73½ days, using 937 loads or 234,250 gallons of water. The new gullies have been inserted as follows:— Tiger Bay 1 Yeoman Street 1 Fourteen of the existing gullies have been found with broken traps, and have had new stoneware ones inserted, surrounded with concrete, in the streets as detailed below:— Trinity Road 1 Clack Street 1 Abbeyfield Road 1 Ilderton Road 2 Rotherhithe Street 1 Oldfield Road 1 Beatson Street 2 Tissington Street 1 Parfitt Road 1 Dilston Grove 1 Trinity Road 1 Swan Lane 1 Thirteen new gully grates to replace worn out and broken ones have been fixed as follows:— St. Marychurch Street 1 Lower Road 1 Rotherhithe Street 1 Cranham Road 2 Litlington Street 1 Odessa Street 1 Silver Street 1 Galleywall Road 2 Neptune Street 1 Suffolk Street 1 Debnams Road 1 •218 Manholes. New manholes have been constructed upon the sewers during the year, and provided with heavy cast-iron circular covers, in the following streets—those fixed at the ends of sewers being provided with flushing penstocks:— Swan Lane to Clarence Street 6 Chilton Street (rear of) 3 Seven flushing penstocks were used in connection with these manholes. The following existing manholes which were covered over below the ground level have been brought to the surface and provided with covers:— Parfitt Road 2 Cranbam Road 2 Silwood Street 1 Silverlock Street 2 Rotherhithe Street 3 Bracton Road 1 Culling Road 1 Old Road 1 New oak blocks have been inserted in the covers where necessary, the cost of the same being £4 5s. Od. Drainage Works. One hundred and sixty-two notices have been received in reference to the re-drainage of houses, erection of new houses, etc., as follows:— Existing houses re-drained Buildings and premises other than houses drained oi re-drained New houses erected or re-built and drained Other buildings ditto 29 Additions and alterations to houses House drains cleansed House ditto (sanitary requisitions) 312 214 In connection with the above, 26 new connections have been made with the sewers; of this number, 9 were connected to the County Council's mains. The cost charged to the owners for the connections and for the necessary interceptor and inspection chamber under the footway where no forecourt existed, amounted to £120 l3s. 11d. Very little difficulty has arisen during the year in getting the drainage regulations carried out by builders and others when executing the various works, as I think owners of property are beginning to realise the necessity of having the work done well once for all. Upon several occasions I have been asked to give a certificate upon the completion of the work, which request 1 have in every case complied with. In a number of cases the very vexed question of combined drain v. sewer, owing to the present unsatisfactory state of the law, has come to the front, but in all instances we have been able to prove that the pipe in question was not a sewer, and therefore repairable by the owner. During the past year the whole of the old drainage notices for Surrey and Kent at the London County Council offices, extending from March, 1818, to October, 1855, have been examined, and copies made of those having reference to this parish. They consisted of 16 volumes, numbering in all about 7,300 notices, and copies have been made of 321 of them, including sketches of the plans attached. The minute books of the Commissioners were also examined and abstracts taken therefrom. A special assistant, under my direction, was engaged for this work at a salary of 50/- per week, and it took 21 weeks to complete. He commenced his duties on the 19th October, 1896, and finished 13th March, 1897, the total amount paid in salary being £52 10s. These old records will prove exceedingly useful, and enable us to trace the drainage of houses executed, previous to the constitution of the Vestry, and under the direction of the Commissioners of Sewers. Street Watering. At the commencement of the watering season the pumps were again examined, and found deficient of water, so that I was compelled to again bring before you the question of taining a supply of water from the mains belonging to the Kent and Southwark Water Companies. 215 Early in the season I again approached the Kent Company as to a moderation of their charges, and succeeded in obtaining terms which I considered reasonable, and which you accepted, viz., £20 per mile per annum, or £50 per annum for the miles from Surrey Bridge to Plough Bridge and the side streets; the stand-posts were erected as soon as possible, and, although only available for the second half of the season, I am of opinion a considerable saving was effected, this district being now watered with one van instead of two as formerly, and pumper's wages amounting to 8/10 per day is saved. This water is also used for flushing purposes without additional charge. As regards the area of the Parish supplied from the mains of the Southwark & Vauxhall Company, the one standpost near the "Bed Lion" p.h. as it did not independently supply any one district was a loss with no equivalent advantage, as the water had to be paid for and no labour saved, the extra man having to be in attendance to assist the carter when pumping water at the other ends of the districts, therefore the Vestry consented to my erecting three additional ones upon the same terms as the one already existing, so that the street watering could be executed by the carters alone. These were also only available for a part of the season. The stand-posts therefore now number seven, fixed in the following positions Near " Bed Lion " p.h., Botherhithe New Road. Silwood Street. Hothfield Place. Culling Boad. Swing Bridge Boad, near Messrs. Holland's. Cow Lane. Beatson Street. The cost of erecting the additional ones and maintaining the whole number being as under:— £ s. d. £ s. d.

The total cost of the street watering amounted to £427 2s. 5d., and is divided as follows :— £ s. d. Horse Hire and Drivers 265 1 1 Labour Pumpers 69 19 3 Water from Posts and Rents 67 2 1 Kent Company, half season 25 0 0 £427 2 5 559½ horses were hired for the watering, and I estimate the quantity of water used as under :— 4351½ Loads pumped from Wells 1,523,000 gallons. 4995½ Loads, Southwark & Vauxhall Mains 1,690,000 „ 770 Loads, Kent Company's Mains 269,500„ Total 3,482,500 „ Previous to the commencement of the season, the eight vans and two carts were thoroughly overhauled, repaired, and painted by Messrs. Oakley & Son at a cost of £.51 7s. 6d. A further expense of £7 10s. 8d. was incurred in repairing sundry defects during the season, making the total repairs £58 18s. 4d. 217 Urinals. One additional urinal, for three persons, situate in Rotherhithe Street, near Swan Lane, has been elected during the year, making a total of ten, with accommodation for 39 persons at one time. The cost of the above-mentioned urinal was as follow:— £ s. d. £ s. d. Macfarline's account 35 0 0 „ additional Screen 12 5 0 47 5 0 Company's charges connecting water supply 4 9 2 Vestry's Plumber, fixing regulating and bye-pass flushing taps 2 11 6 £54 5 8 The circular urinal at the junction of Union Road and Lower Road was damaged by vans upon two occasions; the urinal near Swan Lane twice, and the one near Lavender Bridge once, wantonly damaged and the supply pipes stolen. The damage in all cases was repaired as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the increase in the number of urinals, I am pleased to be able to report that the accounts for water used again show a decrease amounting to £5 14s. 11d. as compared with last year's accounts. The total cost of the maintenance of the 10 urinals for the year is as follows:– £ s. d. £ s. d. Wages, urinal man, 52 weeks 71 12 0 „ Sundays and Bank Holidays 7 5 0 78 17 0 Carried forward 78 17 0 218  £ s. d. £ s. #] Brought forward 78 17 0 Water Supply and Rents of Meters Rotherhithe New Road and Bush Road 4 11 9 Lower and Hawkstone Roads 8 4 1 Halfway House, Rotherhithe New Road 8 18 11 Union and Lower Roads 14 3 1 Railway Avenue 9 12 5 Neptune Street 4 14 0 Rotherhithe Street, near Swan Lane (3 qrs.) 3 8 11 Derrick Street 11 5 10 Globe Street 6 5 0 Lavender Bridge 4 0 10 75 4 10 Repairs to urinals 10 15 9 Urinal brooms 0 17 6 £165 15 1 Average per urinal per annum, £147. Average cost per unit of accommodation per annum, £4 5s. The total quantity of water used as registered by the meters, 1,812,000 gallons. The urinals attached to twelve public houses in different parts of the Parish are also cleansed by the urinal man, as per the list given in my 1895 report. In addition to the above, two 6-stall urinals are maintained in Southwark Park Road by the Vestry of Bermondsey, at the joint expense of the two Vestries. Their maintenance last year amounting to £83 12s. 2d., of which amount the Vestry paid one-half, or £41 16s. 1d. Lighting. At the commencement of the year the Public Lamps in the Parish numbered as follows:— Ordinary Street Lamps 495 Sugg's Patent Lamps 4 10 ft. per hour Lamps 2 Large Lanterns 4 505 219 Seven aditional lamps have been erected, two lamps discontinued, and the positions of seven lamps altered during the year: NEW LAMPS. Luxford Street 1 Corbetts Lane 1 Cornick Street 1 Neptune Street side of Town Hall (temporary) 2 Lower Road, front of Town Hall do. 2 — 7 LAMPS DISCONTINUED. Providence Place 1 Baker's Rents 1 2 — 5 Total 510 LAMPS ALTERED. Luxford Street: owing to additional lamp in street. Rotherhithe Street: (2) on account of new footway opposite South Wharf. Nolan Place : bracket to column. Osprey Street: to improved position. Ccrnick Street : owing to additional lamp in street. Slipper's Place : ditto Cornick Street. The experiments with incandescent burners to five lamps upon the Union Road was continued to the 17th June, 1896, from the 14th November, 1895—a period extending over 216 nights, or 2,212 lighting hours per lamp, and upon the 7th July I presented the following report:— Consumption per hour ordinary street burners 5 cubic feet Do. incandescent burners with pilot light, say 4¼ „ Saving in gas ¾ cubic feet per hour per lamp, or 15 per cent. = 8,295 cubic feet for the 5 lamps during the above-mentioned period. Average number of mantles used per lamp, 15. Average life of mantles, 14.4 nights, or 147½ lighting hours. 220 £ s. d.

The present nett cost of the burners, not included in the above figures, is 9/1, to which must be added cost of fixing. Increased illumination taken from experiments made by the Gas Company, 70 per cent. Present increased cost over ordinary burners for maintenance 36 per cent. The Company desired to discontinue the use of the burners for a time until further perfection was obtained, but at the request of the Vestry they consented to allow them to remain up. On the 16th December, I placed before you a further communication from the Gas Company, that they were prepared to undertake the lighting, repairs, cleaning, and all responsibility in connection with lamps fitted with incandescent burners upon payment of an additional sum of 12/- per lamp beyond the price now paid for lamps fitted with ordinary burners, upon that basis I placed before you figures referring to the whole of the lamps upon the main road from Mill Pond to the Deptford Boundary, but as the existing patent has only three years to run, the Vestry declined for the present to entertain the question. A great diminution in the amount of gas consumed in the Clock Tower of Christ Church has taken place since it was fitted with an automatic arrangement for raising and lowering the supply, and for the past year there is only a difference of 2,300 cubic feet between it and the St. Mary's Church Clock. The following table shows the amount consumed per quarter for both clocks :— Christ Church. 1,000 c. ft. St. Mary's. 1,000 c.

The repairs to the various trenches opened by the Companies under the powers of their respective Acts of Parliament, have been executed by the employees of the Vestry at a cost to the Companies of £759 16s. 1d., this is £76 12s. 10d less than last year.

The following re-naming and re-numbering orders have been received from the County Council, and new name plates of cast iron with raised letters have been put up, and where necessary the houses have been re-numbered by the owners, after receiving the notice from me, in accordance with the orders. " Windsor Terrace," Suffolk Street, abolition of subsidiary name. Neptune Court, now Aylton Street. (2) Mary Street, William Street, now Hobman Street. (2) Adam Place, Adam Street; now Oran Place. Princes Place, St. Mary Church Street; now Regia Place. Wyndham Road, now Brunei Road. (2) Wharf, Rotherhithe Street. Considerable progress has been made during the year in the work of adapting the premises at Bull Head Dock and Victoria Oil Mills for the use of the Vestry as a Depot and Wharf. The Contract for the River Walls and Dock was completed by the Contractor, Mr. Thomas Adams, of Wood Green, N., on the 1st September, and the accounts, as agreed between the Contractor and myself, amounted to £3678 9s. lid., or £45 6s. less than the amount of the tender as accepted. Owing to a sudden dip in the level of the ballast, at the south-east corner of the Dock, it was necessary, so as to ensure a good foundation, to carry the concrete wall considerably below the levels shown upon the contract drawings, the depths varying from 2ft. 6in. to 7ft. 9in., for a length of 3'2ft. along the east side, and 21ft. along the end wall, the cost of weak was £100 16s. 6d., and is included in the amount of the settled accounts. 223 The Committee appointed to inspect recently-erected Dust Destructors in London and the Provinces presented their report on the 7th July, the consideration of which was deferred to enable them to visit Lewisham to inspect a new form of Destructor, which was promised to be at work in a few weeks, but they were compelled to wait over seven months, and it was only on the 27 th February that they were enabled to see the machine in operation. This long period of waiting was not altogether without advantage, as during that time the Destructor at Leyton, which at the date of their first report was in course of erection, was completed, and commenced working during the first week in October. The Committee were so impressed with what they saw at Leyton on the 10th December, and from additional information which they obtained from a source independent of the makers, that on the 16th February they reported to the Vestry a modification of their report of the 7th July, and unanimously recommended in favour of this form of Destructor. The report was adopted at your meeting on the 16th March, and I was instructed to prepare, as soon as possible, the necessary drawings. The Destructor, which will consist of two cells, will be approached by an inclined road, with a gradient of 1 in 20, to the tipping shed, the refuse being shot into shoots, one to each cell, and the cells charged alternately so as to ensure an even temperature in the combustion chamber. The outlets to the flues are at the opposite end to the feed openings, so that the gases pass through the hotest part of the fire on their way to the chimney. The fire bars will be stationary and fixed level, and the clinker will be removed by hand through openings in the side of the cells, the clinkering floor level being 9ft. 6in. below the level of the tipping floor. Forced draught from a fan will be introduced under the grate, the ash health being sealed. Immediately behind the combustion chamber will be placed two 64-h.p. water tube boilers, with a by-pass flue between them, and the dampers will be so arranged that the gases pass round the tubes of one or birth boilers, or direct to the chimney through the bypass flue. The boilers will be fitted with auxiliary firing arrangements, and the steam generated by the waste heat will be utilised for disinfecting purposes ones, and working engine to supply power for mortar mill and electric lighting. The engine house and mortar mill shed being placed beneath the tipping she. The chimney shaft will be octagonal in form with square base, and 150ft. in height above the level of the Spring Dock, 4ft. inside diameter, with an inside lining of firebrick for a height of 100ft. 224 The house in Cathay Street, purchased for use as a shelter, proving unsuitable, I was instructed to consider whether it was not possible to provide accommodation in connection with some of the buildings to be erected at the wharf. I submitted two schemes, and it was decided to erect the shelter in the form of cubicles over the cart shed, to be erected along the Rotherhithe Street frontage. As at this period no decision was arrived at as regards the form of Destructor, I prepared the contract drawings, specification and quantities for the remainder of the buildings, except the stables, consisting of house, office, store, blacksmith and wheelwright's shop, steam roller shed and cart shed, with shelter over. The tender of Messrs. H. Knight & Son, of Tottenham, N.W., amounting to £2,226 7s. was accepted on the 1st September, the work commenced on the 20th September, and is now nearly completed. A self-contained weighbridge of 10 tons capacity, with patent steelyard, without loose weights has been fixed by Messrs. Pooley & Son, Limited, immediately in front of the office window at a cost of £66, tested and stamped by the London County Council's Inspector. The necessary drainage works for the house and buildings, and for the roadways on the east side of the Dock have been executed by the Yestry employees ; 510 tons of granite setts have been delivered for paving the whole of the roadways and under the cart shed by Mr. Wm. Wilson, of Kilsyth, N.B., in accordance with his tender at 28s. per ton, and the paving works are now in progress. Gas and water have been laid on to the house, shelter, and other buildings, and for the use of the depot. The tender of Messrs. Grafton & Co., of Bedford, for the supply of a 3-ton steam crane at £300, and those of Messrs. Stothert & Pitt, Limited, for 100 feet of railway track complete at £15 and three ½yard turn-over skips at £18 2s. 6d., were accepted. the crane, which was required to lift and lower the maximum load at a radius of 20 ffeet, was handed over by the makers on the 6th December, and commenced working immediately immediatley afterwards. Up to the end of the year the following materials had been landed. 225 MATERIALS UNLOADED BY CRANE.

Flower & Everett for the removal of street sweepings, house refuse, etc., having been accepted for the twelve months commencing 30th September, the work of tipping the material into craft was commenced on that day. As shown in the table for the removal of slop up to the end of the year, 6179¼ cubic yards of street sweepings, less the amount of snow thrown into the river, and 1488! loads of house refuse were received and dealt with. The weekly collection of house refuse is shown in the following table, but no reliable weight can be obtained until the weighbridge is in working order, as the loads vary so much in quantity :— Week ending Loads 3rd October (part), 1896 40 10th „ 1896 53 17th „ „ 53 24th „ „ 52 31st , „ „ 47 7th November „ 54 14th „ „ 56 Carried forward 355 226 Brought forward Loads 28th 355 21st „ „ „ 58½ th „ 58 5th December „ 58 12th „ 60 19th „ 58 26th „ „ 57 2nd January, 1897 62 9th „ „ 58 16th „ „ 01 23rd„ „ „ 00 30th „ 03 6th February „ 03 13th „ „ 07 20th „ „ 04 27th „ „ 58 6th March „ 58½ 13th „ 62 20th „ „ . 58 25th „ (part) 1897 49 Total for half-year 148 Street Improvements. By arrangement with the owners of the "Queen's Head" p.h. at the corner of Paradise Street and Fulford Street, an improved "give and take" line upon the Paiadise Street V Irontage was agreed to previous to the rebuilding of the premises and the work is now in hand. 227 Dock Company's Act, 1894. Considerable progress has been made during the year in carrying out the work within the company's premises, authorised by the above Act, and the new bridge across the canal near Plough Road, with the necessary approach road thereto, has been completed. The Company, desiring to close the existing Plough Bridge and a portion of London Street, to enable their contractors to complete the construction of the new canal lock, before completing new road No. 2 as required by the Act, your consent to this arrangement was asked for and obtained subject to the London County Council and the Greenwich Board of Works also agreeing to the proposal. At the request of the Vestry, the Company agreed to set back the pier at the junction of the new road with Yeoman Street, 20 feet from the line of Plough Road, providing the Vestry undertook to execute the necessary alterations to the roadways free of expense to the Company, The pier has been set back and the connection between the new approach road and Plough Road has been completed, the cost of the road and footway alterations amounting to £64 7s. 4d. The junction of the new road with Swing Bridge Road and London Street are at present in abeyance owing to the inability of the Company to obtain the consent of the Greenwich Board of Works to the before-mentioned arrangement as to the closing of the existing roads. As soon as these connections are made, the new road and bridge will bo opened for traffic, existing Plough Bridge closed and demolished. 228 Inventory of Plant, Tools and Materials. March 25th, 1897.

Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths in the parish and the Asylums Board and other Hospitals is 154. In 1893 the number was 142. In 1894 the number was 12G. In 1895 the number was 102. The marked increase is duo entirely to the excessive number of deaths from the two infantile 237 diseases Whooping Cough and Measles. All the cases of Measles were complicated with Bronchitis, Pneumonia, or Broncho-Pneumonia. In fact these various forms of lung disease were the true causes of death. The complete enumeration of deaths from Zymotic Diseases is as follows:— Smallpox, one; Scarlet Fever, ten; Enteric Fever, eleven; Typhus Fever, none; Puerperal Fever, three; Continued Fever, none; Relapsing Fever, none; Diphtheria, twentyfive; Diarrhoea, twenty-seven; Measles, forty-three; Whooping Cough, thirty-two; Erysipelas, one; Membranous Croup, one; English Cholera, none; Influenza, one.
