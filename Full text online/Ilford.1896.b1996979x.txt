Ilford Urban District Council. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, FOR THE Year ending December, 1896. Bomford: F. MYNOTT. STEAM PRINTER, EXPRESS OFFICE. Medical Officer's Report, 1896. REPORT ON THE Sanitary Condition and Health OF THE Urban District of Ilford, FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER, 1896. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In presenting my report on the Sanitary condition and health of the District of Ilford during the year 1898, I beg to state that I estimate the population of the district at 21,450, which is made up as follows:— Ilford, about 18,000 County of London Lunatic Asylum at Claybury 2,450 Dr. Barnardo's Village Home for Girls at Barkingside 1,000 Making altogether 21,450 I estimate the population of Ilford by adding the estimated population of last year to the increase of births over deaths, and the increase by inhabitants of houses put on the register since my last report:— Estimated population last year 14,700 Increase by births over deaths 313 Increase by inhabitants of new houses, allowing 5 persons to a house—600 houses 3,000 18,013 Or in round numbers 18,000. 2 The density of the population of the whole district is about 2.524 per acre. The number of persons per house in the district, excluding the County of London Lunatic Asylum, and Dr. Barnado's Village Home, is about 4.828. The total number of deaths which occurred in the district during the year was 483; of which 296 were at Claybury, and 5 at Dr. Barnado's Village Home, leaving 182 for Ilford, or at the rate of 10.111 per 1,000 per annum of the population: this death rate compares favourably with that for the year 1895, which was ll.836 per 1000 per annum. The number of births during the year in the district was 496, or at the rate of 27.555 per 1000 per annum of the population. The number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year was 324—26 of which occurred at Claybury Asylum, and 17 at Dr. Barnado's Village Home, leaving 281 for Ilford, namely— Scarlet fever 140 Diphtheria 45 Membraneous croup 1 Typhoid fever 33 Continued fever 1 Puerperal fever 2 Erysipelas 23 Measles 36 281 The cases of infectious diseases reported from Claybury Asylum were— Scarlet fever 6 Erysipelas 20 26 The cases of infectious diseases reported from Dr. Barnado's Village Homes, were— Scarlet fever 11 Erysipelas 4 Measles 2 17 Of the infectious diseases notified, 23 terminated fatally, 4 of which were at Claybury Asylum, from Erysipelas; leaving 19 for the rest of the district, or at the rate of l-055 per 1000 per annum from infectious diseases. Of the cases of Typhoid fever, 5 terminated fatally; and I sent a special report on this outbreak to the Local Government Board. 3 The remaining fatal cases from infectious diseases were— Diphtheria 7 Scarlet fever 3 Puerperal fever 2 Measles 2 There was an epidemic of scarlet fever in the autumn which necessitated closing the Beehive schools, and the Gordon Club, which at that time was being used as a temporary board school. I am of opinion that scarlet fever was spread by children who had had it being sent back to school whilst they were still in an infectious condition; in these instances the cases were probably slight and not recognized or notified by the parents. Eighteen deaths from phthisis occurred, or at the rate of 1.00 per 1,000 per annum of the population. Bakehouses are in good sanitary condition with the exception of the one mentioned in my last report, which is still impregnated with the effluvium from an adjoining stable. Burial grounds are in a satisfactory condition from a sanitary point of view. Slaughterhouses are in the same condition as last year, which was satisfactory, as are also cowsheds. Measles was, in October, added to the list of infectious diseases requiring notification. The number of houses closed during the year was two,—in Cottage Row,High Street. A Hospital for infectious diseases is being built, and will be available for use, I, hope, in a short time. I remain, gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JAMES SHIMELD, Medical Officer of Health, 4 Area and Population of the District to which this Return relates.
