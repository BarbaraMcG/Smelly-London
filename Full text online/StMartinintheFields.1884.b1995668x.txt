Pay Hall, 16th June, 1885. WILLIAM COPE, DUNC..N1RVINE Auditors. E 2 68 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 18 8 4. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St.Martin-in-theFields, for the Year 1884. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Fifteenth Annual Report 0n the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. This year is remarkable for another epidemic of Small-pox, of which I shall speak further on Births. During the year 1884 there were 401 Births registered, of which 208 were males, and 193 females. This was 2 less than in the previous year 1883, and the lowest number of the last ten years. 69 The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month of the year:— Males Females Total. January 23 17 40 February 14 17 31 March 21 20 41 April 23 26 49 May 13 14 27 June 13 15 28 July 17 11 28 August 14 16 30 September 14 12 26 October 27 15 42 November 13 15 28 December 16 15 31 208 193 401 The birth-rate of the parish for the year 1884 was 22.0 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the Births registered in the year 1884 were 137,495, which corresponded to an annual birthrate of 33.7 per 1,000. On comparing these two birth-rates it will be observed how low ours is to that of the whole of London. This circumstance, I believe, is due to the families of so many of the inhabitants residing in the suburbs. 70 Deaths. In the year 1884 there were registered 469 Deaths; this number was 61 in excess of the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 29 13 42 February 20 13 33 March 27 9 36 April 34 14 48 May 25 19 44 June 19 10 29 July 24 19 43 August 27 18 45 September 26 16 42 October 20 21 41 November 14 15 29 December 21 16 37 286 183 469 Of the above 469 Deaths, 178 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in that Institution, 158 were non-residents in the Parish. In public institutions situate without the 71 Parish, 48 deaths occurred of Parishioners. Amongst the tables at the end of my Report will be found one giving full details of these 48 deaths. Deaths, 1884 469 Deduct non-residents of the Parish who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 158 311 Add 48 Parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish .. 48 359 These 359 Deaths will be the number on which to estimate the death-rate. Death-rate per 1,000 of the population for the year 1884, 19.7. Ratio of deaths to population, 1 in 50.5. This slight increase in the death-rate over the previous year is not due to the Zymotic class of disease, for in the year 1884 the deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases were 9 less than in 1883, but is owing to an increase in the mortality from general diseases, over which sanitary science has not the control it has with infectious or contagious maladies. 72 The deaths registered in London in the year 1884 amounted to 83,050, and corresponded to a rate of 20.3 per 1,000. This was the lowest death-rate on record in London; the next lowest having been that of the immediately preceding year 1883, when the rate was 204 per 1,000. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields during the last ten years :— 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 1878 17.5 1879 18-6 1880 16.8 1881 18.5 1882 17.6 *1883 19.0 1884 19.7 Ages at Death. Of the 469 deaths, 78 occurred under 1 year, 64 from 1 to 5 years, 32 from 5 to 20 years, 94 from 20 to 40 years, 120 from 40 to GO years, 67 from 60 to 80 years, and 8 above 80 years. *This is the first year returns have been supplied to me from the Registrar-General's Office of deaths of parishioners occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish, which deaths have been added to the death-rate.—J. J. S. 73 Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The seven prineipal Zymotic Diseases are Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. From these complaints 47 deaths occurred in the Parish. This number is less than in the previous year. Ten out of the 47 deaths occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and they were all those of non-parishioners. Small-pox.—This unwelcome visitor, which every now and then comes among us as an epidemic, visited us as such in the year 1884, and destroyed 1,251 persons in London. There was no death from this disease recorded in the Parish, but two cases of residents suffering from this complaint were removed to the Stockwell Smallpox Hospital and there died ; one was a female, 24 years of age, who had never been vaccinated, and the other, a lad of 17, who also had never been vaccinated. The number of cases occurring in the Parish which came under my notice was 21, 14 of which were sent to the Metropolitan Asylums' Hospitals. If the public would more appreciate the beneficial influence of vaccination, these visitations would, I believe, cease to come among us. The two cases of the persons just mentioned who had never been vaccinated, and who died in the Stockwell Hospital, show 74 the value of vaccination, for I make bold to assert had they in their infancy been vaccinated there is every probability they would not have died from that disease. The following facts will, I think, clearly show to an unprejudiced mind the wonderful protective powers of vaccination against small-pox. In a communication addressed to me by Mr. Herbert Goude, the Resident Surgeon of the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital, Higligate, he says :— " During the past 50 years, of which alone I have the records, no permanent official of the Hospital has ever taken small-pox, even in a modified form. They are re-vaccinated on entering upon their duties, unless they bear unmistakable evidence of having had small-pox. The only official who has contracted small-pox in these 50 years Avas a temporary gardener engaged in 1881; this man refused to be re-vaccinated, took the disease and died." How anybody in the face of such strong testimony can ignore the blessings of vaccination, I am at a loss to understand. Measles. — There were 8 deaths from this disease, against 27 of the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—Only 1 death was due to this complaint; the lowest number of the last seven years. DIPHTHERIA.—From this malady 4 deaths were recorded, 3 of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and were those of non-parishioners. 75 Whooping Cough.—There were 13 deaths from this disease, against 2 of the previous year. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. Seven deaths were registered from this class of disorders, they were all due to Typhoid Fever, 6 of which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and were those of nonparishioners. Diarrhcea caused 14 deaths, 13 of which were in children under 5 years of age. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 137. This number is 17 in excess of the previous year. Disease of the Heart.—24 deaths were recorded from this complaint, against 32 of the previous year. Cancer proved fatal to 18 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed further on. Inquests. In the year 1883, there were held 73 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 31 Run over or knocked down in the street 9 Burns and scalds 2 Carried forward. 42 76 Brought forward 42 Suffocation 2 Poisoning, Aconite 1 „ Carbolic Acid 1 Pistol-shot wound 2 Drowning 4 Wound of Throat 3 Hanging 1 Injuries received from jumping out of a window 1 Injuries received from falling off an omnibus 1 Injuries received from falling down stairs 3 „ „ „ off a ladder 3 „ „ a falling coping 1 „ „ in alighting from a train at Charing Cross Station of the South Eastern Railway 1 Injuries received from a falling stone 1 „ „ when driving and coming into collision with another vehicle 2 Injuries received from falling down an area 1 Injuriesreceivedatthe Alhambra Theatre „ „ by an infant from being squeezed between the bed and wall . 1 1 Intemperance 1 73 77 Sanitary Work. Ill the year 1884, 121 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property, besides numerous verbal recommendations to remedy nuisances and sanitary defects. A summons had to be taken out against the owner of 4, St. Martin's Court, for neglecting to comply with the notice served upon him, ordering certain sanitary works and repairs to be performed to the house above-mentioned. The magistrate condemned the owner in costs. Bakehouses. The duty of inspecting the bakehouses having reverted to the Vestry, I have accordingly devoted my attention to them. On the whole they are well kept. I have been very particular in insisting that the water used in the manufacture of the bread should come from a cistern independent of that supplying a closet. Houses Let in Lodgings, &c. Section 35 of the Sanitary Act, 1866, was put in force in this Parish. The section says :—"On application to one of her Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, by the nuisance authority of the City of 78 London, of any district or parish included within the Act for the better local government of the metropolis, or of any municipal borough, or of any place under the Local Government Act, 1858, or any local improvement Act, or of any city or town containing, according to the census for the time being in force, a population of not less than five thousand inhabitants, the Secretary of State may, as he may think fit, by notice to be published in the London Gazette, declare the following enactment to be in force in the district of such nuisance authority, and from and after the publication of such notice the nuisance authority shall be empowered to make regulations for the following matters; that is to say : 1. For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. "2. For the registration of houses thus let or occupied in lodgings. " 3. For the inspection of such houses, and the keeping the same in a cleanly and wholesome state " 4 For enforcing therein the provision of privy accommodation, and other appliances and means of cleanliness, in proportion to the 79 number of lodgings and occupiers, and the cleansing and ventilation of the common passages and staircases. "5. For the cleansing and lime-whiting at stated times of such premises. "The nuisance authority may provide for the enforcement of the above regulations, by penalties not exceeding forty shillings for any one offence, with an additional penalty not exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which a default in obeying such regulations may continue; but such regulations shall not be of any validity unless and until they shall have been confirmed by the Secretary of State. "But this section shall not apply to common lodging houses within the provisions of the Common Lodging Houses Act, 1851, or any Act amending the same." To carry out the provisions of the above section you appointed a special Sanitary Inspector to assist me in the details; 292 houses were inspected, and the 2,038 rooms therein were measured for the purpose of ascertaining their cubical contents. Regulations were drawn up for the management of these houses, which were confirmed by the Local Government Board on 26th June, 1884. Mr. William Cooke, the Inspector 80 of Nuisances, you appointed permanent inspector of these houses. The question will be naturally asked —How do these new regulations work 1 My reply is that the time since they have been in force is too short to ascertain the result. At the end of the tables will be found a copy of the regulations for houses let in lodgings, &c. (pages 91 to 98). Mortuary Chapel. This building was erected ten years ago on a part of the site of the Drury Lane burial ground for the purpose of receiving the dead in the interval between death and burial of those people who have no accommodation for keeping a corpse in their home. I have ascertained that 290 bodies have been received there since it was opened. This is a small number for ten years, and I think it is a great pity such a convenient place is not more appreciated. The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed, those gullies emitting offensive effluvia have also been flushed with carbolic acid and water, and the several courts and passages in the Parish lime-whited. In conclusion, I must again bear testimony to the zeal and intelligence of your Inspector in the discharge of his duties, and also acknowledge with 81 thanks the promptitude with which the Relieving Officer of the district keeps me informed of all infectious diseases and nuisances coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street, June, 1885b f 82 BIRTHS and DEATHS, &c., for the last Ten Years. 1875 1876 1877 1878 1879 1880 1881 1882 1883 ???
