Grosvenor Chapel.—Stipend of Incumbent. The Rev. C. E. Wright, the Incumbent of Grosvenor Chapel, having died on the 31st December, 1877, and the Rev.

Treatment of Epidemic Diseases. The opinion of the Vestry having been invited, by the Managers of the Metropolitan District Asylums, on a report of a Committee of that Board, respecting the provision for the isolation, and treatment, of epidemic infectious disease in the Metropolis, by the formation of a Central Sanitary Authority for the Metropolis, the following resolution was unanimously come to thereon, and a copy forwarded to the Local Government Board and the Metropolitan Asylums Board, viz:— 35 That a communication be addressed to the Local Government Board stating that, in the opinion of this Vestry, it is desirable that powers should be given to Yestries and District Boards to send small-pox and fever patients to the hospitals under the supervision of the Metropolitan Sick Asylum Board, the Yestries and District Boards paying such sums for admission, &c., as shall be agreed upon between the several bodies, and reimbursing themselves by charging the same to the patients. In reply, the Yestry were informed that the President of the Local Government Board, was about to propose legislation, dealing with the subject. Sale of Little Chelsea Workhouse. It was reported, in the Annual Report for 1876, that the Yestry had agreed to sell the Workhouse at Little Chelsea, belonging to the Parish, to the Guardians of St. George's Union, for the sum of £40,000, and that the payments of the purchase-money, were to be extended over a period of nine half-years ; and again, in the Report for 1877, that the Board of Guardians having declined to seal the Agreement, which had been arranged by the Solicitors for the two bodies concerned, the consideration of the matter had been postponed by the Vestry. An arrangement was subsequently come to with the Vestry, for the amount of purchase-money (£40,000), to be paid down by the Guardians, and the conveyance to be then effected; and on the 21st February, 1878, the Vestry received the sum of £40,000, and conveyed the property to the Guardians. The amount which the Parish had to contribute towards the above-mentioned purchase-money, was £29,238; and, in accordance with an order of the Local Government Board, the balance of £10,762 was subsequently transferred 36 by the Vestry, to the Guardians, to invest in 3 per Cent.

John Dee, who kept this house, was fined £50, and the woman, Mary Martin, who lived with him was fined £20. No. 11, Union Street. This house had been kept by the prisoner, John Shine (alias Stewart), for many years, and it is believed that he had made large profits out of it. He was sentenced to six calendar months' imprisonment with hard labour, to pay a fine of £100, and to be further imprisoned until the fine be paid. Also to enter into his own recognizances in £500, with two sureties in £250 each, for his future good behaviour.

John Wyld, the keeper and owner of this house, was sentenced to pay a fine of £30, and to be imprisoned until payment.

The Yestry have received, with the sanction of Her Majesty's Treasury, a sum of £111 out of the fines paid, towards the cost of the prosecution, and expect to receive the fine of £100 remaining to bo paid, less the Sheriff's legal charges of per cent. Protection from Fire. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the fire at Messrs. Newson's timber yard in Pimlico Road, it was resolved that a Deputation should wait upon the Metropolitan Board and urge the claims of the district for further protection from fire. The Deputation, in company with a Deputation from St. Luke, Chelsea, waited on the Metropolitan Board of "Works on the 3rd August, 1877, and Memorials were presented, praying the Board to cause a Fire Brigade Station to be placed in the neighbourhood of Sloane Square.

Public Health Metropolis Bill (1877). A Bill to consolidate and amend the Law relating to Public Health in the Metropolis. The Yestry entertained objections to some of the Clauses of this Bill, more particularly with regard to the powers proposed to be entrusted to the Local Government Board. These objections were embodied in a Petition which was presented to Parliament, and the Members for Westminster asked to support the Prayer of the Petition. The Bill was subsequently withdrawn. Bill of Sales Amendment Act Bill (1878). A Bill having been introduced into Parliament "To Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Bills of Sale," the Yestry took the same course as, in 1875 and 1876, by petitioning Parliament, praying that a Clause might be introduced into the Bill for rendering a Bill of Sale invalid against a Distress Warrant for Poor and other Local Rates. The Yestry regret to find that their opinion on this matter has not been acted on. Buckingham Gate Improvement Scheme. Plans were deposited in November 1877, and notice given of the Promoters' intention, to apply to Parliament, for powers to construct a new street, at the rear of the houses in Buckingham Palace Road, between Stockbridge Terrace and James Street, Westminster. The Yestry agreed to petition Parliament against this Scheme, but were not called upon to further consider the matter, as the proposed Bill was not introduced into Parliament. 40 Metropolitan Board of Works Water Bills (1878). Metropolis Water Supply Bill, for the supply of water for certain purposes to the Metropolis by the Metropolitan Board of Works; for the construction of water works by the said Board; and for other purposes. Metropolis Water Works Purchase Bill. A Bill to make provision for the purchase, by the Metropolitan Board of Works, of the undertakings of the several Water Companies supplying water to the Metropolis, and to certain places in the neighbourhood thereof; and for the supply of water by the said Board to the Metropolis, and to such places, and for other purposes relating thereto. The Vestry, learning that the Metropolitan Board of Works contemplated introducing these two Bills into Parliament, unanimously passed a resolution expressing regret, that the evidence upon which the Metropolitan Board of Works, had arrived at the conclusion, that it is advisable to acquire the interest in the present Water Companies, had not been communicated to the Vestry, and they made application to the Board for such evidence. This information was not supplied to the Vestry. The Vestry subsequently petitioned Parliament against both these Bills, and asked the Members of Parliament for Westminster to support the prayer of their petition; as both Bills were afterwards withdrawn, no further action was found to be necessary. During the year 29 communications have been received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, notifying the applications made for the consent of the Board to the erection of porticoes, bay windows, additions, or other alterations to property within the line of area in this Parish. A list of these 41 tions, with the opinion of the Vestry, and the decision of the Metropolitan Board of "Works upon each application is submitted in Appendix No. 10. Seventy-eight applications for permission to build or alter vaults, areas, dung pits, and other works, abutting upon or under the public way, have been considered by the Vestry. A list of the various applications, with the decision of the Vestry, is printed in Appendix No. 11. Alterations in Names of Streets, and Renumbering of Houses. Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works, for renumbering houses, were received during the year, as follows: Re-numbering New Bond Street, from 168, to end of street, including therein Clarendon Mansions. Re-numbering the whole of the houses in South Street, Grosvenor Square. Numbering the house at the corner of Clarges Street and Curzon Street, 5a only, instead of 5a and 29. 42 LIST OF CHARITIES. Lyon's Estate Charity. The Vestry are interested, so far as the portion of the roadway of Oxford-street in this Parish is concerned, in the rents and profits of certain lands at Kilburn and St. Marylebone, which were left, about the year 1592, by John Lyon, the founder of Harrow School, towards the repair of the road, from Edgware to London, and the road, from Harrow to London. These rents and profits are paid annually to the Edgware Highway Board, by the Keeper and Governor of Harrow School, and by that Board distributed amongst the various local authorities having jurisdiction over the roads.

Consols, and the School House and premises in South-street, let for £105 per annum, are 43 entirely under the control of the Trustees of the Charity. There are 24 boys in the School, who are clothed and taught the common rudiments of education, with the prospect of a reward of £10 towards an apprenticeship. The Trustees meet twice in the year to select children to fill up vacancies, and upon the general business of the Charity. WlLKINs' AND TEAGE's CHARITY. Mrs. Mary Wilkins, in 1771, left the sum of £50, the interest of which was to be used for the benefit of poor persons in the Parish not receiving relief. The sum of one hundred pounds was left by will by Mrs. Teage, in the year 1774, to the Minister and Churchwardens of the Parish for the time being, to be placed out at interest upon real security, or in the public funds, or in the purchase of lands or hereditaments, and the interest or produce, to be from time to time applied by the Minister and Churchwardens, and their successors, in the purchase of bread and coals, to be distributed by them to the poor of the Parish on every St. Thomas's Day for ever. £160 Consols have been purchased with these two Charities, and realize together £4 16s. per annum, which is distributed by the Rector and Churchwardens in the manner provided. H.R H. the Duchess of Gloucester's Charity. H.R.H. the Duchess of Gloucester, by will, dated 29th January, 1857 (proved in the same year), left a sum of money for the benefit of poor persons in this Parish, and a like sum for the benefit of the poor residing in the vicinity of Grosvenor Chapel. 44 The sum of £253 17s. 7d. is invested in Consols, which produces £7 12s. 1d. per annum, and is distributed by the Rector and Churchwardens to the poor of the Parish. And a further sum of £253 17s. 7d. in Consols, which produces £7 12s. 4d. per annum, with regard to which, the Board of Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, have made an order, appointing the Rector and Churchwardens, and their respective successors, Trustees, during the tenure of their several offices, to administer the Charity; and the dividends accruing are to be applied for the benefit of such poor people residing in the Parish, with preference to those who reside in the vicinity of Grosvenor Chapel, or in case any ecclesiastical district shall be hereafter assigned to the said Chapel, the income of the Charity is to be applied for the benefit of the resident poor of such district. Tomlinson's Charity. Mr. Matthew Tomlinson, by will, dated 28th September, 1835 (proved the same year), gave a freehold house in Staffordstreet ("Goat" P.H.), and the accruing rent therefrom, that his Executors should annually clothe four poor men and four poor women in this Parish, and likewise three poor men and three poor women of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields; one of the Overseers of the Poor of each Parish to have access to the accounts of the Trustees. The poor persons to be clothed on the day of the month on which the Testator died. This Charity is in the hands of five Trustees. The house realizes £75 per annum, and a sum of £81 10s. 3d. is invested in New 3 per Cents., which realizes £2 8s. 8d. per annum. 45 William Terwin's Charity. Mr. William Terwin, by will, dated 2nd December, 1824, left the sum of £350 Consols to the Rector and Churchwardens, the interest of which was to purchase bread, to be distributed annually, in January, in that part of the Out Ward of the Parish called Neat House. The sum is invested in Consols, and realizes £10 10s. per annum, which is distributed by the Rector and Churchwardens. Mrs. Nasmyth—1876. Mrs. Nasmyth, by will, dated 15th May, 1869, bequeathed the residue of her estate, to the Rector and Churchwardens for the time being, to be invested by them in their names in the Consolidated Three per Cent. Bank Annuities, or upon Government or Real Securities at interest, in trust to pay and distribute the dividends and interest arising therefrom half-yearly as they shall become due and payable, in relief or gifts to the deserving poor, born or residing in the said Parish, who shall not at any time have received, or be then in the receipt of Parish relief. Every unmarried person selected to be paid the sum of £1 half-yearly, and every married person selected the sum of £2 half-yearly. It being Mrs. Nasmyth's wish that as many shall participate in the bequest as the annual produce thereof will admit of when distributed at the said rates, and further, that the selection of persons from among the deserving poor shall at all times be under the entire control of the Rector and Churchwardens for the time being, but so, nevertheless, that they shall select as recipients in the proportion of two married persons, widows, or widowers, to one unmarried person. 46 The residue of the Estate amounts to £3,935 19s. 3d. and this sum has been invested in New Three per Cent Annuities. Pest House Charity. This Parish, together with the Parishes of St. Martinin-the-Fields, St. Clement Danes, St. James, Westminster, and St. Paul, Covent Garden, are interested in this Charity, which was founded by Earl Craven, in 1687. The Charity, in 1868, consisted of property at Craven-hill-gardens, Cravenhill-mews, and Craven-mews, let at rents realizing £183 14s. per annum; and £15,537 cash, being the purchase-money due for premises belonging to the Charity, taken for the purposes of the Metropolitan Railway Company; and £395 7s. Sd. Bank 3 per Cent. Annuities, remaining on the credit of "Attorney-General v. Earl Craven." The Charity was originally demised by the Earl Craven, for the benefit of poor persons suffering from the plague. A scheme for the management and regulation of the Charity, and for the application of the income thereof, was approved by orders of the Court of Chancery, on 30th May, 1864, and 19th February, 1868. Under this Scheme, the Incumbents of each of the Parishes interested, are by virtue of their offices, always to be Trustees. In addition to which, Trustees have been appointed by the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, upon the nominations of the several Yestries, in the following proportions, viz.:— St. Martin-in-the-Fields 2 St. George, Hanover-square 2 St. Clement Danes 4 St. James, Westminster 4 St. Paul, Covent Garden 4 47 One of the appointed Trustees from each Parish is to go out of office every fourth year, but shall be eligible for reelection. The duties of the Trustees, Receiver, and Clerk are laid down in the Scheme, and the application of the income is as follows, viz.:— "After providing for any costs or expenses which may from time to time be directed by any Court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be paid out of the funds of the Charity, and paying the current expenses of the management and administration of the trust, in pursuance of this Scheme, the Trustees shall, until the further order or direction of the Court of Chancery, from time to time pay three-fifth parts (not exceeding £600) of the net annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of King's College Hospital in Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and the remaining two-fifth parts (not exceeding £400) of such net annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of Charingcross Hospital in Agar-street, Strand, such payments to be received by the said Hospitals respectively on the conditions hereinafter mentioned:— "I. The Governors of King's College Hospital shall set apart twenty-four beds, and the Governors of Charing-cross Hospital shall set apart sixteen beds, in a convenient part or parts of their respective Hospitals, and shall receive therein such patients (herein called in-patients), being sick and otherwise qualified according to the provisions hereof, as shall be sent by the Trustees with in-patients' orders as hereinafter provided. "II. The said Governors respectively shall also receive 48 and supply with advice and medicine as outpatients all poor persons resident in the said several Parishes who shall he sent by the Trustees with out-patients' orders at the customary times for the attendance of out-patients. "III. The Secretaries of the said Hospitals respectively shall give immediate notice to the Clerk of all vacancies in the number of the in-patients, and of any person being rejected as an inpatient. "IV. All in-patients requiring medical or surgical aid, and being fit cases for Hospital treatment, shall be received by both Hospitals indiscriminately, whether suffering from contagious or infectious disorders or not (small-pox alone being excepted), and shall be treated in all respects in the same manner as the other patients received into the Hospitals respectively." The orders for admission as in-patients or for treatment as out-patients in the Hospitals, are granted by an Order Committee, consisting of five Trustees, one member of the Committee being elected from each Parish interested. A new Scheme is to be obtained, if by the falling in of leases or otherwise the net income of the Charity shall exceed £1,000, or if at any time, from change of circumstances or otherwise, Her Majesty's Attorney-General should be of opinion that further arrangements are desirable. Samaritan Fund. In the year 1862 the sum of £50 was left by Lady Williams to the poor of this Parish. The sum having been 49 handed to the Clerk of the Governors and Directors of the Poor, they, under the authority of the 13th section of "The Parish Local Act" (7 Geo. IV., cap. cxxi.), on the 21st May, 1862, resolved:— "That a book be provided, called the Samaritan Fund Book, in which the amount should be entered; that the money be kept in the Clerk's hands, and disposed of, from time to time, by this Board, the sums given being signed by the presiding Chairman of the day." Subsequently the Board further resolved:— "That a box be placed at the House in Mount-street, with the following inscription,—'Samaritan Fund of St. George, Hanover-square, for the Belief, by Gift, of such Poor Persons as the Poor Board cannot, by law, assist with Money;' and "That the Governors and Directors of the Poor, for the time being, constitute a Committee for the distribution of the Samaritan Fund." Upon the formation of St. George's Union, the Fund was handed over to Trustees, for the benefit of the poor of this Parish. The box is retained at the Mount-street Workhouse, and the funds arising therefrom are distributed by the Trustees, upon the recommendations of the Board of Guardians of St. George's Union. The following is a list of the Resolutions, of an active character, which have been passed by the Vestry, since March, 1873:— D 50 The Resolutions passed between 1856 and March 1878 are printed in a previous Report.

My Lords and Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Fourth Annual Report of the various Works which have been carried out during the year ended Lady-day 1878; also a statement showing the actual cost incurred in each department. Maintenance of Roads. The following thoroughfares have been converted from flint roads to granite roads:— Gillingham Street. Gloucester Street. Ranelagh Road. Elizabeth Street (from Eaton Square to King's Road). Lyall Street (from King's Road to Eaton Square). The following statement shows the quantity of material used in the maintenance and repairs of the various roads in the Parish, and the total amount expended, including labour:— Granite. Tons. Flints.

The steam roller has worked continuously on the granite roads, and occasionally on flint roads. The horse roller has also boon used on flint roads as often as circumstances would permit. 55 The cost of maintaining the steam roller, including all expenses of every description, has been as follows:— March 25th, 1878. £ s. d. Wages 219 7 0½ Cartage of Water 171 12 6 Oil, Tallow, Waste, &c. 36 17 0 Coke 86 12 0 Coals (estimated) 6 0 0 Firewood 3 6 0 Repairs by Messrs.

The cost of hiring during the year has been £257 145. 6d. Wood Pavement. Piccadilly. The portion of wood pavement laid down in Piccadilly by the Improved Wood Pavement Company, in 1873, between St. James's Street and Berkeley Street, has been taken up and relaid by the Company, at their own request and expense. The remaining portion of the pavement in Piccadilly is in very good condition throughout. Wilton Road. * The specimen portion of wood pavement laid at the entrance to Victoria Station in December 1875, although 56 subject to very great traffic, has worn exceedingly well, and is at present in very fair condition. This pavement was laid down by Captain Blackall, on behalf of the patentee, at the latter's expense. Maintenance of Footways and Carriageways. There have been constantly employed during the last year, in the various repairs, &c., four masons and four paviours; they have re-laid certain portions of the foot and carriageways which were worn, sunk, or broken, using new materials, supplied by contract, where the old was not fit to re-lay; they have also made good the pavements disturbed for gas, water, new buildings, alterations, &c. They have used, during the year, 1,582 yards super, of York paving, and the cost has been as follows:— £ s. d. South Belgravia 202 3 0½ Grosvenor Place District 434 1 9 In-Wards 602 0 10½ £1,238 5 8 Carriageways. £ s. d.

In order to reduce a large stock of old paving stones removed from Piccadilly and elsewhere, and stored at the Belgrave Wharf, the Vestry decided to carry out certain additional works of paving (not included in the ordinary annual estimate). The entrance to Victoria Station from Buckingham Palace Road, part of Wilton Road, and Turpentine Lane, have therefore been paved with these pitching stones; several additional Crossings have also been aid down throughout the Parish. 58 Paviors' Works.

Fish. Snead's Gardens 67 23 15 11 „ Grosvenor Mews 208 28 2 5 1,552 19 10 Lighting. The streets under the control of the Vestry have been lighted by gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company and the London Gas Company. The lighting of the public lamps in the portions of the Parish, supplied with gas by the Gas Light and Coke Company, has, since the 25th June last (1877), been lighted 59 upon the average meter system; the Vestry carrying out the work of lighting, cleansing, and repairs by its own staff of lamplighters and other workmen, and the gas being paid for by meter indication. The Gas Committee at the commencement of the year, in their Report to the Vestry, upon the subject of lighting, expressed a hope that the introduction of the meter system would effect a saving to the Parish. The Committee however, did not recommend the adoption of the system, upon the grounds of economy alone, but because they felt that the principle of the system was the best to adopt in order to deal fairly between the Gas Company and the Vestry, and that the ratepayers would have the satisfaction of knowing that they would be only called upon to pay for the actual quantity of gas consumed. The Vestry also would be in a position to use the best description of burners, and to maintain them in an effective condition by proper supervision and control, and the public would have the benefit of a more uniform and better light; they would, in fact, get the maximum amount of light at the minimum rate of gas consumed, in consequence of the careful supervision of the regulators, &c. The Committee, in short, felt that the system, if carried into effect and judiciously managed, would result in greater efficiency and economy, and be more satisfactory to the public generally. In order to show how far the opinion of the Committee has been borne out by actual experience, I may mention that, the average consumption of 1,730 lamps during the past 12 months has been 2.47 cubic feet, per lamp per hour, for cannel gas, and 3.95 cubic feet, per lamp per hour, for common; and that out of 149 meter lamps the indications of only very few have had to be taken out of computation on acccount of excess or deficit in registration. This is conclusive evidence of the excellence of the Meters and Regulators. It is needless, I think, for me to add that, as regards the painting and cleaning of the lamps, such work has been much better done than heretofore. That the opinions of the Committee have been fully realized will, I think, be admitted, upon an examination of the following statement of the past year's expenses 60 Statement, showing the actual cost incurred in the introduction of the Average Meter System of Lighting, together with the cost of Gas supplied to the Public Lamps under this system for the Year ended 25th June, 1878, as compared with the amount paid to the Gas Company during the corresponding period of 1877.

If the Meter System, however, had been extended to this district also, a saving of from £233 to £250 a year would have been effected. Except, therefore, that the gas has been ohanged from cannel to common, and the price in consequence reduced, no alterations have been made in the arrangements hitherto carried out. Cleansing thb Streets. The cleansing of the streets has been done by men in the employment of the Vestry. The sweepings in the InWards have been removed under contract by Mr. T. Hobbs, Jun.; the sweepings in the Out-Wards have been carted from the streets by the Parish carts to the Parish Wharf, and thence barged away by contract. With the view of preventing disagreeable smells which were complained of, the principal thoroughfares have, as occasion required, been thoroughly washed, and the effect has proved most beneficial. Watering thb Streets. The spreading of the water in the streets of the InWards has been done by Mr. T. Hobbs, Jun.; in the Out Wards by the horses and carts belonging to the Vestry. The water for the In-Wards is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Company, and that in the Out-Wards by the Chelsea Water Company. Stock of Plant and Materials. The valuation of the plant and materials, consisting of 62 1 steam roller, 1 horse roller, 27 horses, 27 slop carts, and 14 water carts, 12 water vans, 4 shoot carts, gas apparatus, meters, &c., &c., the property of the Vestry, at the expiration of the parochial year was £8,585 4s. 3d. (as per Stock Book). On the 25th of March, 1877, the number of horses in stock, the property of the Parish, was twenty-eight. Since then four horses have been sold by auction, and two destroyed, and have realized £98 11s. 10c?. Five horses have been purchased at a cost of £377. The number of horses in stock, therefore, at the end of the past year (Lady-day 1878) was twenty-seven; the value of which I estimate at £1,917. Stable Arrangements. The cost incurred, under this heading, in the maintenance of the Parish Plant, together with the keep of the above horses, including all labour and expenses for the year ended Lady-day 1878, has been £4,290 16s. 5d., viz.:— Particulars. £ s. d.

Sewers. Serious accidents to the workmen employed in cleansing the sewers having resulted from the accumulation of foul gas therein, the Committee of Works instructed me to report upon the matter, with a view of suggesting some remedial means to prevent such accidents in future. In my Report to the Committee, of the 13th November last, I suggested the use of "Davy lamps," instead of the ordinary open lamps; the Committee having approved of the suggestion, these lamps are now used by all men employed in sewer work throughout the Parish. It will be seen by the following figures that the actual cost has exceeded the estimate by £3,241 2s. 4½d. The following items and works, however, amounting to £1,458 9s. 10d., have been ordered by the Vestry and included in this amount, but were not allowed for in the estimate. 64 Summary of the Expenditure for General Works, Year ended March 25th, 1878.

Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment Act, 1878. Sir,—I am instructed by the Board to request your attention to the provisions of the above Act of Parliament, especially so far as it relates to the width of thoroughfares. You will observe that any person building even a single house upon a carriage-way must set back the house or the boundary of the property 20 feet from the centre of the roadway, and in the case of footways must set the house or the boundary of the property 10 feet back from the centre of the roadway, and these provisions apply prima facie to every building commenced subsequently to the 22nd day of July, 1878, when the Act received the Royal Assent. Another provision of the Act is, that a way laid out for foot traffic only shall not be used for carriage traffic, unless made of the full width of a carriage-way, and even existing footways cannot be used for carriages except by order of the Magistrate. The Metropolitan Board would feel much obliged if your Board would give instructions to its Surveyor to report to Mr. Vulliamy, the Superintending Architect, any case in which it seems that the before-mentioned provisions of the Act are being violated. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. 0. Wakefield, The Clerk of the Clerk of the Board. Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your faithful and obedient Servant, GEO. LIVINGSTONE, C.E., Surveyor. 67 REPOET ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OT The Parish Of St. George Hanober Square, FOR THE YEAR 1877, BY W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (Lond.), MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (being his fifth annual bepobt). To the Parish of St. George Hanover square. My Lords and Gentlemen, Although 1876 was a very healthy year, it has been entirely eclipsed by 1877, for during this year the corrected total of deaths for the Parish, viz., 1,590, was less than in any one of the nine preceding years, and considerably less than the average; and although the number of deaths occurring in Public Institutions (522) was very high, the gross total of deaths (1729) was low. 68 Table I.

(The corrected total of deaths was calculated in a somewhat different manner before 1874; I have re-calculated it, and the corrected death-rate for each year is according to the method adopted by the Registrar-General, so that these death-rates are comparable with those published in his Reports.) From this table it appears that the corrected total of deaths in 1877 was 1,590, the average for the nine preceding 69 years having been 1,718, and the lowest number in any preceding year having been 1,639 in the year 1873. I estimate the population of the Parish at the middle of the year 1877 as 91,037; this is to the estimated population of London almost exactly as 1 to 38 4/5. The corrected death-rate of the Parish has therefore been only 17.46 per thousand per annum, while the average during the nine previous years was 19.08, and the lowest rates for any previous years were 18T6 in 1873, and 18.20 in 1876. The general London death-rate was also low, having been 219, as against 22.3 in 1876, and 23.7 in 1875. The Registrar-General says, in his Annual Summary for 1877, "London maintains its position as the healthiest city in the world. During the past year its prosperity was indicated by a birth-rate above the average of the previous ten years, while a remarkably low death-rate bears testimony to the success which has attended the efforts that have been made during the last quarter of a century to promote the public health and safety." "The mean death-rate of the seven years, 1863-70 (excluding the year 1866, when cholera was epidemic), was 24.4 per 1,000, whereas the mean rate in the seven years, 1871-77, was 22.7." The death-rate in greater London was only 20.7 per 1,000, as against 21.3 in 1876. Of the "22 other large towns of the United Kingdom," Portsmouth (calculated population, 127,144), with the unusually low rate of 17.4, was the only one that had a lower rate than this Parish, Brighton (calculated population 102,264), with a rate of 18.7, coming next. Manchester (calculated population 359,213) distinguished itself among English towns by having the high death-rate of 27.4, a rate 4.5 per thousand higher than that of London with very nearly ten times the population; this is partly 70 accounted for by tho fact that tho pcoplo are moro crowded together in Manchester, for whereas in that town there aro 84 persons to an acre, in London there are only 47; hut this reason alone is not sufficient, for in Liverpool, where there are rather moro than 101 persons to an acre, tho death-rate has been less than that in Manchester during each of tho last three years. It is hardly necessary to add that no large Foreign town has so low a death-rate as this Parish; although Philadelphia (U.S.), with a population of 850,856, is not far behind it (18.8). Tho highest death-rates recorded during tho year wero thoso of Madras (population 397,552), where both smallpox and cholera were prevalent, and where the rate reached the prodigious height of 116.7 per 1,000! and Bombay (population 644,405), where cholera was also prevalent, and the rate was 52 per 1,000. The corrected death-rato of the Western Districts of London was 19.1, tho lowest rate that has boon recorded for thoso districts—during the last thirty-eight yoars, at any rato. Table II. YEAR.

On the other hand, the total number of deaths of children under one year of age was only 309, and the percentage to registered births only 14.45; both lower numbers than in either of the four preceding years. In London the percentage of deaths under one year to registered births was 14.6, or, as usual, a little higher than in this Parish, while it was lower in only one of the "20 large English towns" mentioned by the RegistrarGeneral, viz., Portsmouth, where it was 13.3. The percentage of deaths under one year of age to the gross total deaths was slightly greater than it was last year, owing to the greater diminution in the number of deaths at other ages; it was 17.87, whereas it was 24.09 in London generally, and as high as 23.38 in the Western Districts.

The number of deaths from violence was less than in 1876, but the percentage of these to the total deaths was, as usual, greater than that for London, while the percentage of inquests held in the Parish to the total deaths was almost exactly the same as in London generally.

All the birth-rates were low, but that of May fair was again higher than that of Hanover Square; and all the deathrates were very low, that of Mayfair being, as usual, the lowest, and that of Belgravia, the highest. Table IVa. is new to these Reports, and shows at a glance the birth-rates and death-rates (corrected) of the Sub-districts during the past three years: 73 Table IVa. BIRTH RATES. DEATH-RATES. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1875. 1876. 1877.

From the figures in this table I have calculated, by means of Dr. Bristowe's formula, the mean duration of life in the Parish and in each of the sub-districts, in 1877, (making no allowance for movements of the population). It is as follows:—whole Parish 49.52 years; Hanover Square sub-district 56.63 years, Mayfair 62.66 years, and Belgravia 45.53 years. The mean duration of life in London was 35.44 years, and in 23 large towns of the United Kingdom (including London) 34.2 years, in 1877. During the last three years the mean duration of life in the Parish has advanced thus:—in 1875 it was 46.67 years, in 1876—47.96 years, and in 1877—49.52 years. 74 Table v.

These 151 deaths are equivalent to a rate of only 1.66 per 1,000 of the population, as against 1.9 per 1,000 in 1876. The general London rate was 3.5 per 1,000, and the average rate of the "20 large English towns" was also 3.5. Of these towns not one had, apparently, so low a zymotic death-rate as this Parish; the nearest to it being Brighton and Nottingham, with a rate of 1.9 each; it must be remembered, however, that a considerable number of cases of some of these infectious diseases, and especially of small-pox, are sent to Hospitals outside the Parish. Small-pox caused 12 deaths (including 1 of a case imported from Westminster) in the Parish, besides those of Parishioners which occurred in the Hospitals; this is a larger number of deaths from small-pox than has been registered in the Parish in any one of the nine preceding years except 1871, when 59 deaths from this disease were registered. The facts about these 12 fatal cases are very instructive; they may be tabulated as follows:— Age. REMARKS. l 4 months Confluent. Not stated as to vaccination; imported from Westminster. 2 41 years Not stated as to vaccination. 3 12 days No doubt unvaccinated. 4 27 years Unvaccinated. 5 8 „ "Parent not certain whether the child had been vaccinated." 6 50 „ Had been re-vaccinated on Small-pox occurring in the house, but too late. 7 63 „ "Husband states she had been vaccinated in youth." 8 1 Unvaccinated. 9 42 „ "Vaccinated in infancy." 10 33 „ "Had not been vaccinated since childhood." 11 18 „ "Scrofulous hip joint 16 years; enlarged heart and mitral regurgitation; Bright's kidney; dropsy; variola 1 week." Not stated as to vaccination. 12 13 „ "Father states he was vaccinated in infancy." 76 Of these twelve persons, then, who died from small-pox, No. 3 was an infant who was too young to have been vaccinated: Nos. 4 and 8 were not vaccinated, and without doubt No. 1 also: No. 5 may be taken as doubtful, but probably an unvaccinated case: No. 11 had such a variety of complaints that he might be left out of consideration, and, indeed, has not been included under the head of smallpox in the Registrar-General's Returns; no statement about vaccination was made in the certificate, and we may fairly assume that he had not been re-vaccinated. The other 7, including even No. 12, ought to have been re-vaccinated; it is true that No. 6, a woman fifty years of age, was re-vaccinated on the appearance of small-pox in the house, but she had already taken the poison, and it was too late: she ought to have been re-vaccinated many years before. So that we can trace every one of these twelve cases to want of vaccination or of re-vaccination. Besides these, there was a death registered from purpura hemorrhagica, which I had reason to believe was really a death from malignant small-pox; I therefore had complete disinfection carried out, and all proper precautions taken. The epidemic of small-pox in London, which began in 1876, and caused 702 deaths in the last six months of that year, caused no less than 2,544 deaths in 1877; "it was most fatal in the first three months of the year, and as many as 116 deaths occurred in one week." Measles was slightly epidemic in the Parish, and caused 30 deaths, the average number being about 24. On the other hand, scarlet fever and whooping cough caused only 19 deaths each, their average being 45 each. The 9 deaths from dipththeria almost exactly equalled the average number, for that disease has not been prevalent in this Parish as it has in some parts of London; and, 77 indeed, 3 of these deaths were those of non-Parishioners, in St. George's Hospital. The 25 deaths from "fevers" were decidedly below the average of 30, and were considerably below the numbers of the two previous years, when the deaths under this head were above the average. On the other hand, the deaths from enteric fever in London generally were much higher in 1877 than in 1876. Of these 25 deaths, 2 were registered as from typhus, 17 from enteric (typhoid), and 6 from simple continued fever. Of the 2 deaths from typhus, 1 was that of a case brought into St. George's Hospital from Chelsea, and the other was a doubtful case, registered as "Febris Recidiva," and probably not typhus at all. Of the 17 deaths registered as from enteric (typhoid) fever, 5 were those of non-Parishioners in St. George's Hospital; 2 others were certainly imported cases, and another probably so too, and 1 was really a death from puerperal fever; so that only 8 were undoubtedly fatal cases belonging to the Parish. The deaths from diarrha were only 35 in number, or decidedly less even than last year, when they were 47, a smaller number than in any previous year; the average number per annum during the nine years from 1868 to 1876, inclusive, was 66. Vaccination. By the courtesy of the Public Vaccinators, I am enabled to give the following return of the numbers of persons vaccinated or re-vaccinated by them during the year 1877. 78 District. Vaccinator. Vaccinations. Re-vaccinatlons. Total. Hanover Square and Mayfair Mr. E. D. Jay 173 416 589 Belgravia Dr.E. L.Webb 418 618 930 Knightsbridge Mr.G. H.Pedler 77 48 125 668 982 1,650 Persons are also encouraged to apply at St. George's Hospital for gratuitous vaccination, and the Resident Medical Officer informs me that 582 persons were vaccinated, and 470 re-vaccinated there during the year. I am, of course, unable to give any account of the total numbers of children vaccinated, or of persons re-vaccinated throughout the Parish. The immense increase in the number of re-vaccinations performed is of course due to the fear caused by the prevalence of small-pox; only 79 re-vaccinations were performed by the Public Vaccinators in 1876, as against 982 in 1877, and there were no re-vaccinations at St. George's Hospital in 1876. The distribution of Dr. Webb's cases shows this very well. His return is:— 1877. Vaccinations. Re-vaccinations. First Quarter 115 440 Second ,, 93 68 Third „ 102 9 Fourth „ 108 1 418 518 79 So that, out of 518 re-vaccinations performed by him during the year, no less than 440 were performed in the first quarter, when small-pox was so rife "that the fear of it weighed upon the hearts of all." People forget that if they are once successfully revaccinated they need not have any more fear of small-pox; they wait until small-pox is epidemic, or is even "in the house," and then many hasten to be re-vaccinated, sometimes, as in one of the cases noticed in the Report, too late. It cannot be too widely known that it is more common for a person to have small-pox twice, than to have it after successful re-vaccination; and that, whereas a person who has it twice often has it worse the second time than the first, a person who takes it after successful re-vaccination always has it mildly. Out of nearly 15,000 cases treated in the London Hospitals during the epidemic of 1872, there were only 4 who presented proofs of having been re-vaccinated, and they were all mild cases. Small-pox in London. From Dr. Thomas C. Fox's Report on the 320 cases of small-pox treated in the Fulham Hospital, between March 10th and October 12th, 1877,1 extract the following remarks:— "Firstly, not a single patient died out of 51 admitted who had four or more marks, of whatever quality they were; further, they were all mild cases, and, with one or two exceptions, all above puberty, i.e., the effect of vaccination was wearing out. Secondly, whereas the unvaccinated died at the rate of 43.54 per cent., the vaccinated (and many had the merest apology for vaccination marks) died at the rate of 7.6 per cent. Thirdly, that as the number of marks increase, especially if they be of good quality, so the protection 80 increases, as shown both by lessened porcontago of deaths and number of admissions." He also shows that the "average duration of stay in hospital of patients discharged recovered" was, among the unvaccinatod, 46¼ days, while, among tho vaccinated, it varied from 22½ days for those who had fivo or more vaccination marks to 32¼ days for those who had only one indifferent mark. So that it is quite clear that tho unvaccinatod persons who recover havo tho disease far moro seriously than tho vaccinated. ])r. William Gayton's Report shows that from tho 1st of January to tho 31st of December, 1877, 1,936 patients woro admitted to tho Homerton Small-pox Hospital, and of those 328, or 18.23 por cent., died: tho mortality varied from 46.17 por cent, among tho unvaccinatod to 1.80 por cent. among thoso who had four or moro good vaccination marks; the highest mortality among the vaccinated being 15.93 per cent, among thoso who only had one imperfect mark; and the mortality umong "thoso stated to liavo boon vaccinated, but without ovidonco," was 28.78 per cent. Dr. Gayton also tabulates tho statistics of 5,479 cases treated in tho llomerton Hospital botween February 1st, 1871, and December 31st, 1877. The following table shows the mortality in the various classes of cases:— Class. Mortality. Vaccinated, with good marks 3.57 per cent. „ „ imporfect „ 11.40 „ „ „ stated to be, but with, out evidence . 28.78 „ Not vaocinatod (confessedly) 40.17 „ while among unvaccinatod children under five years of ago tho mortality was 55.61 por cent. With regard to tho efficacy of ro-vaccination, Dr. Gayton says:— "That only one amongst tho largo number of nurses and 81 others who have been occupied here (and in her case the operation was neglected) should have contracted the disease is, or should be, convincing proof enough of its great and almost certain prophylactic influence. In a word, if revaccination was not the preventive, I know not what was." N.B.—" Dr. Gayton has further informed the RegistrarGeneral that since the Hospital was opened, more than seven years ago, 367 nurses and others have been engaged in the work of the Hospital, and with the solitary accidental exception mentioned, re-vaccination has been an indispensable condition of employment, unless the applicant had had small-pox, or had already been vaccinated. The result has been that not one of these has contracted small-pox while there employed." (Reg.-Gen. Report for week ending June 1st, 1878.) Contrast this with the fact that in the Homerton Fever Hospital (only reopened for the reception of fever cases on September 27th, 1877) "during the year 2 nurses contracted enteric fever, 2 scarlet, and 1 typhus, and they all recovered." (Dr. Collie's Report.) The Homerton Fever Hospital was used for small-pox cases from December 8th, 1876, to May 12th, 1877, during which time 915 cases of that disease were admitted, of which 173 died, giving a total mortality of 18.8 per cent. Dr. Collie tabulates the cases, and sums the results up as follows:— "It will be seen from the accompanying tables—(1) that the unvaccinated died at the rate of 53 per cent.; (2) that the badly vaccinated died at the rate of 26 per cent; (3) that the fairly well vaccinated died at the rate of 2.3 per cent.; and (4) that but 1 death occurred in any person under 16 years of age who showed two good cicatrices of vaccination, and after 16, only three such persons died." So that the result is the same in all cases, with large F 82 numbers and with small, for one year or for many years, the mortality from small-pox is less as the vaccination is more perfect. Sanitary Work. For the year ending March 31st, 1878. The following Table was compiled for me by Mr. Hopkins, the late Sanitary Inspector, from the Report Book. Table VI. Various lcinds of Complaints of Nuisances, &C.,from April ls, 1877, to March 31.stf, 1878. Total number of complaints 619 Notices served 98 Houses and premises limewhited and general repairs 69 Houses disinfected after infectious diseases. 210 Old brick drains abolished, and glazed stoneware pipes substituted 82 New drains constructed 13 Drains trapped and ventilated, sinks repaired, &c 97 Closets supplied with water 21 Dust bins renewed, repaired, new covers, &c. 7 Cisterns repaired, new covers, &c. 11 Removal of animals improperly kept (cases of) 7 Meat, fish, &c., condemned (cases of) . 62 Drains and closets unstopped 57 Overcrowding abated 36 Cesspools abolished ..... 15 Street gullies trapped on account of bad smells 17 Cases removed to hospitals 120* *Small-pox, 77; Bcarlet fever, 43. 83 Old people living in filthy rooms removed . 5 Inspection of houses after cases of infectious disease, viz.— Typhoid and low fever 12 Typhus fever 1 Scarlet fever 103 Small-pox 91 Diphtheria 3 Puerperal fever 2 Yellow fever 1 Cholera 0 Various nuisances removed 172 No cause for complaint on inspection 112 Waste pipes disconnected 47 Legal proceedings taken 1 Accumulation of dung, straw, &c., removed 43 Bake-houses in the Parish 77 Licensed cow-houses 7 Licensed slaughter-houses 14 The articles disinfected in the hot-air disinfecting chamber belonging to the Parish were as follows:— 121 Beds 162 Bolsters 248 Mattresses 172 Pillows 108 Palliasses 82 Carpets 68 Quilts 83 Hearth-rugs 339 Blankets 92 Curtains 122 Sheets 193 Counterpanes 23 Dresses 14 Pillow-cases 2 Table-covers 17 Towels 10 Shawls 32 Cushions 13 Jackets 23 Bundles of small clothes 120 Suits of clothing, and a large quantity of sundry articles. 84 The number of complaints (not including dust complaints) was nearly double the number in 1876, and the amount of work done under almost every head greater in proportion ; a much larger number of houses were inspected after cases of infectious disease, and were disinfected; and, as the table shows, a very large number of articles were disinfected at the hot-air chamber belonging to the Parish. No less than 98 notices were served, but it was not necessary to take out a single summons for non-compliance with the notice; a sufficient proof that what the Sanitary Officers required to be done was considered reasonable by the owners or occupiers of the property requiring improvement. The Markets have been regularly inspected, and a considerable number of articles seized and destroyed as unfit for food. The slaughter-houses, cow-sheds, and bake-houses of the Parish are regularly inspected and kept in a cleanly state. No license was opposed by the Vestry at the annual licensing of slaughter-houses and cow-sheds, but in two of the cow-sheds I insisted that a water supply should be laid on instead of the supply from a well by means of a pump, and now there is no cow-shed in the Parish supplied either from a well or from an underground tank. A man was found to be keeping cows without a license, so he was prosecuted, and a conviction obtained, with a fine of 40 shillings, and 12s. 6d. costs. The Public Urinals have been regularly painted with crude carbolic acid, with the best results. I thought it advisable to draw the attention of the authorities of the London School Board to the desirability 85 of their sending information, by means of their Visitors, of cases of infectious disease to the Sanitary Inspectors, and of their forbidding the attendance at School of children from infected houses. I received a favourable reply, and also an acknowledgment of the services rendered them by your Inspector in giving them information from time to time. Having been informed that cases of scarlet fever were being admitted into the general wards of St. George's Hospital, and treated there with patients not suffering from that disease, I wrote to the Secretary, on February 26th, 1878, to ask if scarlet fever patients were admitted, "and if so, whether there is a separate fever ward, and what precautions are taken to prevent infection spreading to other patients, or to visitors ?" After a long correspondence, in the course of which I fortified myself with the opinions of Sir William Gull and Professor de Chaumont, of Netley, on the matter, I at last received a letter, dated May 15th, 1878, from the Secretary to the Hospital, in which he says, "I am directed by the Weekly Board of Governors of this day to inform you, in answer to your letter of the 14th inst., that scarlet fever is not now admissible into this Hospital, in accordance with a resolution passed at the Quarterly and Special Court of Friday last." Sir William Gull wrote to me in answer to a general question and without reference to St. George's or any other Hospital, as follows:— "It is obviously unfair that patients suffering under non-contagious diseases should, by admission into a Hospital, be made to incur the risk of contracting a contagious disease, which may be far more serious than their original maladies. "It would be a grave miscarriage of charity to afford relief with one hand, and the risk of a fatal poison with the other." 86 Professor de Chaumont, in his answer to a similar letter, says: "I do not approve of the reception of infectious cases, such as Scarlet Fever and the like, into the general wards of Hospitals. I think it unadvisable on public grounds, and distinctly unfair to the other patients." The very remarkable occurrence of a death from true yellow fever took place in the Parish during the month of March 1878; it was registered as "contracted on board Mail Steamer from Rio Janeiro." Notwithstanding the fact that this fever has never been known to spread in this country, except in very hot weather, I thought it advisable to take all precautions, and had thorough disinfection carried out. Table VII contains a summary of the results of my Analyses of the water supplied to the Parish by the Grand Junction and Chelsea Companies, from which it will be seen that the organic ammonia in the Grand Junction Company's water was generally high, being only low in the summer months, and towards the end of January 1878. The Chelsea Company's water was fairly good during the nine months of 1877 (the organic ammonia being, however, rather high in the May sample), but it deteriorated in quality during the three months of 1878. The samples collected in March 1878 were both of them so bad that I had fresh ones taken on March 22nd; these showed a considerable improvement in the Grand Junction Company's water (viz.—saline ammonia 0, organic 11 per hundred millions), but only a very slight improvement in that of the Chelsea Company (viz.—saline ammonia 2.6, organic 13 6 per hundred millons). I also wrote to the Secretary of each Company, drawing his attention to the matter. The Chelsea Company, with the view of obtaining water 87 from a purer source than the Thames at Surbiton, have constructed large settling tanks above Moulsey, five miles higher up the river, and above the junction of the Mole. These were finished and put in action in October 1877, and since that time the water supplied by them has been taken at that point, allowed to settle in the tanks, and then run down to Surbiton to be filtered.

I do not, however, attach much importance to this, for, as I said in a special Report which I laid before the Vestry in April 1878, "I submit that it is not the average quality which is of importance, but the worst samples that we are liable to be supplied with at any time of the year, and that the public has a right to demand that it shall at no time be supplied with water which is 'quite unfit for dietetic purposes.'" "As Mr. Simon has said, 'It ought to be made an absolute condition for a public water supply, that it should be uncontaminable by drainage.'" The common gas supplied by the London Gas Company has been examined by me from time to time at their testing room, and has always been found to be above the required standard of illuminating power, to contain occasionally faint traces of ammonia, and to be free from sulphuretted hydrogen. For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases is kept at the workhouse in Mount Street; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply at the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington, or, in case of small-pox, at the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, where they can be accommodated on favourable terms. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon), F.R.C.P. (London). 10, Bolton Row, Matfair, W., June 1878. 89 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health. Summary or Analytical Work for the Year ending March 25th, 1878. NAME OF SAMPLE. Genuine. Of doubtful Quality. Adulterated. Total. Milk 12 3 4 19 Bread 16 — — 16 Butter 6 — 1 7 Tea 5 — 2 7 Coffee 3 — l 4 Mustar 4 — — 4 Pepper 2 — — 2 Flour 12 — — 12 Sugar 9 — — 9 Tapioca 2 — — 2 Sago 2 — — a Arrowroot 6 — — 6 Oatmeal 1 — l 2 Vinegar 10 — 2 12 90 3 11 104 90 Also 4 samples of "cocoa,"which were found to be mixtures of cocoa, sugar, and arrowroot; 2 of "magnesia," which contained some carbonate of magnesia; and 2 of "citrate of magnesia,"which were mixtures of citrate and tartrate of soda, and contained only traces of magnesia. Of these 112 samples, only 5 were brought by private purchasers; of these, one of butter was found to be largely adulterated with foreign fats, and I gave a certificate to that effect; while the other four, one of butter and three of milk, were all genuine. One of the two samples of adulterated tea merely contained a small quantity of "lie" tea, and the other a few "sloe" leaves. The sample of adulterated coffee contained chicory, and was labelled to that effect. The adulterated oatmeal only contained a small quantity of barley meal. The two samples of adulterated vinegar both contained a notable quantity of free sulphuric acid. Three vendors were prosecuted for selling watered milk. In one instance the Magistrate dismissed the case on account of a technical informality in the certificate, although it was worded in exactly the same way as a certificate on which he had previously granted us a conviction, as your Solicitor pointed out. In the other two instances convictions were obtained and the following fines imposed: 10s. fine with 12s. 6c?. costs in one case, and 15s. fine with 2s. costs in the other. I submit that these fines are ridiculously inadequate to the offence, and a report of mine pointing this out was forwarded by your Vestry Clerk to the Home Secretary, who drew the Magistrate's attention to the matter. If the good which has undoubtedly been done by the 91 Act is not to be undone, adequate fines must be imposed when convictions are obtained. Difficulties of various kinds are arising in the way of the carrying out of the Act by the local authorities, as I pointed out in my Report for the Quarter ending Christmas 1877. "Two very important decisions have been made lately in adulteration cases." "The High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh has decided in an appeal case that it is necessary for a conviction, under the 6th Section of the Act, that the article adulterated should be proved to have been sold ' to the prejudice of the purchaser;' that this is not the case when the article is purchased under compulsory power by a public officer; and that the power of compulsory purchase given by Section 15 was only given with a view to prosecutions under Sections 3 and 5 for adulterations injurious to health." "This decision, which ' altogether forbids a conviction against adulterations simply with water or other harmless substance, no matter how far it is carried, at all events if the purchase be compulsory and be made by a public officer,' does not, of course, hold good in England, but it will no doubt be quoted as a precedent and much increase the difficulties in the way of obtaining convictions."* "In the other case, one of the Metropolitan magistrates dismissed a case, with costs, because the defendant produced in Court a Warranty given him by the wholesale dealer; although the Clerk of the Local Authority asked him to grant a conviction on the facts, so that the wholesale dealer might be proceeded against." "It is clear that the Inspector or purchaser cannot know *N.B.— The above decision has since been upheld in the Court of Queen's Bench, and a Bill to amend the Act has been introduced into Parliament. 92 whether the seller of an article has a Warranty to produce or not, and so, if this decision be followed, cases, even where adulteration is proved, will be lost, and those who try to carry out the Act will have to pay the costs, instead of recovering the penalties.". "If the Act is rightly interpreted by the Scotch Court of Appeal, the only thing to do is to use every effort to get it amended, or adulteration will soon become as rampant as it was before this Act and its predecessor were passed."
