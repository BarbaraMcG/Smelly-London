Medical Officer of Health FINSBURY HEALTH CENTRE, PINE STREET, LONDON, E.C.1. The Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF FINSBURY for the Year 1962 BY C. O. S. BLYTH BROOKE, M.D., B.S., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health FINSBURY HEALTH CENTRE, PINE STREET, LONDON, E.C.1. To the Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report for the year 1962. Ever since recovery began to take place from the devastating economic and social effects of the second world war, each year has seen improvements in the prevailing conditions under which the people of Finsbury live, and others work, in the Borough. During the course of any one individual year the changes may not seem very great, but over the whole period a veritable transformation has occurred. Of the factors which have brought this about, one of the most important has been the far seeing and energetic policy of the Borough Council whom I have the privilege to serve. The more personal needs of all sections of the community, but particularly those of our senior citizens,have also received continuing concern by the Council, and the lives of many have been eased greatly in a variety of ways. But these considerations must not be allowed to diminish the endeavours which are required of all, to better the conditions yet further, for there are still some slum properties and some very unsatisfactory and overcrowded houses. There are many unhygienic circumstances, and a great number of social and health problems which if solved would lead to a healthier, happier and brighter existence for many of the inhabitants. The general health of the population remained good in 1962, and the year was comparatively uneventful. The birth rate was 16.05 and death rate 11.6. The principle concern has been the very large number of deaths from Cancer of the Lung and Coronary Disease. Although smoking habits have a large influence on the former, the full story in regard to both of these conditions is not yet understood,and there is little fundamental work that can be done at this time to prevent these conditions. Infectious Diseases did not give rise to any concern,and fortunately the Smallpox outbreak in other parts did not affect this Borough. It was with great regret that I lost the services at the beginning of the year of my Deputy Dr. Bates, who had given me, during the few years she was with me, invaluable service. I was however pleased that she should have secured an important appointment with the Home Office, with regard to the care of children, and wish her all success, and at 2 the same time extend a welcome to Dr. Arnold who took over as my Deputy early in the year. As in previous years I once again, with pleasure, refer to the help and support that you Mr. Mayor, and Members of the Council, have continued to give me, and particularly of that of the Chairman and Members of the Committees with which I have been so closely concerned. It is, I feel, also fitting that I should, in particular, acknowledge the help that you, Mr. Mayor, have personally given in regard to the work of my department, for the elderly, and assure you of the pleasure your election as Mayor gave us all. Once again also, I acknowledge gladly and with sincere appreciation, the loyal co-operation and help I have enjoyed from members of my staff, who, each in their own way, have contributed to the good name that I believe my department enjoys. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, C O S. BLYTH BROOKE, Medical Officer of Health, 3 HEALTH COMMITTEE Chairman: Councillor A.E. Ley Vice-Chairman: Councillor R.J. Redrupp Alderman C.A.

PHYSICAL FEATURES AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS GENERAL: Area of the Borough (acres). 587 Population 1961 census 32,887 Population Density 56 Rateable Value 31.3.62. £2,981,711 Product of a penny rate (1961/2) £11,600 General rate 1961/62 17/4d Finsbury, one of Londons 28 Metropolitan Boroughs, is situated in Central London. The Borough as a whole is built up and congested and possesses very few open spaces, all of which are small in size. A large part of the Borough, particularly in the South East, is essentially industrial and the day population of the Borough has been estimated as between 150,000 and 200,000. The industries accommodated are very varied and include, besides the clock and watch trade which has been associated with Clerkenwell for many years, the scientific and optical instrument making, jewellery, printing and clothing trades. The residential parts of the Borough are mainly working class in character. During the late war Finsbury suffered the loss of many factories, warehouses and offices, especially in the Eastern part of the Borough and there still exist many bombed sites. Residential property also suffered considerable damage. The rateable value has steadily increased since 1951 when it was £956,228 consequent on rebuilding of war damaged properties and devastated areas. A feature of post war development has been the erection of large blocks of modern flats.

POPULATION: There was a further slight fall in the population. BIRTHS: The birth rate has fallen again slightly, in spite of the upward trend of the National Rate. Although the proportion of illegitimate births was slightly higher than the previous: year, the rate per 1,000 of the population was slightly lower. STILL BIRTHS: The rate has risen very slightly above the low level recorded in 1961, but is still below the National Rate. DEATHS: Again there is a very slight rise in the standardized death rate, but it is nevertheless still below the National Rate which itself has fallen a little. MATERNAL DEATHS: There were no maternal deaths during the year. INFANT MORTALITY: As in 1961, there were a large number of infant deaths though there was a small reduction in the total number from 19 to 16, and in the rate from 30.9 to 27.9. These two unhappy years in this respect have followed a period of phenomenally low death rates. Two of the deaths referred to were among illegitimate infants. Of the 16 deaths, 12 occurred in the first week,2 more before the end of four weeks, and the remaining 2 between the end of the 1st and 3rd months of life. 9 10 11 CAUSES OF DEATH 1961: 0- 1- 2-4 5-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 65-74 75-84 85- M F M F M F Total 1.

The Council also continued to act as an agent for the Regional Hospital Board in respect of certain services controlled by them. There is no doubt that continued experience has confirmed the view expressed for many years, that the occupation by the Health Department of a separate building of a suitable character to which the public may readily come for help and advice in regard to the numerous health and social problems with which they are often faced, and where some services are available is of great value. LABORATORY: The laboratory in the Health Centre has been maintained jointly with the Regional Hospital Board since 1948 and undertakes the routine work of the Public Health Department in the control of infectious diseases and bacteriological examination of milk and other foodstuffs, and has operated in close association with the Central Public Health Laboratory service in Colindale. In addition it continues to undertake simple routine pathology of behalf of the Chest Clinic, other clinics in the Health Centre, and of Medical practitioners in the District. A particular feature has been the use made of the facilities for the taking and examination of swabs for the early diagnosis of Whooping Cough. This has been of particular value when the disease has been prevalent. The services of the Laboratory Technician have been available for a limited number of Domiciliary visits when these have been called for. 13 BLOOD TRANSFUSION: The Council continued to co-operate with the National Blood Transfusion Service, by arranging Blood Donation Sessions at the Health Centre. Four sessions were held during the year at which 465 donors attended. 434 were bled and 31 rejected for various reasons. The comparative figures for 1961 were 420 donors, 388 bled and 32 rejected. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION AND INNOCULATION: The international form of certificate of vaccination and innoculation approved since the war, requires the signature of the medical practitioner issuing the certificate to be authenticated by the Medical Officer of health. The purpose of the authenticiation is to provide proof to health authorities abroad that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. In 1962 1,275 certificates were authenticated, no case of an improper signature was discovered,and no application in consequence refused. BURIAL OR CREMATION OF THE DEAD: It is provided by Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, that the local authority shall arrange burial or cremation in the case of any person who has died or been found dead in the borough, in any case where it appears to the authority that no suitable funeral arrangements have been or are being made. During the year 8 persons were buried or cremated under these provisions. HEALTH EDUCATION: Health Educational activities were continued during the year by the exhibition of public posters combined with the distribution of literature to suitable centres. Health education in general was also carried out throughout theyear by all the members of the staff who are in contact with the general public in their homes and businesses. Exhibition Stands situated in the entrance hall of the Health Centre were used to display amongst other publicity matter, the publicity sets issued by the Ministry of Health. Book marks incorporating information on various health education subjects have also been distributed with the co-operation of the Libraries Department. Enamelled panels showing details of hospitals with times for attendance, where advice or treatment on Venereal Diseases can be obtained,were renewed as necessary in the Council's Public Conviences. 14 The Council also continued to co-operate in the Health publicity programme organised by the London County Council health Division III. ELDERLY PERSONS: The Council has continued its very active concern and support during 1962 in connection with all schemes designed to assist in the case of the ageing, towards their better health and to enable the to enjoy their later years. Some of these Schemes have been established as part of the Council's general health services, and others have been encouraged and developed by means of generous grants to voluntary organisations responsible for them, amounting in all to £10,065 during the financial year 1961/62. The work of these organisations has been co-ordinated as far as possible by the Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee, consisting of representatives of most of them and of the Health Committee, and of which I have been privileged to be Honorary Secretary. It has operated therefore in very close association with the Services provided by the Council and has received from its financial grants towards it's expenses. In addition to co-ordination it has also undertaken responsibility for the services indicated with the initials F.O.P.W.C. in brackets below. (a) Visitors: A Nurse Visitor and Assistant Nurse Visitor have been employed whose duties involve the regular visiting of aged persons, particularly those living alone, who are likely to be in need of care and attention. The main duties of the staff of the Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee are to aid all the aged to obtain such benefits as might be available from any source, and to give personal help, comfort and friendship wherever possible. In this and other ways information has become available as to most of the elderly in need, but occasionally others are found whom had they been known earlier might have been helped. The staff which consisted in 1961 of a Social Worker and Assistant Social Worker was augmented in 1962 by the appointment of an additional Social Worker. (b) Meal Services (i) Club Meals: Many of the elderly, particularly those who live alone, are apt to take insufficient food, not only because of expense but also because of the difficulty and trouble involved in preparing a satisfactory meal for one. Dinner services, therefore, have been instituted through voluntary associations throughout the Borough. A grant is given to the associations by the Council to cover their expenses and further grants are made by the London County Council and Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee, to enable the meals to be supplied at a cost of elevenpence per head to the elderly. During 1962 20,608 meals: were served from Meal Centres, as against 20,690 in 1961. The following centres were in operation for 3 to 5 days weekly throughout the year. 15 (i) Women's Voluntary Service, 68 Exmouth Market, E.C.1. (ii) Field Lane Community Centre, Cubitt St. E.C.1, in connection with Field Lane Institution, 16, Vine Hill, E.C.1. (iii) Claremont Central Mission, White Lion Street, N.l. (iv) Finsbury Mission, Moreland Street, E.C.1. (ii) Mobile Meals: Aged persons unable, by reason of sickness and infirmity to attend one of the meal centres, have been supplied with a hot meal delivered to their home by the 'Invalid Meals of London'. Until 1958 this voluntary organisation operated in close association with the Borough Council, and a substantial grant was made to them. Since then they have operated independently. Their main object is to supply invalid meals to the sick rather than normal meals to those who merely, on account of physical infirmity, are unable to go out. Nevertheless many meals have been supplied to such persons. The service is however restricted. Towards the end of 1960 the Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee decided to undertake experimentally on a small scale, the delivery of frozen whole meals which only required to be heated in the impervious envelope in which they are delivered, by placing it in boiling water in a saucepan for 15 minutes. The idea was that this service might be valuable for those not within the purview of the 'Invalid Meals of London', but yet were unable to attend a centre or to cater adequately for themselves. During 1962 6,886 such meals were served to elderly persons unable to attend a meal centre, as against 4,941 meals in 1961. The cost to the elderly was one shilling per meal. (c) Nutritional Supplements (F.O.P.W.C.) The arrangements continued with Messrs. Wander Ltd., Bovril Ltd., Marmite Food Extract Co., Ltd., Glaxo Ltd., and Horlicks Ltd., whereby 'Ovaltine', 'Hospital Extract Bovril', Marmite', 'Jaffa Juice', 'Complan' and 'Horlicks' are supplied to the various organisations represented on the Committee for resale to the aged attending their clubs, at a price considerably less than the normal retail price. These Nutritional Supplements have proved very popular with the aged and considerable quantities have been sold to them. (d) Sheltered Employment: The scheme inaugurated as an experiment, in 1951, to provide sheltered employment for those of the elderly, who are unable to continue in normal employment and yet are able to undertake suitable light work for 2 hours daily, has continued to play an important role in the provisions made for this group of the community. It is administered by a special voluntary organisation known as the Finsbury Employment Scheme for the Elderly, and has received generous support from the Council. 16 The Work Centre named 'Brook House' situated at 39/41 Gloucester Way, E.C.1. made possible as a result of a number of generous benefactors and opened by the late Lord Horder in November 1954, has proved eminently satisfactory in every way. In 1960 a small branch scheme for about 10 persons was opened in the Community Centre on the Priory Green Estate. It was hoped to expand this branch but so far this has not proved possible. Some 120 elderly persons have undertaken work which has been mostly outwork on behalf of many firms, who have generously co-operated, but some articles have been made for sale to the trade or direct to the public. The elderly employed are paid a small wage amounting to 12/6d. a week, which is slightly more than the actual value of the labour provided. This Scheme has not only brought joy and happiness to many elderly people but has been of great value in preserving their health of mind and body. It has also attracted intense interest from many parts of the country and from overseas, and many bodies are considering inaugurating, or have inaugurated, similar schemes. (e) Holidays: The Council has continued this service designed to preserve the Health of the elderly by allowing those sufficiently able to do so to benefit from a stay of two weeks in the country or at the seaside. Applications were invited by public announcement and through variously interested clubs and societies, such applications were made to the Health Department. Each applicant was required to contribute a small sum towards the cost, normally ten shillings per week, but varied slightly in some cases. Arrangements were then made for the holiday at one or other of the holiday homes run by voluntary organisations. A grant was made to each of the homes or to the Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee, to cover the cost including the railway or coach fare, and their necessary travelling expenses, less that amount which the individual was required to contribute. Holidays were provided in this way for about 394 persons in 1962, comprising 96 men and 298 women of which 44 were married couples, at a total cost to the Council of £3,405. Holidays were provided at Brighton, Bognor, Leigh-on-Sea, Clacton, Margate, Worthing, Chigwell (Essex) and Heme Bay. The Scheme has proved an unqualified success as was evidenced by the large number of appreciative letters received, and in other ways. I am of the opinion that a holiday benefits considerably the permanent health of the individual, builds up the body for the winter months and is of considerable value socialogically. All this apart from the pleasure and enjoyment given to the aged persons at the time. 17 (f) Laundry: This service was continued for the Chronic Sick who were unable by reason of ill-health, senility etc., to keep their personal and domestic laundry in a state of cleanliness required to ensure a healthy environment. The articles are collected on Monday, disinfected, checked and sent to a commercial laundry, returned again, checked and redelivered on Friday or Saturday of the same week. A varying number of about 45 to 50 persons have in this way been able to retain their clothes and bed linen in a wholesome condition. (g) Bathing: Baths have been provided free of charge at the Health Centre to those aged persons who. on account of their condition, cannot use the existing Public Baths. An attendant has been available to help with dressing and undressing and to render assistance if this is necessary. In 1960 a bathing attendant was appointed to visit the infirm elderly in their own homes, and there wash and bath them as possible, and according to the circumstances. This has proved a very valuable service and has helped many of the elderly to keep themselves clean, comfortable and respectable. In April 1961 an additional bathing attendant was appointed to cope with the increased demand for the service. It has also relieved the pressure on the Home Nursing Services which previously undertook these duties for those who might be described as sick. It does not of course, undertake the bathing of those for whom a skilled and trained nurse is required. It was found that the attendant could undertake about 20-24 cases each week; in most cases bathing was carried out weekly for those for whom the service was provided. (h) Cleansing: Occasional cleansing services have been provided for those aged persons where their accommodation has been allowed to become so dirty and unwholesome that it had become beyond their capabilities to get it clean again, although possibly able with or without the aid of a domestic help, to keep it at least for a time sanitary, once it had been cleansed. (i) Chiropody: (1) There is a satisfactory chiropody clinic in the Health Centre, administered by the London County Council, which is available for the elderly as well as for others. (2) A domiciliary service (F. 0. P. W. C.) has been provided free of charge for those aged persons who are unable, by reason of senility, chronic sickness, etc., to attend personally the Foot Clinic at the Health Centre, and has proved of great benefit to the Elderly. 726 visits were paid in 1962 and pensioners of all ages up to 96 have received benefit from them. This service has proved well justified in so far as it has enabled the aged and infirm to get about at home in reasonable comfort, and do things for themselves, and so retain the independence essential to their mental and physical well being. 18 (j) S.O.S. Cards (F.0.P.W.C.): The S.O.S. Card Scheme operated by the Committee in the Borough has functioned very successfully as in the past. No use, however, was made of the Scheme during the year under review. The purpose of the Scheme is to enable old people living alone to contact someone outside their home in an emergency. The Scheme besides having a practical value also has a comfort value, as many of the aged express the sense of security which possession of the card affords them. (k) Clubs: There are a number of clubs for the elderly in the Borough, and most of these have remained available throughout the period under review. The majority of them meet once a week and sometimes more often, and various social activities are organised in connection with them. Several are closing associated with religious organisations: The following may be listed: Women's Voluntary Service, 68 Exmouth Market, E.C.1.

Special mention however, should be made of that organised by the British Red Cross Society at 9 Walmsley Street, E.C.1. The premises consist of the basement (kitchen) Ground floor and 1st floor of a medium sized terraced house. These are open most days of the week for club members and other elderly to make use of as they wish - though in fact the numbers using them have been small. The ground floor rooms are used as a snuggery for the elderly to sit and gossip round the fires. A special afternoon meeting was arranged each week for the housebound elderly and special transport has been arranged for them. This provided a valuable amenity for those not normally able to take advantage of facilities and services available for the more active elderly. (1) Compulsory Removal: It was not necessary during 1962 to use the provisions of the National Assistance Act or of the Amending Act (under which both the Medical Officer of Health and his Deputy are empowered by the Council to act in urgent cases) to secure the compulsory removal of any aged persons. 19 OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR THE ELDERLY: 1. (Ambulance F.O.P.W.C.): A secondhand ambulance was presented to the Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee through the generosity of the Rotary Club (Finsbury) in 1959. This has been used for the conveyance of the infirm aged to the club already referred to and for other purposes on behalf of the elderly. It has also been loaned to other organisations providing recreation for the handicapped. In addition, due to the nonavailability of more suitable transport, it has also been used for the delivery of domiciliary meals until November 1961, when it was possible to purchase a more suitable van from a grant received from the Council. In May 1962 the ambulance had to be taken out of use due to the non-availability of spare parts to make it sufficiently roadworthy to obtain a new Certificate of Fitness. The question of the purchase of a new ambulance or similar transport for the elderly, was under active consideration at the end of the year. 2 Barber & Hairdresser Service (F.0.P.W.C. ): The Committee provided a domiciliary Barber Service (Haircutting and Shaving) for elderly men who were housebound or bedridden. This was essentially a restricted service for men for whom no other arrangements were possible. There was no charge to the elderly and the Committee paid the Barbers' fees. 3 Christmas Parcels (F.O.P.W.C.): Many of the elderly have been provided each Christmas with a parcel of groceries and other suitable gifts by the clubs or churches with vhich they are associated, or by the Finsbury Old People's Welfare Committee, which has distributed about 300 each year. 4. Coal (F.O.P.W.C.): The Committee is registered in the Licensed Merchants Register in relation to the district of Finsbury, as a licensed merchant to furnish supplies of coal in quantities not exceeding 28 lbs. This coal is stored at the Health Centre and the service was used on numerous occasions to provide coal to the aged in an emergency. 5. Mending Scheme for the Aged (F.O.P.W.C. ): This scheme provides in association with the Finsbury Employment Scheme for the Elderly, a Mending Service for the aged. There is a definite need for this service which effects repairs to such items of clothing as socks, underclothes etc., and is particularly useful in respect of the male aged living alone. Substantial use has been made of the Scheme. There is no charge to the aged. 6 Ophthalmic Service: As there were many elderly in need of glasses or other ophthalmic treatment who found it too much trouble to make an appointment at a hospital or other clinic, a special arrangement was made in 1956, by the courtesy of Moorfields Eye Hospital whereby appointments could be made on their behalf and for them to be seen with a minimum of waiting in the hospital. Extensive use was made of this service in 1962. 20 7. Outings: Christmas Parties etc.: A number of outings in the summer, and parties and visits to a theatre in the winter have been arranged, and given by many organisations and individuals interested in the Welfare of the Elderly, as by the clubs in the Borough. In some cases the arrangements have been made by the Old People's Welfare Committee. 8. Patients in Hospitals S Residents in Homes (F.O.P.W.C): An endeavour has been made to keep in touch with Finsbury Old Persons in hospital and Welfare Homes, and so help them to feel that they are not forgotten, by sending them Christmas Cards and by arranging friendly visitors for them. This has however proved difficult and has only be successful to a limited extent. 9. Wireless (F.0.P.W.C): (i) The Wireless for the Bedridden Society; The Committee has continued to act as Sponsor in respect of applications received from bedridden or housebound Finsbury aged persons desiring wireless facilities provided by the above Society. A number of new cases have thus been able to enjoy the sound programmes in 1962. (ii) Wireless Relay Services: The Committee has continued to finance the provision of a Wireless Relay Service for the use of the hundred and twenty aged persons participating in the Finsbury Employment Scheme for the elderly, at 'Brooke House', 39/41 Gloucester Way, E.C.I. and at the Women's Voluntary Service Meal Centre in Exmouth Market, E.C.I. These have been much appreciated by the elderly persons using the Centres. The Committee entered into an agreement in 1956, with the two Relay Wireless Companies which cover the greater part of the borough, whereby relay wireles facilities are provided for elderly persons at a reduced rental,the Committee to be responsible for ensuring that each aged person has a current Wireless Receiving Licence. It was agreed that the service should initially be restricted to a maximum of twenty aged persons, who, whilst not housebound or bedridden were, in the opinion of the officers, deserving of the provision of wireless facilities and that in such cases the rental should be paid by the Committee. In 1962 on an average 17 persons have enjoyed these facilities (either relay or a wireless set where Relay Service does not operate) at any one time. 10. Various (F.O.P.W.C. ): (i) Co-operation has continued with the London Electricity Board, and North Thames Gas Board to have electricity and gas appliances checked for possible defects, and meters lowered, where they were situated in places difficult for the elderly to reach. 21 (ii) Brown walking sticks, foot stools and shopping baskets on wheels have been issued to elderly persons on loan, unable to afford them, where they have been needed. (iii) A special news sheet called 'Finsbury Tidings' was issued and distributed free of charge to elderly persons on two occasions during 1962. 22 SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES WATER: The borough is freely supplied with water from the Metropolitan Water Board. As this supply is under continuous control no regular examinations are made of it. All the premises in the Borough have a piped supply of water but in many houses and block dwellings supplies of drinking water, as well as water to be used for other domestic purposes, are obtained from storage tanks. Generally speaking it may be said that these tanks are in good general condition and the majority of them are satisfactorily covered, and do not require attention except on rare occasions. From time to time inspections are carried out, mainly on complaint, to ascertain their condition, and if necessary steps are taken to enforce cleansing and adequate covering, in accordance with the Council's Bye-Laws. The Metropolitan Water Board give regular information whenever water supplies to any premises are withdrawn. This may be because the premises have become vacant or because of defects causing waste of water or of unpaid rates. Investigations are made by the department, and where appropriate, action is taken to have the supply reinstated. It has occurred on a diminishing number of occasions and in 1962 only three instances occurred and in each case the supply was restored. There are at present only 3 deep wells known not to be fully sealed in the Borough. These are situate in the premises of 1. Royal London House, Finsbury Square. 2. City Gate House, Finsbury square. 3. Bovril Ltd., Old Street. The first two premises mentioned are partly in Crown occupation, and samples of the water are periodically examined either by this department or elsewhere, on behalf of the Ministry of Works. That on the premises of Bovril Ltd., is not in actual use. The number of water samples examined bacteriologically in 1962 was 19. Of these 10 samples were taken from deep wells and 9 from private dwellings supplied from water storage tanks in respect of which complaints were received. The well water was also submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. In the case of both the bacteriological and chemical examinations the results were all highly satisfactory. SWIMMING BATHS: (i) The Council maintains two establishments, one in Merlin Street 23 and one in Ironmonger Row, both of which provide in addition to a large indoor warmed swimming pool, slipper baths and facilities for the washing of clothes. That in Ironmonger Row is particularly well equipped in every way, and contains a Turkish Bath section. There is in addition at this establishment, a special childrens pool of limited dimensions and even depth. This pool is not greatly used except at fortnightly intervals when a club consisting of members interested in helping spastics and cured cases of poliomyelitis, helps them to recover some degree of movement and to enjoy the freedom possible for them when in water. The pool is specially heated on these occasions, and a very valuable service is rendered in this way. The water is circulated, filtered and chlorinated. Apart from careful day to day control of chlorination by the Baths Superintendent,the occasional examination of the water has been carried out by the Laboratory Technician. The results have uniformly shown a satisfactory degree of alkalinity and of free chlorine and the sample to be sterile. (ii) There is an indoor swimming pool open to the public during the summer months at Northampton College. The water here is circulated, filtered and chlorinated but the plant in use is somewhat out of date, and detailed control has from time to time been somewhat difficult. Regular chemicel control is maintained by the College authorities. Chemical and bacteriological examinations have also been made from time to time by the Laboratory Technician none of which have given rise to concern, though the alkalinity and amount of free chlorine have occasionally been found to be low and complete sterility not maintained. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORATE: I am happy to report that the Department remains fully staffed in this Section, with an establishment of 10 Public Health Inspectors. In accordance with previous practice the Council has continued to engage student Public Health Inspectors,one of whom sat and was successful in passing the examination in 1962. SANITARY CONDITIONS: I am glad to be able to report that there has been a steady improvement during the past year of the prevailing environmental conditions in the homes of the residents. This has been consequent for a large part on the disappearance of many of the unfit properties. It is reflected in a diminishing number of complaints made to the department from 832 in 1961 to 735 in 1963. It has been possible to investigate all complaints without delay. Generally speaking, the policy adopted has been to press for the abatement of nuisances by informal action rather than to take legal proceedings. In this way it has been possible to preserve better relations with landlords and thus to secure further 24 improvements which could not be enforced. In spite of the general improvement referred to there still remains much unfit property deleterious to health in the Borough. The following table sets out a number of details of the work carried out under this heading in 1962. Housing damp, dirty - remedied 239 Doors, windows, floors, walls, ceilings, sascords repaired 440 Watercloset and urinal defects remedied 90 Soil and vent pipe defects remedied 115 Rainwater pipes cleared, repaired or renewed 62 Waste pipes cleared, repaired or renewed 191 Drains cleared 396 Roofs and gutters repaired 238 Water storage tank defects remedied 13 Yard pr area defects remedied 34 Washhouse defects remedied 1 Water supply to houses reinstated 29 Water supply laid on to upper storeys of house 6 Firegrates renewed or repaired 30 Animal nuisances abated 9 Miscellaneous nuisances abated 173 Dust receptacles renewed or repaired 64 Accumulations of refuse removed 155 Overcrowding cases reported 20 No. of Basement rooms inspected 249 No. of House inspections 923 No. of House-to-House Inspections 57 Total No. of first visits for all purposes 5,447 Total No. of re-visits for all purposes 9,957 No. of Intimation Notices served 329 No. of Nuisance Notices served 31 Legal proceedings were instituted on 10 occasions in 1962,for noncompliance with a Nuisance Notice.

URGENT NUISANCES: During 1962 the following urgent matters were dealt with as prescribed by the London County Council (General Powers)Act 1955 by the service of notices on the persons responsible. Choked drains 8 (in 3 cases the drains were cleared by the owners within the 48 hour period. In the remaining 5 instances the work was carried out by the Council and charged to the owner). Other urgent defects 2 (these matters were remedied by the Council and made a charge on the property). DRAINAGE WORK: Extensive rebuilding and alteration to existing industrial, commercial and residential properties has been going on since the war and continues to take place. This necessitates numerous visits to building sites and discussions relating to compliance by building contractors with the London County Council Drainage and W.C. Bye-Laws. Ninety-three drainage plans were approved by the Council during 1962, and 3,095 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with the supervision of work in progress. The following table is an indication of the extent of the work carried out during the year. Drains laid or amended 52 Soil and vent pipes erected 153 Drains or Soil pipes tested 814 26 Waste Pipes erected 182 Waterclosets installed 775 Urinals installed 124 Lavatory Basins fixed 1,288 Sinks fixed 447 Baths and showers installed 264 Washing machines installed 18 Spin driers installed 3 Petrol Interceptors built 3 The revised Drainage Bye-Laws made by the London County Council came into force on the 1st May 1962. They were necessary because of recent advances in the technique of design and construction, and the use of modern materials in drainage work. The new Bye-Laws allow the use of the 'single stack' system, and this is being used extensively in connection with tall blocks of flats. It calls for greater care in approving installations of this type. Two notices were served on owners of property during the year regarding defective drains, in accordance with Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936. The necessary repairs were subsequently carried out, in one case by the owner and in the other by the Council, on default. COMMON LODGING HOUSES: There is only one Common Lodging House known in the Borough,namely that for men situated at 88 Old Street, E.C.I, which is owned and maintained by the Salvation Army. The premises were licensed for 275 inmates. Separate quarters are provided for the Deputy Keeper and staff, but the common sleeping rooms are large dormitories on the upper floors, the kitchen, dining room and office being on the ground floor, and the washing facilities and lockers in the basement. The main sanitary accommodation is situated in the ground floor year, but additional toilet facilities are also provided on each bedroom floor. Detailed consideration was given in 1961 to this lodging house and the number of men for whom the licence was renewed was reduced from 313. During 1962 a number of improvements were affected by the owners and the premises were redecorated, but as it was understood that the premises would be closed during 1963 no further steps were taken to secure more elaborate modernisation of the facilities provided. The Public Health Inspectors visited and inspected the premises on seven occasions. SHOPS: The duty is placed on the Council by the Shops Act 1950 to carry 27 out inspections of retail and wholesale shops and warehouses to ensure that adequate sanitary accommodation is provided and that sufficient means of ventilation and heating are provided and maintained. Prom 1959, additional duties in respect of the provision of washing facilities, and facilities for the taking of meals in a shop by employees formerly exercised by the London County Council, were transferred to the Borough Council. A register of shops is kept in the department and during the year 120 visits were paid by the Public Health Inspectors. In two instances notices were served on the occupiers requiring various matters to be dealt with. There have been 58 certificates of exemption in force granted by the Council allowing use of sanitary accommodation elsewhere than on the premises owing to restricted space. RAG AND BONE DEALERS: There are no known premises where such trade is carried out, and which would bring them within the scope of the Bye-Laws in this connection. There are 4 premises where trade is carried on in rags and waste paper etc. These have been inspected from time to time. RAG FLOCK: At the end of 1962, 2 premises in the Borough were licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock and 6 premises were registered to use filling materials under the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951. Regular visits have been paid to these premises including 5 inspections in 1962. On all occasions the conditions have been found to be reasonably satisfactory. Four samples of filling materials were taken during the year. All were found to be satisfactory. OFFENSIVE TRADES: At the end of the year no business was licenced pursuant to Section 140 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936, sanctioning the carrying on of an offensive trade. FACTORIES: As might be expected from the general increase in mechanisation throughout the country and the demolition 80 much of the older property in the Borough, the number of premises in which power is not used and where in consequence the Council is responsible for health conditions, other than the satisfactory state of the sanitary accommodation and the enforcement of the Food Hygiene Regulations in canteens, has continued 28 to fall considerably since the war and there are now only 52 non-power factories, in the Borough. The number of factories with power has also fallen but proportionally not to the same extent, there being some 1,201 at the end of 1962. Generally speaking, conditions have been found to be satisfactory. It must be remembered that many of the defects found are ofaminor or temporary nature, such as dirty sanitary accommodation, and are often dealt with informally. On the other hand, certain unsatisfactory conditions found have been dealt with in accordance with the Act and Regulations. The official returns for 1962 are as follows:- INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health (Inspections made by Public Health Inspectors). Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers prosecuted (i) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities. 52 19 – – (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 1,201 956 40 – (iii) Other premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding outworkers premises) 17 29 – – Total: 1,270 1,004 40 – 29 CASES IN WHICH DEFECTS WERE FOUND Particulars Number of cases in which defects were found Found Remedied Referred Number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted To H.M.

Because smallpox and scarlet fever, the two diseases considered most likely to spread in this way, are no longer of serious concern, and verminous premises only infrequently discovered, the supervision of outwork has become of less importance than heretofore, and no formal action has been required in any case for many years, though occasionally by arrangement with the firms concerned, a few articles which might have been in contact with infectious disease have been disinfected or destroyed. 30 OUTWORK ParticularsNature of Work Section 110 Section 111 No. of outworkers in August list reguired by Sect. 110 (i) (c) No of cases of default in sending ' lists to the Council No. of prosecutions for failure to supply lists No of instances of r/orkin unwholesome premises Notices served Prosecutions Wearing apparel Making etc. 1176 - - - - • Household linen 12 - - - • - Umbrellas etc. 12 - - - - - Artificial flowers 17 - - - • - The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 80 - - - - - 8rush making 14 - - - - - Feather sorting 35 - - - - - Carding etc. of buttons etc. 52 - - - - - Cosaques, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings etc. 11 - - - - - Total: 1481 - - - - - The information supplied, which it must be remembered does not embrace all forms of outwork, is of use in that it enables some supervision of the home circumstances. The following tables set out the detailed information supplied in the official returns:- The number of firms employing outworkers in 1962 was 117 The number of Finsbury outworkers employed by them was 174 The number of non-Finsbury outworkers employed by them was 2,938 The number of Finsbury outworkers employed by firms outside the Borough was 39 The total number of Finsbury outworkers employed by firms in or outside the Borough was 263 (of these 80 were firms and 183 homeworkers) The registers of outworkers which firms are required to maintain are inspected as part of the routine during the inspections of the factories concerned. Number of visits paid to homes - 385. 31 CLEAN AIR: There has undoubtedly been a decrease in the degree of Atmospheric Pollution in London over the past 20 or 30 years, but it remains a contributory cause of much ill health, structural damage and drabness in our surroundings. The condition of the air in Finsbury and its further pollution from sources within the Borough is probably little different from that in other parts of the Metropolis. Air pollution from Industrial establishments is certainly lessened as a result of improvements to boiler plants that have been carried out by firms or from the result of pressure brought by officers of the department. Atmospheric smoke however,has not decreased correspondingly, and now probably represents a much greater proportion of the total pollution than before. Much attention has been given to the problems of the prevention of pollution especially since the end of 1956, when the Clean Air Act came into force. MEASURE OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION: Since the middle of 1953 a station for measuring air pollution has been operated in the Finsbury Health Centre in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and monthly determinations of the soluble and insoluble deposits have been made, together with the estimation of the sulphur dioxide content of the air by the lead peroxide candle method. Since March 1955 daily measurements of the smoke and sulphur dioxide by volumetric analysis have also been made. At the beginning of 1960 the monthly estimation of sulphur dioxide by the first method were discontinued as it was found from experience over three years that concordant results were arrived at by this, and the volumetric methods. This is not necessarily the case in all areas as each of the two methods also measures some other impurities. There is considerable daily and seasonal variation due to the weather and no doubt the amount of fuel consumed in the District, but there has been little change in the general level of pollution. SMOKE EMISSION: The number of timed observations made during the year, of the chimneys in Industrial establishments was 505 and 38 complaints of smoke investigated. Verbal warnings have been given where appropriate and advice has been offered to management and their staffs. On 2 occasions in 1962 written notices were issued when contraventions of the Act or Regulations had been observed. FURNACES: Seventy-eight formal notifications (including 13 in 1962) have been received of intention to instal industrial furnaces since the 32 coming into force of the Clean Air Act, and prior approval was sought and given in one case to a plan submitted in 1959. SMOKE CONTROL AREAS: The first two Smoke Control Orders made by the Council came into operation during 1962. In the case of the Pinsbury (No.2) Smoke Control Area, all the firegrates in dwellings liable to grant aid, had been adapted by the end of the year. There were still a few grates remaining to be converted in dwellings within the Finsbury (No.l) Smoke Control Area, which were subject to notices served by the Council. In all 41 notices were served in accordance with Section 12(12) of the Clean Air Act 1956, where fireplaces had not been converted by the date of operation of an Order. The Finsbury (No. 3)Smoke Control Order was made by the Council, and confirmed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government during the year, and preliminary steps taken to implement it. This comes into operation on 1st July 1963. Following a detailed survey and report, the Council agreed to the making of its fourth area. This was the subject of the Finsbury (No.4) Smoke Control Order made on 29th November 1962, and submitted to the Minister and now awaiting formal confirmation. The programme of Smoke Control Areas in Finsbury was revised in December 1961. Originally, 10 to 15 years was envisaged as being necessary to deal with the whole Borough. The Council has now agreed to a greatly accelerated programme which, if it is found possible to adhere to, the Borough should be completely covered by Smoke Control areas by 1967. Details are set out below:- PROGRAMME FOR SMOKE CONTROL AREAS IN FINSBURY Area No Acres Total Premises wellings Date of Order Date of Operation 1 66 623 362 29. 3. 61. 1. 6. 62. 2 37 438 30 31. 7. 61. 1. 9. 62. 3 57 1,346 779 4. 4. 62. 1. 7. 63. 4 103 2,466 2,006 29. 11. 62. 1.10. 63. * 5 100 3,070 2,499 1.10. 64. * 6 64 1,162 932 1.10. 65 * 7 100 1,620 1,215 1. 10. 66. * 8 60 1,568 1,179 1. 10. 67 * Total 587 12,293 9,002 * Proposed VERMINOUS ARTICLES & PREMISES: The Disinfestation service continues to provide for the destruction of all types of insects and pests, but in particular Bed Bug, flees, beetles and cockroaches. 33 The general procedure is to spray with a 5% solution of D.D.T. or other insecticide and to give a follow-up treatment some 14 days later if necessary. Where bedding is found to be badly infested it is removed to the Health Centre for treatment in the steam disinfector. During the past year only two serious infestations have been discovered - one of cockroaches and one of Dermestes lardarius (Bacon Beetles). The latter offered a good deal of resistence to treatment, but after flooring boardshad been lifted and all rubbish and debris, including some old rat nesting, removed, a complete coverage was made with 10% D.D.T. powder which proved to be effective. Clearance Schemes in operation locally have done much to reduce bedbug infestations, and in connection with the re-housing of the families so affected it has been the practice to spray their furniture and effects shortly before removal, or in certain cases to have them fumigated in transit. Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936 enables the Council on a report from the Medical Officer of Health to cause to be cleansed, disinfected or destroyed, any article in a house which has become verminous, filthy, dangerous or in an unwholesome condition, so that health is affected. During 1962 47 such representations were made and spraying was carried out before any article was removed. Disinfestation has covered a wide range of pests and during 1962335 premises were treated which include the following:- Bed Bug 118 Cockroaches 9 Beetles (various) 29 Fleas 10 Flies 7 Ants 13 Routine spraying was also carried out at 86 Council properties which for some reason had become vacant. SCABIES AND OTHER VERMINOUS CONDITIONS: The Borough Council continued the operation of the Bathing Centre in the Health Centre for the treatment of verminous conditions,including Scabies. Arrangements were also continued for the treatment of cases on behalf of the Shoreditch Borough Council. The Bathing Centre also undertook the work of the Holborn Bathing Centre for the period 1st January 1962 until 31st March 1962, whilst the Holborn Bathing Centre was being modernised. The Holborn Borough Council provided the transport and extra staff necessary for this work to be undertaken. 34 The evidence of both scabies and body lice has remained low, although a considerable number of children, mainly dealt with by the London County Council as Education Authority, were found with head lice. Home visiting has only been carried out in connection with the somewhat rare cases of persistent or recurrent infestations in the same family. In 1962 the total number of treatments given was: Scabies Head Lice Body Lice For Finsbury Cases: 14 1 68 For Shoreditch Cases: 7 - 1 Nearly all the cases of body lice were casual residents from a common lodging house, some of whom were sent on suspicion only as being infested. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949 Rodent Control: The work of rodent control within the Borough of Finsbury continues as a large scale operation, and it is pleasing to record that the rat population shows signs of a further big reduction. During 1962 Rattus Norvegicus (Common Rat), has been the chief cause for complaint and undoubtedly due to concerted effort,the presence of Rattus rattus (Ship Rat) has been almost eliminated. It is signficant however, that the presence of the house mouse appears to be more widespread than in previous years,although no particularly large infestation has been found. Rats in the sewers continue to require constant attention although the quarterly use of Sodium Fluoroacetate (1080) has been very effective in reducing the size of infestation generally with total clearance in some areas. For this work the Council employs a Rodent Officer, Assistant Rodent Officer, Foreman and six operatives, who, in view of the extensive Block Control Scheme operated, and the number of contracts held in connection with business premises, this staff is kept fully employed. It is pleasing to record that both residents and the occupiers of business premises within this Borough have been extremely co-operative in all matters concerning rats and mice and as in past years it has not been necessary to serve any Statutorv Notices or take legal proceedings under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act. Number of complaints received Eusiness premises 57 Private dwellings 89 35 Additional Infestations found Business premises 1197 Private dwellings 249 Number of premises treated Business premises 1254 Private dwellings 338 Number of visits made Business premises 13725 Private dwellings 6990 Charges made to Business premises £4,371. Is. 0d. PET ANIMALS: There is little trade in the Borough in pet animals. Licences under the Pet Animals Act, 1951, have been re-issued in respect of 6 premises during the past year. Three were in respect of shops; two in respect of stalls and one in respect of premises used for the breeding and sale of tropical fish, largely for export. All the premises were inspected during the year. HEATIRG APPLIANCES: Observations have constantly been made on all shops, warehouses and stalls handling the sale of new and secondhand gas, electric or oil fires, to ensure that such appliances were adequately guarded in accordance with the 3 .tandards laid down. NUISANCE FROM PIGEONS: In order to control the number of pigeons in the Borough, licenses have been granted for catching them in the streets and open spaces, as they are liable to become a public nuisance and to do much damage. Enquiries are made as to the means employed by those authorized, to ensure that they are humane and as to disposal of the carcasses to ensure that birds unfit for human consumption are not sold for this purpose. During 1962 3 licences were in force. MORTUARY: The Corporation of London was so good as to make available mortuary accommodation at their Golden Lane Mortuary for Pinsbury infectious and emergency cases. HAIRDRESSERS: The Council fixed the 1st February 1956, as the appointed day on which to bring into operation the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1954, requiring the registration of persons carrying on the business of Hairdresser or Barber, and the registration of the premises used, and made Bye-Laws for the purpose of securing the cleanliness of registered premises including the instruments, towels and equipment usedtherein, and the cleanliness of the persons employed both in regard to themselves and their clothing. At the end of the year there was a total of 47 registered premises in the Borough. As a 36 result of a special survey carried out, action was taken where necessary to enforce the requirements of the Bye-Laws, but there is still room for further improvements. In all 20 visits were made to hairdressers and barbers during 1962. DISINFECTION: Disinfection is carried out where infectious disease has occurred, upon request or when such action is considered desirable. The usual method is to spray the infected rooms and contents with a formalin solution and in some instances bedding etc., is removed to the Health Centre for treatment in the steam disinfector. In the more serious cases of infection fumigation is carried out by using a mixture of formaldehyde and potassium permanganate after the rooms have been completely sealed. During 1962 it was not necessary to resort to the latter type of treatment in any case, although spraying was done at 112 premises under the following headings:- Suspected Dysentery and Gastro Enteritis 11 Suspected Measles 4 Suspected Scarlet fever 9 Suspected Whooping Cough 2 Miscellaneous I.D. 28 Tuberculosis 9 Scabies 4 On behalf of St. Marks Hospital, Moorfields Eye Hospital Mount Pleasant G.P. 0. 45 Bedding and clothing were brought to the Disinfecting Station in the Health Centre in these cases, and disinfected with steam. In all including the caseswhere this was carried out for the control of vermin 444 articles were treated. Goods, mostly clothing, were also disinfected on behalf of certain export firms as follows:- Number of articles 25, 062 Number of times disinfecting plant charged 78 RECEPTION HOUSE: The portion of the Health Centre which had, in the past, been maintained by the Council as a Reception House (for persons who could not remain in their own rooms whilst these were being cleansed after infectious disease, or who had no alternative accommodation in which to reside during housing repairs) continued to be used, by agreement with the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, for the purpose of 37 accommodating the administrative side of the Mass Radiogrphy Unit. The Islington Borough Council has kindly agreed to provide accommodation for Pinsbury residents at their Reception House as and when the occasion should arise. No use has been made of this accommodation during 1962. NOISE: In one case formal action was taken under the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1937, which provides for Noise to be treated as a nuisance under the Public Health (London)Act 1936, in certain circumstances. In most instances however, the restrictions imposed have rendered legal action impracticable. Towards the end of I960 the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, which somewhat strengthens the powers to secure abatement of noises which are a nuisance, came into force. During 1962 there were 19 complaints of noise received by the Department - a considerable increase over previous years, probably due to press publicity regarding the Noise Abatement Act. A summary of the complaints indicates the type of premises involved, viz: Factories 9 Shops 6 Dwellings 3 Demolition Works 1 Several complaints were disturbed by night work at adjoining premises. In most cases, following correspondence with the firms in question, in each instance considerable amelioration of the conditions was brought about. The complaints regarding private dwellings were all in respect of private disagreements between tenants. The one formal intimation notice was served on the owner of a launderette in which automatic machines were operated by the insertion of a coin. The laundrette situated under a large block of flats, was unattended and remained open 24 hours a day, and nuisance was caused by noise from the driers, particularly late at night and on Sundays. As a result of my warning, the launderette closed at nights and employed an attendant, and amongst other steps to reduce the noise, new driers were installed which ultimately abated the nuisance. In 1960 the Council accepted an invitation to become a member of the Noise Abatement Society. The Society aims to eliminate excessive and unnecessary noise from all sources, by means of publicity, pressing for the enforcement of existing laws, and for new Bye-Laws where existing laws appear inadequate. 38 SECTION D HOUSING GENERAL: According to the preliminary data provided by the Registrar General, the total number of structurally separate dwellings occupied at the time of the census in April 1961 was 9,262. Taking into account the numbers of premises demolished and those newly erected or converted since that date, it is estimated that the total number of dwellings in the Borough at the end of 1962 was 9,438, disregarding empty properties. During the year the remaining temporary hutments, erected for emergency housing purposes after the war,were demolished. The dwellings in the Borough therefore,consist of approximately 7,000 flats and 2,440 houses. The proportion of flats has increased considerably in recent years following the demolition of many unfit houses and the erection of flats on the sites. Ownership of the flats is roughly as follows:- Pinsbury Borough Council 2,090 London County Council 600 City Corporation 540 Metropolitan Police 130 Housing Associations 1,860 Private Ownership 1,780 NEW BUILDING: The following new dwellings were completed during 1962:- By Pinsbury Borough Council Mulberry Court, Brunswick Close Estate 37 flats By The City Corporation Crescent House, Golden Lane Estate 146 flats By The London County Council, Roby House, Wenlake Estate, Old Street 19 flats By Private Owners Caretakers Plat, Sophia House, Peatherstone St. Harvest Lodge, Penton Street. 1 flat 7 flats Total 210 flats During the last year 6 certificates of Habitation under Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936 were issued. CONVERSIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS: Since the inception of the improvement and standard grants schemes, only two major property owning companies have taken the opportunity of 39 improving their dwellings with the aid of Council grants. Practically all the grants in the two categories have been made to these two owners. Comparatively little of the older property in the Borough has therefore been reconstructed or had the five standard amenities provided. It is known that improvement grants have been made by the London County Council to a certain Housing Trust. Following the Circular from the Minister of Housing & Local Government in the latter part of 1962, the Council has considered how best to encourage the improvement of houses, as a result of which a preliminary survey of the area has been undertaken, and letters are being sent to those owners of houses of a type envisaged in the Circular. During 1962 an application for standard grants in respect of a block of 12 flats was received from a Housing Association, but was deferred on the grounds that all the conditions had not been observed. The Conversion of the undermentioned properties was completed during the year without grant aid. 56/57 Myddelton Square 5 flats REPAIR OF HOUSES UNDER THE HOUSING ACTS: During the year, following detailed surveys and estimation of the probable cost of repairs, official representations were made to the Health Committee in respect of two unfit houses in the Borough. As a result, formal Notices were served on the owners requiring the repair of the premises. In one case the tenants were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation, and following an appeal to the County Court, the owners gave an undertaking not to allow the premises to be used for human habitation. Ultimately the Council agreed to make a Closing Order. In the second case an appeal was pending at the end of the year. UNFIT HOUSES & PARTS OF HOUSES: There are still many unfit houses and parts of houses in the Borough, that cannot be repaired at reasonable cost, although their number is steadily deminishing. Owing to the difficulties in relation to rehousing, it has not been practicable to secure demolition or closure of any but those in the worst condition. Prom time to time it has become necessary to take action to secure closure of a few individual rooms (other than basements) in houses where these could not be made fit at a reasonable cost. Steps have been taken to secure closure of unsatisfactory basement rooms, usually when these have become vacant or been known to be about to become vacant. The table appended summarizes the action taken during 1962 and indicates the overall position at the end of the year. 40 CLOSING AND DEMOLITION ORDERS: Whole Houses Basement Rooms Other Parts No. of representations made 5 4 - No. still under consideration 6 14 1 Total No. of undertakings accepted - - - Demolition Orders made - - - Properties demolished during 1962 2 - - Closing Orders made 2 3 - Such premises later demolished 4 - - Orders later determined - 11 - Total No. of representations lapsed or no action taken 1 - - Total No. of properties still subject to (a) Demolition orders - - - (b) Closing Orders 44 130 5 INSPECTIONS: The tabular statement prepared in accordance with the Housing Consolidated Regulations 1925-32 is as follows:- No. of houses considered on inspection to be unfit for human habitation 11 No. of houses wherein defects were remedied by informal action - No. of representations made with a view to:- (a) serving notices requiring the execution of work 2 (b) making demolition or closing orders 9 No. of notices served requiring the execution of repairs 2 No. of houses rendered fit after service of notice - No. of demolition or closing orders made 3* No. of houses in respect of which undertakings were accepted - No. of houses demolished 6 (* including premises represented prior to 1.1.62). CLEARANCE AREAS: Rehousing by the Council and the L.C.C. of the tenants from the large King Square Clearance area, continued throughout 1962 and by the end of the year the immediate requirements, including much demolition, to allow redevelopment to take place, had been met. One block of flats was approaching completion. Donegal Street area was also cleared and the premises demolished during the year. Surveys were carried out by the Housing Inspector, of Benjamin Street, Margery Street and St. Helena Street areas, all of which are included in the agreed slum clearance programme. Reports and representations were submitted to the Council and appropriate Orders agreed to. 41 A summary of the position relating to individual areas is given below:- Area No, of Houses Year of Order Remarks Herbal Hill 2 1957 ) Premises vacant, not not yet demolished. Field Place 7 1957 ) Medcalf Place 15 1957 Premises demolished during the year. King Square: No. 2 Area 292 1958 Rehousing nearly completed and most houses demolished. No. 3 Area 25 1958 Rehousing in progress Donegal Street 42 1959 Premises demolished during the year Northampton Road 9 1961 ) Clearance Orders made Bowling Green Lane 2 1961 ) Public enquiry held January 1963 Benjamin Street 4 ) Survey undertaken. Council Margery Street 14 ) agreed to make C.P.O. St. Helena Street 9 Survey made. C.O. agreed REHOUSING: Applications for rehousing by the Borough Council are made to the Housing Manager and these have been assessed for some years according to a points scheme. When accompanied by medical certificates to support the application on medical grounds, these have been referred to the Medical Officer of Health. Enquiries are then made by the Nurse/Visitor into the detailed nature of the family health, and the apparent bearing on this of the accommodation in use, and when desirable an inspection is carried out by the Public Health Inspector. These reports are then correlated with the medical certificates, and a degree of medical priority is then allotted. During 1962 applications have been dealt with as follows:- New Cases 94 Cases reconsidered on new medical certificates 76 Cases reconsidered 3 Applications for rehousing by the London County Council are made to that body. Reports are sometimes asked for and supplied in regard to the existing overcrowding and sanitary defects. A very limited number are granted medical priority allocated by the County Medical Officer of Health. The number of families rehoused during 1962 was Rehoused by Pinsbury Borough Council (original lettings). 38 Rehoused by Finsbury Borough Council from clearance areas etc. 37 42 Rehoused by London County Council (including clearance areas) 99 Rehoused in New Towns 28 Rehoused by City Corporation 5 In addition many transfers within Council property took place, in order to make the best use of existing accommodation and prevent under occupation. OVERCROWDING: It is difficult to estimate the extent of overcrowding in the Borough - either overcrowding based on the purely legal standard or what may well be considered to be overcrowding of families living in cramped conditions, necessitating the use of kitchens as bedrooms, but not legally overcrowded. At the beginning of 1957 a register was started of overcrowded families, coming to the notice of the Department. Since then details of some 163 families have been recorded,in 47 of which the overcrowding was subsequently abated by rehousing. Generally speaking however, serious overcrowding is much reduced, and the majority of cases coming to the notice of the department are only overcrowded to the extent of ½ or 1 unit, usually caused by natural increase over a period of years. Twenty eight new cases were noted during 1962. It is the policy to send strongly worded letters,threatening prosecution to owners and tenants of dwellings where recent wilful overcrowding has come to light. Three bad instances were discovered during the year, all in respect of immigrants. One flat, let to a family, was being used as a lodging house for single men but the practice of taking in lodgers ceased after pressure from the department, and following a decision by the Council to apply for a summons. In another instance, the parents had failed to disclose the total number of children in the family and had secured accommodation much too small to comply with legal standards. After receiving notice to quit, arrangements were subsequently made to board out some of the children. The third case was still under discussion at the end of the year, but there appeared to be little point in instituting legal proceedings. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION: The Council welcomed the provisions of the Housing Act 1961 regarding Houses in Multiple Occupation. Considerable thought has been given to this very Complex subject, bearing in mind the difficulties that would certainly arise from the wholesale indiscriminate application of the Act, in an area like Pinsbury. A small pilot survey was carried out in order to assess the problems and towards the end of the year a detailed report was prepared for consideration by the Health and Housing Committees of the Council. One notice was served during the year under Section 90 of the Housing Act 1957 laying down the number of persons permitted to 43 occupy the premises, and subsequently alterations were carried out to the house to substantially comply with this notice. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING OF STAIRCASES: Bye-Laws were made by the Council in 1958 under the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1956, requiring the adequate artificial lighting of common staircases in tenament houses and flats. During the winter months of 1961/62 a survey of all the blocks of flats in the Borough was carried out by the Public Health Inspectors regarding the artificial lighting of the staircases and landings. Some 236 visits of inspections were made. It was found that the standard of lighting was reasonably good and in only a few instances was it necessary to request owners to carry out modifications or effect repairs to the existing installations. CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR: Inspection of properties are made in connection with all applications to the Council for a certificate of disrepair and for their cancellation. Advice is given when requested in regard to the completion of the appropriate form. The following is a summary of the action taken in recent years, and the present position. Housing Repairs S Rents Acts 1954 No. of certificates issued 24 No. of certificates revoked 8 No. of certificates still in operation 16 Rent Act 1957 Applications for certificates 70 Certificates issued 34 Certificates still in force 22 Certificates cancelled 12 Certificates not proceeded with 17 Undertakings Accepted 19 Certificates issued as to remedying of defects (a) Issued to tenants 8 (b) Issued to landlords (Cancellations) 6 (c) Still in force 4 In 1962 there was only 1 application for a certificate, as to the remedying of defects from a landlord. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS: 44 Legal proceedings in respect of contraventions of the Housing Act 1957 were instituted during the year as follows:- Date Premises Offence Result 8.5.62. 15 Culpeper Street Obstruction in connection with illegal use of Basement room Pined £20 (max penalty) Cos ts £2.12. 6. 19.7.62. do. Using basement room in contravention of Closing Order Fined £20 Costs £2.12. 6. 45 SECTION E. FOOD GENERAL: Food Premises: Apart from those premises closed by reason of slum clearance, and other redevelopment, the number of food premises in the Borough remains comparatively unchanged. The numbers of the various types of food businesses in the Borough are now as follows: - Restaurants, cafes and snack bars 156 Public Houses 106 Off-licence premises 9 Breweries, Distilleries, etc. 12 Factory canteens 75 Commercial canteens 50 Dairies and milk distributors 133 Ice cream manufacturers 3 Ice cream sellers 149 Confectioners (sweets) shops 74 Bakers shops 21 Bakehouses (i) Basement 7 (ii) Above ground 9 Grocers & provision shops (retail) 57 Provision merchants (wholesale) 11 Greengrocers & fruiterers 22 Cheese importers 3 Fish shops 2 Fish curers 2 Fried fish shops 9 Eel and pie shops 5 Poultry dealers (wholesale) 6 Butchers shops (retail) 38 Wholesale butchers and offal dealers 46 Wholesale horseflesh dealers 1 Bacon factories 7 Sausage factories 2 Sausage casing merchants 3 Meat extract factory 1 Public cold stores 6 Soft drinks manufacturer 1 Chemists shops (retail) 16 Manufacturing wholesale chemists 9 46 In addition there are approximately 180 street market stalls dealing in various foodstuffs. NOTE: Some premiss: are enumerated in more than one category. Theee business establishments have been inspected periodically both formally and informally. The total number of visits paid during 1962 was 3,334 to premises and 2,179 to stalls. FOOD HYGIENE: Due to the variety of nationalities engaged in food businesses, particularly catering, the practice of Pood Hygiene is one that requires constant supervision by the Inspectors. It is recognised that strict observance of the requirements of the Regulations can only be attained by personal contact with the employers and employees, and in order to try and attain this the combined lecture, demonstration and discussion groups initiated last year have been continued during 1962. Unfortunately although every endeavour was made to meet the wishes and convenience of the traders and staff it is regrettable that these have not been supported by the caterers. This disinclination for the trade to get together necessitates considerably more effort on the part of the inspectors involving personal contact and advice at individual premises. Particular attention has been paid to try and induce food handlers to regard the use of sterilants as a necessity in their business. Investigation has shown that generally they regard the use of popular and well advertised detergents as being a satisfactory answer to their problems. The ineffectiveness of such solutions to render articles used in food businesses bacteriologically clean, has been demonstrated in some instances by the swabbing of utensils and apparatus and considerable surprise has been shown by the caterers when the results have been explained to them. In every instance it has resulted in the use of sterilants in the establishment concerned. Unfortunately the trade is of such a type that although the use of sterilants is established after these demonstrations, it is necessary for periodic inspections to be made to ensure the continual use of them. Many of the cafes and restaurants in the Borough have kitchens situated in the basement of the premises. Inspections have shown that many of these rooms are unsatisfactory so far as temperature and ventilation are concerned, and attention is now being paid to this matter. In some instances it has been possible to have small mechanical ventilation systems installed which have resulted in beneficial results to employees. Although it may be considered an idealistic aim, it is considered 47 that food preparation rooms should be kept in such a satisfactory condition that the occupier should not hesitate to allow his customers to inspect them at reasonable times, upon request. This point is being explained to caterers and although it is too early to report the results of these conversations, it is believed that some satisfactory result will be observed in the case of more enlightened operators. BACTERIOLOGY OF POOD: The installations of a well equipped laboratory within the precincts of the Health Centre, considerably assists in a more efficient discharge of duties in connection with Pood Hygiene and the prevention of food infections. During the year the following examinations have been carried out:- Samples of foods 228 'Washing up' water 5 233 Details of these examinations are as under:- Artificial cream 9 Bacon 6 Beef 19 Beef (minced) 20 Brawn 10 Breakfast Sausage 13 Coconut 3 Corned Beef 13 Ham 15 Ice Cream 27 Ice Cream (Soft) 3 Iced Lollies 16 Jellied Veal 11 Luncheon Meat 22 Milk 14 Miscellaneous 27 228 The samples of artificial cream, coconut, ice cream,ice lollies and milk were found to be satisfactory. The cooked meats were frequently found to have heavy counts. In some instances this was due to 'ageing' but in many instances it was apparently caused by contaminated equipment, particularly slicing machines. The introduction of systematic cleansing and sterilizing was advised in these cases, and the resultant samples shewed a considerable improvement. 48 During the latter part of the year an unusually high incidence of infection with Salmonella Bredeney became apparent in the London Area. After investigation, the common source of infection was traced to a heavily contaminated ham cooking establishment situated in the Borough. Upon this being discovered, the firm were ordered to discontinue processing. After a thorough cleansing, and using a revised method of handling the raw and cooked meat products, the firm were permitted to re-open under close supervision by the department. It was not possible to trace precisely how the premises became contaminated, owing to the many sources of supply of raw material. During the investigation 191 swabs were examined by the Public Health Laboratory at County Hall. A further stage in the campaign to obtain a higher degree of cleanliness has been the periodic sampling and swabbing of various types of food premises. When results are known the occupants of the premises are notified and if the reports have been satisfactory they are encouraged to continue their efforts. In the event of the results being unsatisfactory they are informed of the result, and are advised how best to improve the position. Generally the advice given has been followed with beneficial results. Quality of food and its description: This important work in connection with foodstuffs was carried out during the year by routine informal sampling of a great variety of foodstuffs. A few adverse reports were received, both regarding quality and description. During the year 624 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst as under:- Foods No of samples submitted Milk 50 Cream & Condensed milk 16 Butter, margarine & fats 24 Cheese 10 Sausages 22 Meat & Fish products 178 Soups 3 Sauces, vinegar etc. 22 Condiments, spices & flavouring 31 Jams & preserves 21 Jellies & Gelatine 8 Dried fruit 30 Cake & pudding mixtures 19 Fresh fruit & vegetables 2 Cereals 8 Coffee, Cocoa, tea & extracts 32 49 Foods No. of samples submitted Non-Alcoholic drinks 33 Alcoholic drinks 1 Canned fruit & vegetables 47 Cakes & Bread 48 Sugar confectionery 3 Dehydrated foods 15 Drugs, tablets 1 624 Reports of unsatisfactory samples were received in respect of ten samples as follows:- 1. Excess of sulphite preservatives 2 2. Not of the nature & substance demanded 2 3. Article not in sound condition 4 4. Article suspected of being contaminated 1 5. Article not satisfactorily labelled 1 Action was taken in respect of these samples as follows: - 1. Further samples were taken formally of the articles and these were reported as being genuine. 2. This was in respect of a substance on sale in a street market labelled 'salad oil'. A formal sample was obtained and legal proceedings instituted (Result reported elsewhere). 3. Two of these samples were in respect of complaints by the public and two in connection with informal samples submitted for examination. The two complaints were found on investigation to be of minor consequence and no further action was deemed desirable. The two samples were in respect of fermentation and investigation showed that no further stock was being held by the retailers. 4. This was in respect of Raw sprouts and the complaint referred to a bitter taste, suspicion being centred around the possible use of agricultural sprays. Analysis failed to detect the presence of chemical contamination. 5. An informal sample of pate was reported wrongly labelled in so far as all the ingredients were not listed. A letter was sent to the firm importing this article informing them of the matter. COMPLAINTS BY THE PUBLIC: The number of complaints by the public in connection with foodstuffs numbered 27 during 1962. This was an increase of 9 over 1961.and although it would appear that there is a suggestion of carelessness on the part of the manufacturer or retailer, detailed investigation has shown that blame cannot be easily traced, in many cases, to a specific cause. 50 A summary of the complaints is therefore given to show the wide variety of complaints. Foreign Bodies in Foods (8) * Matchstick in sausage roll. Piece of metal in canned stewed steak Piece of latex in sausage Stone in canned peas Piece of metal in a sweet lolly * Piece of plastic price ticket in bread Mouse droppings in bread Particles of dirt inside jar of cream Upon receipt of the complaints the usual procedure of notifying both the seller and the manufacturer and requesting them to submit observations for the consideration of the Council, was carried out. Legal proceedings were instituted in respect of those cases marked with an asterisk (*). Mouldy articles of Food (8) The articles of food complained of under this heading were as follows:- Sausage rolls (3) Steak & Kidney Pie (2) Strawberry Tart (1) Bread (1) Cheese (1) With the exception of the cheese, all these complaints were, upon investigation,found to be due to the failure of the shopkeeper to rotate his stock properly with the result that fresh stock was sold before previous deliveries. In all these cases suitable letters were sent to the retailers warning them of this unsatisfactory method of trading,and subsequent visits by the Inspectors have been made to ensure that the advice is being followed. Unsatisfactory condition of Foodstuffs (4) Two complaints were received in respect of Orange squash, but examination failed to trace any harmful condition. One of the complaints was in respect of an article sold as salad oil which upon examination was found to be wrongly labelled, and rancid. Legal proceedings were taken in this instance after a formal sample had been taken of the article. The remaining article under this class of complaint was in respect of bread, but it was not considered that the condition complained of warranted further action by the Council. 51 Alleged unsound food sold to the public (6) This type of complaint is fortunately not very common. The six complaints were as follows:- Poultry (2) Oxtail Ham roll Desiccated Coconut Butter In all these cases investigations showed that the complaint of alleged unsoundness was in some cases not justified or due to unsatisfactory storage. Defective Canning (1) This complaint concerned a can of imported fruit, and was in respect of the condition of the inside of the can. The importers of this foodstuff were communicated with, but no further action appeared to be warranted. In all types of food complaint,letters are sent to the complaintants thanking them for bringing the matters to the notice of the Department, and informing them of the result of the investigation and action taken. Particular Foods and types of food premises in the Borough Stalls The progress regarding continuous compliance with the Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations is still very slow as it has not been possible to obtain complete co-operation with all the stallholders in certain matters. Approval of storage facilities and conditions of sale, prior to the granting of licences is still being carried out by the Department with beneficial results to the general public. At the end of the year the Council agreed on a revised system of sweeping and refuse collection in the Market street for a trial Deriod to commence early in 1963. Milk. The Milk supply in the Borough is being maintained at its previous high standard, and no special action was required by the department during the year. No. of Dairies on register at end of year 9 No. of Distribution Premises at end of year 124 No. of Designated milk licences issued during the year: Tube rculin Tested 2 Pasteurised 3 Sterilized 2 52 Satisfactory Unsatisfactory No. of samples submitted to Public Analyst 50 Nil No. of samples submitted for Bacteriological examination 14 All milk Nil C.I. Milk Average fat content 3.55 4.26 Average non-fatty solids content 8.63 8.94 Ice Cream There are now 3 premises in the Borough where ice cream is manufactured. Routine inspection of these premises has been maintained and 46 samples submitted for bacteriological examination all of which were reported as being satisfactory. Undoubtedly the time spent in instructing the operators of the machines in respect of adequate cleaning methods, has had a good effect. Constant supervision is however,being maintained to ensure a continuance of high standards in this trade in the Borough. The introduction of soft ice cream machines did not cause undue concern during the year, due partly to the bad summer weather and the fact that the trade so far as mobile vehicles are concerned,is generally operated by large reliable firms only. Number of premises registered for manufacture 3 Storage and sale 149 Storage only 2 MEAT INSPECTION: The boundary of the Pinsbury Borough Council runs along by part of the Smithfield Meat Market and in this particular area there are a number of wholesale butchers and offal premises, bacon and provision warehouses, poultry, game and rabbit shops. Some of the wholesale butchers premises deal in a low class of meat, principally the boning out of carcasses of old cows, bulls, sheep, sow and boars, which are eventually used in the manufacturing trade. The meat inspector is engaged full time in seeing that these carcasses are examined to ensure that no diseased meat is passed on to the public. Larger quantities of meat seem to be consigned to the Borough every year, and there has been an increase in the number of wholesale butchers premises. In particular, one very large American meat importer opened large premises in St. John Street, and has taken on the proportion of a 'miniature Smithfield Market' . Consignments of Scandinavian and Continental offals and canned hams continue to be imported into the Borough with the usual condemnations taking place. 53 The collection of unsound meat and other foodstuffs continues to be satisfactorily collected by the Council's contractor Messrs. Henson & Burbridge Ltd., Matusa Works, Beckton, who render down the meat etc. for technical purposes. The importation of Beef Livers affected with Echinococcus cysts, has shown a great improvement and only 105 Beef Livers were found to be parasitic. During the course of the year there has been an increase in the number of certificates issued for the export of meat etc., and 283 certificates were granted. There are no licensed slaughterhouses and no slaughtering has taken place in the Borough since the war. The retail butchers shops and stalls have been inspected with regard to the conditions of the meat which appears to be fairly satisfactory. REGISTERED FOOD PREMISES: In accordance with the requirements of Section 16 of the Pood & Drugs Act 1955, the undermentioned types of businesses namely those used for the manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food, are registered by the Council. Two premises were added to the register during 1962,making a total of 76. A numbar of these businesses were registered for more than one type of manufacture. Sausage manufacturers 33 Sausage smoking 1 Meat Pickling 40 Offal cooking 5 Cooked meats or pie making 4 Bacon curing and smoking 3 Ham boiling 12 Pish curing 3 Shellfish cooking 2 Jellied eels 2 Meat extraction 1 Regular inspections of these premises have been carried out, and during 1962 389 visits were made. During the year twenty-three of this type of premises were cleansed or repaired during the year. At the latter end of 1962 a large meat processing plant was started in the Borough. These premises will require constant supervision during the early stages of operation, in order to ensure that the requirements of the Pood Hygiene(General)Regulations,1960 are adhered to completely. The tendency to employ automation in the handling of meat products is becoming more evident,and in one large sausage factory in the Borough a new system of handling by this method is being installed. 54 Bakehouses: There are 7 underground and 9 other bakehouses in the Borough. The general standard of these is satisfactory, although one basement bakehouse still requires frequent visits to maintain the minimum standards.

Seventeen public houses were cleansed or improved during the year. Since the introduction of the Licensing Act 1961, which requires the registration of club premises by the Justices, for the sale of intoxicating liquors, twenty-three applications have been considered, and with the exception of one application, which was withdrawn, the applications were all granted following reports of non-objection by the Council, as a result of visits by officers of the department.

POISONS: The Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933 requires the Council to keep a register of persons selling those Poisons enumerated in Part II of the Act. During 1962 there were 34 applications for inclusion in the register and all the premisee concerned were visited regarding compliance with the Regulations as to labelling etc. 56 SECTION F INFECTIOUS DISEASES GENERAL: The general incidence of Infectious Disease was low throughout the year, and at no time gave rise to any concern. For the second year in succession there were no cases of poliomyelitis. There were no cases of Smallpox either at the time of the outbreak in other centres or at any other time during the year. All cases are visited by the Nurse Visitor, and general advice has been given on the precautions that need to be taken in its control; letters from the Medical Officer of Health setting out some of the principle points being delivered by her. Detailed enquiries are made as well as arrangements for the examination of contacts, and their exclusion as well as the patient from school or work where appropriate. In the occasional case where it may be desirable to exclude a contact from work, the appropriate certificate under the National Insurance Act is given. These visits are of considerable value in limiting the spread of infections, and are in the main, greatly appreciated both by the Doctors and the patients or their parents. In some cases where it may appear to the Visitor that further medical treatment is necessary, the calling in of medical advice has been recommended. In 1962, 2,424 visits were paid by the Nurse Visitor. The following table shows the incidence of notifiable diseases in 1962.

MASS RADIOGRAPHY UNIT CF): During 1962 the Mass Radiography Unit examined 40,706 males and 27,056 females - making a total of 67,762. Up to the end of 1962 the Unit has examined 759,799 persons since it commenced operations in May, 1950. 62 One hundred and eighty-nine cases were referred to Chest Clinics, hospitals, etc.,for further investigations,and so far (mid-March, 1963) forty eight cases with a significant tuberculosis lesion have been reported as well as four cases of carcinoma of the lung. Pinal diagnoses are awaited from twenty-two cases. Clinics generally record their sputum findings. For the larger part of the year under review, the Unit operated at the Mass Radiogrphy Centre,20 Golden Lane, E.C.l.,and for the remaining period it visited firms and organisations which included a co-operative Survey from 4th June to 5th July at the Finsbury Health Centre by kind permission of the Public Health Committee of the Borough of Finsbury. Prior to this Campaign, firms in Finsbury were circulated with particular concentration upon firms in the northern part of the Borough,as firms in the southern section are conveniently situated to the Mass Radiography Centre at Golden Lane. Also in this campaign firms in the Ludgate Circus area were circulated as there are direct transport facilities to the Health Centre. Besides the planned Sessions there were also Sessions at which no appointments were necessary but these were not so well attended as the organised Sessions even when it is appreciated that a number of firms sent their staffs during these Sessions. Handbills were distributed drawing attention to the Public Sessions. The undermentioned Table summarises the results of the Finsbury Survey: Total Number of Firms circulated 1639 Number of Participating Firms 385 Men W omen Total Total number X-rayed 5018 2764 7782 No previous X-ray 1212 741 1953 Recalled for Large films 78 30 108 Referred to Chest Clinics, for further investigation 21 8 29 Significant Cases of Tuberculosis 6 1 7 Carcinoma of the Lung 1 - 1 Special Heart conditions 3 4 7 General Practitioners have continued to use the services of the Unit so far as their patients are concerned.
