THE REPORT BY THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LEWISHAM DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1858. PUBLISHED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD, JUNE, 1859. greenwich: printed by w. ii. crockford, blackheath road. 1859. R E P O R T. In the preparation of their Third Annual Report, the Board of Works for the Lewisham District have resolved on a departure from the course hitherto adopted in making such reports as ample as possible; and they have been actuated in this decision not only from the consideration of the expense involved in printing a lengthened report, but from the fact that the Reports by the Press of the proceedings of each meeting of the Board render such annual reports less necessary, and that they are not required by the Inhabitants of the District is rendered manifest by the extremely limited sale of those hitherto published. In the following observations the subjects will be taken in the same order as heretofore. The establishment arrangements of the Board remain upon the basis settled in 1858, as reported last year. The expenditure upon the Highways has again been considerably reduced, as will be seen by reference to the accounts appended to this report. The following are the particulars of the sum raised for Watering the Sydenham Roads. It has, however, exceeded the expenditure, and notwithstanding the extended watering which is contemplated, a less rate will, it is hoped, be sufficient for the present year. Date and amount of Precept. Date and amount of Rate. Rateable value of Property chargeable. Amount levied. 30th September, 1858. £400. 21st December, 1858. 6d. in the pound. £18,970. £395 4s. 2d. A Deputation of the Board waited upon the Phœnix Gas Company, in the hope of arranging the difficulty which (as referred to in the last report) had arisen with them as to the renewal of the contract for lighting Lewisham Village, but without success, the Company not only declining to enter into any contract without an advance in price of 10s. per lamp, on the ground before mentioned, but also refusing to enter into any contract at all unless the Board consented to waive the authority reposed in them by the Metropolis Local Management Act for controlling the Company in laying down 4 main pipes. The Board were therefore compelled to resort to the best substitute for gas which could be found, and regret that it has failed to realise their expectations. They are, however, led to expect that the contract with the Phœnix Gas Company will be renewed for the ensuing season, upon the same terms as heretofore. The Sewerage works constructed during the year ending the 25th March last, are, as appears from the following statement, compiled from particulars furnished by the Sewers' Surveyor. LOCALITY OP WORK.

The sewer in Suburban Grove was constructed at the cost of the owners of the property there, and contributions amounting to £95 were made by Mr. Saxton and the authorities of the Roman Catholic Institution in Wells Road, towards the cost of the sewer there. The Financial condition of the Board has by a great effort during the past year been brought into a satisfactory position, and the balance in the hands of the Board on the 25th March, 1859, will, it is believed, admit of a material reduction in the rates for the year ensuing. This result arises from a reduced expenditure upon the Highways, and for lighting Lewisham Village, and from the 5 delay in effecting loans in respect of which provision had been made for interest and sinking funds. The amount payable to the Metropolitan Board of Works on account of the debt and expenses for the years 1856 and 1857, and which this Board had been so long fruitlessly endeavouring to borrow, they at last succeeded in obtaining from the London and Westminster Bank, their Treasurers, at £5 per cent. interest, nominally for six months, but the Board do not anticipate that they will be called upon for its repayment otherwise than by easy instalments, and they have, therefore, to congratulate the ratepayers upon having escaped the onerous burden of paying the entire sum, nearly £7,000, by one rate; and in the meantime, before the repayment of the amount borrowed can be required, the Board confidently anticipate that the question of the apportionment of the debts of the late Commissioners of Sewers (the doubts and difficulties of which have alone prevented the Board from effecting a permanent loan), will be definitively settled, and a great reduction be made in the amount hitherto apprehended as the apportionment for the Parish of Lewisham. The apportioned debt upon the Parish of Lewisham, in addition to the above-mentioned sum, amounts to £21,311 1s. 5d., £2,605 10s. 11d. being charged upon that part of the Parish within the former Greenwich Separate Sewerage District, and £18,705 108. 6d. upon that part of the Parish within the former Ravensbourne Separate Sewerage District. These sums form part of a sum of £200,000 borrowed by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers from the Rock Life Office, and known as the "Rock Loan," and comprise the bulk of the debts of the Commissioners of Sewers in which this District is interested. This sum of £200,000 was in part expended by the Commissioners of Sewers in constructing sewerage works in the various districts throughout the Metropolis (including most of the sewers constructed by them in the Parish of Lewisham), and in part placed to the credit of such Districts, and otherwise expended, and its apportionment between the several parishes under the Metropolitan Local Management Act has been a hotly contested question from the constitution of the Metropolitan Board to the present time. Among others, the neighbouring parishes of Greenwich and Camberwell were violent opponents of the original apportionment, but this Board were content with it, as it was universally believed that if it were disturbed it would be to increase, and not diminish, the apportionment upon the Parish of Lewisham. Ultimately, however, the Metropolitan Board were brought to admit that the apportionment had not been made upon an equitable basis, and the whole matter was reconsidered, the result being that the apportionment upon the Parish of Lewisham was increased to £30,526 18s. 2d., 6 and proportionate reductions were made from the parishes abovementioned. This Board then considered that the time had arrived for them to make a full investigation into the principles of the original and amended apportionments, and a Committee of their body was appointed for the purpose. The conclusions they arrived at will be found embodied in the memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works, appended to this Report. The memorial was presented by a deputation from this Board, and was referred by the Metropolitan Board to their Committee of Works and General Purposes, upon whose Report the apportionment, against which the memorial appealed, had been based; and the Board have to congratulate the ratepayers of Lewisham upon the most satisfactory result, viz., a further report by the Committee, in which they propose to reduce their apportionment upon this Parish from £30,526 18s. 2d. to £18,803 1s. 3d. This report has very recently been confirmed by a large majority of the Metropolitan Board, and may now be considered as their ultimate decision on the subject. It will be seen from the subjoined table how the apportionments above referred to have been arrived at. PARISH OF LEWISHAM. Re-apportionment under Report of 21st March, 1359.

Sheweth, That your memorialists have received the Report of the Committee of Works and General Purposes of your Board, proposing an apportionment among the several Parishes concerned, of the debt in respect of the two hundred thousand pounds borrowed by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers from the Rock Life Office upon the basis of the resolution of your Board of the thirty-first December last. And your memorialists having given such Report their most serious attention, regret that, whilst they concur in the general principle of the resolution referred to, they are unable to approve the manner in which it is proposed to be carried into execution, except as to such Sewers the benefit of which is wholly derived by one Parish. Your memorialists submit that the circumstances attending the construction of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Main Sewer are, with reference to the Main Drainage of the Metropolis, identical with those under which the Counters Creek Sewer was executed, and that the cost of both should therefore be transferred to the Metropolis at large; each of such Sewers being, in the language of your Committee on the amendment of the Metropolis Local Management Act, equally "treated by the body who executed them as a part of the Main Drainage of London," and each being constructed for the drainage of areas nearly equal in extent; and the cost of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer being, in proportion to the area drained, a work of far greater magnitude than the Counters Creek Sewer, and consequently bearing with greater hardship than the latter upon the immediate District for which it was constructed. And your memorialists submit that the transfer to the Metropolis at large of the cost of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer is further rendered necessary from the peculiar circumstances attending its construction, and that such circumstances render any equitable apportionment of the cost of the Sewer impracticable, whether upon the proposed or any other plan, as will be apparent from the following considerations:— 1st.—That the peculiar and primary object in view in constructing the Sewer was the purification of the River Ravensbourne, from which the water supply of the neighbourhood is derived, and not the drainage of Lewisham Parish, of which upwards of four thousand acres are still used for agricultural purposes; and that while such water was in 1856 supplied to upwards of sixteen thousand houses, it was supplied only to five hundred 15 and fifty houses in Lcwisham Parish; thus the area directly benefitted is distinct from the area drained: the former is exempt from charge, and the whole burden thrown upon the latter. 2nd.—That the construction by the Commissioners of Sewers of two Main Sewers for the drainage of one area, viz: the Ravensbourne and Lee Green, and the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewers, which, for a considerable length, run parallel, and at a short distance from each other, is an acknowledged mistake in engineering, involving the utter waste of an immense sum of money, by the expenditure of which no benefit whatever is anywhere derived. That should the foregoing considerations fail to satisfy your Board of the propriety of transferring the cost of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer to the Metropolis at large, your memorialists submit that the entire area (within the limits of the Metropolis) capable of being drained, although not at present actually draining into such sewer, should be charged to the cost of its construction; and that as the drainage of Penge must eventually be connected with the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer, that Hamlet should have been charged with a proportionate part of the cost of the Sewer. And your memorialists submit that, in order to the efficient drainage of Penge, it is of the highest importance to provide for including in the Metropolitan area, the portion of the Parish of Beckenham which intervenes between Penge and Lewisham, and which solely prevents the construction of a junction Sewer between the Sewers already constructed in Penge and the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer, and thereby connect Penge with the Main Drainage system. Your memorialists further submit that the difficulty experienced in many districts in localizing expenditure on Sewerage works, which deterred your Board from opening the question of the re-apportionment of the debts of the Commissioners of Sewers as regards any debts antecedent to the Rock Loan, does not apply to the Greenwich and Ravensbourne separate Sewerage districts. These districts were formed so recently as the year 1849, and with respect to them, therefore, one uniform principle of charge may and ought to be adopted. Thus the injustice may be avoided which would otherwise arise from the principle hitherto prevailing, whereby nearly the whole of the money raised in Lewisham has been expended on Sewerage works for the drainage of the adjoining Parish of Lee, while under the proposed altered principle and reapportionment, such Parish would be freed from charge in respect of the Sewerage works executed in Lewisham, the cost of which has been defrayed out of the Rock Loan. That your memorialists have learned, although the fact is not stated by your Committee, that the cost of Sewers, the benefit of which is derived by more than one Parish, has been apportioned between the several Parishes charged, not upon the universal principle of the annual value of the area drained, but upon the basis of the acreage of such area. Thus the charge upon land used for agricultural purposes is equal to that upon land covered with houses. And your memorialists submit that such a basis is not only unprecedented and contrary to all existing modes of rating, but, having regard to the exemption of land from Sewers rates, it involves the anomalous injustice that the portion of the area charged, upon which there are the 16 fewest houses, and therefore having the least necessity for Sewerage works, is the one most heavily charged towards their cost; and if it happen that the houses be situated in one Parish and the land in another, as is the case to a great extent in the area charged to the cost of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer, the anomaly is the greater and the wrong the more intolerable. Your memorialists therefore earnestly hope that your Board will take the several circumstances detailed into your consideration, and especially with the view to the transfer of the cost of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer to the Metropolis at large; and that in settling the general principles upon which the apportionment of the debts of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers should be based, provision may be made for the exercise of a discretion in your Board with reference to the peculiarities of each particular case, and for the equitable adjustment of questions which may be raised by any Vestries or District Boards affected thereby. The above Memorial was presented by a Deputation of the Board; and, with several Memorials from other Vestries and District Boards, was referred by the Metropolitan Board of Works to their Committee of Works and General Purposes, who had suggested the reapportionment referred to, with an instruction to reconsider the principles of such apportionment in connection with the several Memorials referred to them. The following are EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORT OF THE WORKS AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE, June 13, 1859:— "In their Report of the 21st March, your Committee stated that where the work executed benefited one Parish only, they imposed the whole cost of the work on that Parish, and where it benefited more than one, they had divided the cost between the Parishes benefited, in the proportion of the area in each Parish drained by the work. "It is in the class of cases falling under the latter branch of the foregoing rule that the modification above referred to has been introduced. Further consideration has satisfied your Committee that the test of area alone is not the just principle for apportioning the cost of a work; but that it is also proper to consider the rateable annual value of the property situate within the limits affected by the work, and with respect to some few works, therefore, they have distributed the cost between the Parishes in the ratio of the rentals. "With respect to the Memorial from the Board of Works for the Lewisham District, your Committee find that the cost of the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Sewer from Bell Green to Deptford, amounted to £26,545 16s. 5d. and that it was partly constructed with the view of 17 purifying the Ravensbourne, and thereby incidentally of purifying the Thames; and they are of opinion, that it is equitable that the entire cost should not fall upon the Parishes; and they therefore suggest, that £10,000 of the cost of such Sewer should be viewed as a part of the expenses of the Main Intercepting Drainage. They do not, however, propose that this amount should be raised by Precept from the Metropolis, but recommend that the principal and interest of so much of the debt should be paid out of the moneys raised by the Board under the Metropolis Management Act Amendment, as a part of the £3,000,000 which the Board are empowered to raise under that Act. "The works, the expense of which has been redistributed according to rental, are the following:— * * * (2). The Deptford, Lewisham, and Bell Green Sewer, the cost of which was £26,545 16s. 5d., has been apportioned according to the rental, in consequence of which the charge on St. Paul, Deptford, is increased from £6,338 2s. 8d., the amount first recommended, to £7,772 18s. 7d. The third work which has been dealt with in the same manner is the North Kent Valley and Lee Road Sewer, &c., cost £2,680 4s. 1d., which will make some variation in the amounts proposed to be charged on the Parishes concerned, which are also shewn in the tabular statement."

APRIL. DISTRICTS. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Males. Females. Total. Males. Females. Total.

In the corresponding five weeks ending upon 30th April, 1857, 30 deaths only were registered; but in the four weeks included in the report sent in in April, 1856, 41 deaths were mentioned, therefore, The mortality of the district, calculating for increase of population, is below the average for the month. Hooping cough and measles are unusually prevalent; the former has been also in many districts very fatal. Two deaths are recorded from this cause in this district. Eight deaths have taken place from epidemic disease during the month, and as usual have occurred in neighbourhoods requiring your order for their sanitary improvement, thus— One measles, Sydenham Park. Offensive drain near. One measles, Perry Hill, Sydenham. One typhus, Fox and Hounds, Sydenham, near Wells Road. Two hooping cough, Loampit Vale, Lewisham. One ditto ditto, Hanover Street, Lewisham. One diarrhoea, Elliot Place, Blackheath. One scarlatina anginosa, Garden Row. Blackheath.—The general appearance of Loat's Pits is much improved, but the supply of gas light and water would indeed be a great boon to the inhabitants. Part of the houses, however, in this locality, but lying in Greenwich parish, are in a most offensive and filthy state, and must be injurious to the health of the inhabitants of both parishes. Garden Row, situate just above the Pits, requires draining and water supply. Sandwell Place is suffering also from the want of a sewer. These localities might both be readily drained. 19 It appears to me, upon examination, that the soil about the large block of houses bounded by Tranquil Yale, Montpelier Vale, and the Heath is seriously contaminated with the foul liquid from cesspools, &c., and it is of the greatest importance that this evil should as early as possible be remedied by efficiently draining the locality. In one house that I have visited, in Montpelier Vale, the pump water is contaminated and unfit for use. In another foul liquid exudes from the ground. In another the house is rendered filthy from a cesspool in the kitchen. It is also important that the drainage of Camden Row, &c., and neighbourhood adjacent should bo opened into the sewer as soon as possible. Some houses in this place are in a most dangerously offensive state, and would doubtless suffer severely if epidemic disease should attack the inhabitants before precautionary measures can be adopted. A dung heap (Mr. Fox's yard) at the back of some houses in Tuns Passage is very offensive, although dark liquid is not now running from it as formerly into the adjacent yards. Lewisham.—A drain from Church Terrace, Ladywell, appears to me to be still supplying drainage to the Ravensboume. The state of the houses in the neighbourhood of the Retreat, Hither Green Lane, is very bad and much complained of; a sewer is much required to be carried from the main up to this locality. Sydenham.—Offensive stable and accumulations at the back of butcher's and greengrocer's, West Kent Park. The drainage from Steel's Cottages, adjoining Dartmouth Row, is occasioning as great a nuisance as arose formerly from all the houses combined, owing to accumulations of offensive sewage. These should be drained directly, as hot weather may occasion serious disease if the offensive odours are not removed. The drainage of Lower Sydenham into the sewer is not at present attended to. The same may be said of the offensive privies reported at the back of the Dolphin inn in 1856. A most filthy ditch, recently partially cleaned, exists in Mr. Colson's field. The drainage of most of the houses in Park Road Terrace, Dartmouth Park, still runs into this most offensive ditch. Pigs kept in Willow Road arc much complained of as a nuisance by the inhabitants of Albert Road, whose premises abut against them. Hanover Street requires urgently to be drained and cleansed.

This number is considerably above the average for the month of May, 35 and 26 deaths having respectively represented the mortality in the years 1856—7. No deaths have been registered in the Hamlet of Penge during the month, which renders the proportionate mortality of the other wards greater. Nine deaths have taken place from zymotic disease, viz.:— Lewisham.—The Grove. Hooping cough and croup. Avenue Road. Hooping cough and pneumonia. Bridge Place. Croup. Loampit Hill. Hooping cough. Blackheath.—Regent Street. Hooping cough. Camden Row. Thrush. Sydenham.—Bell Green, Lower Sydenham. Purpura hæmorrhagica. West Kent Park. Measles. Wells Road. Scarlatina maligna. Several cases of ague have occurred in the Wards of Blackheath and Lewisham, a disease very uncommon in the district since the construction of the sewer through Lewisham and the drainage of Rushey Green, which locality used frequently to produce some cases of this disease. I am not aware that there is any map or sufficient register of house drainage in the district. May I be allowed to suggest that as drainage is carried on it will be most important to have some easy and accurate means of reference as to what houses have been drained, and when, and in what manner this has been done, so that we may not have to depend upon memory or supposition. The following deficiencies and other evils in a sanitary point of view require your immediate consideration and order for their remedy. Blackheath.—An alley near Mr. Tuck's, Tranquil Yale, is in a most unsatisfactory state, and in common with most of the houses here, is damp and undrained. One case of ague has occurred here. My attention has been again directed to Paragon Mews, several parts of which locality are in a most offensive state: a sewer is really required here. Also to the state of Sandwell Place and adjoining houses, which are totally undrained. Measles is endemic here. Lewisham.—Some houses recently built (Ashburnham Villas), near the footpath leading across the fields from Lee Road to Hither Green Lane, are draining into the Quaggy. Ibis is a nuisance which should be stopped immediately, or the inhabitants must be sufferers. Hither Green Lane, especially in the neighbourhood of the Retreat, requires a systematic plan of drainage, as some of the houses are in a dangerous state of nuisance. Loampit Hill, Loampit Dale, and Rushey Green are still without water supply. Sydenham.—Stemp's and adjoining houses require drainage; the closets at some of these houses are in a filthy state. Pigs kept in this neighbourhood are also very offensive. Albion Terrace, Sydenham Park, requires again to be brought under your notice. In 21 one or two instances cesspools in the houses are only covered by the kitchen boards, and the drain from these houses is open for some distance, although near the sewer. Some new houses built and building in Perry Vale are turning their overflow drainage into the ditch opposite Emerson Terrace, where it must ere long be a great nuisance, and whence it will eventually get into the Ravensbourne. It should be taken in the other direction into the sewer. A gully opposite Round Hill corner is at times a most offensive nuisance. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

Seven deaths have taken place from consumption in Blackheath and Lewisham. B 2 22 Eleven deaths have occurred from epidemic disease; of these I am sorry to have to name three deaths from malignant sore throat occurring in Penge, in which district there have been several cases. This disease appears to be caused by malignant typhus attended by a confervoid (vegetable) growth, which rapidly blocks up the air passages, and appears under the microscope exactly similar to the fungus observed in the atmosphere of sewers and cesspools. (Dr. Letheby). Two deaths from this cause have taken place near the Crooked Billet. The ditch at the back of this locality, the contaminated stream from the greater number of houses here, the sewage from the Crystal Palace behind, and the want of attention to house drainage, would seem fully to point out the exciting cause. One death from this disease has also taken place in Hamlet Road, an undrainced and offensive locality. Blackheath.—Five deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, viz.:— One hooping cough, Tranquil Vale. One fever, Green Man Hotel. One croup, Ordnancc Bow. One hooping cough, Bath Place. One ditto, King Street. In Lewisham, two, viz.:— One typhus, Shrubbery Cottages. One hooping cough, Silver Street. In Sydenham.—One scarlatina, near Forest Hill Station. Much good might be done in preventing the spread of epidemics, and in allaying their virulence by the use of disinfecting agents (e.g., chlorine, as Burnet's Fluid, or oxygen, as in Condy's Fluid) in every house, to be frequently thrown down sinks, drains, and cesspools; the former being more appropriate for cesspools, the latter for drains in connection with a stream which is likely to be used for drinking and other domestic uses. Several nuisances exist in the district exceedingly detrimental to health, many of which have been often before your notice, but which, from the heat of the weather, and the peculiar state of the atmosphere now, urgently require your attention. Blackheath.—The filthy state of Paragon Mews ; large open hole containing drainage; the exceedingly dangerous state of some of the houses and drains in this locality. On this subject I cannot do better than refer back to what I urged upon the attention of the Board in March, 1856, the only difference being that it has become worse since then:— The untrapped gully holes receiving sewage from stables and houses in the Mews, at the back of Montpclier Row, emit at times noxious effluvia. A coachman and his wife, who reside opposite one of these holes, frequently suffer from ill health, which has been attributed to this cause." Bath Place, a locality near the above, also really requires attention. One death from epidemic disease in this locality I have recorded above. The undrained state of many of the houses in Montpelier Vale. Drainage at the back of Jobbins's, baker, Blackheath. Offensive drainage at times flowing from Mr. Fox's stables. Offensive drainage into ditches between Grote's Buildings and the sewer parallel with the railway. Lewisham.—The offensive smell from the urinals near the public road adjoining several of the public houses. Some deodorising substance should be ordered to be used here. Offensive smell detrimental to health from the culvert opposite Mr. Wood's house, Lewisham Road (late bed of rivulet), probably caused by some house drainage not yet diverted into the sewer. Covell's drainage obstructed and contaminating well water. No blood should be allowed to enter the drain; it is liable to coagulate, and unless instantly diluted with water would thus choke any pipes and interfere with any system of drainage whatever. I cannot but repeat the necessity there exists in such a soil as that of Lewisham for cementing the drain pipes together (as suggested by me in January, 1856), which in this case would have obviated a great part of the evil. Hither Green Lane is offensive from want of drainage, as before reported. Ashburnham Villas, reported last month, are unaltered in their outfall of drainage into the Quaggy stream. 23 Sydenham.—Brown's (butcher's yard), complained of as offonsive. Sheep are kept there for some time before slaughtering. An exposed urinal at the Fox and Hounds Inn, complained of as injurious to the business of the shops opposite. Steel's Cottages are yet undrained. Several complaints have been made to me upon this subject, and with great justice, as the drainage running from these houses upon the land at the back of Dartmouth Row, &c., is most offensive and most dangerous to health. (I have several times brought this under the notice of the Board). The sewer is close by. The drainage of the Gothic Houses in Stanstead Lane is not yet carried into the sewer. In one of these houses, which has more particularly come under my observation (Mr. Ironside's), the children have been suffering from a low form of gastric fever, to be attributed to the noxious smell in the house. Insufficient drainage at the back of Hamburgh Terrace; no exit for flood water. During the heavy rain a short time back the water stood nine inches deep in some of the cottages. Pigs kept at Mr. Plumley's, Willow Road, are complained of. Drainage required in Russell Street. Part of an open ditch separating the property in this street from that on Sydenham Hill is very offensive. Three houses in the above street, inhabited by Jinks, Burkin, and Hutchins, are much complained of as being offensive. The offal, blood, &c., from Mr. Haydon's, butcher, Forest Hill, is carried across the road, I am informed, and placed upon Duffin's dung heap, a locality surrounded by inhabited houses. This is much complained of, and must be detrimental to health. Drainage from Mr. Little's house, Sydenham Hill, flows into an open ditch bounding Mr. Upton's property. I am informed that this has only recently received sewage, and if now allowed it will become a noxious open sewer, and a nuisance to many inhabitants. Drain from houses blocked up, Dobb's, Willow Road; drainage runs across path into road. State of Havard's Lane, Sydenham Hill, from decomposing garden refuse, &c. See Dr. Letheby's note. Penge.—The offensive state of the open ditches near the Crooked Billet. Drainage of the greater part of the district flows in this direction, and is at times most noxious and prejudicial to health. A drain is much required to prevent sewage running into the Anerley water, which is at times offensive. More houses have been connected to the drain in this direction, which renders a plan of the sort the more necessary, especially as the distance is short, and would not lead to any very great expense. The marshy piece of land at back of the Anerley School is now very offensive and prejudicial to health. (Mentioned in May, 1856, and several times since).

This number is a little below the average for the same period during the last three years. Six deaths have taken place from preventible causes, viz.:— One typhus fever, Bell Green, Sydenham. Five malignant sore throat, Penge. Three of the wards, viz., Blackheath, Lewisham, and Sydenham have been comparatively free from epidemic disease, and only one death is registered from this cause in the above-named localities. Penge is, unfortunately, an exception to the above; malignant sore throat is still prevalent there, and has destroyed five lives. I feel bound to remind you that the offensive state of part of this district, that at present most affected by disease, has been brought under your notice in the months of January, May, August, September, October, and November, 1856; in February, March, May, June, July, 1857; and in February and July of the present year. At Haynes's house, in the yard adjoining the Crooked Billet, closets have been recently built without notice, and without the necessary water supply. A privy at the Crooked Billet, close to the house, is in a most offensive state. Two children (of Haynes's) have died of malignant sore throat; a third, who was attacked by the disease, has been removed out of the contaminated atmosphere at mv suggestion, and has recovered. A remedy is required for this evil at once, both to satisfy the minds of the inhabitants as well as if possible to stay immediately the progress of disease. I think that material good might be done immediately by constructing receivers and deodorizing the sewage, at the same time widening the water courses through which it runs, that it may get away more rapidly. Any attention or time that I can give to promote this object is at the service of the Board of Works. Numerous complaints have been made to me of the state of this part of the district, 25 and I have suggested that the complainants should embody their wishes in a petition to the Board. Measles is endemic at the North Surrey School; 35 cases have occurred there, but no death has taken place from this disease. One child is in a precarious state from noma (gangrenous destruction of the cheek), a disease generally supposed to depend upon impure atmosphere for its cause. The state of the infirmary at the above-mentioned school, though much improved, is still in an unsatisfactory state. Drains still exist under the infirmary buildings. These are, however, to be removed. The steam from the wash-house in the building at times still permeates the sick wards, and is not only prejudicial from its smell (the clothes of the sick children are washed here), but the fact that moisture is a well known medium for conveying infection renders it extremely objectionable that this arrangement should still be allowed to exist. The urinals attached to the infants' play-yard, as well as the closets, are also situate under and near to the windows of the infirmary, and are at times very offensive and detrimental to the health of the sick children. I have represented these and other matters to the Board of Management; but it is intended to erect immediately a larger play-room for the children at the end of the present building, thus impeding the free access of air to the infirmary, and to allow the urinals, &c., to remain in their present improper position. I think it therefore my paramount duty, as Officer of Health of the district, to mention these matters to you, and leave the responsibility in your hands. Blackheath.—Spencer Place. I have received complaints from some of the inhabitants here respecting an accumulation of refuse from a butcher's, poulterer's, and fishmonger's, which is at times allowed to remain too long here, and when removed is a most unpleasant nuisance and detrimental to health. This should be removed every morning or evening in a covered truck. The drainage of Camden Row is still progressing, and will be an important improvement. Much satisfaction is also shown at the improved state of some of the houses in Montpelier Vale, in consequence of the recent attention to drainage. Complaints of the state of Paragon Mews have again been made, and I think it is very important that a drain should also be constructed here. Lewisham.—It is, I think, important again to remind you that the water supply of parts of this district has been hitherto totally neglected. The want becomes more and more urgent, as in some part limited supplies are with difficulty procured, and the drainage of these localities, in other respects much improved, suffers from its absence, and is quite insufficient without it. Sandwell Place is in a state requiring the construction of a small sewer. Some of the cesspools in this locality are in an offensive and dangerous state. The boundary ditch at the south west side of Mr. Hadley's premises is in a tainted state, said to arise from the soil issuing from the houses called Church Terrace and Church Grove. This also adds to the contamination of the river. Sydenham.—Offensive openings still exist in the drain into the covered ditch between Round Hill and the Police Station. The offensive drainage in Wells Road requires attention. Offensive gullies still exist at the end of this road and in Jews' Walk. Offensive accumulations still exist in the ditches at the back of Park Road Terrace, Dartmouth Park. Steel's Cottages and Dartmouth Row are still undrained and offensive. Wellington Terrace, Wells Road, and four houses at the back, drain into an open ditch at the back of Elliot's Cottage, thence in open ditch by Hayes's strawberry grounds, and thence across Wells Road. Dolphin Inn and adjoining premises require proper drainage. The brewers (Messrs. Courage and Donaldson), have caused an old filthy pond to be filled in, and have thus cut off the communication of a drain from Miss Mayow's house. The drainage now runs over the surface into the open ditch, both which are very offensive and prejudicial to health. The privies at Jones's are in a very offensive state. At Mr. Wallis's, tailor, next to Dolphin Inn, the privy is overflowing and runs into Dolphin yard. 26 There is no drainage except that into open water course. The milk supply of some parts of this district is very inferior in quality; I have examined samples of it which are considerably reduccd with water, and probably by the abstraction of cream. The cows are in many instances constantly confined to stalls, are fed upon stimulating food, and live in an impure atmosphere. This, from injuring the animals' health, also deteriorates the quality of the milk. There can be no reason why, in this country district, cows should in the summer time be shut up at all. They ought to be constantly feeding in the open air. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected.

The remaining wards of the district are in a very healthy state. The deaths registered in the month from the 24th July to the 22nd August, have been 28. During the corresponding period in 1857, they were 41 in number. Six deaths have, however, taken place from epidemic disease, or in other words, disease called into activity by local causes, viz.:— Blackheath.—Fever, Camden Cottages. Diarrhœa, Essex Place. Lewisham.—Diarrhœa, Ladywell. Pcnge.—One noma, North Surrey Industrial School. Cynancha maligna, near the Crooked Billet. Sydenham.—Scarlatina, Peak Hill. No proper drainage exists here. Measles are still endemic at the North Surrey Industrial School, but no death has 27 taken placc from this cause, and the disease has declined in activity during the last few days. A mild form of diarrhoea is prevalent more or less in the whole district. Lewisham.—The drainage of Church Terrace, and numerous houses at the back, requires immediate attention. The overflow or soakage from the cesspools attached to the above-named houses communicates with a ditch connected with the river, the water of which is hence contaminated with sewage. A sewer is much required here. Hither Green Lane still requires connecting with the sewer. Some of the houses here are in a most unhealthy state. Sydenham.—The drainage of St. Germans Road is occupying the attention of the inhabitants resident there, as no sewer exists there, and drainage is thus impossible. This would be a desirable improvement if properly carried out. It is intended to lay plans before the Board for their approval. Pigs are still kept in an offensive manner in the Willow Road, and I can bear out the complaint of Mr. Short as regards this nuisance. The drainage of houses in High Street is gradually progressing. A block of houses (3 or 4) at the back of the Rock and Fountain are in an offensive state, and also require draining into the sewer. Russell Street also requires more efficiently draining. The gullies near Round Hill are still very offensive. Penge.—The drainage of the City of London Tavern, Anerley Road, requires attention. Also an overflowing cesspool next Coe's, West Kent Park. Offensive drainage at Mr. Leache's, Laurel Brook, Perry Vale. Drain from Albion Terrace running by Raglan Street. Want of drainage and dangerous cesspool at Mr. Wetherall's, near Forester Inn. The houses at Lower Sydenham require opening into the sewer. No drainage at present. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air.

One diptheria, Silver Street, Lewisham. One diarrhoea, Hope Cottages, Lewisham. One scarlatina, Silver Street, Lewisham. One diarrhoea, Camden Place, Lewisham. One scarlatina, Loampit Hill, Lewisham. The state of Merton Place (more especially the Greenwich end), I called your attention to some time back. Upper Sydenham is far from satisfactorily drained, even upon the line of sewer put in by the Commissioners some years back. The drainage of houses here should be completed before another summer. Bell Green I had several times to call your attention to last year, when scarlet fever was prevalent and carried off several persons. There is no proper drainage to houses here, although a sewer runs along in the old ditch by the side of the road. Loampit Hill is most imperfectly drained, and has no water supply. Rushey Green, although materially improved in drainage, and consequently in healthiness, has no water supply. I cannot sufficiently urge upon you the importance of completing the drainage of these localities by a proper supply of water, which it is in your power to order in every instance.

Seventeen males and 8 females have died between the 25th September and 23rd October, whereas 34 and 29 were registered in the years 1856 and 1857 respectively. Ten deaths have, however, taken place from epidemic disease, viz.:— Diptheria, Mount Nod Place, Blackheath. Ditto, Dartmouth House, Blackheath. Measles, Loampit Yale, Lewisham. Scarlatina, Stratford Place, Lewisham. Ditto, Vicar's Hill, Lewisham. Ditto, Dartmouth Cottages, Lewisham. Dysentery, King Street, Lewisham. Typhoid fever, Avenue Road, Lewisham. Diarrhoea, West Kent Park, Sydenham. Fever, North Surrey School, Penge. I wish to call your attention to the fact that the deaths from these diseases are quite out of proportion to the deaths from all causes in the district, and this indicates to my mind the necessity for carrying out the drainage of houses, as well as necessary main drainage, and promoting the cleanliness and, comfort of the poorer inhabitants by an adequate supply of water, as it is well proved in this district that diseases of the abovementioned kind may be occasioned and fostered by local contamination, even in an otherwise salubrious locality, such as that in which we live. This proves what has been previously well known in other less favoured places, that neglect of sanitary regulations cannot be permitted with impunity. The evident connection between zymotic disease and an impure atmosphere is not without its lesson. Scarlatina is somewhat prevalent in Lewisham. I have been called upon during the month again to examine the state of Sandwell Place ; some of the houses here are in a most offensive state from want of drainage, and I have no doubt that the soil is extensively saturated from percolation of sewage under the houses. This I pronounce to be very dangerous to health, and I think that it demands some attention. The block of houses in Hither Green Lane (Retreat) are also still insufficiently drained. Church Terrace and adjoining houses are also insufficiently drained, and contaminate the river. The undrained state of the court by the Crooked Billet, Penge, I have to notice, as my attention has been again called to it from a case of erysipelas, and another of scarlet fever, occurring in one family living in this place. I wish more particularly to direct your attention to this, as it is, I think, important that a drain should be made from the sewer now constructing, to receive the sewage of this and adjoining houses, draining into the ditch adjacent. The drainage of the houses now erecting at the back of the Forest Hill Chapel is not yet completed satisfactorily, as it is taken eventually from a 12 inch into a 6 inch pipe in the old ditch, which must, when the houses are inhabited, be insufficient. An open ditch at the back of some houses in Russell Street requires covering in for a few yards, as it is an offensive nuisance. 30 Complaints have been recently made also of the accumulation of refuse at back of Mr. Selmes's fishmonger, partly consisting of decomposing fish, which is a most offensive nuisance to the adjoining residents. Tables of mortality, &c., are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer. Prevailing winds.

This may be accounted for when I mention that 12 deaths have taken place from diseases of the respiratoy organs alone. Six deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, viz.:- One scarlatina, Vicar's Hill, Lewisham. Two ditto, St. John's Terrace, Lewisham. One ditto, Cross Street, Lewisham. One ditto, West Kent Park, Sydenham. And one from epidemic diptheria in a house adjoining a stable at Forest Hill. Scarlatina and measles are extremely prevalent in the district. My attention has again been called to the water supply of Lewisham, from the existence of epidemic disease in Cross Street, &c. Some of the houses here are in a dirty 31 state from insufficient drainage. The absence of water supply, and the difficulty of obtaining it in sufficient quantity rendering all attempts at cleanliness nugatory. I have, therefore, to request you will use the authority vested in the " Board of Works" to compel a proper supply of water, and thus remedy a great evil. In Russell Street, Sydenham, works are required, the drain in the roadway, which is altogether too superficial, having been broken in in several places. This is not only offensive and dangerous, but likely to block up the drainage from the houses, and therefore requires immediate attention. I have received several complaints respecting the gully opposite Mr. Stutter's, in the centre of Sydenham. This is a most offensive nuisance, and might be easily remedied. A drain at the end of Raglan Street is very offensive. The entire members of one family resident here have been affected with typhoid fever, attributed by the medical attendant to the lack of proper drainage. The drainage hitherto carried out at Penge is very incomplete, and it is most important that a drain should be carried to the Crooked Billet and beyond, to receive the sewage of the houses in this portion of the village, in which part I have had so repeatedly to call your attention to the existence of disease and mortality, attributable, in my opinion, to want of drainage. The Crystal Palace sewage in the green lane should also be received in a covered sewer; the quantity and offensive nature of the discharge from the mouth of the drain here positively require that something should be done, both for the protection of the inhabitants here as well as to save the river from the most filthy contamination. (A person resident in a house adjoining this district has had several attacks of typhoid fever). METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches.

Industrial School — — — - 1 1 Total 32 39 71 17 17 34 32 Gentlemen, During the five weeks ending upon the 25th of December, 71 births and 34 deaths have been registered. Thus from the Registrar's returns of mortality, and calculating also for increase of population, the state of the public health would assume a very favourable aspect, as in the four weeks ending upon the 26th December, 1856, 28, and in the five weeks ending upon 26th December, 1857, 32 deaths were registered. Upon analysis, however, it appears that only 9 of these deaths took place in Blackheath, Sydenham, and in Penge, therefore the mortality of Lewisham Village has been greatly above the average, 24 deaths having been registered in this sub-district alone, whilst the mortality at the Union Workhouse has been considerably below the average for this month, only one death having been registered. This mortality (in Lewisham Village) has principally occurred amongst the aged and infants; thus 10 deaths have occurred in children under 3 years of age, and 9 have occurred in those between the ages of 60 and 85. Taking the whole district, Ten deaths have occurred from diseases of the lungs. Seven deaths from diseases of the zymotic class. The localities in which these latter deaths have taken place will, most of them, be familiar to you, from my having repeatedly brought them under your notice as deficient in sanitary requirements, viz.:— One thrush, Raglan Street, Sydenham. One measles, West Kent Park, Sydenham. One croup, Hanover Street, Lewisham. One influenza, Lewisham Park, Lewisham. Three scarlet fever—One, Loampit Hill, Lewisham ; one, the Village, Lewisham; and one, Hanover Street, Lewisham. Measles has been extremely prevalent in the district, but is principally of a mild type. One death has been registered from this cause. Scarlet fever has also been somewhat prevalent. Three deaths have been registered from this cause. Influenza has been and is also somewhat prevalent. Three or four cases of diptheria have occurred, but they have been exported from the Metropolis, and recovery has taken place, though very slowly. The localities I have to request your attention to, for the promotion of the health and comfort of the population of the district, are as follows:— Blackheath.—Camden Row ; no water is supplied here for any purpose. The new drainage is ineffectual in consequence, and if it should be entirely blocked up, I anticipate serious illness. Bath Place requires attention. Montpelier Row is without proper drainage, and Paragon Mews is in the same state as when formerly brought under your notice. Lewisham.—The drainage of the houses in Hither Green Lane demands attention. No sewer exists here. The water supply of Rushey Green, Loampit Hill, Cross Street, and neighbourhood, is still in abeyance. Many of the evil results anticipated are occurring from this deficiency. Sydenham.—Opposite Sydenham College, Sydenham Park, a gully is required in the road. A great quantity of water always remains after rain-fall. Offensive gullies, rendered more dangerous from the absence of gratings, exist in West Kent Park, the drainage of which locality is most unsatisfactory. A sewer is required in St. Germains Road; sewage is running in the open street. The drainage of Scudder's Row, Willow Road, is in a most unsatisfactory state, both from want of proper sewer accommodation for the inhabitants in this locality, as well as for those residing in the main street above. Penge.—Offensive sewage in ditch running from Crystal Palace along the green lane by several houses. A ditch at the back of the houses in the main street is still very offensive and dangerous to health. This still empties, eventually, into the Ravensbourne river. Anerley.—A swamp, consisting principally of sewage, occupies many feet of surface 33 between the Crystal Palace property and the Anerley water. This is most offensive and dangerous to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood adjacent, as well as to the children occupying the North Surrey School; it is most offensive and prejudicial when the wind blows in that direction, as well as frequently at other times. The ditch by the side of the road, and bounding the North Surrey School grounds, is offensive from sewage being again poured into it. This was remedied at my request as far as the above-mentioned School lodge was concerned, but is now rendered again offensive by sewage from above. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

This is partly attributable to the Lewisham Ward, in which the mortality is still greater than usual. Although the temperature of the atmosphere for the month has been greatly above the ordinary temperature of January, the damp atmosphere and sudden alteration of temperature have acted severely upon delicate constitutions; thus 17 deaths have taken place in children under 5 years of age, and 7 in those above 60, whilst 8 deaths have taken place from inflammatory affections of the lungs. Measles and scarlatina have very much declined in severity during the month, and fewer cases have occurred for the last fortnight. Influenza continues to be prevalent, but no mortality has occurred from this cause. Diptheria has occasioned two deaths. 34 The following list will show you the mortality from epidemic disease, and the localities in which deaths have taken place from this cause; most of these localities will be known to you as almost the only places in which deaths occur from the above-named class of diseases, and which you will, I know, give me the credit of having repeatedly brought under your notice as requiring your order to carry out drainage, supply water, remove offensive accumulations, and otherwise promote the health of the population by sanitary measures. Thus 9 deaths have occurred from epidemic disease, viz.:— Hooping cough, Avenue Square, Lewisham. Malignant scarlet fever, Providence Place, Lewisham. Diptheria, Village, Lewisham. Ditto, Phoenix Place, Blackheath. Measles, Forest Hill, Sydenham. Ditto, Lower Sydenham. Ditto, Raglan Street, Sydenham. Ditto, Wells Road, Sydenham. Ditto, Wells Road, Sydenham. I consider it highly desirable for the safety of the public that the gullies in "West Kent Park should receive proper attention; not only a foul smell arises from these places, but the gratings are in several instances removed, and consequently very dangerous for passengers. The oozing of sewage into St. Germains Road still continues, and is very offensive and unsightly, besides being prejudical to health. The sewer is not carried sufficiently far up Russell Street to make it available for sewage; nor does it affect the part which was described as broken in, dangerous, and liable to cause obstruction, in my last report. Offensive sewage still runs along the road near Laurel Brook, Perry Hill, and is apparently caused by one house only. I think that in the absence of a drain, parties should be compelled to pump and remove sewage, or at all events, in a clay soil, deodorize, so that it should not contaminate the public roads. I have received a letter from Mr. Burton, surgeon, of Lee Park, relative to the inefficient drainage and want of water supply at Camden Place, Blackheath, and apprehending mischief if this is not remedied; but this I have already brought under your notice. The water supply for the whole of Lewisham will, I trust, also receive your earnest attention. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches.

Of the deaths 18 have occurred in children under 10 years of age, 8 between the ages of 60 and 80, and 2 between the ages of 80 and 90. The mortality is a little in excess of the average for the last four years, but less than that occurring during the same period of last year. Five deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, viz.:— One measles, Eliot Park Cottage, Sydenham. One scarlatina, Raglan Street, Sydenham. (Note, Registrar). One scarlatina and diptheria, Eliot Cottage, Blackheath. Two hooping cough after measles, "Willow Road. (See note of Mr. Crellin). More than ever convinced, by a recent inspection of the state of houses in Lewisham, I cannot but again urge upon the Board the necessity for a general water supply for the promotion of the health and comfort of the poorer part of the population of the district, especially those who live in the neighbourhood of Rushey Green and Loampit Vale. The drainage and general improvement of many localities also require your attention, as in Lewisham, Exchequer Place, near the office of the Board of Works, which is offensive and undrained. Avenue Square, where the character of the diseases and deaths which have taken place during the last few years indicates the necessity for drainage and general attention to sanitary laws. Hither Green Lane, where there are a great many houses with no system of drainage. I cannot too strongly urge the compulsory drainage of houses situate adjacent to the lines of main sewer. Many inhabitants residing in this advantageous position are still suffering from nuisance which is easily removable. In Penge—I have still to complain of the ditch which receives the offensive sewage from the Crystal Palace, and which should certainly be covered. Also of an accumulation of manure and offal in Mr. Wren's cow-yard. A person residing between these two nuisances is now suffering from typhoid fever, which I attribute to the above-mentioned nuisances. The drainage from Upper Norwood, distributed at the back of the houses in Anerley Vale, is still offensive and prejudicial to health. Sydenham.— Appended are two communications; one from Rev. Taylor Jones, respecting the accumulation of water opposite Sydenham College, and which I have already brought before your notice, requesting the construction of a gully for its removal into the main. One from Mr. Crellin, surgeon, complaining of the state of Willow Road, which is extremely filthy and unwholesome, notwithstanding the existence of a main drain, placed there by the Commissioners of Sewers some years back. A note is also appended by the Registrar concerning the offensive ditch at the end of Raglan Street. I have many times attracted your attention to this dreadful nuisance, close to the main sewer, and now that you have allowed four new houses to be drained into the same ditch, the evil must be greatly increased, to the danger and detriment of the inhabitants residing near. The mortality brought under your notice from epidemic disease in Raglan Street, and the disease always existing there, proves the necessity for some immediate step to be taken for the protection of the inhabitants. The dangerous and offensive gullies in West Kent Park require attention. C 36 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air.

The mortality registered being unusually large for this period, owing to the excess in Sydenham, in which ward the average of the past three years has been 7 only, but is this time more than double, viz., 16. The number of deaths registered arc (exclusive of Penge), 38. Seven deaths have occurred from epidemic disease, viz.:— One scarlet fever, Hurst Terrace, Blackheath Ward. One hooping cough, Lewis Grove, Lewisham. One ditto, Upper Sydenham. One ditto, West Kent Park, Sydenham. One ditto, Forest Hill, Sydenham. One measles, Raglan Street, Sydenham. One fever, Perry Hill, Sydenham. Twenty deaths have occurred in children under 6 years of age, and nine in those whose ages range from 60 to 85. Hooping cough is prevalent in the district. Measles also still continues, although much lessened in intensity. A few places in the district require to be brought under your notice, and to which I now request your attention. Orchard Place, midway between Lewisham and Sydenham, is situated below the level 37 of the main sewer. The houses here are very dirty, and a great quantity of refuse is thrown into a dirty pond near the houses, from which many of the inhabitants get their supply of water. There is no proper drainage here. A great quantity of offensive sewage runs from Verey's brewery and adjoining houses, at Lower Sydenham; this is offensive and prejudicial to health, and should be taken into the adjoining sewer, to prevent it reaching the Pool river, as it does at the present time. Sewage still flows into the open ditch at Ladywell, from the houses in front of which the sewer passes. The cow-yard occupied by Mr. Samuell, Blackheath Hill, contained upon a recent inspection of mine a great quantity of offensive manure, &c. This is situated in the midst of dwelling houses containing a pretty considerable population, and it should be entirely done away with, or the law enforced to compel the daily removal of a nuisance which is much complained of by the inhabitants.

This number is greater by 34 than that recorded in the previous year. But if allowance be made for the rapid increase of population in this district, moreover considerably augmented by the increasing resort of invalids and persons in a precarious state of health, we may, I think, come to the satisfactory conclusion that little or no proportionate difference exists between the mortality tables of 1857 and 1858. The deaths were divided as nearly as possible between males and females, 206 having occurred amongst the former, and 203 amongst the latter. 162 occurred in children under 5 years of age. 29 occurred in children between 5 and 10. 5 occurred in persons between 10 and 15. 7 ditto ditto 15 and 20. 25 ditto ditto 20 and 30. 21 ditto ditto 30 and 40. 31 ditto ditto 40 and 50. 34 ditto ditto 50 and 60. 36 ditto ditto 60 and 70. 60 ditto above 70 years. Deaths are most numerous at the extremes of life, nearly half in this district having occurred in children under 10 years of age, and rather less than one-fourth in those above 60 years of age, during the past year. From the tenderness and delicacy of C 2 38 infant life, it forms a most important test of the healthiness of particular neighbourhoods, as they most readily suffer from external agencies, which affect in a much less ratio the more acclimatized and hardened adults. It cannot but be observed by any experienced person, upon conning over the tables of mortality accompanying this report, that notwithstanding the comparative healthiness of this district, a number of deaths might (humanly speaking) have been prevented; that some were produced by causes which admitted of removal, whilst others occurred in the course of other complaints, the fatality perhaps of which might have been avoided by proper attention to sanitary regulations and sufficient nutriment. 97 deaths have occurred from zymotic disease. 69 from diseases of the organs of respiration. 22 from old age. 8 from violence. 49 from consumption and other tubercular diseases. The number of deaths registered in the different quarters of the year varied. 101 took place in the 1st quarter. 126 ditto in the 2nd quarter. 84 ditto in the 3rd quarter. 98 ditto in the 4th quarter. Thus, They were most numerous in the second quarter, when 30 deaths were registered from zymotic disease. 79 deaths occurred in the Blackheath Ward, an increase of 24 over last year (1857). 115 deaths occurred in Sydenham, a decrease of 3 over last year. 139 deaths occurred in Lewisham, an increase of 31 over last year. 35 deaths occurred in Penge, an increase of 1 over last year. 33 in the Union Workhouse, a decrease of 12 over last year. 4 in the North Surrey District School (Penge), a decrease of 10 over last year. 4 in the Watermen's Asylum, Penge, an increase of 3 over last year. It is to be remarked upon favourably that only 11 deaths have been registered from fever during the entire year. This disease has never affected us to any amount, but the number of deaths registered from this cause during the past year has been unusually small. The births which have taken place during the year in the district have numbered 691—342 males and 349 females; thus the excess of births over deaths has been 282. The sanitary labours of myself and your Inspector of Nuisances have been constantly carried on during the year, as you are aware, from the periodical reports and tabulated complaints brought before you from time to time. In many instances the result of work carried on by your order, or by communications or notices from the Board of Works, has been very satisfactory. As an instance of the great benefit to be derived from attention to sanitary laws, I may name the infirmary of the North Surrey District School. Once or twice I had to bring before you an account of the offensive and badly ventilated state of the infirmary, which was by degrees placed in a more satisfactory condition. Since this has been done, the mortality, which averaged for the last five or six years 16, or more than two per cent. upon the population of the School, has been reduced to the number of four ; this being in an establishment where the average number of children is 700, of ages varying from 2½ to 16 years, and notwithstanding an epidemic of measles which occurred in the spring. Although not so readily to be pointed out, I anticipate the same results from many of the improvements made in the district; I may instance The Kirkdale sewer, Sydenham. The improved sewerage of Penge and Anerley Vale. The sewer in Montpelier Yale, Blackheath. The sewer in the New Road, Lower Sydenham (Paxton Park). The sewer in Wells Road, Sydenham. The Forest Hill sewer. The improvement in Three Tuns Passage, Blackheath; and a multitude of minor local improvements. Much remains to be done, however, towards completing the work begun. The inhabitants of scores of houses situate upon the lines of sower so beneficially placed by your order, are not receiving the benefits which they might derive from complete drainage; 39 and a regular ledgered record of what is done in this way is, in my opinion, a thing of the greatest importance, as it is very difficult to obtain facts as to drainage from inhabitants, especially where, as in most badly drained houses, they are constantly moving. The water supply of the district has already received your consideration, therefore it is not necessary for me again to inform you of the necessity for a supply of water to complete a system of sewerage. I am happy to be able, however, to inform you of the improved quality of that from the Kent Waterworks Company, who obtain a large supply from an artesian well upon their premises at Deptford. The river still requires improvement, which must be done under the repeated orders of the Board of Works to prevent contamination to the stream. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, Medical Officer of Health. Sydenham, 31st March, 1859. 40 DEATHS DURING FOUR QUARTERS OF THE YEAR 1858.
