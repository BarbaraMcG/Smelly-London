Public Offices, East Ham, February, 1900. To the Chairman and Members of the East Ham Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Tenth Annual Report upon the health of the District of East Ham, and in doing so, to congratulate the District Council upon the fact, that in spite of increasing population with its attendant risks, the District still continues to occupy a prominent place amongst the healthier London suburbs. 6 The work of the Department in the abatement of nuisances continues to increase, and much work of a valuable and permanent character has been executed by the Inspectors during the year. General Sanitary Condition of the District. (a.) The population at the last Cenus (1891) was 32,710. The estimated population in January, 1899, was 79,640, this number being arrived at by counting the number of occupied houses. At the present time the number of occupied houses, and estimated population for the four Wards, are as follows:— Occupied Houses Empty Houses Houses in course of Construction Estimated Population Manor Park Ward 3,436 217 485 20,444 Plashet Ward 6,660 108 218 39,627 Central Ward 4,477 53 492 26,638 Beckton and North Woolwich Ward 946 7 11 5,628 15,519 385 1,206 92,337 (b.) The area of the District is 3,266 acres, and there are about 28 persons per acre, and 5.95 persons per inhabited house. (c.) The subsoil is sand and gravel, overlying the London clay, much of the District being marshy. (d.) The water supply is from the East London Water Works Company, and is mostly obtained-from deep wells; it is generally ample, and of good quality, and the amount used is about thirty gallons per head, per day. (e.) The system of sewerage is by water carriage; the sewage is collected by two large main sewers,' serving respectively the northern and southern parts of the District, which meet and discharge at the Pumping Station, Bonny Downs. It is there chemically treated, and precipitated in tanks, the effluent passing through filters, and thence into Barking Creek, the sludge being put on the land, where there is ample space. 7 (f) The principal industries are the Beckton Gas Works, and the products in connection therewith, there are also a large number of men in the south of the District, who work at the Royal Albert Docks; the building trades employ a great number, and the Urban District Council about 300; but the greater portion of the workers travel to London, as may be seen by the overcrowded condition of the trains both night and morning. The inhabitants appear healthy, and do not suffer from any special disease. (g.) The Thames forms the southern boundary, and the Roding the eastern boundary of the District, both rivers being tidal. (h.) No fresh Bye-laws have been adopted during the year. (i) In every new road the main sewer is laid, and the houses connected with it. (j.) Great attention has been given both by the Inspector and myself to the Bakehouses and Slaughter-houses, and they are mostly in a satisfactory condition. During the year 1899, the number of deaths registered for the District, was 1,201, excluding 41 who died in the West Ham Union, 3 in the Plaistow Infectious Diseases Hospital, and, calculated on a population of 80,000, this will give a death rate of 15 per 1,000 for the year. The number of births registered for the same period was 3,028—viz 1,605 males, and 1,423 females; this gives a birth- rate of 37.8 per 1,000. The following table will show the different rates of mortality in East Ham for each of the past three years, with those of England and Wales for 1899:— East Ham. England & Wales. 1897 I898 1899 1899 Death-rate per 1,000 living 13.7 14.3 15 18.3 Zymotic Death-rate per 1,000 living 2.6 2.7 3.2 2.2 8 Deaths of Infants. 44 per cent. of the total number of deaths from all diseases (1201) were those of children under one year of age, for out of a total of 3,028 born, 529 died before reaching the age of one year. The following table will record the ages at which the deaths occurred:— 1898. 1899. Deaths under 1 year of age 428 529 ,, over 1 „ and under 5 years 145 169 ,, ,, 5 years ,, 15 „ 44 50 ,, ,, 15 ,, ,, 25 ,, 29 47 ,, ,, 25 „ ,, 65 ,, 216 282 „ „ 65 „ 102 124 964 1,201 The deaths of children under one year of age are still very considerable. Many samples of milk have been taken by the Inspector for analysis, which will, I hope, help to secure good milk for these infants. Zymotic Death-Rate. Two hundred and fifty-seven deaths were recorded from the seven principal Zymotic Diseases, and estimated on a population of 80,000, gives a Zymotic Death-rate of 3.2 per 1,000 per annum, as compared with 27 per 1,000 for 1898. They were as follows:— 1898. 1899.

The number of Scarlet Fever cases notified during 1899, showed a large decrease, and were only of a very mild form, as is shown by the fact that only one death ensued. I have visited the Schools during the year on several occasions, and examined the children separately, and any suspicious cases were sent home, with any others living in the same house, and isolated. 12 DIPHTHERIA.

Twenty-two of these deaths were under 5 years of age, and 17 over 5 years, as against 219 cases recorded for 1898, which resulted in 23 deaths. In November I submitted the following reports on the free supply of Antitoxin, and the prevalence of Diphtheria:— 13 EAST HAM DISTRICT COUNCIL. Public Health Department. SPECIAL REPORT re DIPHTHERIA, Forwarded to Local Government Board in November. I beg to report that during the current year, 320 cases have been notified, as compared with 164 for the corresponding period of 1898. The cases have occurred in the different Wards as follows:— Manor Park. Plashet. Central. Woolwich. Total. January 3 15 9 — 27 February 10 11 5 — 26 March 6 14 19 — 39 April 3 4 4 1 12 May — 19 8 — 27 June 2 14 9 — 25 July 4 7 11 — 22 August 5 11 9 — 25 September 7 15 5 2 29 October 2 36 7 2 47 November* 5 33 1 2 41 47 179 87 7 320 *To 13th inclusive. The percentage of cases per 1,000 population in the respective Wards are as follows:— Manor Park Ward 2.93 Plashet Ward 5.11 Central Ward 3.78 Beckton and North Woolwich Wards 1.16 It will be seen that the Plashet Ward has suffered most, especially in the western part of the Ward, including Sherrard Road, 14 Halley Road, Strone Road, and South Esk Road. In these four roads there have occurred sixty-one cases, but they are exceptionally long roads, containing in all, over 1,000 houses, with a population of over 6,000 inhabitants. These roads have been newly made, and the houses recently built. The occupiers of these houses are people removing principally from the overcrowded parts of East London; the houses are occupied as soon as completed, and before they are thoroughly dry, or the streets made up These are conditions which lend themselves very considerably to the spread of the disease. Thirty-eight cases have been removed to Hospitals outside the District. Of the 320 cases notified, 28 have terminated fatally. In every case the premises have been inspected, drains tested, and general instructions given as to isolation, etc., day and Sunday schools have been notified, and instructions given that no children from infected houses should be admitted to school; disinfectants have been supplied gratis, and houses fumigated at the termination of the disease. Librarians and Pawnbrokers are kept acquainted with the whole of the infected houses in the District. The Council decided in February to distribute Diphtheritic Serum, free on application, in all cases of Diphtheria occurring within the District. Taking twelve months prior to the free distribution of Antitoxin, there occurred within the District 229 cases, resulting in 22 recorded deaths, being equal to 9.6 per cent. of deaths. Since February 1899, the date that the free distribution commenced, there have been notified 293 cases, resulting in 24 recorded deaths, being equal to 8.19 per cent. of deaths. It will be observed that since the free distribution of Antitoxin, there has been a decrease of 1.41 per cent. of deaths. In consequence of the large number of cases occurring within 15 the Borough of West Ham, they have been compelled to suspend the arrangement which enabled East Ham to send their Diphtheria patients into the West Ham (Borough) Isolation Hospital. The Council subsequently arranged with the Plaistow District Nurses Home, to send trained nurses to take charge of patients in their homes, where efficient nursing was not provided. The Council have taken premises in the centre of the District, large enough for twelve beds, and the necessary staff, and are now busy furnishing and fitting the premises for the reception of patients, which will be ready in about fourteen days.

Since 1st January, 1899, to 30th October, 1899, 280 cases 16 have occurred, resulting in 23 recorded deaths, being equal to 8.21 per cent. of deaths. The Council decided in February, 1899, to distribute Antitoxin free on application in all cases of Diphtheria, and since that date 253 cases have been notified, resulting in 20 deaths, or being equal to 7.9 per cent. of deaths. It will be observed from the above figures, that since the distribution of Antitoxin, there has been a decrease of 2.95 per cent. of deaths. One hundred and three patients have been treated with Serum at home, using 232 doses, at a cost of £28. Nine patients died at home after treatment. Ten removed to Hospitals after inoculation. Eighty-five recovered. (Signed) A. W. BEAUMONT, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. On 21st November the Council sanctioned the use of a building known as Clock House for the purpose of a Diphtheria Hospital, which I am sure will be of great benefit to the district. The first patients were admitted on 30th January, 1900. This arrangement entirely does away with the agreement with the West Ham Corporation, by which we used to send our Diphtheria cases to their Plaistow Infectious Diseases Hospital. 17 TYPHOID FEVER.

The majority of the cases were of a mild type; hence the small number of deaths (16) in proportion to the number of cases (92), 25 cases were removed to Hospital. In every case the residence of the patient was examined as to the sanitary condition of the external drainage, as also the drains inside the house, and the water supply used for domestic purposes, and also that used for flushing the w.c. Enquiries were also made as to the food and milk supply. The sum of £6 17s. was paid as compensation for bedding destroyed after this disease. Diarrhcea. One hundred and thirty-nine deaths were attributed to Diarrhœa; 137 of these were under the age of five years, and 2 over, and most of the deaths occurred during July, August and September. It appears to me that the higher the temperature and the 18 longer it lasts, the greater the mortality amongst infants from this complaint. To prevent the recurrence of this mortality, I should advise the frequent flushing of sewers, and the ventilation of them ; the earth beneath the house should be covered with an impervious stratum of cement, so as to prevent any gases rising into the house. Strict supervision should be given to the food supply, especially milk, as this is the main food of these infants. Measles. Thirty-eight deaths were registered from Measles, as against 33 for the year 1898. There was a slight epidemic in the Central Ward, during May and June, in consequence of which I visited the Schools in the affected area, and advised the closing of the Infants' Departments of High Street, Plashet Lane and Lathom Road Board Schools for a period of 14 days from 1st June. This was done, and the epidemic abated. Phthisis. There were 57 deaths during the year, being equal to a death rate of .712 per 1,000 per annum, as compared with 50 deaths for the preceding year or a death-rate of .714. Phthisical patients should be isolated, and all expectorations carefully disinfected and destroyed. Much harm is done by carelessly depositing sputa on carpets, etc., where it dries, and the bacillus, set at liberty, is transmitted by the wind to favourable grounds for cultivation. Cows should be periodically subjected to an examination by a Veterinary Surgeon, for Tuberculosis. Milk should be frequently examined for bacillus. Influenza Still continues amongst us, being marked by its severity during November and December. 19 Small Pox. No cases of Small Pox were reported during 1899. An arrangement with West Ham Corporation has been made by which we are enabled to send any cases, should they occur, to their Dagenham Hospital, which was opened in May last. Puerperal Fever. Nine cases were reported, resulting in five deaths, as against 4 cases last year, and one death The houses and drains were inspected, and every precaution taken by isolation and disinfection to prevent recurring cases, and the nurses are cautioned not to take lying-in cases for a certain period. The sum of £7 9s. has been paid to mid-wives as compensation for loss of employment in this manner. Notification of Infectious Diseases. I have made returns each month to the Essex County Council, and weekly to the Local Government Board, of the number of fresh cases notified in the district. During the year the sum paid to Medical Practitioners for notifications of Infectious Diseases, amounted to £128 12s. Offensive Smells. Several complaints of this description came before us, for which Notices were served to remedy, and the nuisance abated; and there have also been complaints referring to the smells arising from the surface ventilators, so I would advise that more up-cast ventilating shafts should be erected. Buildings. A large amount of building is still going on (about 2,000 houses per year), as will be seen by the increase of population. New roads are constantly being made, a long time elapses before they, are taken over, and, being used for traffic, so quickly get into 20 a bad, insanitary state by the water, rubbish, &c., remaining on the surface; and I believe that this accounts for a great many cases of Diphtheria, for many of our first cases are reported from houses in these new roads. Bakehouses. Together with Mr. Banks, the Chief Inspector, I visited the Bakehouses in the District. So far as known, we have 33 Bakehouses—18 on ground floor, and 15 underground—and with a few exceptions they are generally kept in a satisfactory condition. Isolation Hospital. Our Isolation Hospital is of corrugated iron, and contains three wards, with thirty beds. One hundred and forty-seven cases of Scarlet Fever were treated in this Hospital during the year, and there were no casualties. A site has been procured in the District for the erection of a permanent Isolation Hospital, which I hope will soon be proceeded with. Rancliffe House Convalescent Home. One hundred and twenty-two patients have been drafted from the Isolation Hospital to the Convalescent Home during the year. Here also no deaths occurred. Sanitary Department. Our Sanitary Staff consists of a Medical Officer of Health, Chief Inspector of Nuisances, two Assistant Inspectors, Sanitary Clerk, Dust Inspector, and Disinfecting Man. The routine work of the Department is carried on in a very efficient and methodical manner, and a great deal of work has been done during the year. (Signed) A. VV. BEAUMONT, B.A., M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 21 Inspector of Nuisances Annual Report. To the Chairman and Members of the East Ham District Council. Gentlemen, I herewith beg to place before you my Fifth Annual Report of the work accomplished by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year ended 31st December, 1899. Inspection of the District and Removal of Nuisances. In compliance with complaints lodged, notifications of Infectious Diseases received, house-to-house inspections, &c., 4,303 primary inspections were made in the District, as compared with 3,751 for the year ended 31st December, 1898. Of the 4,303 inspections:— 734 were made in the Manor Park Ward. 1,347 „ ,, Plashet Ward. 1,616 ,, „ Central Ward. 606 „ „ Beckton and North Woolwich Ward. Details and particulars of the above inspections are entered in the Inspector's Journal. At 64 per cent. of the premises inspected, various works of sanitary amendment were required to be executed, to put the houses into a sanitary condition. There have been 5924 nuisances discovered in the course of the inspections made, the nature of which manifest the need of the house-to-house inspections, which have been systematically carried out in many parts of the District, One thousand nine hundred and sixty written Preliminary Notices were served, and in cases where the provisions were not complied with the serving of 119 Statutory Notices was necessary. In nine cases legal proceedings were instituted and Magistrates' Orders obtained; but this course is seldom found necessary, as the persons on whom Notices are served know (some of them from experience) that it is to their advantage to comply with the provisions therein contained. 22 Return of Proceedings taken under the Public Health and East Ham Improvement Acts.

Fined £1 & costs, or 14 days imprisonment. 23 It will be noticed that the nuisances discovered are in excess of the Notices served; this is owing to the fact that one Notice will call for the abatement of several nuisances, and in many instances personal interviews were obtained, and the required works executed by the respective persons liable.

Special attention has been given to ascertain and remedy this form of nuisance. It invariably occurs with the poorest inhabitants, and in those districts where the rents are highest. In the early part of the year a house-to-house inspection was made throughout the North Woolwich and Beckton Ward (south of Royal Albert Docks), and in several instances flagrant cases were discovered to exist. Notices were served, and the numbers reduced, but it frequently happens that a labourer in casual employment will muster ten and upwards in family, and owing to his unfortunate circumstances, is compelled to live in two or three rooms, it will be seen that to cause this man to leave one house, frequently means that he moves into another under worse conditions. The best remedy for overcrowding is the erection of municipal dwellings, and let at moderate rents. At the time the house-to-house inspections were made, there was not an empty house in the whole Ward. There were 490 houses, with an average of five rooms, and 7 "31 persons per house. Dairies and Cowsheds. There are 15 Registered Cowsheds and 96 Dairies in the District. During the year, 31 dairymen and purveyors of milk have been added to the Register; 327 inspections were made, and particulars entered in the " Dairies and Cowsheds Register." The general condition of the dairies is satisfactory, but to keep them so they require constant attention. Slaughter-houses. There are 16 Licensed Slaughter-houses in the District, which have been periodically inspected and kept under regular supervision, and I am glad to report that the owners have always been willing to adopt any suggestions made for keeping these places in a sanitary condition, and with a few exceptions they are kept so. An application for the premises, No. 65, High Street North, to be licensed, was granted provisionally by the Public Health Committee, subject to satisfactory alterations being carried out. 25 Factories and Workshops Act. The premises under the regulations of the above Acts have been periodically visited, and, speaking generally, may be considered in a satisfactory condition; in a few cases a word of warning had to be administered. The Laundries and Bakehouses have received attention, and where any infringement of the Acts were discovered, Notices were served and their provisions complied with. Drain-testing. During the year, 829 drains were tested by chemicals, smoke, and water, and in 178 cases defects were discovered to exist, principally in the traps. In each case steps were immediately taken to procure the amendment of such defects. Much good work continues to be done in this direction. Complaints. Four hundred and twenty-nine complaints have been received — 311 written and 118 verbal. Many of them proved, on examination, to be frivolous, and others beyond the jurisdiction of the Sanitary Authority; others had been made from sheer vindictiveness, whilst many were perfectly justifiable. There are many persons with confused ideas as to what are the functions of a Sanitary Inspector, applications being frequently made for the ejectment of an undesirable lodger or neighbour, &c. A large number of anonymous letters containing various complaints have been received, and in a few instances neither the name nor the number of any street was given, in consequence of which they could not be traced. The rule of the Department is to investigate every complaint made, and personally I think that it is preferable that a few anonymous, frivolous complaints should be investigated, than run the risk of neglecting one that may turn out to be of a serious character. 26 Market Places. The Market Places and Stalls have been under the observation of the Sanitary Inspectors daily, and especially on Saturday nights. On several occasions unsound food has been discovered and destroyed by the owner in the presence of the Inspector. Several trunks of fish and barrels of crabs have been destroyed at owners' requests. Infectious Diseases. Nine hundred and twelve notifications of Infectious Diseases were received during the year, and particulars entered in the Infectious Diseases Register. Each house has been visited immediately on receipt of the notification : a printed form of precautions has been handed to the Householder, and directions given as to Isolation, &c., and Disinfectants have also been freely distributed. The premises have been inspected and drains tested in all cases, and where defects were proved to exist a Notice has been served on the responsible person and the work carried out under the supervision of the Department. Two hundred and twenty-two infectious cases have been safely removed to Hospitals during the year. The Head Teachers of the Day Schools and the Superintendents of the Sunday Schools are advised of all cases of Infectious Disease occuring at houses at which scholars reside who are attending their respective Schools; they are further informed when the house has been fumigated and when the children may resume School. Schools. The Elementary Schools in the District are periodically visited and examinations made of the Sanitary appliances. In some cases it has been necessary to call the attention of the School Managers to irregularities. 27 Gipsies and Tent Dwellers. We occasionally receive visits from these unwelcome guests, but during the past year they have not annoyed us to the same extent as on previous years, this is accounted for by causing their speedy removal when they do arrive, and making them generally uncomfortable. It must be expected that we shall always have them with us while there is vacant land for them to pitch upon, seeing that our district is in such close proximity to London, and the Hop and Fruit fields of Kent, which suits their convenience for business purposes, but with the aid of Police and horse, we must endeavour to keep them moving, it occupies much time and patience, and often incurs work of a dangerous and unpleasant character. Urinals. The Public Urinals in East Ham are daily cleansed by a man specially appointed for that duty, and during the past year have been kept in a satisfactory condition The Private Urinals are a nuisance, and much trouble has been experienced in compelling the owners to keep them clean, and in a sanitary condition. Remo\ al of Dust and House Refuse. For the purpose of this work, the District is divided into six sub-Districts. Two carts and three men work the District near the Shoot, and three carts and four men in the Districts that have to cart the dust the greater distance. It is so arranged that whilst one cart is filling, the others are travelling to the Shoots, and by this method very little time is lost, We havf 15 carts and 23 m^n at this work, and a responsible Dust Foreman who reports to me. During the past year very few complaints were received, and the work has proceeded satisfactorily, and taking into consideration the phenomenal growth of the District, and the great tax put 28 upon this department of the work, it has been creditably dealt with. The weekly pail system continues to give satisfaction. I am hoping in the near future to see properly constructed tip-covered ^ans at work collecting the dust, as this would greatly facilitate the collection. I have to again mention that there are a large number of householders who refuse to place their dust outside their doors ready for the dustmen to collect, necessitating the going through the houses, which causes much loss of time and delay in the collection. During the year, 616 Notices have been served on owners to supply portable iron dust-bins. In 470 cases they were complied with, but in 149 instances the District Council did the work of providing them, and recovered the costs from the owners. Number of Loads removed from Manor Park Ward.

In January a Conference was held in London, under the auspices of the Metropolitan Committee of the Essex County Council, when a resolution was carried approving the action of the local authorities who were carrying out the provisions of the above Acts, and suggested that every urban district within the Metropolitan area should follow their example. It was further agreed that the Essex County Council should assist in defraying the expenses of working the Acts. Eighty-nine samples have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, which revealed 24 of them to be adulterated, being equal to 2 6.96 per cent, of adulteration. Of the 89 samples taken, 38 were taken on Sundays, 17 of which proved to be adulterated, being equal to 4473 per cent, of adulteration; while of the 51 samples taken on week-days, only 7 proved to be adulterated, being equal to 1372 percent, of adulteration, showing a difference in Sunday adulteration of 31'oi per cent. These figures speak for themselves, proving the necessity for Sunday sampling. In January I purchased half a pound of butter from a shop in Romford Road, and when the butter was about to be divided, Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The number and nature of samples of Food taken.

He was summoned for refusing to sell under the 17 th section Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. The magistrates convicted, and inflicted a fine of 40s. and costs. The vendor, being dissatisfied with the magistrates' decision, appealed to the Superior Court. The case was stated and heard by Mr. Justice Day and Mr. Justice Lawrence on the 9th and 10th of June, when their Lordships upheld the finding of the magistrates, and dismissed the appeal with costs against the appellant. This decision is of vital importance to the successful working of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act; for it will be seen that if a vendor had a right to seize the article already sold, when he discovered for what purpose it had been purchased that it would be essential for the Inspector to go through a specific physical training in order to successfully carry out his duties. In March, I stopped a milkman, and asked for a pint of milk. The vendor measured me a pint from a small can in his barrow. Feeling sceptical as to the contents of a large churn, I desired to be served from it; but Mr. Milkman said "No." He was summoned for refusing to sell from a particular can which contained an article being sold as food, convicted, and fined £5 and costs. It will be seen that this was an important decision; for what would be more easy than for fraudulent milkmen to carry a small quantity of "pure" ready for the Inspector, and at the same time be trading with a mixture of milk and water. A third conviction for refusing to sell was obtained against a milkman, who, after serving the milk, refused to take the money, stating that the milk was a gift. He was fined 40s. for being too generous. It will be seen from the tabulated list of prosecutions that the Warranty and Time Limit Clauses have caused us to have two cases dismissed, and are a great hindrance to the effectual working of the Acts. The defendants were under no obligation to inform us that they held Warranties, neither did they until the 28 days (time limit) had expired. 31 It is provided in the Act of 1899, that the Warranty defence shall not hold good unless seven clear days' notice is given to the purchaser of such intention, with the name and address of the Warrantor. But even this will be of little service to us, for proceedings must be instituted and summonses served within 28 days, and not heard within 14 days from date of service. It frequently happens that 18 or 20 days elapse before the result of the analysis is known. The vendor must have the summons 14 clear days and is only called upon to give 7 days' notice that he holds a Warranty. It is apparent that even under the new Act the 28 days limit will have disastrous effect in prosecutions against the Warrantors. One would like to have seen in cases where the Warranty defence was to be available the 28 days limit suspended or extended. In July four milkmen were summoned— two for abstracting one-fourth and one-fifth respectively of the orginal cream from the milk, and two for adding n per cent, and 12 per cent, of water respectively. In the cases of abstracting the cream, the Bench convicted, inflicting a fine of twenty shillings and costs in both cases ; but in the two cases of the added water the Bench dismissed the summonses, considering the offence too trivial to convict. Against this extraordinary decision an appeal to the Superior Court was made. The cases were heard at the Queen's Bench Division, and argued before Mr. Justice Bucknill and Mr. Justice Channel, who decided that the magistrates should have convicted and sent the cases back with an order to convict. This result is most satisfactory, as it establishes the fact that the Analyst's Certificate is bona-fide evidence. It is gratifying to note that in all three appeal cases we were successful. 32 TABULATED LIST of ADULTERATIONS and PROSECUTIONS. Number of Sample. Where Purchased. Date. Article Sampled.
