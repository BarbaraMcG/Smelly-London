REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR 187 8-79, and REPORTS of THE MEDICAL OFFICER, ANALYST, AND SURVEYOR; Also Accounts in Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board during the same period. Printed in accordance with section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. The Metropolitan Board of Works introduced into Parliament early in the present Session " A Bill to amend the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, so far as relates to the protection of the Metropolis from floods and inundations caused by the overflow of the River Thames." The Bill being of a similar character to that of 1877, save in matters of detail, and founded on the principle of charging local authorities and waterside owners with the expense of any works which the Metropolitan Board might deem necessary to prevent inundations, it was resolved to oppose the same, and also to memorialize the Home Secretary upon the subject. Accordingly a Memorial was drawn up and presented to the Right Honourable R. A. Cross, M.P., calling his attention to the fact that the Metropolitan Board, in the present Bill, had failed to adopt the ' Thames River , (Prevention of ' Floods) Bill. 4 recommendation of the Select Committee of 1877 as to the incidence of taxation, and praying him to use his influence to procure the insertion of a clause for giving effect to such recommendation; and shortly afterwards the Right Honourable Gentleman placed himself in communication with the Metropolitan Board and a considerable amount of correspondence ensued. The Bill was read for the second time on the 28th February, and referred to a Select Committee of eleven members, six of whom were appointed by the House of Commons and five by the Committee of Selection: two were subsequently added, making the total number thirteen. The Committee met under the Chairmanship of the Right Honourable "W. E. Forster, and Counsel were heard on behalf of the promoters and various opponents of the Bill; Mr. Bidder, Q.C., appearing, as on the former occasion, on behalf of this Board; ultimately, (after numerous sittings) on the 12th May, the Chairman announced that the Committee had decided on passing the preamble of the Bill on the understanding that a clause, submitted by Sir James M'Garel-Hogg on behalf of the Metropolitan Board, and designed to meet certain objections raised by the opponents of the Bill, should be inserted; such clause being to the effect that nothing in the Bill should authorize that Board to direct the execution of any works other than were necessary for the protection of lands within the limits of the Bill from floods and damage caused by the overflow of the Thames; and that the Metropolitan Board should have no authority to prescribe works for any other purpose under the proposed Act; or for embankments similar in character to those previously executed under a special Act of Parliament. It was also announced, in reply to a question of Mr. Bidder, that the Committee had resolved to leave the incidence of taxation as it stood in the Bill; thereby casting the expense of the necessary works on the ratepayers and owners of property in waterside districts, and reversing the decision of the Select Committee of 1878. 5 By order of the Committee specifications and estimates of works considered necessary by the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board in the St. Saviour's district have been lodged, amounting to £2,600. The Bill has passed the House of Commons and been read a second time in the House of Lords and referred to a Select Committee of that House, but this Board has not thought it necessary to incur the expense of any further opposition. Parliamentary Plans and Notices were, in November last, deposited of " South London Tramways," " South Metropolitan Tramways," and "London Tramways Extensions," by which several schemes it was intended to lay down new or extended lines in Stamford Street and Southwark Street. A Memorial was received from inhabitants of Southwark Street objecting to the proposal on account of the obstructions which would be occasioned to the loading and warehousing of goods and to the traffic generally, and it was resolved to oppose the Bills. Finding this to be the case the several promoters withdrew their Bills and abandoned the schemes so far as the district of St. Saviour's was concerned. Street Tramways. This Board has agreed to purchase of Mr. Stidder, Sanitary Engineer, occupying premises on the east side of Little Guildford Street, his interest as Lessee in the strip of land in front of the premises, lately enclosed by iron railings, for the sum of £200, for the purpose of widening the carriage-way at the spot. It has also been agreed to purchase of Mr. Heath, Lessee of premises on the south side of Orange Street, a strip of land in front of the same, for the sum of £90, for the widening of the foot-path. The consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners,—the freeholders has in each case been obtained. Improvements! Having been invited by the Westminster Board of Works to appoint delegates to consider the policy and expenditure of the School Board for London, this Board has appointed Messrs. Thorn, Evans, and Hunt, as its representatives to confer with other local School Boardl Policy and Ex-| penditure. 6 authorities and agree, if possible, upon some united course of action, with a view to checking the vast and increasing expenditure of that Board. Co-operative Stores. This Board also at the request of the Westminster Board of Works, has appointed Messrs. Boulden & Chappell as delegates to consider the subject of Crown Servants conducting trades, and as the result of the labours of the Conference, the question has been brought before the House of Commons, and a Select Committee appointed to investigate the matter. Water Companies' Charges The Board, on the invitation of St. Martin's Vestry, has appointed Messrs. Hale & Hideal as delegates to consider the enormously increased charges of the Southwark and Vauxhall, and other Water Companies, for water supplied by them, and a Memorial has been presented to the Home Secretary praying for inquirv. Hospitals or Infectious Diseases. Several communications having being received from Limehouse and other Boards and Vestries of the Metropolis on the subject of providing Hospital accommodation for persons suffering from infectious disease, this Board appointed as delegates, Messrs. Tuohn & Back, and Mr. Biancitt, its Medical Officer, to attend a proposed Conference at the Cannon Street Hotel; after several meetings, on 18th June, 1878, a resolution was passed as follows:— That, in the opinion of this Conference, many almost insurmountable obstacles present themselves to the carrying out by the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, of the powers conferred upon them by Sect. 87 of the Sanitary Act, 1866; and it is further of opinion, that it is desirable that provision should be made by Act of Parliament for one Authority, acting for the whole Metropolis, to provide Hospital accommodation for non-paupers suffering from contagious disease. This Board concurred in the above resolution, and expressed an opinion that the authority so proposed to bo constituted, should be us far as possible, representative. Subsequently a Memorial was prepared and presented to the Home Secretary, in accordance with the views expressed in the above resolution. 7 This Board, at the suggestion of the Phoenix Gas Company, has sanctioned the placing experimentally of improved gas lights at the Sanctuary on the southern approach to London Bridge, and at the crossing near Duke Street, similar to those in the Waterloo Road. The estimated cost of the one at the Sanctuary is £33 10s. per annum. Improved Lighting. Fresh Contracts for Sewer and Drainage work, Pavior and Masons' work, and Cleansing, Dusting, and Watering, have been entered into, as will be seen on reference to the list of Contracts at page 39, post, the former Contracts having expired. Contracts. This Board, as mentioned in the last Annual Report, resolved to co-operate with St. George's Vestry in a joint application to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the adoption of a transverse in lieu of a longitudinal boundary line at the junction of the two parishes in the Southwark Bridge Road, for the purposes of paving, watering, and cleansing, pursuant to Section 140 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, and an order to that effect has since been received. Boundary Liil Southwark I Bridge Hoail Precepts have been issued by this Board during the year 1878-9 for amounts required to meet the estimated local expenditure, and the charges of the Metropolitan Board of Works and School Board for London, as under, viz. :— Precepts.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour, once more to place before you, a summary of the sanitary measures adopted by this Board and its Officers, during the past year, and the statistics of disease and death for the same period, by which the health of the population is usually tested, and I beg to offer a few customary observations by way of elucidation of the principal facts, which will enable you more easily to understand the tables which are appended. The registered number of deaths which occurred in Christ Church was 340, and in St. Saviour's 329, making a total of 669 deaths. The total number of births was 1,086, comprised in the following details:— Christ Church Males 285 Females 238 523 St. Saviour' Males 296 Females 267 563 1,086 The apparent higher mortality in Christ Church, is caused by the workhouse being situated there, which is filled with aged and infirm men, of the total number who died there, namely 71, 51 were between 60 and 80 years of age, and 12 between 80 and 90. The following is a statement of all the deaths which occurred from various causes during the year. 10 CHRIST CHURCH. first quarter. second quarter. third quarter. fourth quarter. total.

And in the parish of St. Saviour's ,small-pox 1, measles 11, scarlet fever 6, diphtheria 1, whooping cough 22, diarrhoea 14—total 55. 11 It will be remarked that one death only occurred in the district from small-pox, it is, however, only fair to state, that a very large number of cases of small-pox were promptly removed to the Small-pox Hospital, and that some of them died. I wish the Board to understand that a large proportion of these cases were of the non-pauper class, which were as readily removed by the relieving officers, as those that were, and these gentlemen deserve the warmest thanks for their kind co-operation. I believe we very narrowly escaped the introduction of typhus fever into the district. The following are the facts :— A family named Austin came to reside in Orange Court sometime in November, on the 21st and 25th the parents and two children were removed to the Stockwell Fever Hospital, stricken with typhus; so virulent was the poison, that on the 4th December the parents and elder daughter were dead. They had previously resided in King Street, Mint Street, where an infant named Bache had been ill with typhus, and whose bed-linen the mother of the Austin family had washed, and thereby caught the disease. I immediately directed every article of furniture to be burnt, disinfected thoroughly the house, and happily, by these means prevented the disease from spreading. No fresh case has since occurred in any part of the district. The disinfectants which were employed were, sulphur and bichromate of potassium. In Christ Church there were 11 deaths from violence, and 14 in St. Saviour's, 20 inquests were held in Christ Church, and 17 in St. Saviour's. I take this opportunity of stating that 24 bodies have been removed from the district to the Mortuary since it was erected by the board, and that all opposition to its use has stopped,—indeed, now that we have experienced the advantages which it affords, it appears impossible to believe we could have managed without it. In the following tabulated statement I would direct your attention to the ages of those who died during the year, 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH—Population at Census, 1871, 14,573.

In St. Saviour's 100 died undor 1 year of age, 89 betwoen 1 and 20, 42 between 20 and 40, 45 between 40 and 60, 43 between 60 and 80, and 10 between 80 and 100. Again, the most striking feature of the Report is the high rate of mortality amongst infants under 1 year of age, amounting in Christ Church to 83, and in St. Saviour's to 100 deaths. As I have pointed out in a former Report, such a high rate of mortality is a fearful waste of human lifo. It is a painful part of my duty to be compelled to dwell from time to time upon a subject so deeply to be deplored, but I do not hesitate to say that a largo number of these infant lives would have been spared, had they been properly cared for by their parents, as a great proportion of tho deaths were caused by diseases which are induced by insufficient food and clothing, neglect, and exposure. In the tabulated statement of Sanitary Works, completed during the year, you will find no less than 2,055 complaints were made of non-removal of dust. In some instances, where dust receptacles are close to dwelling-rooms, this is a serious nuisance, and is certainly prejudicial to health. I hope more efficient arrangements will be made for its removal in future. Water Supply. I have made analytical and microscopical examinations of the water supplied to the district during the year, and, as a result, beg to report that it has been abundant in quantity and fairly good in quality. I have found on two occasions living organisms in the water supplied by the Lambeth Company. At the present time 15 tho subject of the enormous increase of the cost of water, amounting in many parishes to over 100 per cent., has assumed such a serious aspect, as to call for a meeting of delegates from the District Boards and Vestries. This increase has been produced by the legislation of 1852, which permitted charges for water to be based upon rateable value, and, as the rateable value of property is increasing, there is urgent need of some action being taken to obtain some uniform system of managing and of regulating these Companies. I trust I shall be pardoned for alluding to this matter, inasmuch as the sanitary condition of the people depends very much upon an ample supply of water being afforded them, and any restriction which may be caused by the increased cost of water, must affect the health of the people. I have advocated in my former Reports that a constant supply in lieu of an intermittent service is urgently needed, and I hope this important feature will be borne in mind in any discussion that may take place. Gas Examination. The average illuminating power of the Gas supplied by the Phoenix Company, as tested by Letheby's Photometer, according to the requirements of the Metropolis Gas Act, was equal to 14-5 sperm candles. The highest illuminating power was equal to 15-3, and the lowest 14-2 candles. The proportion of Ammonia in the Gas has never reached the proscribed quality of 2'5 grains for 100 cubic feet of Gas. Sulphuretted Hydrogen was never detected. I have thus shortly indicated the points of interest suggested by the records of the events and precedings of the past year. The favourable sanitary condition of the district may be c 2 16 easily tested by an examination of the appended tables, and I trust you will consider them sufficiently interesting for perusal and comparison. In conclusion, I have to thank the Board and its Officers for their kindness and courtesy during the past year. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 25, Stamford Street, June, 1879. 17 SAINT SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT.—Population at Census, 1871, 30,250. Area in Statute Acres, 203.

TO THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS. Gentlemen, In the past year I have examined 108 articles of food, and nine in duplicate, therefore 117 in all. Milks amount to 60 in number, and of these nine were adulterated, or at the rate of nearly 15 per cent. This is a great improvement and I record it with pleasure. One case was of unusual interest, as the Vendor of No. 71 had attempted the substitution of a false sample. Thinking that the case would be decided at Somerset House by the milk left with him, he boldly challenged my analysis and insisted upon his sample being forwarded to Somerset House. Mr. Errington's sample was found by the Government Chemists to be similar to mine and the Magistrate at the Southwark Police Court imposed a heavy fine for the attempted fraud. It is worthy of record, that the Chemists at Somerset House had given the case as an adulteration with at least 22 per cent., that which I had given as 24 per cent. The milk was more than three weeks old, and the judgment is formed on the hypothesis of a regulated deterioration. This is the first occasion, according to the "Analyst," that so perfect an agreement has been come to between the Government Chemists and the Public Analysts. We have only had two really bad cases of milk adulteration in the year ending Lady-day 1879, a wonderful contrast between the time when the Act was first passed, and the present. Besides the 60 milks, I have analysed one sample of Norwegian Condensed Milk and one Anglo-swiss. Considering how very largely these milks are used by mothers, I hold it as a 20 matter of some importance to examine them occasionally. This particular sample of Norwegian milk, although not adulterated, was too cheesy to make up into good milk. It has been already improved since this analysis was made. Within the last twelvemonth I have also examined five varieties of Cocoa, and find that they respond to the descriptions given on the wrappers. Cadbury's Cocoa Essence is really pure Cocoa from which some 60 per cent. of fat has been removed. Of admixtures, Epps's Homoeopathic Cocoa, and Taylor Brothers Maravilla Cocoa, are undoubtedly the best. To those who drink Cocoa, the facts which I have recorded arc useful, and it is my intention to make you acquainted with the others in the market. Nevertheless, even now the conclusion is irresistible, that the cheapest are not the most economical, Besides Milks and Cocoas, I have submitted four Coffees to the test of analysis. One coffee contained about 46 per cent. of chicory. No indication was furnished by the wrapper, but the Vendor succeeded in persuading the Magistrate that he had informed our Inspector to the effect that it was an admixture. Anyhow it was handed to me as coffee pure and simple and I could do no other than supply a certificate of prosecution. In another case of coffee, the sample was wrapped up in paper admitting it to be a mixture; nevertheless it was a pure coffee! I presume the vendor wished to make himself quite safe. Of Alcoholic Drinks I have examined only four. These were all of the genus—porter. Two of them, the manufacture of firms bearing a very high reputation, only contained 35 grains of salt to the gallon, or less than one-half of what is found in milks. And, in those porters of another well-known firm, the quantity has greatly diminished. I have further analysed six samples of Flour and eight samples of Bread. They have all withstood the test, as only in one bread was there alum in very small quantity. 21 The six Butters were at least genuine and that is sometimes all that can be said of them. Three Mustards were excellent. As it was your wish that Sweetmeats should be occasionally examined, Mr. Errington brought me two varieties. Nothing could be said against them except in respect to dirt, which was the prevailing feature in one. In conclusion, I have subjected live Violet Powders to analysis. Of these three were genuine, according to my ideas, and consisted of scented starch: the other two were made up of scented sulphate of lime, and the best part of them were the attractive covers. I may explain my reason for considering violet powder as a drug. Starch is a drug, and under the head of starch I find the following comment in Peter Squire's Companion to the British Pharmacopoeia: ''in the form of violet powder, which is merely scented starch, "it (starch) is useful to prevent the low inflammation that may "be caused by the chafing of the skin." It now appears that violet powder may be made up of any non-injurious powder. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend all who are interested in the matter, to ask for scented starch when they require violet powder as it is thus sold by all reputable chemists. On the whole, the working of the Act has been beneficial, and I think progress may be reported in almost every article with reference to diminished adulteration. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital Medical and Surgical College, S.E.
