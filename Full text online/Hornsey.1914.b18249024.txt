Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Hornsey for the year 1914. The vital statistics as a whole are again very satisfactory, the death-rate being almost the lowest on record. The same remark applies to the infantile mortality, and the other vital statistics are of a similarly favourable character. Towards the end of the year considerable re-organization of the work of the Department was necessitated owing to a large proportion of the Staff having joined His Majesty's Forces, and in some respects part of the work usually carried on had to be curtailed. Arrangements have now been made to, as far as possible, temporarily fill up the vacancies so caused, and the work of the Public Health Department is now being carried on without serious interruption. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HAROLD COATES, M.D., D.P.H. 4 BOROUGH OF HORNSEY. Summary of Statistics.

At the middle of 1913 the estimated population was 88,160. The gain during the twelve months 1913-1914 is, therefore, 1,674 persons, which is equal to an increase of 1.89 per cent. The gain during the preceding twelve months 1912-1913 was 2,638 persons, equal to 3.08 per cent., so that the rate of increase has been less during 1913-1914 than in the preceding year. Reference to the table on page 5 will show that the rate of increase in the population has been a very fluctuating one. The enumerated population at the date of the last census, April 1st, 1911, was 84,592, and the gain in the 3¼ years from the date of the Census to June 30th, 1914, has been 5,242. The following table shows the estimated population of the Borough at the middle of each year from 1901. These figures are all based on the number of inhabited houses in the Borough as ascertained from the rate books, and the average number of 5 persons per house as given in the Census returns, and differ somewhat from the Registrar General's estimate, which is calculated by a different method. The population of the Borough at tlie middle of 1914, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 87,742.

The statistical calculations of this report are based on the estimated population of 89,834. The following table shews the yearly increase per cent. for each year since the Census of 1901:— Increase of population during the year.

The increase for the last year being 1,764, is above the average yearly increase. The "natural increase" of population during 1914, i.e., excess of births over deaths, was 738. In the preceding year the "natural increase" was 601, so that this year there is a gain in this respect. The estimated population at the end of each Quarter of 1914 was as follows:— End of first quarter 89,596 „ second „ 89,781 „ third „ 89,927 „ fourth „ 90,032 The following table shews, for each Ward of the Borough, the population estimated at the middle of the years, for the years 1913 and 1914, with the increase or decrease during the 12 months.

With a population of 89,834, this gives us 31.2 persons per acre. Thirteen years ago there were 25 persons per acre in Hornsey. As is shewn in the table below, the number of persons per acre varies greatly in different parts of the district. North Haringey is the most thickly populated, having 79 persons per acre, then follow West Hornsey with 61 and East Hornsey with 60 persons per acre. Crouch End with 17, Highgate and Muswell Hill, each with 18 persons per acre, are yet the least densely populated areas.

The yearly average number of deaths registered in the Borough during the previous ten years was 659. The death-rate calculated on these figures (gross death-rate) is 6.94 per thousand of the mean population for the year. This is 0.7 lower than the corresponding rate last year. This, however, includes only deaths actually registered in the Borough, and does not include those of Hornsey people dying elsewhere. There were 194 Hornsey people who died outside the district during 1914, viz.: — 59 in the Edmonton Workhouse and Infirmary. 4 in other Infirmaries. 9 in the Great Northern Central Hospital. 63 in other Hospitals outside the Borough, 11 in Lunatic Asylums, and 48 in various other places. On the other hand there were 27 deaths registered in Hornsey of persons non-resident in the district. To get the nett deaths belonging to Hornsey we must add to the number of deaths registered in the Borough the number (194) of Hornsey people dying outside the Borough, and deduct the number (27) of deaths registered in Hornsey of persons who normally resided in other districts. This gives us the nett number of deaths belonging to Hornsey as 791, a decrease of 33 from the corresponding number for 1913. The death-rate calculated on these figures is the nett death rate, and for the past 10 years is as follows:— Year. Nett death-rate. 1905 8.78 1906 9.57 1907 9.35 1908 9.14 1909 9.47 1910 8.77 1911 9.58 1912 9.82 1913 9.34 1914 8.80 17 It is only for these ten years that the comparison can be made, as for the years before 1905 the figures referring to deaths of Hornsey people outside the Borough cannot be obtained. The nett death-rate for 1914 is 0'54 lower than that of 1913. During the last 10 years the death-rate has been very steady and has kept at a very low figure.

The death-rate last year in Crouch End Ward was 8.7, so that this year's rate shows a marked improvement. The most considerable improvement in the annual ward death-rates occurs in Finsbury Park Ward, where the death-rate has dropped from 14.4 in 1913 to 8.7 in 1914. This is much lower than the usual rate in Finsbury Park Ward, and is, in fact, the lowest recorded for this ward. Other wards with better death rates as compared with 1913 are Highgate, Muswell Hill, West Hornsey, and North Haringey. East Hornsey, South Haringey and Stroud Green Wards each have higher death-rates than in 1913, the greatest loss as compared with the previous year having occurred in the South Haringey Ward. The deaths in public institutions have been referred to the Wards from which the patients were removed on entering the institutions. The Ward death-rates for the last 10 years are as follows:— Ward. Death rates per 1,000 1914. 1913. 1912. 1911. 1910. 1909. 1908. 1907. 1906. 1905.

The following Chart shews the principal causes of death:— 25 NUMBER OF DEATHS IN HORNSEY FROM VARIOUS CAUSES. 26 More than half the deaths are due to the diseases classified in the four groups of (1) Bronchitis and Pneumonia, (2) Diseases of the Heart and Blood-vessels, (3) Cancer, (4) Tuberculosis. Of these, the last is of a known infectious nature, and a big step in the campaign against this disease has been taken now that the various measures provided for by recent legislation have been put into operation, and, in a few years, a considerable saving ought to be shown in this direction.

The chief gains are in deaths from Cancer, Bronchitis and Measles. Tuberculosis.—The deaths from Phthisis of the Lung numbered 44, or 11 less than in the previous year, and 7 less than the yearly average for the preceding 10 years. Six of these 44 deaths occurred in persons who had been removed to the Edmonton Workhouse, 1 at The Downs Sanatorium, 1 at the Great Northern Hospital, 2 at Brompton Hospital, and 7 at other places outside the Borough. From forms of Tuberculosis other than Phthisis there were 10 deaths registered, a decrease of 9 compared with the year 1913. 28 The total deaths from all forms of Tuberculosis were, therefore, 54, or 15 less than in the previous year. The number of deaths from Phthisis and from all forms of Tuberculosis and the death-rates per 1,000 of the population are given below:— Year. Number of deaths from Consumption of the Lungs.

At the middle years of life, viz :—15-45 years of age, out of a total of 121 deaths registered for the Borough, 30, or nearly one-fourth, were due to Phthisis alone. The accompanying chart shews the Annual Death-rate from Phthisis in Hornsey for the past 19 years, 1890-1914:— 30 ANNUAL DEATH-RATE FROM PHTHISIS. 31 During the year 267 cases of Tuberculosis were notified to me by Medical Practitioners. In addition 14 persons were certified to have died from Tuberculosis who had not been notified during life, so that altogether 281 cases of Tuberculosis were registered. Of these it was found that 88 cases had been previously notified and that 59 cases belonged not to Hornsey but to other districts, these notifications being accordingly transferred, the new cases occurring in Hornsey, therefore, being 134. Of these 101 were cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 33 were cases of NonPulmonary Tuberculosis. The following table shows the number of cases of Tuberculosis notified in each Ward:— Highgate.

This is a decrease of 14 deaths from 1913, and of 32 deaths from the number registered in 1912. A glance at the table below shews that the deaths in 1914, though lower than in 1913, are nearly double the number in 1901. The death-rate from cancer per thousand of the population is equal to 0.91, about one-ninth of the total death-rate. Reference to the chart appended shews that previous drops in an otherwise almost continuous rise have occurred, but that these drops have been of a temporary character. There is no reason to 33 believe that any factor has occurred to favourably affect cancer mortality, and the probability is that this year's fall will not be permanent.

The Zymotic death-rate is equal to '46 per thousand of the population. Diarrhoea and Diphtheria are the diseases responsible for the higher Zymotic death-rate this year as compared with 1913. There was one death from Scarlet Fever. 36 The death-rate calculated per thousand of the population from these diseases is the Zymotic death-rate, and is shewn below in Hornsey and in England and Wales for a number of years:— Hornsey.

I am, therefore, unable to compare our Zymotic death-rate with those of England and Wales, and the 97 Great Towns. 37 The accompanying chart shews the annual death-rate from Zymotic Diseases in Hornsey for the past 20 years, 1895-1914: — ANNUAL DEATH-RATE FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. 38 Considering the Zymotic diseases in detail, it is seen that there was no death from Small Pox. There were two deaths from this disease in 1902; there have been none since that year. From Scarlet Fever there was one death. In recent years Scarlet Fever has not been an important cause of mortality, the highest number of deaths-in any one year being G in 1906. Diphtheria caused 6 deaths.—A higher number than for two or three years past, but still below the average number of deatlis annually from this disease. Enteric Fever caused only one death, a decrease of two as compared with 1913. There were 15 more deaths from Diarrhoea. This mortality is almost entirely responsible for the slight increase in the Zymotic death-rate. There were 11 less deaths from Measles and 4 less from Whooping Cough. Infantile Mortality.—During the year 1914 there were 88 deatns of infants under 1 year of age, as against 81 in 1913, and an average of 108 for the ten years 1904-1913. The infantile mortality for the year 1914, i.e., deaths under 1 year of age per 1,000 births, is 57 in Hornsey. In 1913 the infantile mortality rate was 56, and the average rate for the 20 years 1894-1913 was 85, the highest being 133 in 1895, and the lowest 56 in 1913. Thus the infantile mortality is again a very favourable one, and only in 1913 has the rate been lower. 39 weekly return of infantile mortality during 1914.

The number of deaths in the first 3 quarters of the year is 27, 20, 24, and then there is a drop to 17 in the last quarter. Often the number of deaths of infants rises rapidly in the 3rd quarter, owing to epidemics of summer diarrhoea. In the hot summer of 1911 there were 28 deaths among infants due to this cause. In 1912 only 13 deaths were due to diarrhoea, and in 1913 this number fell to 10. And in 1914, 18 deaths were due to diarrhceal diseases. The accompanying chart shews the Infantile Mortality (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 births) in Hornsey for the past 21 years, 1894-1914:— 41 CHART SHEWING INFANTILE MORTALITY. 42 During 1910 and 1911 there were rises in the Infantile Mortality from what was the low record year of 1909, and these rises were only slightly counterbalanced by the little fall of 1912. This year the Infantile Mortality is but slightly higher than the previous record. The Infantile Mortality at the four quarterly periods of 1914 was as follows:— 1914. Rirths. Infantile Deaths.

Diarrhceal diseases are responsible more than any other condition for the remaining deaths, the number of deaths from this cause being 18, and other Infectious diseases 8 deaths. Special efforts are made, by means of house-to-house visitation in the poorer districts, to prevent or mitigate conditions likely to favour the occurrence of diarrhceal diseases, e.g., the proper cleansing of houses, courts and passages, the prevention of accumulations of refuse, and the encouragement of sanitation generally. Plainly-worded leaflets are distributed, giving instructions as to the storing of food, the feeding and management of infants, and the prevention of diarrhoea. Deaths under one year of age of Illegitimate Children.—There were 54 illegitimate births registered during the year, and 12 deaths under 1 year of age of illegitimate children occurred. This gives an infantile mortality among illegitimate children of 222, i.e., more than four times the infantile mortality among children born in wedlock. The number of legitimate births registered was 1,475, and the number of deaths under 1 year of age of legitimate children was 76. This gives an infantile mortality among legitimate cliil dren of 51. 44 INFANTILE MORTALITIES IN GREAT TOWNS.

Tub ore ulosis (all forms) Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912. For convenience of comparison with preceding years, the following table has been divided so as to show first the total notifica. 47 tions in the case of the older notifiable diseases, and then the more recent additions to the list. Considering the older notifiable diseases first (Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas and Small Pox), we see that the cases notified to me numbered 481 in 1914. This is an increase of 122 as compared with 1913, when 359 cases were notified. The yearly average number of notifications of these diseases for the last 20 years is 495, the number of notifications for 1914 being, therefore, 14 below the yearly average. There were no cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever or Acute Poliomyelit s notified during 1914. The notifications of Tubercular Phthisis numbered 101, and of other forms of Tuberculosis 33, and have already been referred to. The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914, came into operation on the 1st April, 1914. Circular letter and copies of the Order were sent to Medical Practitioners practicing in the Borough and circular letters enclosing books of notifications were also sent to midwives. Eleven cases were notified during the last 8 months of the year. oo NOTIFICATIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

There is therefore an increase of 140 over the cases notified in 1913, and an increase of 77 on the average number for the preceding twenty years. The disease was mostly of a very mild type, there being only one fatal case occurring among the 346 cases notified.

There is therefore a decrease of 14 from the number of cases notified in 1913, and an increase of 8 as compared with the yearly average for the preceding 20 years. When the increase of population is taken into 52 account the rate per 1,000 of the population is below the average for the last 20 years. There were 6 deaths among the 101 cases notified, as compared with 3 deaths among 115 cases notified in 1913. The cases were fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, the fourth quarter being highest with 40 cases and the second quarter lowest with 10 cases. The first and third quarters were almost equal with 22 and 23 cases respectively.

One case of the 9 notified proved fatal. 53 The number of cases of Enteric Fever in the Borough was one less than in 1913 (9 against 10), and well below the average for recent years. The attack rate is 0.10. Isolation Hospital.—As compared with the previous year there were 116 more patients admitted in 1914, viz.:—704 in 1914 and 588 in 1913. The increase in the number of patients admitted to the Hospital is almost all accounted for by the larger number of cases from Hornsey and Wood Green, the figures being for Hornsey 317 in 1914 as against '247 in 1913—an increase of 70, and for Wood Green 268 in 1914 as against 216 in 1913—an increase of 52. The cases from Finchley were slightly fewer than last year, 119 in 1914 as against 124 in 1913—a decrease of 5.
