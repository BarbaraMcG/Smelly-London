x> iscu REPORT ON THB SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JANUARY, 1863. No. LXX. The registered mortality of January has been 282, corresponding almost exactly with the corrected mean registered mortality of the same month in the previous six years. But although this is the case, there are other features in the Tables of Mortality and Sickness which are far from satisfactory. The zymotic mortality has remained unusually high. Scarlet fever and measles have still prevailed extensively, although their violence appears somewhat to have abated since last month ; hooping cough has carried off a considerable number of children, and 10 deaths have been registered from fever. Small pox as the most readily preventable of all infectious diseases is, however, that on which we must look with the most concern. From this malady 9 deaths have been registered in four weeks. In December 9 deaths were registered in the course of five weeks ; so that the mortality from this disease appears rather to have increased than diminished. The followiug are the localities where the fatal cases occurred— 25, Clayton-street 3, Bedford-place 40, River-street, York-road 'The Ambassador," York-road 6, York-road 10, Albion-place, Ball's-pond 20, Brunswick-road 266, Pentonville-road 3, Kailway-place, Kingsland Son of a Tailor, Son of a Jobbing Labourer Son of a Labourer Daughter of a Coffee-house-keeper, aged 11 months A Stonemason Daughter of a Carman Male Draper's Assistant A Costermonger aged 18 months „ 11 „ 5 years aged 30 years ,, 3 „ ,, 7 „ „ 23 „ ,, 21 „ Unvaccinated. Unvaccinated. Unvaccinited. Unvaccinated. Unvaccinated. (Died in Small Pox Hospital) Unvaccinated. Two of these deaths were registered in the first week, one in the second, three in the third, and three in the fourth week of the month. The number of new cases occurring in the practice of the Parochial Surgeons and Holloway Dispensary was 25. The weekly deaths from scarlet fever were 5, 2, 5, G; they mainly occurred in the neighbourhood of the Caledonian-road, Canonbury, and neighbourhood of the Lower-road. The weekly deaths from measles were 4, 6, 1, 1, which were distributed in such a manner as not to show any marked preference for any one district, EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR FEBRUARY, 1863. No. LXXI. The mortality has again fallen to the precise corrected average of six years. The deaths registered in February amounted to 26G. The deaths in each of the classes of causes, viz., Zymotic diseases, Constitutional diseases, and Local diseases are represented almost precisely by the numbers registered in February last year. Compared with the mortality of January, that from the Miasmatic disorders has fallen from 85 to 58. Small-pox has occasioned only 3 deaths against 9 in December and 9 in January. The following were the fatal cases— 9, Albion-place, Ball's-pond Ditto 9, Linton-street South Son of a Builder's Labourer Daughter of ditto An Artificial Flower Maker aged 3 months „ 3 years aged 29 years L'nvaccinated. Imperfectly Vaccinated in Lonibardy. (Died in Small-pox Hospital.) The numbers of cases which have occurred in the practice of the Parochial Surgeons and Dispensaries amount, however, to 32, an increase of 7 upon the number recorded last month. The localities in which they occurred are chiefly the sanitary districts of Ball's-pond, Queen's-road, and Bemerton. Scarlet Fever has occasioned 21 deaths, chiefly about the Caledonian-road and Hornsey-road. The monthly deaths from Measles have fallen from 12 to 7, and the cases from 41 to 21.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR MARCH, 1863. No. LXXII. During the five weeks which ended on the 28th of March, the mortality of this Parish has been excessive. It has been high throughout London, but not to the extent that it has been with us where the deaths have been one-third higher than the corrected mean of six years. The number registered was 422, the corrected mean of the previous six years is 316. Whatever the cause of the higher mortality of London may have been, Islington suffered from it disproportionably to the rest of the Metropolis. Among possible causes there is one which cannot be overlooked, namely, the sudden change of temperature of the air which occurred in the middle of the month. During the two first weeks the mean temperature was respectively 4 and 7.3 degrees above the mean of 21 years; in the second week it fell to 2.4 degrees below the mean; in the fourth week it was 0.8 degrees below the mean; and then in the fifth it again rose to 5.8 degrees above it. All this irregularity must have exercised a baneful influence upon the public health. Besides, the unusually high temperature during the early part of the month depressed vital energy, the low temperature in the middle favoured the occurrence and fatality of pulmonary diseases, and introduced complications in those Zymotic maladies which were prevailing at the time. Doubtless, too, there were other atmospheric conditions engaged in producing the high mortality. We commenced the month with an unusual amount of Small Pox, Scarlet Fever and Hooping Cough, and although these diseases figure largely in the mortuary table, neither they nor yet all the Zymotic diseases together constitute the whole explanation of the high death rate. The diseases of the Respiratory Organs caused 96 deaths, the corrected mean of six years being 70, and Cancer, Consumption, Hydrocephalus, Apoplexy, and Infantile Convulsions were all much above the average for March in the number of deaths they occasioned. It is clear then that the chief cause of all was of some such general character as I have indicated above. The deaths from Zymotic maladies amounted to no less than 150, that is, they were twice as numerous as in any March during the previous six years. Out of these, the diseases which claim special notice are Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, Continued Fever and Rheumatic Fever. Small Pox occasioned 13 deaths. In the five weeks of December it only occasioned 9 deaths, and last month only 3. It is at any rate as fatal now as it was in the previous epidemic period; when this was at its height, namely, in February, 1860, the monthly deaths were 11 in four weeks. The following particulars will show that it is not only the unvaccinated who succumb, but those whose arms exhibit only the marks of imperfect or insufficient vaccination. The cases were these— A Female Servant, from 3, Northampton-place, Upper Holloway, aged 22 years _ (Died in S. P. Hospital,) A Labourer from 14, Dorset-street, Ball's-pond, aged 26, (Died in S.P. Hospital) Daughter of a Journeyman Carpenter at 5, Queen's Road, aged 1 year A Bricklayer, from 10, Blundell Street, aged 59 years (Died in S.P. Hospital) Son of an Excavator, at 35, Albion-place, Ball's-pond, aged 2 months Son of a Jobbing Labourer, at 35, Dorset-street, Ball's-pond, aged 2 weeks... Daughter of a Jobbing Labourer at 2, Garden-cottages, Newington-green, aged 2 years Wife of a Bricklayer, at 2, Mildmay-street, aged 43 years A Mason, at Prince Albert, Windsor-street, aged 40 years Daughter of a Cabdriver, at 7, Sun-row, aged 4 years Female Child, at 6, Gordon Court, aged 13 months A Plumber, from 35, Barnsbury-row, aged 30, (Died in S. P. Hospital,) Wife of a Grocer, at 3, Strahan-place, aged 56 Two indifferent vaccine cicatrices. One indifferent cicatrix Unvaccinated. Vaccinated, probably after imbibing the poison of the disease. ' Supposed to hive been vaccinated. Vaccinated when young. Supposed to have been vaccinated when young. Vaccinated, but with what effect not ascertained. Unvaccinated. One pretty good Cicatrix. The number of new cases on the books of the Parochial Surgeons and two Dispensaries are 40, the weekly numbers being 6, 3, 8, 6, 10 (omitting those in the Holloway Dispensary). The deaths from Scarlet Fever rose from 21 in the four weeks of February to 41 in March, the March average for six years being only 9. The weekly numbers were 6, 12, 2, 14, 7. The sudden fall in the mortality during the coldest week of the month is very remarkable. The fatal cases chiefly occurred in those central sanitary districts which are included between the Upper Street, Caledonian Road, and Great Northern Railway, the greatest number being in Lower Holloway. The new cases on the books of the Medical Officers before mentioned are 44, the weekly numbers of 42 being 11, 8, 11, 6, 6. There were 41 deaths of young children from Hooping Cough, the mean for March being 15. The weekly numbers were 7, 4, 18, 6, 5; thus nearly half of these deaths occurred in the cold week, showing the influence of the sudden change in the temperature. The new cases on the Table II. are 49; the weekly numbers of those attended by the Parochial Surgeons and Islington Dispensary were 10, 4, 4, 7, 9. So it appears that the cold weather rather gave an impulse to the fatality of the cases than absolutely increased their number. The districts where the deaths were most numerous were those of Archway, Bemerton, Lower Road, and St. Peter's. Of the 17 deaths from Fever 4 only are returned as Typhus, and 2 of these were nurses in the Fever Hospital. Rheumatic Fever exhibits the very unusual number of 7 deaths, but the number of cases upon Table 2 are not exceptionally large. There were 64 deaths of persons over 60 years of age, 7 of whom were over 80 years old, and one above 90. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, April 6th, 1863. TABLE I.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR APRIL, 1863. No. LXXIII. The mortality in the Parish, although still very high, has not been quite so great as it was in the month of March. The deaths registered were 300, and had the death rate of March continued they would have amounted to 338. Still they were greatly above the average for April. The mean mortality of April for seven years past, corrected for increased population, would have produced 253; the actual deaths were 47 above this number. Of the 300 deaths, 94, or nearly a third, were due to maladies of the Zymotic class. In March there were recorded five deaths from Erysipelas, and seven from Rheumatic Fever; there are none recorded from these diseases in the mortuary table for April. The deaths from Hooping Cough also have fallen from 41 in five week to 18 in four weeks, the weekly numbers being 3, 6, 4, 5. The deaths from Fever also have fallen from 17 to 10, the latter number including those of two nurses who died from Typhus in the London Fever Hospital. The diseases which have maintained their high fatality have been Small Pox and Scarlet Fever. Small Pox has most distinctly increased amongst us uring the month. In the five weeks of March 40 new cases were recorded upon the books of the Dispensaries and of the Parochial Officers. In the four weeks of April the number rose to GO; nor doe3 this include all the cases that have come to my knowledge among the same class of our inhabitants, while I have heard of very numerous cases occurring in the families of those who are in a position to engage the services of private practitioners. In both classes of persons it has been no rare event for t hree or four persons to be ill with Small Pox in a single family. The intelligent portion of the public are alive to the danger, and both primary and secondary vaccinations are being actively procsedel with. At the same time there is, especially among the poor, a cla93 of persons who obstinately reject the offers of vaccination made to them. In one house which I visited in Brand Street there was, in a filthy room, a woman with three children, who were at the height of the disease, and a son scarcely recovered was playing with other children in a common yard for that and some adjoining houses. The woman said that she had had eleven children, and if she had eleven more not one of them should be vaccinated. And this contumacy is allowed. Who can wonder at the spread of the epidemic when the fuel that supports the flame is thus permitted to accumulate ? The weekly numbers of the 60 cases were 20, 16, 15, 9. They occurred in nearly all parts of the parish, but chiefly in the districts of the Queen's Road, Highgate Hill, Lower Holloway, Bemerton, Belle Isle, Kingsland, Lower Road, and the Irsh courts. In Water's Court the first case was one of " malignant" or " petechial" Small Pox, a form in which the whole mass of the blood becomes disorganised. No one can be surprised at such a case occurring in so dirty and offensive a place. Of course the disease spread in the court. The fatal cases registered during the month were 10. The weekly deaths were 1, 6, 1,2; they were as follows:— At 4 Dean-street, Son of a Greengrocer, aged 1 year From 113 Upper-street, Female Servant, aged 18 years From 9, George-place, Labourer, aged 46 years At 7, Mildmay-road, wife of a Merchant, aged 25 years At 7, George-street, Master Tailor, aged 23 years From 8, Durham-road, Frrand Boy, aged 16 years At 18, Albany-place, Son of a Navigator, aged 9 months At 10, Water court, Son of a Builder's Labourer, ajjed 9 years At 26, Canonbuiy-road, Daughter of a Banker's Clerk, aged 1 month At Arundel-road,*Police Constable, aged 24 years Sttd to have been Vaccina' ted, but no perceptible Cicatrix. (Died in S. P. Hosp.) One indifferent Cicatrix. (Died inS. P. Hosp.) Suppressed S. P. Premature Confinement, Acute Pyoemia. After Vaccination 6 days Scarlatina 5 days. Two indifferent cicatrices. (Died in S. P. Hospt.) Unvaccinaled. (Petechial S. Pox). The deaths from Scarlet Fever amounted to 34; so that the death rate from this disease varied in no degree from that during March. The uncorrected mean for the seven previous Aprils is 8. The weekly deaths were 6, 14, 7, 7. It evidently prevailed quite as extensively as in March, since there is a record of 44 new cases in Table II, the same number in four weeks as occurred in the four weeks previously. The weekly numbers were 16, 10, 9, 9. The mean temperature of the air was, according to Mr. Glaisher, above the average throughout the month: in the first week 1.5 degrees above it, in the second 4.2 degrees, in the third 4.9 degrees, and in the fourth 3 degrees.

The mortality in the Parish has again been somewhat reduced, although during the month of May it was still greatly above the average. The number of deaths registered was 280, the corrected mean of the previous seven years being 223. Thus we have lost by disease 47 persons in excess of what is usual at this period of the year. On examining the mortuary table in connection with the tables for May in previous years, the excess is found to be referable mainly to the larger number of deaths recorded under the heads of small pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, diseases of the heart and old age. The number of new cases of small pox attended during the month by the parochial medical officers and those of the two Dispensaries was 134, more than twice the number that occurred in April. The Irish courts by the turnpike, and the Queen's Road district in the Hornsey Road have been the principal foci; but the White Conduit and Bemerton districts have also suffered severely. A good number of cases have also occurred in the streets about the Lower Road and in Lower Holloway. The weekly numbers show a steady increase of the disease during the month. They were as follow : 23, 31, 36, 43. The fatal cases were 15—ten in the East and five in the West sub-district. They were as follow :— At 20, Half-Moon-crescent, son of a Bricklayer, aged 7 year At 43, Gifford-street, daughter of a Plasterer, aged 4 years From 13, Victoria-road, a widow, aged 53 years At 12, Waters-court, Son of a Builder's Labourer, aged 2 years At 4, Rutland-terrace, Son of a Domestic Sen-ant, aged 8 years At 13, Albany-place, Wife of a Brickfield Labourer, aged 24 years At 10, Rutland-terrace, Wife of a Block'.Cutter, aged 37 years At 9, Gordon-court, Daughter ot a Brazier, aged 10 months From 3, North-buildings, York Road, Labourer, aged 28 years At 39, Dean-street, Joiner, aged 22 years At 140, New North-road, Accountant, aged,53 years At 20, Windsor-road, Daughter of a Female, aged 5 weeks At 5, Parsell's-court, Son of a Builder's Labourer, aged 6 years At 2, Arundel-road, Daughter of a Builder's Labourer At 7, Parsells-court, Journeyman Plumber, aged 18 years Unvaccinated.

Of the six fatal cases of diphtheria, five occurred in two houses at the southern extremity of the Douglas Road, three in one house and two in the other. An opinion has been expressed by some of the neighbours that the attacks were due to malaria from exposed mud upon the bank of the New River. I cannot say I coincide in the opinion, although it must be admitted that such exposure should not have been allowed. I have reason for believing that other causes were in operation, some of which are now in course of being remedied. There had been a death from typhoid fever, a little while before, in an intermediate house. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, June 1863. TABLE I.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JUNE, 1863. No. LXXV. The tables of sickness and mortality during the five weeks of June continue to exhibit a low condition of the public health. The registered deaths amounted to 320, the mean mortality of seven previous years, corrected for an increased population, being only 262. We have here, then, 58 deaths registered over and above what has been usual at this season. Twenty-three of these are readily accounted for. They were deaths from Small-pox. It is the largest monthly number I have yet had to record. Up to the present time the epidemic has cost us the lives of 85 persons, and the permanent disfigurement of a much larger number. It is a serious thing to enquire who is responsible for the imperfect vaccination observed in the large majority of these cases. The number of new cases of Small-pox entered during the five weeks upon the books of the Parochial Officers and of the two Dispensaries is 105. If the disease had prevailed as it did in May, the number would have amounted to 167, so that it has clearly been declining amongst us during the month. The same fact seems demonstrated by the weekly numbers, which were 21, 23, 23, 21, 17; but these numbers are oidy less high than the weekly, numbers in May. The greater proportion of these occurred in the neighbourhood of the Queen's-road, Caledonian-road, in Brand-street, in the streets near the commencement of the Back-road, Kingsland, and in Lower Holloway. The mortality, being higher than any I have yet recorded, corresponds with the greatest prevalence of the disease in the present month. The weekly deaths registered were 8, 7, 5, 2, 1, the largest number thus being registered early in June. They occurred as follows :— At 3, Market-place, Upper Holloway, Daughter of a Waiter, aged 19 months. From 44, Payne-street, a girl aged 7 years .. From 7, "Wellington-place, a Carman, aged 29 years At 29, Shepperton-cottagcs, a Miller, aged 36 years At 10, Albert-place, Queen's-road, a Stone Sawyer, aged 22 years At a hut in rear of 13 Brand-street, Daughter of a Journeyman Bricklayer aged on9 year At 2, Hornsey-road.

From 4, Queen's-road, a boy, aged 10 years 1, Hayes-place, a girl, aged 13 years From the "Half Moon," Lower-street, a Barman, aged 16 years At 4, Caledonian-street, Daughter of a Contractor's Manager, aged 7 years At 44, Gifford-street, Son of a Bricklayer, aged 22 months At 6, Hallway-place, Son oi an Upholsterer, aged 6 weeks At 30, Camden-passage, Daughter of a Soda Water Bottler, aged two weeks At 20, Kingsdown-road, a Female Servant, aged 20 years At 32, Upper Victoria-road, a Labourer, aged 28 years At 3, Arragon-terrace, Daughter of a House Painter, aged 14 days At 15, Queen's-place, Queen's-road, Daughter of a Commercial Traveller, aged 6 years Tico small cicatrices.

With respect to the deaths in the huts at the rear of 13, and 15, Brand-street, I have to say that several weeks ago I reported these huts to the Sanitary Committee, who viewed them and coincided in my opinion that they were totally unfit for habitation by human beings. They were erected without proper notice to the Vestry, and in contravention of the 29th Section of the Building Act. By the advice of the Vestry Clerk I communicated this fact by letter to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The excess of our mortality during June is further accounted for by the occurrence of 52 deaths from scarlet fever, which is 25 above the mean number, and by 14 deaths from measles, which is six above the mean. The excess of deaths from these three diseases amounts to 54. The weekly new cases of scarlet fever were 7, 9, C, 10 and 11. The deaths from bowel complaints were about the mean number for the month of June, but those from diseases of the nervous system and the organs of circulation and respiration were unusually numerous.

The death rate, indicative of a low condition of the public health in June, continued to increase in July. The number of deaths registered in the four weeks ending July 25th was 295. This number is 47 above the average mortality of the Parish in July for the past seven years, and at the rate of 10 deaths a week more than took place during the month of June. The deaths from bowel complaints were 46, a number only exceeded by the deaths from the same causes in 1857 and 1859. The weekly new cases of diarrhoea entered on the books of the Parochial Surgeons were 16, 41, 59, 65, showing the mode in which it has increased with the warm and dry weather we have past through. No rain fall was registered at Greenwich during the first three weeks of the month, and but little during the fourth. Scarlet fever has continued to increase amongst us; eighty new cases were entered on the books of the Parochial Surgeons and Dispensaries, the weekly numbers being 17, 19, 26, 18. The deaths amounted to 44, the mean for July being 8. The weekly deaths were 6, 8, 13, 15; five of them occurred in Albert Square, one at No. 8, two at No. 9, two at No. 14; at the last named house there have been, up to the time of printing this Report, four cases three of which have been fatal. The decline of small pox indicated in my Report for June has become more pronounced, the number of new cases which have come to my knowledge among the poor amounting to 25 (in place of 105 in June), the weekly numbers being 12, 5, 1, 5. There were only two deaths of unvaccinated persons, viz.— From 19a, Blundell Street, a Smith and Gas Fitter, aged 30 years (Unvaccinated.Died in s.p.hosp.) From 1, North Buildings, a girl, aged 12 years (Unvaccinated Died in S.p. Hesp.) The deaths from consumption (36), and from chronic diseases of the liver (7), have been much more numerous than is usual at this season. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOE AUGUST, 1863. No. LXXYII. The number of deaths registered during the month of August, amounting to 288, although somewhat below the mortality of July, is still excessive, being as much as 55 over the corrected mean of seven previous years. The diseases of the miasmatic order, notably small pox, scarlatina and bowel complaints, together with apoplexy, paralysis and other diseases of the brain, have been principally concerned in producing this result. Scarlet fever appears, however, to have somewhat diminished in frequency, both of cases and deaths; but a larger number both of cases of small pox among the poor and of deaths from this malady have been placed on record. The cases of small pox in Table II. amount to 31 against 25 in July, and the deaths in Table I. to 7 against 4 in July. The weekly cases were 6, 8, 10, 7, and the deaths 3, 2, 1, 1. The latter occurred as follows:— At 6, Caledonia Crescent, daughter of a Stonemason, aged 9 weeks. From 9, Bedford Place, Upper Holloway, Labourer, aged 26 years One Vaccine Cieatrix. (Died in S.p.Hosp.) — 5, Lampeter Street, male child, aged 3 years Unvaccinated,( Died in S.P.Hosp.) ditto female child, aged 10 months {UnvaccinatedDied in S.P.Hosp.), At 7, Blenheim Road, daughter of a Stationer, aged 3 years. From 4, Hanover Place, Horsekeeper, aged 22 years Unvaccinated. Died in S.P.Hosp.) At 3a, Edward Street, White Conduit, daughter of a Miller, aged 5 months. The weekly cases of scarlet fever recorded were 15, 14, 17, 15, and the deaths 5, 8, 7, 14. Two of the latter were in a dark and badly ventilated house, No. 14, Albert Square, where the basement is said to be sometimes saturated with water from defective drainage, while the domestic supply of water to the whole locality is still most imperfect. I have made repeated visits and enquiries in the Square, and the invariable complaint still is that there is never any water on Sundays, and frequently none on week days after 4 or 6 o'clock p.m. During the months of July and August, nine deaths have occurred in this Square; one from phthisis, one (a child) from diarrhoea, and the remaining seven from scarlet fever (four of them at No.14). The lower rooms of this house, as well as of No. 13, arc totally unfit for human habitation; but I have been repeatedly foiled in the endeavour to obtain a magistrate's order for the closure of rooms similarly occupied. The section of the Nuisances Removal Act which relates to this matter stands thus quite inoperative, so far as this Parish is concerned. The water supply, however, must now seriously be enforced; it is not to be borne that a colony of poor persons shall have no means of domestic or personal ablution, to say nothing of clean drinking water, from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR SEPTEMBER, 1863. No. LXXYIII There occurred in Islington during the five weeks ending the 26th of September, 357 deaths, of which 208 were children under 10 years of age. This mortality, indicating a low state of the public health, especially amongst the poorer classes, is excessive, inasmuch as had the ordinary death rate ruled there would have been 85 deaths the less. Although diseases of the miasmatic order have been one principal cause of this excess they have not been the only one, since, although accounting for 140 of the deaths, this number is ith less than it would have been had the miasmatic death rate of August continued. The deaths from, so termed, local diseases were 101, the highest number in any previous year being 79; the number includes 35 deaths from respiratory diseases. There were 14 persons over 80 years of age who died during the month, 11 of whom are stated to have died from the natural changes brought about by prolonged existence. Small pox, although greatly abated, has not yet left us. I mentioned that in August the cases among the poor had been more numerous than they were the previous month, and now, correspondingly with this fact, we have to record a mortality which has risen from 7 to 13. They took place as follows:— From 14, Hope Street, a painter, aged 35 years One indifferent Vaccina Cicatrix (Died in S. P. Hospital.) At 2, Rochester Place, wife of a letter carrier, aged 26 years Vaccinated in early lift. From 13, Brunswick Road, daughter of a bricklayer's labourer, aged One Vaccine Cicatrix. 15 years (Died in S. P. Hosp.) At 15, Felix Terrace, son of a fishmonger, aged 3 months Unvaccinated. — 7, Cathcart Hill, daughter of a builder, aged 2 years. From 16, Lower Street, a female, aged 18 years Died in S. P Hosp At 8, Canon Street, daughter of a draper's warehouseman, aged 1 year. — 2 Smith's Terrace, Hornsey Road, son of a joiner, aged 4 years Unvaccinated. Ditto, daughter of ditto, 9 months Ditto. Ditto, son of ditto, 2 years Ditto. — 36, Blundell Street, a carpenter, aged 44 years. From 3, Tollington Place, a labourer, aged 28 years(Died in S.P.Hosp) — 33, Nailour Street, a bookseller's assistant, aged 30 years One Vaccine Cicatrix,(Died in S.P Hosp.) The weekly deaths were 1, 0, 1, 9, 2. In respect of one of the deaths at 2, Smith's Terrace, where a whole family of children had been left unvaccinated, Dr. Lankester held an inquest. Since the instances are but few in which the parochial authorities in this Metropolis have thought proper to enforce the penal clauses of the Vaccination Act, this is a step which, in the present condition of affairs, I think, might almost have been anticipated. My own impression is that a few enquiries of this kind would exercise a beneficial influence upon the public. The weekly cases enumerated in Table II. were 3, 4, 1, 3, 6. There were 36 deaths from scarlet fever, a reduction of one-fifth upon the weekly average in August. By far the largest number of these occurred about the neighbourhood of the Caledonian Road and the Lower Road. The weekly numbers of the cases enumerated in Table II. were 19, 15, 11, 30, 15. There were also 9 deaths from diptheria. The deaths from hooping cough have risen from 10 to 19. There was an unusual number of deaths, too, of consumptive persons.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR OCTOBER, 1863. No. LXXIX. Two hundred and eighty-two deaths have been registered during the past month, of which nearly half, or 131., were of children under 5 years of age. This mortality is again unusually high, since, if the death-rate of the previous seven years had ruled, the deaths would not have exceeded 225. Small pox, scarlet fever, hooping cough, and acute inflammatory chest diseases have had most to do with the excess. In no October that has passed since I have held my present office has scarlet fever been so fatal. The highest number of deaths was 28 in October, 1861. The deaths have chiefly taken place in the streets about the Caledonian and Lower Roads, occupied by the labouring classes. The weekly numbers were 9, 14, 8, 9. The weekly number of cases attended by the parochial surgeons and the dispensaries were, 27, 22, 16, 18. There have been five deaths from small pox, as follows:— At 26, Buckingham Street, daughter of a cheesemonger, aged 3 months Unvaccinated. From 6, Gordon Court, a girl, aged 4 years Unvaccinated.DiedinS Hosp.) „ 4, The Terrace, New Norfolk Street, a girl, aged 11 years Unvaccinated.Died ins S.P.Hosp) „ 7, George Street, Caledonian Road, a roan, aged 67 years Unvaccinated. DiedTnS.P.Hos) At 32, Packington Street, a joiner, aged 26 years. During some weeks past an epidemic of typhus fever has been prevailing extensively in some parts of London. Commencing at so early a season it betokens a sickly winter, and although but few cases have occurred in this Parish, we must be prepared to see more of it in the crowded parts occupied by the poor as the colder weather sets in. Experience has shown that, although this disease breaks out and spreads under epidemic influences which we little understand, yet that it selects, above all, those places where persons are most crowded together, where destitution depresses the powers of resistance, and dirt and foul effluvia are present to poison the blood. The Fever Hospital in this Parish is now so full, that the erection of a temporary building for the accommodation of additional cases is contemplated. If our poor population is to be kept free from the epidemic, it can only be by the adoption of means to abate over crowding of their dwellings and improve their physical comfort; while any individual cases, as they may occur, are removed at once to the Fever Hospital before they become foci of infection to others. But while it is my duty to warn you of the proximity of typhus, I must add that, although of course part of the work of prevention lies with the Sanitary department of the Vestry, the employers of labour on the one hand, and those whose charity leads them to visit the poor and relieve their distress in their homes on the other, will have their share to perform. It is desirable that all instances of over crowding of poor tenements, and occupation of unhealthy kitchens as sleeping rooms, should be communicated to me by any parishioners who come across them.

No. LXXX Although the monthly mortality has been somewhat higher than that of October, and is still above the average, several improvements have been observable in the public health. Small pox and scarlet fever have been less prevalent and less fatal, the deaths from the former having fallen from 5 to 3, and of the latter from 40 to 17. The total mortality of the month is 290, which is 18 above the corrected mean. But although the deaths from zymotic maladies generally have been reduced, those from respiratory diseases have increased—to a greater extent, too, than is customary at this season of the year. Sixty-five deaths from these causes have been registered, and of these no less than 23 are said to have been due to pneumonia. This is an unusually large number, being more than double the uncorrected mean for November. Seven cases of infectious fever (typhus) have been received from various parts of Islington into the Fever Hospital during the four weeks. From one room at No. 3, Queen's Koad, where a family was living in a state of extreme filth, one case was sent, and since the expiration of the month three more, and it was found necessary to destroy the bedding, &c., and to prohibit the further use of the room until again rendered fit for habitation. Of the 10 deaths recorded as from fever, nine were of the endemic form (typhoid), and only one of the infectious and epidemic fever (typhus). The deaths from small pox occurred in the first, third and fourth weeks of the month, and were as follows:— At 1, Fort Place, Highbury Vale, a chandler's shop keeper, aged 29 years... Unvaccinated. „ Union Cottage, Holloway Road, a milk carrier, aged 33. „ 40, Sidney Street, Maiden Lane, the son of a wood sawyer, aged 2 years Unvaccinated. The number of cases attended by the parochial surgeons and the dispensary have fallen from 16 to 10. The unusual number of 9 deaths from violent causes appear on the Table. Of these one was a suicide by hanging, and seven were deaths of young children, the result of accident or negligence. One child died from injuries inflicted by a fall; one was scalded by the spilling over it of a cup of hot tea, and four were suffocated in bed. I have further to note, in explanation of the unusual number of cases of disease in the infant poor house, that there has occurred there a mild outbreak of ophthalmia. Fifteen cases were admitted into the infirmary at various times in the course of a month, but none of them appear to have been severe. Care, extreme personal cleanliness, a well varied diet, and immediate isolation of those affected are the means of preventing and arresting the spread of this disease in establishments of young children. Two eases of infectious fever have occurred also in the body of the Workhouse. The first case was that of a woman who had been on tramp and brought in with her the seeds of the disease. Although no other cases have arisen to my knowledge, the occurence should tend to hasten the steps now being taken to provide a new Workhouse, and in themeanwhile to lessen the crowded state of the house by the temporary removal of some of its inmates. I beg to append to this Report, at the request of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, a copy of a "Memorandum," issued by that body, "concerning the present prevalence of typhus fever in London," and I have also forwarded a copy, with some recommendations of my own, to the Board of Trustees.

The Report for the present December relates to six instead of five weeks. This must necessarily happen about every sixth year. In the six weeks, then, ending January 2, there happened 472 deaths of residents in Islington. In order to compare this mortality with that of the previous seven Decembers, it is necessary to add ith to the corrected average, which will raise it to 457. The mortality recorded, then, is 15 above the mean. Infectious fever (typhus), which still prevails largely in other parts of London, happily makes but slow progress with us. Of the 12 deaths recorded in the Mortuary Table, 8 are said to be due to typhus, but it is right you should understand, in modification of any conclusion you may draw, that even now, although the majority of medical practitioners distinguish typhus from the endemic non-infectious fever, there are those who, from want of opportunity to study the two diseases side by side, still use the term "typhus" as synonymous with continued fever when ever this assumes the character of prostration. Although, therefore, it is certain that we have amongst us cases of the prevailing fever, it would be premature to assert that the rise of mortality, from one death in four weeks to eight in six weeks, is to be taken as an accurate expression of its rate of increase. An examination of the books of the Fever Hospital shows that only six cases of true typhus have been received from Islington during the month, and one of them was a tramp. Out of the eight reported deaths one was of a nurse at the Hospital, and three were of persons of a rank in life which put misery and want, as causes, out of the question. This merely shows us what we already knew—that in epidemic seasons, while those badly clothed, poorly fed and wretchedly lodged, are the most ordinary victims, typhus by no means neglects to visit families whose circumstances are more comfortable. None are absolutely safe. The practical conclusion is, that the disease must be anticipated by active measures directed to its favorite haunts. This is being done, as far as our sanitary staff permits, by searching out overcrowded tenements and kitchens unhealthily occupied as sleeping rooms, and by taking measures which are needful to enforce obedience to the sanitary clauses of the Acts of Parliament, which it is your province to administer. I have already been called upon to advise the Sanitary Committee on the matter of the new temporary ward for typhus cases at the Fever Hospital, and it may not be amiss to place again on record my opinion, that no more harm is likely to arise from it to the neighbourhood than has resulted from the established wards. The distance of the new ward, even from the nearest part of the neighbouring premises, is such as the poison of typhus has, so far as I know, never been able to traverse. I have stated that, in such seasons as this, typhus may occur anywhere, but the residents in the neighbourhood of the Hospital are in no greater danger from it than those who reside more remotely. You are aware that I have for some years kept a register of every death that has happened in each house in the Parish, and it demanded no additional labour to demonstrate, as I did, to the Committee (and as I should be happy to do to any one anxious for accurate information in the matter) that the opinion I have expressed is fully borne out by experience. The erection is unsightly, and calculated to originate gloomy thoughts; but with all this, as a sanitary board, you have decided you have nothing to do. Measles, scarlet fever and hooping cough continued to prevail to much the same extent as in November. Towards the middle of the month both scarlet fever and measles had decidedly declined in prevalence, but increased again at its close. The cases of scarlatina which came to my knowledge weekly were 17, 11, 5, 8, 1, 13. The weekly deaths were 4, 8, 13, 9, 8, 3. The former numbers give, of course, the most reliable idea of its actual weekly variations, as death does not happen instantly. The eastern half of the Parish has been suffering most. But three deaths from small pox have been recorded—one in the third, one in the fifth, and one in the sixth week of the month. The proportion of cases among the poor has scarcely varied. But the epidemic is not yet over. The three deaths occurred, two in streets adjoining the Caledonian Road, and one near the Camden Road. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF Dth Parish Of st.Marp lsllington, during the year 1863. BY EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., (Lond.) \ MEMBER OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS J FELLOW OF THE ROYAL MEDICAL AND CHIRURGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON, ETC., medical officer of health. to the VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, 1. The Report which I have this year the honour of submitting will be found to differ in some respects from those which have preceded it. In the first place, I have substituted for the customary Table of Mortality, based upon a second laborious and minute tabulation, a Table which consists simply of a summary of those contained in my monthly Reports, so far extended, however, as to give particulars as to deaths at various important periods of age below 20 years. To this I have at length been reluctantly driven by the enormous increase of our population, and consequent bulkiness of the returns to be classified. The only important dilference now is, that this Mortality Table is to be compared with the Annual Summary of the weekly Returns of Births and Deaths in London, issued by the Registrar General, instead of comparing it with the Tables in his Annual Reports. In the next place it will be remarked that, while leaving the mortality and sickness Tables to tell their own tale in a great degree, I have this year dealt more at length on the relation which may ba traced between mortality and disease on the one hand and local unsanitary conditions on the other, as this relation may be traced in a portion of the Parish where the death rate is, year by year, the highest. It has, however, been necessary to enter into full particulars respecting the epidemic of small pox from which we are now emerging. In the third place, I have thought I could see some advantage in detailing, more fully than I have lately done, the work carried out during the year under the direction of the Sanitary Committee. MORTALITY AND DEATH RATE. 2. The number of deaths registered in Islington, exclusive of those of strangers in the Hospitals, during the 53 weeks embraced by 1804, amounted to 3,854. To these we must add 169 more deaths, as our probable share of the deaths that took place in various Metropolitan Institutions for the reception of the sick, (fee., thus giving a total mortality of 4,023 persons. Correcting this for comparison with an ordinary year of 52 weeks, we arrive at the number of 3,946 deaths. This is one element in calculating the death rate of the year. The other, namely, the population, is less readily determined, and, notwithstanding the recent census, is already liable to erroneous estimation. Judging from the rapid progress of building and occupation of new houses, especially in the Northern half of the Parish, it is tolerably certain that the rate of increase has not been less than the mean annual rate of increase during the decenniad 1851-61, namely, 5 per cent., calculated upon the population of each preceding year. Tfius estimated, our population in the middle of 1863 would have been 173,235, and the consequent death rate 227 per 10,000 living. This is an unusually high rate, but still is not so high as that of the Metropolis generally, which is estimated by the Registrar General as 245 per 10,000. Commenting upon this high death rate, lie adds, "this lact should arouse the vigilance of the Boards of Works, for if they cease to carry out the recommendations of their Health Officers, the ground gained will be lost, and London will no longer be the healthiest large city in the world." 4 This warning is, no doubt, a proper one; it flows naturally from the fact that it is based upon; but, so far as I am concerned, I can safely affirm that, in my own efforts for upholding the healthiness of Islington, I have no reason to complain of want of co-operation, on the part either of the Vestry or of the Sanitary Committee. It is to be kept in mind, however, that our population has increased from about 127,000 in 1857, to 173,000; that since the establishment of the Vestry, the passing of new statutes has laid new and onerous duties upon the sanitary staff, occupying yearly a larger share of their attention; and that, if five or six years ago the supervision of the sanitary condition of the dwellings of the poor could not be completed within any one twelve months, the extent to which this supervision can be satisfactorily carried out now necessarily becomes yearly less. Experience has taught us within how very brief a time an improved neighbourhood, inhabited by a negligent population, falls back into a condition calculated to invite rather than repel disease. I may instance, also, one branch of sanitary work in which we have never yet attempted to engage—I mean the improvement of the places where people, especially young people, are engaged in numbers, in various sedentary industrial occupations—the work-rooms of dressmakers, mantle makers, milliners, artificial flower makers, tailors and such like. I mention this now, because instances of dangerous overcrowding and want of ventilation of such work rooms have been communicated to me, and my attention called to the subject by a circular from " The Children's Employment Commission." Recurring, however, to the warning of the Registrar General, it is to be remarked that no vigilance on the part of Sanitary authorities will prevent the outbreak of epidemic •visitations such as small-pox and scarlet fever, although sanitary measures will do much to break their forc9; still less will it modify the unfavourable influence which extremes or sudden variations of temperature, or other meteorological conditions exert upon the very young and upon those far advanced in age. To provide a remedy against these influences is the province of private hygiene, assisted where needful by public liberality. Both these classes of causes have been operative in augmenting the mortality of the year that has recently closed. 3. The following Table represents the Births which have been registered during the year. Neither this nor previous similar Tables represent all the births that have taken place in the Parish. Many are never registered at all; nor will any improvement in this respect ever take place until the law relating to Registration is amended, by rendering the registration of all births compulsory. There is, however, no reason to assume that more births are left unregistered in any one year than in any other, or that the neglect of registration is more flagrant here than in any other parts of the Metropolis— 1863.

If, then, our population has increased by 5 per cent., as estimated, it must chiefly have been by immigration from other places—a circumstance which, as I have formerly shown (Fifth Annual Report, 1860), tends to augment our death rate. It is again observable that, contrary to the ordinary rule, the number of female births exceeded that of the males, although very slightly. The number of persons who sought medical relief from the Parochial Surgeons, and at the Institutions from which I receive regular returns, was 32,426. DISTRICT MORTALITY. 4. Table II shows how the mortality was distributed among the several Districts into which I have found it convenient to divide our Parish for sanitary purposes, and also enables you to compare the mortality this year with that of previous years in each of them. It will be observed that while, as might be anticipated with certainty, the increase has been most remarkable in those which are known to be growing moBt rapidly in population, there are few in which some increase has not taken place. In the Table below I have arranged the death rate per 1000 living (in 1861) in order, placing those Districts at the head of each column in which it has been highest, and throwing them (as on former occasions) into groups of Districts. I have added, also, a column to show the death rate of 1862, for the purpose of comparison. The Districts marked*are those in which new houses were chieflv beinsr erected at the time of the Census. The death rate as calculated for all, but principally for these, will be more or less considerably in excess of the truth—how much in excess any one of you can judge as closely as I can. Group 1.

The Second Group embraces those with a more mixed population, of which the numbers are singly underlined on the map. . The Third, Group embraces those with a population more or less poor and negligent, doubly underlined on the map. 6 It is to be observed in this Table—1°. That the increased death rate mainly took effect in the 2nd and 3rd groups. If the true population of the Districts in Group I could be known, it is not unlikely that the apparent increase would turn out altogether deceptive. 2°. That in the first group, Duncan and Hornsey Road Districts alone presented a death rate lower than that of the previous year. This is the more remarkable in the latter instance, on account of the very great increase in the population in this District during the past year. In the second group, Highbury Vale and Trinity Districts were alone similarly favored. As respects Highbury Vale, it is important and interesting to notice how steadily the death rate has been lessening since the abolition of the open Hackney Brook Sewer, and the improvements which have been since carried out in the house drainage. In 1860, the deaths in that District were 23; in 1861, 19 ; in 1862, 17; and last year, 16. The Table shows that Highbury Yale, which used to be a favorite haunt of fevers, stood last year as the most healthy District of the second group, and was on a level with the best Districts of the first group. 3°. That the District of the Irish Courts, the death rate of which has always been the highest or next to the highest of all, exhibited last year a death rate which no other has yet attained, viz., 42 per 1,000 living. Contrast the deaths in'this District for a moment with those of the District immediately adjoining—Duncan District; The latter contains a population of about 800, while the population of the Irish Courts District is only about 200 more. Yet in the Duncan District there were but 5 deaths, and not one of those under 5 years of age, while in the Irish Courts District there were nine times as maDy deaths, and more than half of these were of young children. 5. The Irish Courts constitute a typical District. They exhibit, in a small, circumscribed area, the fatal operation of those causes of disease which it is the province of a local Sanitary Board to see removed—of conditions which operate with equal certainty in other parts of Islington, as well as elsewhere, and only less demonstrably because the instances of their occurrence are more scattered, and because the conditions themselves are not always combined in the same manner. The opportunity of tracing out the relation between premature death from what is clearly avoidable disease and the local conditions referred to, as presented by the fearful death rate of these Courts during the year, is one which ought not to be passed by. I propose, however, to consider the mortality in these courts as it has occurred during a period of four years, (in one instance only during two years), during which the local conditions and the character of the population have been pretty much the same. When it is said that these courts are inhabited mainly by low Irish, it will at once be understood that the people are dirty in their habits, that personal and domestic proprieties have no place in their system of life, and that social irregularities of all kinds abound. Still there are grades even among the low Irish, and it is obvious to any one visiting these courts that, on the whole, a superior grade of persons occupy Smith's Buildings (or at any rate a part of them), to those which have taken up their abode in Rose and Crown Court, and that these again are not nearly so filthy in their habits as the inhabitants of Waters Court. Great improvements have taken place in these courts since I first knew them and visited the poor in them 26 or 27 years ago, and still further improvements have been made, although at the expenditure of an infinity of trouble, during the period of my tenure of office; but it will be seen that much, very much, still remains to be accomplished. I believe all that is requisite may be accomplished by the exercise of patience and determination. 7 Bose and Crown Court comes first. The houses, mostly with two, but some with three rooms, lie on three sides of a quadrilateral paved court; the fourth side (the shortest) formed by a high wall, against which are three panned privies, which, not being supplied with water, are constantly being choked up, and the corners of which are used as common urinals. The sixteen houses consist altogether of 37 rooms; No. 16 consists of a single room. The court is entered by a low arched passage between Nos. 9 and 10, Rufford's Buildings. At one side of the entrance of the court is No. 16, and at the other side No. 1, beside and partly beneath which is a much used and never over clean slaughter house. There are other panned privies in the court, but less used and cleaner than those mentioned. The dust and refuse is deposited (or ought to be) in an open receptacle at the entrance of the court. The only water supply hitherto has been by a butt holding about 110 gallons. Supposing this filled every day, which is not the case, there would be less than a gallon per head of the inhabitants for all purposes. The rooms are all small and low, and the only houses which have any effective provision for ventilation through them are Nos. 4, 5, 9 and 10. The population of these 37 little rooms in May last year was 124, of whom 19 were children under 5 years of age. A similar number occupied the court in 1856. Now in the last four years there have died in the court 19 persons—that is between 15 and 16 per cent, of the population. Of these, 13 were infants under 5 years of age. Six years, then, would suffice to clear the court of young children. It is these little ones, then, that are thus shown to suffer most decidedly from the dirt, closeness, bad effluvia and neglect which reign in this place. We shall find the same result in other courts. Of the deaths of young children, one occurred at No. 2, on the one side of the slaughter house, and two at No. 16, opposite the slaughter house; three in No. 6, which is one of the worst ventilated houses in the court, with a privy, formerly a cesspool, against its back wall; two at No. 7, one at No. 8, two at No. 11, which has two of the filthy- privies close to its door and windows, and one at No. 13, adjoining a privy. Three out of four deaths from diarrhoea occurred in the houses which were most exposed to privy effluvia, and the fourth in the house beneath part of which the slaughterhouse extends. At No. 16, the single roomed, dark, unventilated habitation opposite the slaughterhouse, there were altogether three deaths, one of them from consumption. We shall again see this connection between diarrhoea and privy emanations on the one hand, and consumption and darkness and bad ventilation on the other, brought out when speaking of other cour ts. It is right to state here that since the commencement of the present year this property has chaDged hands, and several improvements have been effected. Smith's Buildings is in the form of the letter T. To understand the lesson taught by the mortality here, a distinction must be drawn between the houses at the entrance of the court (the upright part of the T), and those represented by the cross part of the T. There are altogether 25 houses in this court, and of these the houses numbered from 10 to 19 lie in the cross portion. These houses alone have a thoroughly satisfactory ventilation through them. The tenants of the houses from 6 to 22 appear to be cleaner and more decent than those occupying the other houses. Every house has its own panned privy, not supplied with water. The rooms are every where small and low. The water supply has of late been tolerably good, a constant supply by means of Jenning's apparatus having been furnished. But for some reason this supply 8 is not available except during specified hours, and only for a very short time on Sundays. Smith's Buildings contains a population of about 140, of whom 31 are children under five years of age. During four years 28 persons have died in the court, or 20 per cent, of the population. Of these, 18 were infants under 5 years of age, so that, taken altogether, the children, though dying off at the rate of 58 per cent, every four years, do not die so quickly as in Rose and Crown Court. But here we must make a distinction : of all the 28 deaths, 18 occured in the eight houses, Nos. 1 to 5 and Nos. 23, 24 and 25, all in the first part of the court; and of these 11 were infants. Now these eight houses, the dirtiest and loivest as respects their occupants of any in the court, contain about 64 persons, of whom 9 are infants under five years of age. The mortality, then, in this part of the court comes to this—that it represents a death rate of 28 per cent, in four years, and that young infants will not live there. Contrast with this the mortality in the 10 well ventilated houses, Nos. 10 to 19. In these during the four years there only occurred four deaths, and of these only two were young infants. In these ten houses there was not a single death from zymotic disease of any kind. The four years mortality at Nos. 7 and 8 in the cross portion of the court is instructive. These are by no means dirty houses, but in their immediate rear and close to their back door are situated six privies, formerly cesspools, and the houses have no proper ventilation through them. In No. 8, three deaths occurred, two of infants from disease of the zymotic class, one being from measles, and at No. 7 there was another death from measles. The only other death from measles in the court occurred at No. 25, which is so situated as to have two privies in its rear, the emanations from which cannot fail to enter the house. In No. 25, three infants died of zymotic maladies, and one from tuberculous disease. Smith's Place, a little court of four two-roomed houses and a population of 15 persons,. which communicates by an arched passage with Smith's Buildings, presents another remarkable and instructive contrast. Three deaths have occurred here during the four years—ail of them, two being infants, in the two houses Nos. 1 and 2. Now these houses are excessively dark, and each has a panned privy, but not supplied with water, practically speaking, within the house, and there is no proper ventilation to sweep away the effluvia which must arise from them. Two of the deaths were from diseases of the tubercular class, one being consumption, thus bearing evidence to the character of the dwellings. The other was a death from hooping cough. Nos. 3Jand 4, where no death occurred, are houses of the same size, but light and thoroughly ventilated. Again, contrast these two last mentioned houses with the houses Nos. 7 and 8, Smith's Buildings, which are in their rear, a group of four privies separating them. In the well ventilated houses no death resulted, while in the badly ventilated, four deaths occurred, of which three were from zymotic causes. We have seen here more than one experimentum crucis. Swan Yard and Parsell's Court constitute one group of buildings, the houses of one side of Parsell's Court separating this court from Swan Yard. Swan Yard consists of a narrow passage with six houses on the South side; with the exception of No. 6, there is no proper ventilation through any of them. There is a privy opposite No. 3, and a group of horrible privies (partly belonging to Parsell's Court) opposite No. 6. The population may be stated at 51 persons, of whom 8 are under five years of age. During the two years 1862 and 1863, No. 4 is the pnly house which escaped some mortality. Altogether 12 deaths occurred in the court, 9 that is to say, about 23 per cent, of the population died off. Of these nine were infants under five years of age, and one half of the deaths were due to measles or some other form of zymotic disease. This court is, then, as fatal to young infants as is the first part of Smith's Buildings; they cannot live there—all that are bom there or are brought to reside there are doomed to die within two years. Parsell's Court is a narrow court with five houses on each side, and entered by a narrow arched passage from the High Street. The rooms are all small and low. The only house which has any ventilation at all through it is No. 10. At the further extremity of the court, opposite No. 5, is a common privy designed for the use of four persons at once, disgustingly filthy, and an open dust bin. Nos. 3, 6 and 10 are the only houses which death has not visited during the last four years. The population is 104 of whom 16 are under five years of age. The people are dirty in their habits and houses. The total number of deaths in the four years was 23, or over 22 per cent. Of these 14 were of infants under five years of age. So here, again, the chances of an infant living four years in the court are exceedingly small. The largest number of deaths, namely, six in the four years, occurred in No. 5, opposite the common privy; four of these deaths were of infants, one death was from small pox, and the only death from diarrhoea occurred in this house. No. 1 is an intensely dark house besides being badly ventilated, and here three deaths occurred, of which two were infants, from some form of pulmonary disease. Another contrast. Nos. 8, 9 and 10, form the sides of a little blind passage on one side of the court. In No. 10, which is tolerably ventilated, no deaths occurred, while in Nos. 8 and 9, which are dark and badly ventilated, three deaths occurred, of which two were due to consumption. No less than five deaths from tuberculous disease of one kind or another occurred in this dark, unventilated court. Water's Court i3 the last to be noticed, and the phenomena it has presented during the past four years are such as, if standing alone, would suffice to demonstrate the fatal operation of the several causes of disease whioli I have been tracing out in the preceding instances. The court is very much of the size and shape of Rose and Crown Court. It is entered by a tolerably wide covered passage from the High-street. The houses lie on three sides of an irregul ar quadrangle. Those on the South side, numbered from 1 to 5, are in the same lino as the entrance passage; the eastern side is occupied by a high wall, and there are houses numbered from 6 to 15 on the remaining two sides. None of the houses have any ventilation through them. The rooms are very small; they vary in capacity from about 830 to 1,600 cubic feet, but however small, we almost contantly find each room occupied by a family. The rooms in Nos. 6 and 7, and No. 15, appear the smallest of any, and during the past year we have found in single rooms of these houses, families numbering from four to six persons, exclusive of friends now and then accommodated for the night. Thus occupied we have found as little as 147 cubic feet of air allotted to each inhabitant of a room measuring 18 feet long by 7 feet wide by 7 feet high. None of the houses are particularly well lighted, but Nos. 12 and 15 some rooms are so dark that a person entering must often remain some minutes before he can clearly distinguish their contents. At the further end of the South side of the court is the common privy, than which I can conceive of nothing much more disgusting. It consists of an iron tank intended to hold water, but never containing any, and seats of the ordinary character are dispensed with as a luxury the low Irish of this court did not appreciate. Even the tank appeals superfluous, 10 in asmuch as a preference is shown for the floor and the doorway, while slops intended for the tank are often thrown in so carelessly at the entrance of the privy as to be spattered over the walls. I can never approach these privies without being horribly sickened, and members of the Sanitary Committee who have visited the place with me can testify to similar effects upon themselves. Above the privies is placed the water tank for the supply of the court, in which I have been credibly informed the boys of the court have been seen batbing in the summer time, so that, besides absorbing the foul gases from beneath, the water acquires occasionally another equally indescribable pollution. The drain from the privies runs beneath No. 6, and the surface of the court is never clean for many hours after being swept up by the Contractor. The population of the court is about 130. This is not so high as it used to be, on account of our frequent interference to abate over-crowding; in 1856 it was 150. Out of the entire population we found 32 to be infants under 5 years of age. The deaths during the four years amounted to 31, or nearly a quarter of the population. Nineteen of those which died were infants under 5 years of age. And now I must call your attention to the distribution of these deaths. The only houses which have had no death in them for four years are Nos. 1, 2 and 3. These houses receive the only pure air that enters the court from the passage into the High-street, the prevalent winds sweeping their face and then whirling round the court carry the effluvia from the privies to the houses 6, 7, 8, 9, <fcc. Corresponding with this course of the current of air and the situation of the privies,vie find the distribution of the mortality, and especially of that from zymotic causes, and in the most marked degree, from certain particular forms of zymotic disease. There were single deaths (not of infants) in Nos. 4, 13 and 14 which we may pass over for the moment, to concentrate attention upon No. 5 on the South side, and upon Nos. 6 to 11 on the North side. In all these houses there were one or more deaths from zymotic disease of some kind, but in no others, with the exception of No. 12, to be separately considered. In No. 5 there were four deaths; two of them of infants, one dying from measles and the other from hooping cough. This iB the house against the side of which the filthy privy is placed. No. 0 (the smallest roomed and most crowded house in the court), is situated directly facing the privy, at a distance of a few paces from it. In this house three deaths occurred, ail from some form of zymotic disease, viz., one from childbed fever, one from diphtheria, and one from diarrhoea. At No. 7, next door to it, three deaths also occurred, one from a pulmonary affection, one from consumption and one from cholera. The only two deaths, then, in the court referred to bowel complaints, occurred in the two houses most exposed to the privy effluvia. At No. 8, two zymotic deaths occurred (one of an infant), viz., one from diphtheria and the other from measles. At No. 9, two infants died, one from scarlet fever. At No. 10 three persons died, two being infants, and one of the deaths was from small pox. At No. 11 two deaths occurred, one from consumption and one of an infant from scarlet fever. And now for Nos. 12 and 15, the two darkest houses in the court—and darkness implies, be it recollected, invariably two other things, very bad ventilation and an abundance of dirt. In No. 15, small and over-crowded, there occurred 5 deaths, four of them of infants, but here the special conditions present produced not zymotic but tubercular disease. Two of the deaths were referred to consumption, the highest manifestation of this class of maladies, and another was from some other form of tubercular affection. A fourth death was referred to disease of the chest of an acute kind. In No. 12 four 11 deaths occurred, three of them tuberculous (one being consumption) ; the fourth death was from small pox of a highly malignant petechial or putrid type. From time to time, during the past eight years, these courts have been visited and reported upon by myself to the Sanitary Committee, and, bad as they are now, their condition is not so bad as they were when first I took them in hand; there is less overcrowding, a better supply of water to most of them, and some improvements have been made in the privies, though by no means all that ought to have been made. It is true that the powers conferred by the Nuisances' Removal Act are not so complete as one might desire when coping with such aggravated nuisances as are presented by these courts, but I do not think that we have yet put this Statute to all the use it is capable of. Landlords of such property as this will rarely do anything out of consideration for the health or lives of their tenants; compulsion alone will extort amendments. What is needed here is the closure of the fatal houses until made fit for human habitation, and this is a proceeding which the Justices properly enough are unwilling to direct, except where the demonstration of unhealthiness is most convincing. I cannot but think you will consider that, in these instances, the demonstration requisite for such action is now complete. CAUSES OF DEATH. 6. Table I shows the causes of death of 3,854 persons who died in the Parish during the 53 weeks. Referring to this Table for such particulars as may be desired, I shall, on this occasion, only enter at length upon the subject of the two zymotic maladies whose prevalence has chiefly characterised the year. Small Pox commenced with us as an epidemic towards the close of 1862. During the last three months of that year I obtained information of the occurrence of 68 cases and 12 deaths. During 1863, 509 cases occurred in the practice of the Parochial Surgeons, and of those institutions which furnish me with Returns. The cases occurred and deaths were registered, month by month, as follows— Cases Returned. Deaths Registered. January 25 9 February 32 3 March 40 13 April 60 10 May 134 15 Juno 105 23 July 25 4 August 31 7 September 17 13 October 16 5 November 10 3 December 14 3 509 108 The disease then extended gradually among our population during the four first months of the year, burst out into its chief severity in May, continued to prevail during June, and then in July suddenly became reduced, so that the number of cases 12 that occurred only amounted to one-fourth of the number that occurred in the previous month. A very slight increase in August was followed by a marked decline in the epidemic. The deaths that were registered during the year amounted to 108. This, then, has proved a far more severe outbreak of small pox than that which signalised the years 1859-60. During those two years I obtained information of only 272 cases and 46 deaths, while during the 15 months of the recent outbreak, 577 cases and 120 deaths came to my knowledge. Although, as appears from Table II, the disease was spread over nearly all parts of the parish, it fell with greatest severity upon the districts in the extreme north of the Parish, where the Small Pox Hospital is situated; the Queen's-road District, where but few houses altogether escaped the visitation; Lower Holloway; the streets to the west of the Caledonian-road, and those in the neighbourhood of Battle-bridge ; the Kingsland District; Balls-pond District, in one street of which I was informed not a house escaped invasion; the streets to the south of the Lower-road, and the Irish courts. The epidemic fell upon vaccinated persons as well as upon those who were unvaccinated. But the character of the attacks undergone by these two classes was widely different. Among the former, the disease appeared in a modified form —so modified, indeed, in some of the cases, that I saw that it was little more than an ailment almost as trifling as a common cold. Some of these cases, indeed, were regarded as merely cases of chicken pox. On those who were unvaccinated, on the other hand, it fell heavily, malignant and petechial cases appearing from time to time where the locality of the patient, and the conditions under which he was placed, favoured such a course in the disease. The influence of vaccination in controlling the epidemic is seen in part in the returns which I made of fatal cases in my Monthly Reports. Of the 120 deaths, there were 87 in which the previous vaccination of the deceased or its neglect was noted. Out of the 87, there were 57 who had never been vaccinated at all, while 30 are stated to have been vaccinated ; but of these 30 there was not one whose vaccination had been such as was satisfactory. Nine of them presented on the arm only one vaccine cicatrix, and of these there were but four in which the single scar could be regarded as satisfactory in its character. Ten of them presented on the arm only 2 vaccine cicatrices, and in some of these cases the scars are stated to have been "indifferent" in character, or "small" and badly marked. One only presented three imperfect cicatrices, one four imperfect cicatrices, and one is stated to have been imperfectly vaccinated in Lombardy, where recent revelations appear to show that negligence in the performance of the operation is rather the rule than the exception. Of the remaining eight, two were vaccinated after the poison of the small pox had been imbibed and the mischief done; two, aged 43 years and 26 years, respectively, had not been vaccinated since they were infants; in one, although vaccination had been performed, the effect of the operation was not ascertained, and three were reported to have been vaccinated, but showed no evidence of it on examination of the arm. So far, then, as Islington is concerned, one thing is quite clear, namely, that although vaccinated persons suffered from the epidemic, small pox appeared in them in a modified form, and not one who had passed satisfactorily through the protective malady died of small pox. The first measures adopted to meet the threatened epidemic were taken in December, 1862, when I forwarded to the Board of Trustees a copy of a memorandum upon the subject, which I had previously laid before your Sanitary Committee, and which 13 embraced a series of recommendations, the majority of which they adopted. Handbills, urging the people to seek protective vaccination, were circulated throughout the Districts and streets where the the disease mostly prevailed, and left by the distributors at each house, and often with each family in a house; the Medical Officers under the control of the Trustees were directed to urge, in all cases, the removal of small-pox patients to the hospital, and to vaccinate all that they found unprotected in infected houses. These gentlemen also undertook the examination of the arms of the children attending the charitable schools in their several Districts, a task which I was on this occasion unable to undertake myself. As in the former epidemic, the Trustees further appointed Mr. Thompson to act as Vaccine Inspector, his duty being to assist in the examination of the schools, to visit and report to me as to the condition of localities where small pox broke out, to vaccinate where he could do so without interfering with the permanent vaccinators, and to ascertain the vaccination of about 4,000 children born during the previous year, and whose vaccination had not been returned, as it ought to have been, to the District Registrars. All this agitation gave a marked impetus to vaccination among all classes of the population, and re-vaccination was sought to an extent quite unparalleled in the experience of our medical practitioners. Indeed, towards the close of April, most of the private practitioners were in this difficulty, that their primary vaccinations, from which alone they could take lymph for the vaccination of others, bore no sufficient proportion to the re vaccinations which they were called upon to perform. The stock of dry lymph at the National Vaccine Establishment was exhausted, and it daily happened that one practitioner or another had to seek for a supply from his friends at great loss of time and trouble. I felt that I was then called upon to step into the breach, and I immediately established at my own residence a depot for dry lymph which I obtained from the District Vaccinators, who most kindly assisted my efforts, and from such private practitioners as had performed primary vaccinations and could obtain lymph from the arms of healthy children. During the whole time of the greatest pressure I was thus enabled to supply all that were in need and refused no one, giving to each applicant the full quantity he required. During the month of May alone, when the epidemic was at its height, I supplied 517 charges of lymph. As the epidemic spread, the question arose as to the best mode of providing for the isolation of the cases, and this was determined, I believe wisely and economically, by an agreement with the Small Pox Hospital, under which no patient sent from our Parish should under any oircumstances be refused. Altogether 267 cases were sent to the Hospital between November, 1862, and December, 1863, at an expense to the Parish of £677. This was money well spent, for no one can tell the damage which these cases might have effected by spreading the disease, while the expense of providing special hospital accommodation with the requisite staff would have exceeded double this sum. The ambulances established some years ago did good service; at one time the daily cases to be sent were so numerous, that all three ambulances were simultaneously in use. As respects myself I may state that I kept up, during the severity of the epidemic, personal visits to those localities where the epidemic was most severe, and frequently in the evenings called upon the Parochial Officers to ascertain that all the cases which had occurred during the day were transmitted to the hospital. In addition, I met those gentlemen for conference one day in the week at the Vestry Hall, and I should be deficient in common lionesti did I not express my sense of the courteous and cordial 14 manner in which throughout this period they assisted me by their efforts and by their opinions upon points of practical detail. Scarlet Fever prevailed also as an epidemic through the year. Between January and June, from 43 to 47 cases occurred monthly in the practice of those Officers and Institutions which furnish me with returns. In July there were 80 cases, and the numbers varied between this and 90 cases until November, when they fell to 30, 55 occurring in December. The total number of cases was 072 and the total mortality 392. This disease has also (like small pox) been more prevalent and more fatal than in 1859, when the cases returned to me were 472, and the deaths amounted to only 210. Unhappily we do not possess against this disease the same protection that we have against small pox, nor will the most anxious precautions prevent in all cases the access of the subtle poison of scarlet fever to families; and when it does enter them its fatality is determined very much by family constitution. At the same time, as I have frequently pointed out, unsanitary conditions very decidedly aggravate the malady, while carelessness during convalescence brings about secondary diseases, which carry off such as the primary disease may have spared. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR. 7. Table IV represents the sanitary work of the year, as relates to the inspection and amendment of dwellings. A great part of these amendments were carried out as usual without the necessity of legal proceedings, but in several instances summonses were taken out to enforce the disuse of unhealthy underground rooms for sleeping purposes, the abatement of over-crowding, and the cleansing and draining of dwelling-houses. I must allude to one of these cases. In the rear of Nos. 13, 14, 15, and 10, Brandstreet is a small common court-yard, at the end of which has been erected recently, and without notice to the Vestry, a row of small single roomed huts, originally, it is said, built for wash-houses, but really adapted to use as separate dwellings. They are in direct contravention of the 29th Section of the Building Act—one of its sanitary Sections. Each was occupied by a single family, the capacity of the rooms being sufficient only to allow about 150 cubic feet of breathing space per head. As this condition of things was the fault of an officer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, if of any one, a representation was made to them. No steps, however, were taken by the Board to enforce the law, and still these places continue to be occupied. Small Pox broke out in these huts, as might have been anticipated, with fatal results. Proceedings taken by the Sanitary Committee, under the Nuisances' Removal Act, have not been able to touch the over-crowding, nor yet to remove the principal grounds of complaint, because each single roomed hut of about 700 cubic feet capacity constitutes a house occupied by no more than a single family. Is there really no remedy for all this ? 8. The house improvements, carried out under the supervision of our Inspectors, are detailed in Table IV. The sanitary condition of 750 houses altogether was inquired into during the year, and, in addition to such amendments being effected as the re-construction and repair of drains, the abolition of 72 cesspools, the panning, trapping and supply of water to 209 privies and closets, the construction and covering of dust bins, paving and draining of wet yards, improvements in the domestic water supply of 152 houses, and house cleansing and ventilation, over crowding of tenements has been abated in 53 instances, and 33 under-ground rooms, unhealthily 15 occupied as dwellings by separate families, have been cleared of their tenants. It is in the cases of over-crowding and underground tenements that we have the most frequent occasion to have recourse to legal proceedings at the Police Court. 9. I stated in my last Report that the licences for cow-houses in 1862 were in many cases granted upon the understanding that the requsite amendments in their condition were to be forthwith carried out. In some of these cases the necessary work was honorably performed, but there were others in which nothing had been done up to the time when the annual period of licensing recurred. Several slaughter houses also, which had been licensed in former years, were in an unsatisfactory condition. There were also several applications for licences both to newly established slaughter houses and to new cow sheds. As respects the latter, the Magistrates had expressed a determination to be more strict in their requirements than on occasion of the primary licensing, and the proceedings of this year would thus necessarily form a precedent for future years. I therefore laid before the Sanitary Committee my views upon the subject, which constituted a basis on which they made their own determination upon each case. All the new sheds and slaughter houses were visited by the Committee as well as such of those already licensed as gave me dissatisfaction. All those which were not satisfactory at the time of the Committee's visit were directed to be opposed, but by the day appointed several of these had made the necessary alterations; in other cases the licence was withheld until I had certified to the Magistrates that my requirements had been fulfilled. Two of the Magistrates visited those whose licensing was opposed by the "Vestry. Among the slaughter houses formerly licensed, the first refused was that of Mr. Brooker, in Shepperton Street, on the ground of the frequent seizures of diseased meat made during the year, indicating that the place was used for an improper purpose; The renewal of Mr. Wace's licence for his slaughter house in Theberton Street was refused on the ground that it had been made a public slaughter house and had become a nuisance to the neighbourhood. The only cow house for which a renewal of the licence was refused was that of Mr. Ellis, in Bryan Yale. It was a most disgusting place, filthy, undrained and confined, and had during the whole year been a source of great annoyance to the neighbours. In addition to these, the licence was finally refused to one new cow house and two new slaughter houses, which were quite unfit for the purpose. It has been necessary on three occasions to take proceedings for slaughtering and cow-keeping without a licence. One was the case of Mr. Roads, 1, City Terrace, Hornsey Road, who had refused to obtain a licence at all. His cow shed was in excellent condition, but it was considered that the supremacy of the law must be vindicated. He was fined 20s. and took out his licence in a regular way at Michaelmas. Ellis, of Bryan Vale, having refused to remove his cows on his licence not being renewed was also summonsed and convicted, the cow sheds being finally abandoned. The third case was that of Mr. Filmer, who was summonsed for slaughtering in a back kitchen or area, at 318, Caledonian Road, a place for which a licence had been sought but refused. He was fined 20s. 10. Adulteration of Food. In the latter part of 18G2, I received several articles of food for analysis, from a Society which had been established for the suppression of food adulteration. These articles were bread, beer, gin and cocoa, in respect of which I gave the needful certificate, but no action was taken by the Society. I have also several times been applied to by individual parishioners to undertake analysis, 16 chiefly of bread and beer, but have declined on the ground of the applicants not having complied with that Section of the Act, which, in fairness to the seller, ought to be strictly enforced, and which directs that he shall be informed that the article purchased was about to be taken to the analyst, or else that no warrantry of purity had been given such as would form the basis of proceedings at a Police Court. As a criminal statute this Act has broken down. Its enactment has exercised a moral influence, but as a means of punishing delinquents it is inoperative. No steps have yet been taken to carry out the provisions of the Bakehouses Act. 11. Diseased and unwholesome Meat has been seized by the Inspectors in the following intances— 1. At a slaughter house, 4, Brandon-road, four quarters of beef, weighing 618 lbs. It was condemned by the Magistrate, and the owner, Mr. Wheeler, was summonsed to the Police Court, and convicted in costs. 2. At the licensed slaughter house of Mr. Wace, in Theberton-street, the carcase of a diseased cow, weighing 282 lbs., was seized and condemned. On the hearing of the summons a conviction in costs was obtained. 3. At the licensed slaughter house of Mr. Brooker, 5, Shepperton-street, diseased meat has, during the year, been seized on three occasions, and condemned by the Magistrate. On the first occasion four quarters of beef, weighing 336 lbs., dressed in the same manner as it would be if prepared for food. At the hearing, on June 12th, the summQns was dismissed on the ground of there not being sufficient evidence that it was prepared for food. On August 19th, another seizure was made of the carcase of a diseased cow, weighing 3 cwts. It was dressed as for the butcher. On the hearing of the summons, the person who sent the cow for slaughtering stated that liis directions were, that if anything was found to be wrong it was to go to the boilers. This summons, therefore, was also dismissed, but without costs, the Magistrate stating his opinion that it was a very proper case for the Vestry to take up. The third occasion was in September, when 25 pieces of salted meat, 140 lbs. (beef and pork), concealed in a loft in the slaughter houses, were seized and condemned. This meat was putrid, and believed to be destined for the manufacture of German sausages by a person in the neighbourhood; as no excuse for this could be set up, Brooker was convicted at last in costs and a fine inflicted of £10 or 2 months' imprisonment. 4. At a shop in South-place, a large quantity of putrid meat exposed for sale was seized and destroyed with the consent of the owner. As the shop was subseqiiently closed no proceedings were taken. 5. At a German sausage manufactory, 7, George-street, New North-road, kept by Mr. Peck, 360 lbs. of diseased meat in course of being manufactured into sausages, were seized and condemned on October 3rd. The Sanitary Committee taking a lenient view of the case did not prosecute. A few days later, namely, on October 8th, 1051bs. of meat, still more diseased and very putrid, were seized by Mr. Dunham in the same 17 place and condemned. On the summons being heard Peck was convicted, and fined £15 or two months' imprisonment in the House of Correction. It was suspected although not proved that Peck and Brooker were connected in business, and if so the Vestry may congratulate itself upon the result of the proceedings. I have the honor to bo, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., M.R.C.P., etc. Medical Offictr of Health. Vestry Offices, April 4th, 1864. TABLE I.
