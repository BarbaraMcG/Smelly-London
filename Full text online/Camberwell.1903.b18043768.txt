CAM 10 Borough of Camberwell. Jown Hall Camberwell. S.E. 2nd Dic- 1904 With the Compliments of the Medical Officer of Health Sibranan Medical Association Sibrary 429 Strand W.C. Appendix I. to Annual Report. Report of the Medical Officer of health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Camberwell. Gentlemen, —The population of London as calculated to the middle of 1903 by the Registrar-General is 4,613,812, showing an increase of 34,702 over the year 1902. The various rates for the births, deaths and marriages depend for their value as statistics on the accuracy of this estimate. In the 52 weeks ending January 2nd, 1904, 130,906 births were registered in the County of London compared with 132,810 in 1902; there were 80,430 persons married, a decrease of 1,204; and 72,109 deaths occurred, compared with 82,540 in 1902. The year 1902, however, for statistical purposes contained 53 weeks, so that the figures are not altogether comparable. The greater length, however, of that year is not sufficient to explain the great diminution .in the number of deaths, which led to a decrease in the death rate of about two per thousand for the whole county, while it is over three per thousand on the average of the past ten years. With the increased building operations that are going on in certain parts of the Borough and also with the clearing away of inhabited houses in other divisions, the estimation of the population of the Borough and its sub-districts becomes an increasing difficulty. There are two ways that perhaps are the most accurate, one, to assume that the Borough and its sub-districts are increasing in population to the same extent that they did in the years 1896-1901; the other to take the number of houses assessed to the rates, and to find out what was the proportion of inhabitants per assessment at the time of the Census in April, 1901. The estimation by assessment seems to me to be more likely to give accurate results, for if we go on the other plan St. George's district would show a decrease which would amount to no inconsiderable number in the course of the inter- censal period, while other parts of the Parish are opening up more rapidly than they did between 1896-1901. I therefore have calculated the population on the second plan, and from this I have also deduced the birth and death rate, but for the purposes of comparison I have appended the results of the first method.

It is therefore necessary to subtract the former and add the latter. The net result as set out in Table D indicates that 3,629 deaths represent the mortality of inhabitants of the Borough. The deaths are classified under the headings of the various districts in the case of those parishioners who die in the parish, as also are those who die in institutions to which they have been removed from an address which is known to us. It not infrequently happens that a person dies in an institution either inside or outside the parish, and all the information we can get as to his previous address is the fact that he was removed from some part of Camberwell Borough. Such deaths we have been obliged to treat as a class apart, iii. and to re-distribute them to the various sub-districts in proportion to the number of deaths already ascribed to them. This will act with some little unfairness towards Dulwich, since the previous address of a person removed from that division is more likely to be known than that of some one, say, from parts of No. 1 Ward, but the fewness of such deaths will make no appreciable difference.

The temperature during the first three months of the year was considerably above the average, the excess amounting in February to 5.5 degrees; while the temperature of the summer months was below the average. The excessive rainfall is so fresh in the minds of every one that it needs no further mention. All these factors played a considerable part in the reduction of the mortality. The mild winter and the low temperature of the summer helped the old and the young, while the excessive rainfall, by constant flushing of the drains and wastes, helped in the raising of the general standard of health. Total The deaths of those under one year and those over 65 have largely decreased, as will be seen by the following table; and it is well known that the mortality among these two classes is the one that, in the absence of a serious epidemic, exerts a pronounced influence on the death rate.

Camberwell 13.7 VI. Deptford 14.9 VII. 14.2 Battersea VIII. Lambeth 15.2 IX. Southwark 18.1 X. Bermondsey 18.4 Since age and sex distribution vary in different towns, and on account of this fact being an important consideration in comparing the death-rate of one town with another, it is necessary to multiply by the factor for correction. This for Camberwell, as ascertained in the census of 1901, is 1·03788, so that the corrected death rate is 14·32, and in contrasting deaths in Camberwell with any other town this number should be used. The number of notifications received during the year amounted to 1,466, including duplicates, but excluding 20 of chicken-pox. After eliminating double notifications so far as is possible the total is 1,407, compared with the corrected total of 2,789 in 1902. The scarlet fever cases, which were 1,306 in 1902, last year fell to 667, but the case fatality has diminished in a still greater degree, there being only 11 deaths, contrasted with 44 in the previous year. The decrease has affected all the registration sub-districts, but has been more especially marked in Camberwell. Diphtheria shows a decrease equally marked, the number being over 300 less than last year, Dulwich alone of the sub-districts having shown an increase. A corresponding diminution in these two diseases was shown in practically all the South London boroughs. While the increasing use of diphtheria anti-toxin and the early measures that are now taken in treating an attack may account for the diminished fatality, it does not seem possible to ascribe the corresponding diminution in that of scarlet fever to any other reason than a change either in the type of the disease, or the growing up among us of a population more resistive to its attacks. Notifications and Case Mortality of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Scarlet Fever. Year. Notified. Mortality per cent. Notified.

The notifications were of those especially from the baby class, who occupy a separate room from the older scholars. From the throats of children attending this latter class I took swabs at random and forwarded them to the Bacteriologist; the result, however, in the majority of cases was negative. I did not, therefore, feel justified in recommending that the school as a whole should be closed, except for the purpose of disinfection. But I advised the exclusion of the relatives not only of the patients but also of the others who attended the baby class, in addition to those who were found, on bacteriological examination, to be affected. The disease in the majority of cases was of an exceedingly mild type. As a result of my advice the school was closed for a period of three weeks by order of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee. The result was eminently satisfactory, for the disease showed a marked diminution, and since then has not been remarkable for its prevalence in that neighbourhood. Between November 21st and December 4th there was a marked increase in the number of enteric fever cases certified. Careful inquiry was made into all possible sources of infection but without discovery of any suspicious article of food which affected the majority of the cases ; indeed, the only circumstance common to nearly all was that they drew their water supply from the Southwark and vauxhall Water Company's mains. The number of cases was not large enough to state definitely that the water was the source of contagion, but the date of infection in these cases that I have specially referred to coincides with a period when the examining chemist reports a particularly bad state of this company's water. For the rest of the year, however, the notifications showed a marked lessening from those mentioned in my previous report and were accompanied by a corresponding diminution in the number of deaths, there being only 18 compared with 29 in the previous year, the falling off being especially noticeable in Peckham and St. George's. Measles caused 75 deaths as compared with 109 in 1902; 13 of these occurred in Camberwell, 21 in Peckham and 41 in St. George's. On April 1st, 1903, the new ordinances of the London County Council in reference to dealing with this disease came into force. It will be remembered that by their action, practically all the sections of the Public Health Act which related to infectious diseases were made applicable to measles, with the exception of that relating to its notification. Since this date a record has been kept of all cases of which we received intimation, which were almost invariably from the schools. At first we received some information from medical men in attendance, but they subsequently rightly decided not to notify unless the fee that is paid in the other infectious diseases was also forwarded in this. We not infrequently found that the patient had been ill some time previously and was now quite well; indeed it was by no means uncommon to disinfect on the same day that the notification was received, the patient having recovered. A reason for this is that on Saturday morning during school term we get a large number of notifications, usually equalling in number those received during the previous week, and consisting of those cases which have presumably come to the knowledge of the school authorities during the week, while during the vacations the notifications are practically nil. I can only repeat what I have said in previous reports, that while my own personal opinion is that notification of measles, even on identical lines with that of the scheduled list of diseases will be useless, I strongly hold that if an attempt is to be made to deal with it in this way, compulsory notification by medical men should be included. It is true that the mortality from measles during the last year has considerably diminished, but this cannot be taken as certain evidence of any good effect of the remedial measures, for in the case of hooping cough there has been a similar drop, although no precautionary measures have been taken. In all there were 1,416 rooms disinfected after the occurrence of infectious disease, in addition to the articles of clothing which are set out in detail in the table. An innovation during the past year has been the re-tabbing of mattresses that have been removed for the purpose of disinfection; this work, which is carried out by your own staff, has greatly lessened the number of complaints and is well worth the small extra amount expended. The disinfection which is now carried out after measles has resulted in a large increase in the work, and should the prevalence of that disease continue, must ultimately lead to an increase in your disinfecting staff. Only on account of the small number of notifications of other infectious diseases have we been able to carry it out as expeditiously as we have. As in past years the complaints of damage done have been few, although the articles have been so numerous. The deaths from diarrhœa, especially in infants, dropped down last year from 132 to 110. This, perhaps, does not seem a very large diminution, but it must be remembered that 1902 was abnormally low, so that last year is very much below the average. The cold summer and the absence of dust, etc., were no doubt contributing causes to this decrease. Epidemic influenza caused 30 deaths, 19 less than in 1902; of these, the greatest number (12) occurred, as in last year, in Camberwell. A further decline took place in the mortality from the septic diseases connected with childbirth, only two deaths having been registered from this cause. The deaths from tuberculosis of the lungs and elsewhere caused 70 deaths less than in the previous return, the diminution being especially shown in phthisis. The corrected death-rate from this disease for Camberwell is 1.22 per 1,000, and compared with the other ten South London Boroughs we are fourth on the list, six other municipalities having a higher proportionate number. In 147 instances the room occupied by the deceased was disinfected by the officers of your authority, after death. But in a great number of instances we received, in answer to our circular letter recommending cleansing and disinfection, an intimation that precautions had been taken against the spread of any possibly infectious material. Pleurisy, which also in all probability comes under the heading of tuberculous diseases, caused a similar number of deaths to 1902. In previous reports I have insisted that the necessity for disinfection, the discontinuance of spitting, notification and other schemes, which are put forward as remedies for the prevention of the spread of consumption are altogether secondary to the great importance of fresh air, sunlight and healthy houses generally. Whether we shall ever be able to finally dispose of the last living tubercle bacillus I very much doubt, and it is only by putting people in such a condition of body that they are able to resist the attacks to which every one is more or less constantly exposed that we shall be able to control the spread of consumption. During the year I have made inquiries at most of the houses where fatal cases of consumption had occurred, particularly having regard to the length of tenancy of the deceased, the duration of the illness and the date and locality of any deaths of relatives that had occurred. The result of such investigations confirms me in the opinion that the family predisposition to tuberculous diseases is in great measure of being overlooked under modern theories of the spread of the disease. Second cases in houses are not common, but it is common to find that relatives have died, perhaps several years ago and in other parts of the country. The deaths from cancer and the other forms of malignant disease showed a diminution from 1902 to the extent of 30 deaths. There is, however, unfortunately, nothing further to report in the discovery of any cause for the disease. Several applications were received during the year for disinfection of bedding after deaths from this disease, and although we are not bound to do so, as a precautionary measure, whether beneficial or not, instructions were given for it to be carried out. As one might expect from the mildness of the winter, the deaths from bronchitis were considerably below those even of the previous year; the difference was 113, and occurred almost entirely in the inmates, either old or quite young, of the infirmary, etc. The amount of smallpox within the Borough in 1903 was not of great account. It consisted of an imported case, which was obviously contracted on board a transport from the east; of a small outbreak in connection with the Remand Home at Camberwell Green; a series of cases in Dragon Road, and two other isolated cases. The last occurrence taking place in the Borough deserves especial mention because of the fact that the patient objected to be removed, and as the house was not situated in an overcrowded part there was no justification in asking for powers of compulsory removal. The amount of isolation between the different members of the household was naturally inefficient, although quarantine was observed as regards the neighbours. Thanks, however, to their being re-vaccinated at a recent date, no one contracted the disease—except the attendant, who was only re-vaccinated eight days before the appearance of the rash. Several cases of smallpox Occurred in connection with the Remand Home of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Camberwell Green, to which young people who have been charged at the various police courts are drafted until arrangements can be made for their subsequent discharge to the various industrial schools, etc. In May last we received a letter from the Local Government Board with a complaint as to my action in the matter made by a Mr. Robertson, together with a letter from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and asking for my report on the subject. I accordingly reported to the Public Health Committee in the following terms: — Public Health Department, Town Hall. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, —In reference to the letters and complaints which have been sent to me relating to the Remand Home at Camberwell Green I have to report as follows: — The notification of smallpox was received on the afternoon of April 14th, and within an hour of the removal of the patient the premises were disinfected and instructions had also been given that 110 further discharges should take place without leave. A complete list of the boys and girls who left the Home since the case of presumed chickenpox on the 4th of the month, was obtained on the morning of the 15th, but this list gave us no idea of the destination of the boys or girls beyond the number of the police constable in whose charge they left the Home. (The boy Gooch left the Home on the 14th, before the notification of smallpox had been received at the Town Hall.) On the same day that this list was received from the Home, namely, the 15th, a clerk from this office attended at the offices of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to see if any information of the whereabouts of the boys could be obtained. Getting none there he went to Scotland Yard Police Offices, but could get no information there whatever—except that at the offices of the Industrial Schools in Great Scotland Yard they might be able to help; on applying at this address we were supplied with the destination of three boys (one of these was that of a boy we were informed went to St. Vincent Training Ship) and on that day a letter was sent to the Superintendent stating that two boys from Mawby Buildings, Borough, had been admitted to his ship. For the remaining cases we were, referred to the various police courts, and it being then too late to apply at the police offices this had to be delayed until the next morning. On the 16th consequently a visit was made to the Lambeth and Southwark Polic0 Courts, and as a consequence a letter was sent to the St. Vincent's Reformatory School, as we feared that the letter sent the previous day to the St. Vincent's Training Ship would miscarry. Letters were also sent to wherever the boys or girls could be traced. A visit was also made on the 16th to Westminster Police Court, but as it was then late in the day and the chief clerk was not there, a letter was sent in the evening to this Court asking for information, and a reply was received the next morning, by telegram, which notified us of a boy who had been sent to the Redhill Reformatory, where we at once wrote. Inquiries were also made by letter at the Greenwich, Woolwich, Wandsworth and Thames Police Courts, and all information obtained from these sources was at once sent by letter to the schools concerned. First, as regards the complaint signed "T. D. Robertson," in which he states that the schools were not warned until the 16th and then by letter instead of telegram, I have to say that we were not able to obtain the list from the Remand Home till April 15th, and had we been able to get on that day the information at the Industrial Schools Offices that we afterwards had to find out for ourselves at the various police courts to which the constables had taken the boys and girls from the Remand Home, we should have been in a position to have advised the schools concerned on the 15th. With regard to the actual case at the St. Vincent Industrial School, Dartford, it must be obvious that no action on our part would have prevented that, for I note from a letter from that institution that the boy was admitted on the 8th, i.e., when he was incubating the disease; while with regard to the wrong school being notified I can only say that it was the address given to us. Regarding the other school which is assumed to have ground for complaint, I would point out that the case of smallpox at the Remand Home was notified to me on the 14th, so that the mischief would have been done before we could possibly have warned the authorities of the school in question, even had we been able to communicate with Redhill on April 14th. I would advise that a copy of the letter of complaint from Mr. Robertson be forwarded to the Industrial School Department with a suggestion that they always get immediate information of the destination of the boys and girls who are drafted off to schools under their control by order of the magistrates.—I am, gentlemen, your obedient Servant, FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. On August 5th I received a further letter from the Local Government Board in the following terms:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., August 5th, 1903. Sir,—I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your report to the Borough Council of Camberwell with reference to the transfer of certain girls and boys from the Camberwell Remand Home to certified reformatory schools at a time when inmates of the former institution had been found to be suffering from smallpox, and in forwarding to you the enclosed copy of a list which the Superintendent of the home states was handed to the Sanitary Inspector on April 15th, I am to state that the Board are unable to reconcile the information given in that list with the statement contained in your report that "this list gave us no idea of the destination of the boys and girls beyond the number of the police constable in whose charge they left the home." I am, sir, your obedient Servant, (Signed) NOEL T. KERSHAW, Assistant Secretary. F. Stevens, Esq., Medical Officer of Health. To which I replied as under on August 18th, 1903:- Town Hall, Camberwell, August 18th, 1903. Dear Sir, —Remand Home, Camberwell Green.—I enclose you a copy of the list as received by the Sanitary Inspector about two o'clock in the afternoon of April 15th, 1908, with the exception that I have numbered the names in red for the purpose of reference. In the case of 24, 27 and also 15 the addresses appear to have been added, as they are in a different handwriting, and I believe the} - were obtained by my clerk, who is at present away on leave. Directly he returns I will let you know whether it was as we received it. With regard to number 11 the words "near Woking" in brackets were added by my clerk. Yours faithfully. FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. The Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. For the information of the Council I append copies of the list referred to in the letter of the Local Government Board and the list that was handed to me on April 15th. I am not aware that the suggestions made to the Public Health Committee have been carried out in all Remand Homes, but it seems to me an exceedingly necessary one; for on applying to the Industrial Schools Department, as will be seen from the above, we were absolutely unable to get information beyond the three cases. It would appear, however, that so far from being negligent in the matter we took on ourselves work which we ought not to have done by running over London to the various police courts. The proper course (officially speaking) would have been to have sent the list of the cases to the Industrial Schools Department and left it to them to take the necessary action, on the natural assumption that they would have all the available information.

During the past year a more determined effort was made to settle the question of insufficient light and ventilation to the staircases of houses occupied by more than one family once and for all. A house was taken to which no exception could be made in any other way than to the dark and unventilated staircase. The summons was heard before Mr. Hopkins at the Lambeth Police Court on March 25th. The Council was represented by Mr. Courthorpe Munroe and the defendant by Mr. J. P. Easton. For the Council were called the Assistant Medical Officer of the County Council; Dr. Jackson, the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham; Dr. Bousfield, your Bacteriologist; Dr. Stone, one of the Medical Officers of the Camberwell Provident Dispensary, and Mr. A. E. Mullins, a local architect. A good deal of evidence was given both for and against, and the summons was adjourned for the magistrate to view the property. On April 8th the judgment set out below, which has been copied from the Morning Advertiser, was delivered. Unfortunately for the Council's case the magistrate visited the premises on a particularly fine and bright day:— "Mr. Hopkins said the cases of which this was a type were not very uncommon incidents of the constant struggle on the part of the local authorities to keep London healthy and sanitary, according to advancing modern ideas, but the question raised was very difficult, and he hoped they were in a fair way of getting it authoritatively settled by the. High Court. In form the summons was to obtain an order to abate a nuisance, but in substance the contest was whether the owner of a house built long prior to the passing of the Public Health (London) Act could be compelled to make a structural alteration in it to the extent of putting a skylight in the roof for the purpose of lighting and ventilating a staircase and landing alleged to be dark and unventilated. "He had been favoured with the views of eminent scientific gentlemen upon the condition of the house, with particulars of the carbonic acid proportion in samples of air taken within and without, with;particulars of air stagnation, and finally he had himself visited the property. The houses under the defendant's control were tiny houses in a mean street. They were in very good order and repair, and were, perhaps, exceptionally well cared for, for such property. They consisted of four living rooms, two on the ground floor and two on the first floor, and in the middle of the house, entered from the ground floor passage, was a straight staircase, the sides of which ran right up to the ceiling lines of the first floor. On the floor line of the first floor was a tiny landing, off which on left and right two doors opened into the two first floor rooms. THE QUESTION OF "NUISANCE." " Doors and windows being all open there was light and circulation and ventilation, and draught enough and to spare. When the doors and windows were shut the staircase was rather dark and was apt to become stuffy when the top room doors were continuously shut, and the Council asked for an order to abate the nuisance alleged to arise from that rather dark and stuffy staircase. They said that could be done by putting a skylight in the roof at a cost of for each house. He thought the work might be done so as to effect an improvement in the premises as regarded light and air, but he had to consider whether that improvement could be made compulsory. "He had always thought that there was no magic in the words 'structural alteration,' and that everything depended upon whether, as a fact, the premises were in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. If so, he had always thought that an order to abate the nuisance or the danger must follow, whether that order involved a structural alteration or not, and he had in his time made or refused several such orders according as he had been satisfied or not with the evidence in that particular. "In this case he was of opinion that the premises were not in such a state as to be a nuisance within any meaning of the word 'nuisance' as used in the Public Health Acts that he was aware of. He was also of opinion that these premises were not in such a state as to be injurious or dangerous to health. It seemed to him that the worst that could be said against them was that they gave to tenants who were careless about letting into their rooms such bad air as London afforded, an opportunity of living in a more stuffy atmosphere than was good for them according to modern ideas. "He was of opinion that the tenants could themselves use these premises in such a way as would entirely negative all the evidence given by the Council as to the danger of injury to the health of the tenants. It followed that he was not prepared to make the order asked for, and that he must dismiss the summons. As scientific evidence was called on both sides he should allow the defendant £5 5s. costs." Since the hearing of this summons no statutory notices calling upon owners to provide light and ventilation to the staircases have been served; but, inasmuch as in my opinion such staircases are injurious to the health of the persons living in such houses, I am bound by Act of Parliament to cause the Sanitary Inspectors to send an intimation to the owner of such conditions, but without asking the Sanitary Authority for power to proceed further. Personally, I should have preferred to have seen the case fought out in the High Court, so as to get a governing decision for future use. Now that a new Education Authority has been established for London, it is to be hoped that they will take into consideration the regulations governing the attendance of children who are competing for the various prizes or scholarships. It has often happened that children have been allowed to go to school suffering, albeit unknowingly on the part of the parents, from some infectious disease. I have often been assured by the mothers that they would have kept such children at home, only by doing so the chance of gaining some award would have been lost. Owing also to the requirements of the education authorities I believe children have gone back to school with a certificate of disinfection, but—and this applies especially to diphtheria—without a certificate stating that the child itself is free from any infection. In previous reports I have directed the attention of the Council to the fact that bacilli may exist in the throat of a child who is free from all clinical evidence of the disease, and I hope that under the new regime, in the case of diphtheria, the procuring of a certificate by the parent that the child's throat is bacteriologically free from this disease will be necessary before the teacher can permit him or her to return. There can be no excuse for the neglect of this precaution, for practically all boroughs in London have followed your lead and made arrangements for the bacteriological examination of pathological material free of any charge. Tables VI. and VII. show the work of your Inspectors arranged in tabular form and classified according to the nature of the work and to the name of the Inspector. The increase of 500 in the number of house-to-house inspections is accounted for by there being little time occupied on smallpox visitations in the past year, the number of visits to contacts having dropped from 13,443 to 804. During the year 5,830 intimations were served, followed by 1,414 statutory notices. Furthermore, in the case of 3,333 premises, it was found necessary to cause summonses to be served to enforce work to be done. Factory and Workshop Act. The Factory and Workshop Act, which came into force two years ago, has been carried out as set forth in the annexed report. This Act, which lays the responsibility of keeping a register of workshops, etc., on the local authority, has led to an inspection of all such premises within the borough that we have been able to discover. Under the Public Health (London) Act it is necessary that all such places shall be provided with suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences, and difficulty has arisen as to how far the Committee are justified in going. A workplace has been held to be a place where people are employed; for instance, a builder's yard, a jobmaster's yard and other places where men, although strictly speaking they are employed there, are, for a greater part of their time, at work elsewhere. In other cases, it happens that there is a small room or shed used for the purpose of manufacturing, where persons of each sex are employed. The workshop being in connection with a dwelling-house, the female portion of the workpeople have access to the closet in the house and the males to the one outside in the yard. Personally, I think this would be a sufficient arrangement, and as the sanitary authority is left by the Act to be the judge, I have advised to that effect, with the result that each case has been considered on its merits. There can be no question as to the overlapping of the duties of the various Inspectors. Where females are employed there will be three Inspectors visiting the premises. Miss Bevan will go for the female portion, the corresponding male Inspector will go for the male portion and the Factory Inspector, whether male or female I know not, for both. As will be seen below, there have been three persons prosecuted for neglecting to send in lists of outworkers. It can hardly be said that the sanitary authority were unduly hard on the defendants, as they were written to three times asking for the lists before the summonses were issued. If, however, the Act should ever be re-cast, it is necessary that some means should be provided of causing employers to send a supplementary list of outworkers, in case they should take on any fresh hands between the two specified dates in February and August. They are under no obligation to inform the district council of such outworkers, and if these should be discharged before the next list has to be sent in their names will never appear at all. The practical appli- xxii. cation of these remarks to such fluctuating trades as dress-making is obvious. The last certificates for underground bakehouses were only passed at a meeting of the Council in the present year (1901). One has been voluntarily closed by the occupier on account of our minimum demand being too onerous. In all, sixty-seven certificates have been granted. The regulations insisted on by the Committee and set forth in their report have been, in the main, carried out; where any departure from them has been allowed it has been after a visit of the SubCommittee to the premises in question. The result of the change in the law has been very beneficial to those employed in such places—some bakehouses having been improved out of all knowledge.

In common with many other South London boroughs we experienced great nuisance from the overflowing of the sewers during the heavy rains of last year. This was especially noticeable in June and led-to a soaking-in of sewage matter underneath the floors of many houses, especially in St. George's Road, Cooper's Road, and others. The measures taken for the prevention of any ill effects were the taking up the floor boards and thoroughly sluicing the subjacent earth with a solution of Izal. What the effects might have been had there been a dry summer it is impossible to say, but most likely we should have had a serious amount of illness. As it was, beyond the inconvenience to the tenants from the smell, and the damage done to the carpets in certain cases, no ill effects followed. With the increase in our staff we have at last been able to arrange for a much more systematic inspection of the various trades in the borough. Besides casual inspections, all the milkshops, workshops, board schools, urinals, etc., are regularly inspected from twice during the year down to once a month, according to the different premises. During last year also the places where food is prepared have continued to receive attention. We have prepared a register of such premises which will now be under regular inspection. A case which attracted a good deal of attention at the time was that of a cow seized at a slaughterhouse, 255, Southampton Street. Both the sender of the cow and the owner of the slaughterhouse were prosecuted; the former was condemned to six months' imprisonment, which was upset on appeal, his counsel raising a point that at the time of the hearing of the case at the police court he had not been asked whether he would be tried there or at the Quarter Sessions. The presiding Justices upheld this objection. The owner of the slaughterhouse was fined £5 and 3 guineas costs. The case was followed up with great determination and intelligence by your Inspector Kerslake. The licence for this cowhouse was withheld by the London County Council in October, 1903. The unsound food destroyed, as set out in the tables, has reference partly to seizures by the Inspectors and also to those instances where the owners themselves brought the food and asked us to destroy it. During the year 1903 five certificates were granted in respect of houses the owners of which had claimed exemption from Inhabited House Duty. This, however, does not represent the number of applications. In the case of about twenty tenements I refused the certificate outright, and in other instances I could only have granted it on the carrying out of various improvements, the expense of which would have more than counterbalanced the reduction of taxation. With the increase in the staff it has also been possible to institute a record of all the houses in the borough which are likely to require systematic inspection, dating from the beginning of the year 1903. Where drainage work has been carried out and no plan could be demanded from the builders we have, in twenty-six instances, been able to keep a record of the amount of work done. This has been done by one of your staff, Mr. Fenner, from sketches supplied by the Sanitary Inspectors. In conclusion, I have to thank the members of my staff for the assistance they have always so willingly given me and the members of the Public Health Committee and the Council for the consideration so often shown. I am, Gentlemen, your obedient Servant, FRANCIS STEVENS. TABLE I. VITAL STATISTICS OF WHOLE DISTRICT DURING 1903 AND PREVIOUS YEARS. Births. Deaths under One Year of Age. Deaths at all Ages. Total.

Origin of the Movement Early in December, 1903, under the auspices of the Camberwell Committee of the Charity Organisation Society, a meeting was called, to which the Mayor of Camberwell, the Chairman of the Board of Guardians, and other representative inhabitants of the district were invited, in order to discuss the question of dealing with the unemployed in the Borough. After debate it was decided that the best system would be to form a Central Committee and a certain number of District Committees for the consideration and disposal of cases, and to send a deputation to put the whole question before the Mayor officially. This proposal was carried into effect. The Mayor approved of the scheme and laid it before the Borough Council. The result was that the Borough Council nominated twenty of their number to serve on the Central Committee, that is, one member for each ward; the Board of Guardians did the same; and, in order to obtain the co-operation of the clergy, the ministers and the charitable associations, and to make the scheme thoroughly comprehensive, it was decided to call a meeting of representatives of all denominations and all charitable bodies at the Town Hall, and there to elect from them twenty additional members to serve on the Central Committee. formed. Central Committee formed. This was done, and the Central Committee was duly elected. A list of members will be found on page xviii. of this report. The first meeting of the Central Committee was held at the Camberwell Baths, The Worshipful the Mayor presiding, on January 6th, 1904, when the following regulations were submitted and unanimously adopted, viz.:— Regulations. 1.—That the Borough be divided into nine districts co-terminous with the Guardians' relief districts. 2.—That the members of the Central Committee be appointed to serve on such District Committees; no member to serve on more than one District Committee. 3. —The District Committee shall appoint their own District Secretary and office and avail themselves of all voluntary assistance they can possibly obtain. 4.—That an Executive Committee of one member from each District Committee, with the Mayor, the Chairman of the Board of Guardians and the Hon. Secretary, be appointed. 5.—That the District Committees only deal with cases in which the distress is dm to lack of employment. All other cases (including those of a chronic nature, whether due to lack of employment or not) to be left to the Poor Law and the ordinary charitable agencies. 6.—That no application be entertained unless made by the head of a family. 7.—That persons known to be drunkards, "loafers," or of a bad character, be not assisted. 8. —That no one in receipt of Poor Law relief be assisted except by payment of club arrears or redemption of tools. 9.—That no persons living in common lodging houses be assisted. 10. —That single men with no one dependent upon them be not assisted. 11.—That relief be not given to persons who have not resided in the Borough for at least six months, unless there be special reasons to the contrary. 12.—That back rents be not paid. 13.—That, as far as possible, help be given with a view to making the family independent, e.g., by taking tools out of pawn, emigration, migration, etc. 14.—That temporary allowances be given in money, not in kind. 15.—That every application be taken down on the form provided for that purpose, and that all information that cau be afforded by the Believing Officers with regard to the persons mentioned in the form be entered thereon, and also any reports from employers, clergy and ministers and others. 16.—That no relief be given until the home has been visited by a member or person appointed by the District Committee. 17.—That all relief shall be paid at the homes as far as possible. Valuable information may be obtained in this way, and crowding at the offices will be avoided. 18.—That in granting relief, income from all sources must be taken into account. 19.—When the District Committee is satisfied that an application is satisfactory, then the form, with all the information thereon, is to be sent to the Central Office (No. 34, Brunswick Square) for the Executive Committee to deal with. At this meeting volunteers were called for, to act as Secretaries to the Local Committees, and Mr. R. J. Somers was appointed Honorary Secretary to the Central Committee. The members of the Central Committee were distributed as follows, upon the basis of the nine districts of the Poor Law, viz.:— Members of the District Committees, District No. 1. Mr. A.

Executive Committee, The Executive Committee consisted of a representative from each of the nine Poor Law districts, together with The Worshipful the Mayor of Camberwell, the Chairman of the Board of Guardians and the Honorary Secretary. The Town Clerk and the Clerk to the Board of Guardians sat as ex-officio members. It was decided that the Committee should commence work as soon as centres could be found and Honorary Secretaries selected; further, that a private appeal for subscriptions should be issued to the leading employers of labour in the district. The following were the regulations for the Executive Committee:— (A.) The Executive Committee shall, if satisfied by the report of the District Committee that a man needs assistance, immediately send on his name and address and occupation to the Borough Engineer, with a request that he shall be given work for so many days per week for two consecutive weeks that will provide remuneration in accordance with the scale. (B.) If the Borough Engineer is unable to afford employment in any particular case, then the Executive Committee shall, if funds permit, afford monetary assistance in accordance with the following scale: — Maximum Scale which is only to be paid in exceptional circumstances and where no work has been found by the Borough, Council or relief given by the Guardians. Weekly scale of relief for food and fuel: — For work, including rent. For cash payments. s. d. s. d. (a) Man, wife and six or more children dependent 10 0 16 0 (b) Man, wife and four or five children dependent 9 0 16 0 (e) Man, wife and two or three children dependent 8 0 12 0 (d) Man, wife and one child dependent 7 0 12 0 (e) Man and wife 6 0 8 0 Failing sufficient funds being available, applicants to be referred to the Relieving Officer. (C.) No case will be dealt with by the Executive Committee except upon the written report of the District Committee, to whom applications must be made in the first instance. The scale of payments herein proposed was, as shown hereafter, considerably modified. Local Commitees.

The Borough Council provided rooms at No. 34, Brunswick Square for use as a central office. The Executive Committee met daily (except Saturday) per rota for the consideration of cases and for the transaction of other business at the central office. Funds available for the Unemployed. The Borough Council had, on December 23rd, 1903, voted the sum of £2,000 for the employment of additional labour in cleansing and repairing the roads and in painting the interior of the Town Hall. At the time, however, when the work of the Unemployed Committee began, only about £600 of this sum remained available for paying the men recommended for employment by the Executive Committee. The remainder had already been allocated by the Borough Engineer to the works already mentioned. Early in March a further grant of £200 was made to enable the Committee to continue the work until the 25th of that month, the money in hand having become exhausted. The balance of the money received from the appeal was used as payment to the men for an extra week's work after the Committee's postage expenses had been deducted. A statement of the income and expenditure of the Committee is attached at the end of this report. The first District Committee commenced operations on January 13th, 1904, and by January 22nd the whole nine were at work. Rules for District Committees. The following were the rules which they were instructed to follow, viz.:— 1. That the Honorary Secretary, or a member of the Committee, attend at the District Centre during stated hours in the day or evening for the purpose of receiving applications. 2. That each statement be taken down in writing on the application form and signed by the applicant. All questions on the form to be fully answered. 3. That all forms be taken by the Honorary Secretary or member of Committee to the District Relieving Officer for his report, which must be entered thereon in writing and signed by the Relieving Officer. 4. In all cases a report as to the applicant's character and capabilities must be obtained from his last or principal employer, or employer's representative, and must be entered on or attached to the form. Local employers must be seen personally. Those at a distance must be written to. 5. When applicants have only resided at their present address for a short period, inquiry as to character should be made at the previous address. 6. When inquiries have been completed, but not until then, the form is to be brought before the District Committee for consideration and afterwards forwarded to the Central Office (34, Brunswick Square, Camberwell, S.E.) with the Committee's recommendation entered thereon. All applications, whether recommended or not, should be sent to the Central Office. It may at this point be of interest to compare briefly the system of relief now instituted with that which had hitherto been in force. Coparison of the old and the New Systems of Relief. In winters previous to that of 1903-4, unemployed men were allowed to register their names at the various depots of the Borough Council. Each man then received two days' work in rotation. Under this system no verification of residence was attempted and no enquiries were made as to the requirements of the individual cases. There was in consequence no certainty that Camberwell men were being employed, and there was nothing to prevent unemployed men from other districts of London obtaining work by giving addresses in Camberwell. Advantages of the New Scheme. The new system which was initiated in 1903-4 has been of great value in obtaining reliable facts and statistics for the first time; in ascertaining whether the distress was real and widespread, or only peculiar to certain districts; in drawing into co-operation all local bodies, which were able to give valuable information, and sometimes practical help in individual cases when required; in keeping in touch with the families of the men employed; in establishing a system of co-operation and interchange of information between the Guardians, employers of labour and charitable associations, thus avoiding overlapping; and, lastly, in the discovery of so many volunteer helpers who were willing to give their time and thought to the work. As will be seen from the regulations for the Executive Committee (page iv.) it was originally intended in the scheme that the amount of work given should be in proportion to the size of the family of each applicant and should be continued week by week as long as it was considered advisable. Amount of work Available for the Unemployed. This plan could not, however, be carried into effect owing to the limited amount of work available and to the fact that the proposed distribution of work entailed so much extra labour on the staff of the Borough Engineer. In order, therefore, to save that department as much trouble as possible it was decided to give each man recommended by the Executive Committee three days' work in rotation, irrespectively of the number of those dependent on him. When the work first started the number of men recom- mended by the Committee whom the Borough Engineer could employ was limited to 90 per week, but as the number of applications and of recommended cases increased this number was found inadequate. A deputation of the Executive Committee, therefore, waited on the General Purposes Committee of the Borough Council and pointed out the difficulty, with the result that the General Purposes Committee gave instructions for 140 men to be employed per week. The rate of pay was 4s. 9d. per day, the same as that of the Borough Council's general labourers. Lists were sent twice a week to the Borough Engineer of the names and addresses of the men recommended for work by the Executive Committee, and the Borough Engineer, in due course, reported to the Committee the number of men who appeared or were absent, as the case might be. At the invitation of the Mansion House Unemployed Committee six men were sent to the Osea Island Relief Works, Essex, their families being meanwhile supported for one month from the funds of the Mansion House Committee. It is satisfactory to state that these men gave a good account of themselves, as testified by the following extract from a letter from the Superintendent at Osea Island: — "It gives me great pleasure to be able to reply very favourably respecting the six men sent here from your Borough. I have not had any complaints from their respective gangers, and as far as I have been able to judge from personal observation they are well-behaved men, whom I should have no objection to recommend anywhere. Of course the work has been strange to them and allowance must be made, but all things considered they are a very good class of men, and as good as any I have had here and better than some." Number of Applications Received. During the period of the relief work, i.e., from January 25th until March 26th, 1904, applications were received from 1,189 men, of whom 658 were recommended for work and were accordingly employed. Of these all had one turn, 532 had two turns and 34 three turns of three days each. These men were almost entirely employed in sweeping roads. Seventy-one men in all found work elsewhere or returned to their old employment during the period mentioned; 149 did not respond to the postcard sent to them, and it may, therefore, reasonably be supposed that they also found other work. Only seven men out of the total number recommended for employment actually refused the work offered them. A few words of explanation are needed with regard to the 531 men who were not recommended for employment. Roughly speaking, about one-third of these were men of bad character and unworthy of help; one-third did not require the assistance for which they asked, the income of their respective families, taken as a whole, being sufficient for their needs, and the remaining third, classed as "stand over" cases, consisted chiefly of married couples with no family dependent on them, the wife earning some shillings a week. Had the amount of work available been larger, many of this last class would, no doubt, have been recommended, but under the circumstances it was thought best to allow them to stand over in favour of more urgent cases. The inadequate Supply of Work. It will be seen from the above figures that owing to the amount of available work being so limited the men were obliged to wait for about two weeks, and sometimes more, between their respective turns. The result was that unless they were fortunate enough to obtain other work between whiles, they were obliged to apply to the Guardians for relief. It was with the view to avoiding any such contingency that the original scheme was drawn up, and the failure of the conditions first laid down caused keen disappointment, not only to the men themselves but also to the local Committees. Two of the Committees passed resolutions on the subject and one sent a deputation to wait on the Executive Committee to express their opinion that it would have been better to have dealt satisfactorily with a limited number of cases than to have spread the relief out over a large number in small doles which were of no real benefit to any. The applications have been classified so that they may correspond as nearly as possible to the respective classes of the census, viz.:— Division 1. Census Class XII. Carpenters, joiners, bricklayers and masons. „ 2. „ „ XII. Plasterers, painters and paperhangers. „ 3. „ „ XII. Plumbers, gasfitters and brass finishers. „ 4. „ „ XIII.

Table B.— The classified returns of each individual district. Table C.— The number of applications dealt with in each district and the average ages of the applicants. These tables have been carefully compiled from the information contained on the individual case papers. They are both interesting and instructive, showing as they do, not only the particular pursuits which are most affected by a period of slackness in trade, but also details of the average number of children, wages, rent and time of residence in the Borough of the applicants in each of the nine districts. The figures showing the number of those who were in receipt of parish relief should prove of special interest to the Board of Guardians, the differences being very marked both in the various trades and in the different poor law areas. Your Committee desire to testify to the amount of care and trouble taken by the various local Committees, and to the way in which they adhered to the instructions framed for their guidance. They obtained valuable help from other volunteer workers and fully carried out the rules, carefully visiting and investigating each case before referring it to the Executive Committee for final decision. A study of the rules (vide page ii.) will show that the possible abuses outlined at the beginning of this report were obviated, the circumstances of each case being carefully gone into, the home visited, and the joint earnings of the family ascertained, so that only those actually in need and whose resources were insufficient to meet their wants were employed on relief work. By a study of Blue Books and other records it will be seen beyond doubt that all previous schemes have failed and failed disastrously, chiefly owing to their attempts to deal with these two divisions as one large class. Any effort which is to succeed should deal with the unemployed sectionally. Herein lies the inherent difficulty—a difficulty hitherto never overcome. In concluding their report your Committee venture to state their opinion that, in attempting to deal with the question of the unemployed it must always be borne in mind that there are two distinct classes which will have to be provided for, viz.: — Division 1.—Those who are thrown out of employment by the bad state of trade, and Division 2.—Those who are more or less permanently unemployed. It does not, however, seem altogether impossible to surmount the obstacles in the way. With a system such as has been adopted in Camberwell, further strengthened and developed, it should be comparatively easy to clearly define the two divisions above-mentioned. This having been done, it might be left to the Borough Council to deal entirely with Division I. and to the Board of Guardians to take charge of Division II. Assuming this system to be adopted, the Borough Council would be left with the task of providing work for a certain number of men, over and above their ordinary staff of labourers, during a limited period annually, work which should enable the men to earn sufficient to keep themselves and their families from becoming a charge upon the poor law. It is not for this Committee to say how this end is to be accomplished. While fully recognising and thoroughly understanding the nature of the many difficulties which lie in the way, they are of opinion that the question is not incapable of solution and is worthy of the earnest consideration of the Borough Council. They would suggest that a special Committee, either by a Government department or the London County Council, be appointed to consider the question thoroughly and systematically and, if necessary, to take evidence upon the various points from those who have made them a special study and from those who have had practical experience in the working of the various schemes for dealing with the unemployed during the past and previous winters. They would urge, however, that any scheme which may be adopted should avoid the inadequate dole of work which does nothing to keep up the efficiency of the workman and is ineffectual in keeping him from coming upon the poor law. They would also urge that due care should be taken not to discourage thrift during the summer months when work is plentiful by holding out hopes that provision will be made during the winter. It would probably be necessary to put such as painters, plumbers, bricklayers and similar tradesmen who earn high wages in the summer on a different footing with those whose earnings do not increase in the same proportion. The Committee wish especially to thank the Honorary Secretaries of the District Committees, who, by their unselfish application to the work enabled them to carry out their scheme of organisation. They also wish to tender their thanks to the Borough Engineer, Mr. William Oxtoby, for his courtesy and co-operation and to the Town Clerk, Mr. C. William Tagg, for his invaluable advice and assistance throughout the whole movement, and Mr. C. S. Stevens, Clerk to the Guardians, for his able services.

The activity of this department, though somewhat limited by the very low rate of mortality from infectious disease during the phenomenally wet year included between April, 1903, and March 31st, 1904, has been steadily increasing, and the proportion of cases of suspected diphtheria submitted to it for examination has never been so high. With 367 notifications, the number of specimens from throats sent in has been— Positive. Negative. Doubtful. Total. 124 157 12 293 The number of medical men who send specimens steadily increases, as the provision made by the Council becomes more widely known and appreciated, and some of the oldest practitioners in the district have quite recently for the first time availed themselves of the services of this department. The number of tubercular sputa has been 110, made up as follows:— Positive. Negative. Doubtful. Total. 23 86 1 110 The examinations so made are most useful, both to the practitioner and the patient, enabling the former, after three negative results, to assure the latter with almost positive certainty, that he or she is not suffering from consumption. The number of examinations of blood for typhoid fever, by Widal's re-action, has not been large, for the disease has shown but small prevalence. The results have been— Positive. Negative. Total. 7 9 16 Milk. Samples from the thirty cowsheds of the Borough have been examined, with results fairly comparable with those contained in my four previous reports upon this subject, but distinctly more favourable. Tubercle bacilli were clearly shown in specimens 7, 19 and 20, and there was some doubt about 4, 6 and 21, but they were probably not acting as carriers of tubercular disease. All the remainder were, so far as could be discovered, free from tuberculosis. In view of the very emphatic pronouncement contained in the interim report of the Royal Commission, which, as the Council will, no doubt, remember, fully bears out my constant contention, I do not propose in any way to relax my present oversight, and it will be for the Council to consider whether, in the absence of other direct legislation, it be not its duty to proceed against offenders in this respect under the Acts already in force, under which the presence of a small amount of arsenic, of which the seller was quite unaware, was held to be an offence, and was duly punished. Since a period of six years has now elapsed since the Vestry of Camberwell, for the first time in the history of sanitation, decided to attempt to grapple with the disease known as diphtheria, which was then making such terrible havoc among the younger members of the community, and as, further, continuous and comparable statistics are available for an exactly similar period preceding, the moment seems opportune for the consideration of the results which have been obtained by the combined efforts of the officials of the Public Health Department. It is true that the year 1903 is in some respects an unfair one to include for purposes of comparison, since the extremely wet weather and the consequent constant purification of the atmosphere had the effect of lowering not only the death rate but also the frequency of all the more common epidemic diseases, and notably those which for our present purpose are the most readily available for comparison as well as the most satisfactory, so that the statistics of all these three would, in themselves, tend to show a much more favourable course of affairs than in warmer and drier years. But whilst this might affect, in the way described, the prevalence of these diseases, it would be in any case without effect upon their severity. The diseases which I have selected as illustrating most clearly the points to which I desire to draw special attention are three in number, viz.:— Measles, scarlatina and diphtheria. These three are all prevalent epidemic diseases, and account, between them, for the greater part of the zymotic death-rate. The first of these, measles, pursues its way uncontrolled. It is difficult to recognise in its earlier stages, there is no notification of its occurrence, and the attempts at isolation are of the feeblest possible character. In scarlatina we have a disease which is earlier recognised, and the notification of which is enforced, but for which there is no specific treatment. In diphtheria we have again a disease in which early diagnosis is by no means difficult, in which isolation is usually stringent, and in which remedial measures of the utmost value are at our command. I have therefore chosen these three as showing most typically the progress which has been made in warding off the attacks and minimising the damage of the three respectively. In order to be able to do this fairly I have taken the number of notifications of the two latter, and the mean mortality of all three from the tables published in the Council's annual reports from its Medical Officer of Health. The proportions of notifications and deaths have then been, for each year, reduced to a rate per 100,000 of the population, and then further represented in the charts which are subjoined, as percentages of the average per 100,000, for a period of twelve years, i.e., for six years before and six years after the establishment of the Bacteriological Department and the introduction of free anti-toxin. Those members of the Council who are sufficiently interested in the subject to follow the charts will find all the most important factors with reference to these diseases therein depicted, under a form which renders them easy of apprehension. On Chart I. the blue line indicating the mortality from Measles will be seen to pursue an extremely irregular course, with epidemics of considerable magnitude in 1892 and 1896, lesser ones in 1894 and 1901, and in the remaining years being at or below the mean. In the case of scarlatina, the heavy epidemic in 1893 was followed by a less severe one in 1896, and by a slighter one still in 1901. In the case of diphtheria, we find that whilst the mortality was continuously above the average from 1893 to the middle of 1896, it has since then only once, and then only to a slight degree, risen above it, viz., in the epidemic of 1898. The above figures refer simply to the number of deaths in the years referred to respectively. Chart II., which includes the number of notifications per 100,000 and the relation of the fatality to the average, though somewhat complicated, will be found well worth study. It happens, curiously enough, that in the first and last of the series, viz., 1892 and 1903, we have the two points at which the notifications were less numerous than at any other. In 1892 the notifications were 312 upon a population of 238,788, with 85 deaths, or a case mortality of 35 per cent. In 1903 the number of notifications was 367, with 36 deaths, or a case mortality of 9.8. Allowing for the difference of population, the numbers 312 and 367 are fairly equal, so that we are confronted with the fact that by some means or other the mortality from diphtheria in 1892 was, roughly speaking, four times what it is found to have been in 1903. Two changes only have occurred in the interim, viz., the provision of means for early diagnosis and a similar provision for effectual treatment. It seems, therefore, not unreasonable to conclude that these factors have been the determining ones in bringing about this highly satisfactory result. In the case of scarlatina, whilst we find that the epidemics are both less frequent and less severe than was formerly the case, the mortality still tends to rise above the average and to vary in its fatality in different epidemics; nor do we find any evidence of the fact which is very remarkably shown in the case of diphtheria, especially in the epidemics of 1896 and 1899, that while the number of notifications increased considerably, the case-mortality was, in the first year, but little in excess of the average, and in the second, very decidedly below it. Chart III. shows directly the number of deaths from scarlatina and diphtheria respectively for the twelve years, the average in each case being indicated by a dotted line, and in this case the points referred to in the preceding paragraph and especially the steady and continuous fall in the fatality of diphtheria, as compared with that of scarlatina, are still more strongly marked. I desire to add in concluding this part of my report, that in my opinion, neither the provision of anti-toxin, nor the facilities for early diagnosis which this department affords would have sufficed alone to bring about any such favourable results as it has been my pleasure to record, nor would these combined have been sufficient without the generous and loyal support which has always been accorded to my efforts by the Council and by my colleagues of the Public Health Department. (Signed) EDWD. C. BOUSFIELD, D P.H. (Camb. and Lond.) Report of the Public Analyst. To The Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Gentlemen, —During the year I have had 888 samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Of these samples I had to report against 155, showing 17.5 per cent, of adulterated samples. This is the bald summary of the year's work, but in the annexed table I have placed every article taken in such a manner that it can be seen at a glance what articles were taken and when, and it can also be seen how adulteration varied in the same article from quarter to quarter. The table is so complete that there is little left for me to add. The unsatisfactory state of the law on the addition of preservatives, however, requires some mention. In the 1875 Act there seems to me to be an implied sanction for the use of preservatives generally, again in the Margarine Act of 1887 in section 3 there is this definition of butter: "The word 'butter' shall mean the substance usually known as butter made exclusively from milk or cream, or both, with or without salt or other preservative, and with or without the addition of colouring matter." It is obvious from this that it is perfectly lawful to add preservatives to butter. In the 1899 Act, section 1, occur the words: "Provided that an article of food shall not be deemed to be adulterated by reason only of the addition of any preservative or colouring matter of such a nature and in such quantity as not to render the article injurious to health." It may be contended that this proviso only applies to imported articles, but the legislature could scarcely mean to expressly allow the importation of an article, the sale of which after importation would be an offence against the Acts permitting its importation. Against these quotations, which are a part of English law, we have certain recommendations of a Departmental Committee which may be summarised as: Total prohibition of formalin or formaldehyde, total prohibition of all preservatives in milk, restriction of the amount of salicylic acid that may be employed, restriction of boric acid in cream to 0.25 per cent, and in butter and margarine to 0.5 per cent. This Committee was appointed on July 10th, 1899, and took evidence at intervals until May 14th, 1900, its report with recommendations being issued in 1901. We are now in 1904 and no action or attempted action has been taken to make the recommendations of the Committee or any of them law. Under existing legislation the Board of Agriculture has power under the Act of 1899 to restrict, if not prohibit, the amount and nature of preservative that may be added to milk, cream, cheese and butter, but again nothing has been done. This state of inertia on the part of the legislature and the Board of Agriculture places local authorities in great difficulty as they do not know what powers the law gives them to prevent the addition of excessive amounts of preservatives to various articles of food. The steps taken by the Borough of Camberwell to endeavour to get some settlement of this vexed question are of very great importance. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FRANK L.
