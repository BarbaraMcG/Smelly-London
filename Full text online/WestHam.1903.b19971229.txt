A LONDON: The Avenue Press, Ltd., Stratford, F., and 32, New Bridge Street, E.C. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Borough of West Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under order of the Local Government Board is required to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence . . . The report is to be for the year ending 31st December . . It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district and with the means for improving those conditions. It should contain an account of the sanitary circumstances of the district and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in these circumstances." In accordance with the above requisition, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1903, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which therefore are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other Authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, CHARLES SANDERS, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. A 2 4 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,441.4 hours, being 205 2 hours more than in 1902. The hottest day was July 11th, when the temperature reached 87.5 degrees, and the coldest day was January 16th, when it sank to 23.6 degrees. The number of rainy days was 177, the total rainfall during the year being 35.33 inches. Meteorology during 1903. Week ending. Temperature. No. of Rainy Days. Sum for week, in inches.

Births.—The number of births registered during the year was 9,478, being 75 less than the previous year, but 740 more than the average during the last 10 years. This makes an annual birth-rate of 33.6 per 1,000, the average birth-rate for the 10 years 1893—1902 being 34.8. Distributed to the various wards, the births were as follows:— Ward. Total. Males. Females. New Town 547 288 259 Forest Gate 515 284 231 High Street 645 328 317 Broadway 487 240 247 Park 408 222 186 Upton 383 201 182 West Ham 1,122 552 570 Plaistow 1,162 592 570 Hudsons 912 471 441 Canning Town 1,083 561 522 Tidal Basin 1,276 682 594 Custom House and Silvertown 938 480 458 Totals 9,478 4,901 4,577 7 Deaths.-—The number of deaths registered in the Borough during the year was 3,599. This number included the following deaths in public institutions and other places in the Borough :— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Plaistow Hospital 1 75 West Ham Hospital 16 53 St. Mary's Children's Hospital 28 41 Seamen's Hospital — 58 Non-residents registered in the district 12 92 The 3,599 registered deaths do not include the following deaths in institutions outside the Borough Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Union Infirmary 36 446 Borough Asylum — 119 Dagenham Hospital — — Residents registered in London Institutions. 37 261 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the nett deaths of the Borough numbered 4,394 (2,387 males and 2,007 females), being 464 less than those of 8 the year 1902, making an annual death-rate of 15.5 per 1,000, or 3.4 per 1,000 less than the average death-rate for the 10 years 1893-1902 which was 18.9 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution, this death-rate becomes 16.5 per 1,000. Notifiable Epidemic Disease. The total notifications received during the year numbered 1,700, and were distributed as follows:—Small-pox 13, Diphtheria 544, Membranous Croup 8, Erysipelas 219, Scarlet Fever 660, Enteric Fever 237, Puerperal Fever 18, Anthrax 1. The attack-rate, death-rate, and fatality of these diseases, together with a comparison of their death-rates during the past ten years, is best studied in the table given below :— Disease. Notified Cases, 1903. Deaths, 1903. Attack rate, 1903. Death rate, 1903. Fatality Deaths to Attacks per cent. Average Attack- rate, 10years, 18931902. Average Deathrate, 10years, 18931902.

Erysipelas 219 11 .77 .02 5.0% In addition to the above, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea, which are included in the statistics for the purpose of 9 estimating the Zymotic death-rate, and which are usually the potent factors for swelling that rate, caused 597 deaths, a number much below the average in the cases of Measles and Diarrhoea, as shown below. These diseases not being notifiable, it is impossible to record the exact number of cases, but by returns kindly supplied to me by the School Attendance Officers I am enabled to gauge roughly the number of children absent from the Public Elementary Schools owing to an attack of Measles or Whooping Cough. During the year 1903, I received, in this manner, intimation of 1,744 cases of Measles and 515 cases of Whooping Cough. Disease. No. of cases. No. of deaths. Death-rate per 1,000.

Disinfection.—The routine practice with regard to disinfection in West Ham naturally varies according as the necessity for the operation arises from the removal of a patient to the hospital or from the recovery of the patient at home. In the case of removal to 10 hospital, the process is simple and practically automatic. As soon as the ambulance reaches the hospital the disinfecting van is despatched for the bedding, which is conveyed to the steam disinfecting station at the hospital. In the meantime the assistant of the Public Health Department attends at the house and thoroughly disinfects the premises, so that within a few hours after the removal of the ease the room may be cleansed and used with safety. Where cases are treated at home, however, the matter is not so simple. Although the Notification Act requires notice to be given to the Local Authority of all cases of notifiable disease, no provision is made for information to be given of the recovery of the patient, and the Public Health Department have to rely partly on the kindness of the medical man who may be in attendance, partly on the information of friends of the patient where no medical man is in attendance, and partly on periodical visitation of the house at or about such time as the recovery of the patient may be considered probable. In theory, the Sanitary Inspectors should keep such watch upon the premises that they should become acquainted with the date of recovery of the patient ; but in practice such supervision is not only impossible, but would prove utterly galling to the friends of the sufferer. From these causes it sometimes happens that upon attending to disinfect, the assistant finds that the patient has been up and about for a more or less lengthy period without having had his premises and articles liable to be infected properly disinfected Such cases, however, are few in number, and it appears difficult to devise a scheme which will entirely obviate them. On the other hand, there is an increasing tendency on the part of the public to call in the aid of the Department for the purpose of disinfecting premises which in the past have not been officially disinfected ; and although in many cases it is questionable whether a single disinfection is as valuable as a persistent recourse to pail and scrubbing-brush, it is not considered advisable to refuse the assistance when desired, even if it necessitates an increase of the 11 disinfecting staff, especially as the opportunity can be made use of for educational purposes Common Lodging-houses. —During the year a new Lodging-house was opened at 12, Tidal Basin Road, for the accommodation of 63 lodgers. There are, therefore, now 10 Common Lodginghouses within the Borough, registered under the Public Health Act, accommodating 516 lodgers. Slaughter-houses.—There are 12 private slaughter-houses within the Borough subject to an annual license, and 11 old slaughterhouses not subject to an annual renewal. All these buildings have been periodically inspected by the staff, and found to be kept in a cleanly condition. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops.—In accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders, inspection has been made by the Sanitary Inspectors and the Medical Officer of Health of the premises occupied by the 25 cowkeepers within the Borough. These premises are registered to accommodate 400 cows. In a large number of cases a much fewer number than were allowable were found within the cowsheds. In five cases, however, an excessive number above the legal limit were stored, and peremptory notices to abate overcrowding served on the cowkeepers. A considerable difference is noticeable both with regard to structure and cleanliness between different cowkeepers, and in view of the dangers to public health arising from contaminated milk, it is very desirable that there should be a levelling-up in the conditions under which some of the cowkeepers carry on their trade. In this connection I append the report of the Veterinary Inspector furnished to me by him after his annual examination of all 12 the cows within the Borough with a view to detecting tuberculosis of the udder. Town Hall, West Ham, 31st December, 1903. Examination of Cows in the County Borough for Tuberculosis of the Udder. Veterinary Surgeon's Report. The annual examination just concluded shows the number of dairy cows in the Borough to be 337 in 21 registered cowsheds. The premises at 281, Beckton Road are no longer used for cow-keeping. The general condition is again satisfactory. No case of tuberculosis of the udder was discovered, and a few only (seven) of the pulmonary form ; none of these being in an advanced stage. Six doubtful cases had to be revisited, but healthy resolution occurred in every instance. Sanitary arrangements are, on the whole, well observed. Appended are an abstract and details.

"The Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall, in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State." In accordance with the above requirement I submit a series of tables specifically showing the work carried out under the above Act. In 14 cases notice has been received from His Majesty's Inspector of Factories calling attention to nuisances remediable under the Public Health Act, but not under the Factory and Workshops Act. In the majority of cases these complaints have referred to a sufficiency or condition of the sanitary accommodation in connection with factories, and an attempt has been made to bring the latter up to the standard which rules in the metropolis, although the order of the Home Secretary relating to this subject is not in force within the Borough.

In accordance with the recommendation made by me in 1902, a special SubCommittee of the Public Health Committee was formed for the purpose of examining and certifying underground bakehouses under the Factory Act. The sub-Committee held eight meetings and visited each bakehouse on at least two occasions. The whole of the underground bakehouses certified were renovated up to and in accordance with the standards suggested in my special memorandum, save that the Council did not see its way to insist upon a minimum height of eight feet, but lowered the minimum height to seven feet. Seven underground bakehouses which were existent at the passing of the Act were not altered with a view to obtaining a Certificate, in some cases being closed, in others being used for another purpose, and in two cases a new ground-floor bakehouse being built in substitution. These bakehouses were situate at 160, Maryland Road ; 52, 22 Cruikshank Road; 64, Field Road; 191, Upton Lane; 16, Knox Road ; 332, Green Street; and the Co-operative Stores, Stratford New Town. I append a complete list of the underground bakehouses certified:— 73, Angel Lane 106, Balaam Street 108, Chapel Street, Stratford 88, Green Street 32, Khartoum Road 115, Leytonstone Road 199, Leytonstone Road 28, Martin Street 2, Northern Road 93, Plaistow Road 46, Plashet Road 23, Portway 158, Portway 42, Romford Road 327, Romford Road 54, Stratford Road 63, Upton Lane 100, Woodgrange Road 38, Windmill Lane 54, West Ham Lane 34, Pelly Road 2, Whitwell Road 80, Barking Road 16, Greengate Street 25, Chatsworth Road 8, Howard's Road 160, Boleyn Road 47, Fairland Road 48, Balaam Street 55, Carpenters' Road 43a, Water Lane 65, Chobham Road 30, Vansittart Road 44, Woodgrange Road 37, Vicarage Lane 97, Vicarage Lane 12, Terrace Road 530, Barking Road 365, Barking Road 51, Grange Road 117, Stratford Road 18, Station Road, Forest Gate 40, Stephen's Road 31, Denmark Street 78, Albert Square 195, High Street, Stratford The alterations required by the Sub-Committee in order to render the above bakehouses worthy of certificate were in all cases thorough, and in many of an extensive character, leading to the lowering and provision of concrete floors and damp courses, the insertion of 23 windows and ventilation shafts, the re-laying of drains, new means of access, and the re-facing of walls. The visitation during the execution of these works was laborious, but the ultimate result has been fraught not only with great benefit to the working bakers, but with considerable improvement in the methods of manufacture of the bread and other articles made upon the premises. Housing of Working Classes Act. During the year I only reported the following house as being in a state so dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation, viz.:— No. 23, Clarkson Street, Canning Town, which was voluntarily closed and thoroughly renovated, before occupation, by the owners. In January, 1903, the Housing of Working Classes Committee reported: "That, in connection with the subject of housing accommodation for the working classes, your Committee have had it brought to their notice that complaints are constantly arising with regard to the alleged overcrowding of houses, and recommend that the Public Health Committee be asked to cause instructions to be issued to the Inspectors of the Public Health Department to pay special attention to this question in their house-to-house visitations." In order to carry out this instruction constant watch has been kept during the year with a view to detecting overcrowding, but my officers have been unable in their enquiries to elicit facts which would warrant the belief that excessive overcrowding is rife in West Ham. From the Nuisance Table in the Appendix it will be seen that 39 notices to abate overcrowding were served during the year, a much smaller number than was found necessary in the years 1899, 1900, and 1901. During the year 498 new buildings were added to the inhabited 24 houses of the Borough, the houses being distributed among the wards as follow :— New Town 3 West Ham 43 Forest Gate 3 Plaistow 22 High Street 16 Hudsons 114 Broadway 1 Canning Town 33 Park 29 Tidal Basin 106 Upton 21 Custom House and Silvertown 107 One of the features of the year was the very large number of empty houses, especially in the southern portion of the Borough. Offensive Trades.—The only points worthy of note in this connection were the transference of fat-melting and bone-boiling business at Stratford from Mr. W. Hornett to a limited liability company, and the permission granted to Mr. F. Hammersley to establish a new fat-melting business at Bradfield Road, Silvertown. Owing probably to the comparatively low temperature during the whole of the year there were very few complaints in connection with the numerous offensive trades located in West Ham, but the same remark cannot be made in respect of smoke. It became necessary to serve official notices upon 27 firms, and I am pleased to record the distinct improvement in the condition of the atmosphere resulting therefrom, though there is still room for improvement in individual cases. General Sanitary Inspection.—Systematic house-tohouse inspection has been carried out throughout the year by 14 of your Inspectors (two ladies), and the results set out in the various tables at the end of the report, although the figures do not by any means make a full disclosure either of the difficulties encountered in the work or the benefits resulting from it. 25 Stratford Mortuary.

The total amount collected during the 307 working days of the year 1903 amounted to 28,403 loads, an increase of 142 loads on the . previous year. The shoots on which the above house refuse was deposited are set out below :— Out of Borough. Wanstead Brickfield (Messrs. East & Barrett) 654 Wanstead Ballast Hole (Mr. Allerton) 26 In the Borough.

Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Margarine Acts. Under these Acts 998 samples were purchased for analysis, and 161 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated.
