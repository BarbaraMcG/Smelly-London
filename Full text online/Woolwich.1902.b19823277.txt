To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. Me. Mayor and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting you with my Second Annual Report on the health of the Borough. Part 1.—Statistics. 1. Population. -I estimate the population to the middle of 1902 to be 122,505. This is more than the population estimated on the supposition of an increase since the census proportional to that between the two last censuses (120,020), but less than the population calculated according to the increase of inhabited houses (126,597). This population—122,505, is obtained by estimating a proportional increase for Woolwich and Plumstead Parishes, and an increase for Eltham, according to the number of new houses certified to have a proper supply of water (520), this number being multiplied by the number of persons to a house in Eltham found at the census (5.34). The population of each ward (see Table II.) is estimated in the same manner as that of Eltham, according to the number of new houses; the sum of these (126,597) is in excess of the figure taken for the Borough. 321 new houses were certified for water between the census (April 1st, 1901) and June 30th, 1901, and 1,292 between June 30th, 1901, and June 30th, 1902. 2. The estimated increase of the population during the year, is 4,886. The natural increase or excess of births over deaths was 1,892. 3. The following table gives for each ward the population and number of inhabited bouses found at the census together with the number of persons to a house, and the number of 10 Wards. Dockyard. St. Mary's. River. St. George's. Burrage. Herbert. St. Margaret's. Central. Glyndon. St. Nicholas. Eltham. new houses certified for water certificates from June, 1901, to June, 1902:— North. South.

Births.—The birth rate 29.9 was lower than in 1901 (303), but higher than in the previous three years; it was below the average of the ten preceding years. (See Table 1). The rate for the County of London was 28.5. 5. The following table shows the birth rate of the three parishes and eleven wards of the Borough, and how these compare with the neighbouring Boroughs:— Birth rate. Woolwich Paeish 28.8 Wards. Dockyard 32.2 St. Mary's 21.2 River 28.2 N. 39.1 S. 25.6 St. George's 34.4 Plumstead Parish 31.5 Wards. Burrage 22.7 Herbert 26.4 St. Margaret's 37.2 Central 32.6 Glyndon 28.5 St. Nicholas 29.8 Eltham 23.8 Greenwich 28.1 Lewisham 25.7 West Ham 34.1 East Ham 36.4 Erith 37.27 London 28.5 England & Wales 28.6 Woolwich Borough 29.9 12 6. The Birth rates of St. Mary's, St. Margaret's, Central, and Eltham Wards were higher than in 1901, and the birth rates of St. George's, Burrage. Glyndon, and St. Nicholas were lower. The highest birth rates were in the River Ward North, and St. Margaret's, and the lowest in St. Mary's, Burrage and Eltham. 7. The following table gives the birth rates for each parish in the last seven years:— 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902. Woolwich 30.5 31.5 30.2 30.3 28.2 28.5 28.8 Plumstead 32.7 32.3 30.2 30.2 29.8 31.5 31.5 Eltham 21.9 19.5 19.3 21.4 21.1 22.3 23.8 8. Deaths.—Table 1 gives the gross and nett deaths and death rates in 1902, and each of the past ten years, and shows also how the nett deaths are arrived at. All death rates mentioned in this report are nett death rates, to the extent that they are corrected for public institutions. Deaths by accident in the street, and by drowning in the river, registered in the Borough, have however been all credited to the Borough, even though they were known to have belonged to other districts. There were ten such deaths in 1902, most of them being registered in the River and St. Nicholas Wards. A few other deaths of Tramps passing through the Borough, dying in the Workhouse Infirmary, have also been credited to the Borough when they could not be definitely said to belong to other sanitary areas. But these are too few to affect the death rates. The year in question consists of the 53 weeks from 28th December, 1901, to 3rd January, 1903, but in order to make all birth and death rates comparable with years of 52 weeks, they have been multiplied by the fraction 52/53. 13 No correction has been made for the age distribution of the population, although this materially affects the death rates. Thus the large number of female servants in Eltham, and of soldiers in St. George's and St. Mary's Wards, at an age when the death rate is very low, make the death rate in these wards, and to some extent in the Borough, appear lower than it really is. Mr. Shirley Murphy has calculated the factor for correction for differences in the age and sex constitution of the population to be 1.05107 for London County, and 1.07024 for the Borough. The application of such factors to the death rate of each Borough had the effect in 1901 of bringing Woolwich down from the sixth to the seventh place as regards lowness of death rate. 9. The death rate 14.7 is, with the exception of 1901 (14.6), the lowest that has occurred in the past ten years. 10. Table VII. shows how Woolwich compares with the County and other Metropolitan Boroughs. The death rate in West Ham was 17.1 „ „ Bast Ham „ 11.9 „ „ Erith „ 12.88 ,, „ England and Wales 16.3 „ „ London ,, 17.2 11. The following table gives the death rate in each parish and each ward of the Borough:— Woolwich Paeish 17.1 Dockyard 16.4 St. Mary's 14.0 River—North 18.7 River—South 18.7 St. George's 16.4 14 Plumstead Parish 14.3 Burrage 15.4 Herbert 13.1 St. Margaret's 13.5 Central 13.2 Glyndon 14.5 St. Nicholas 13.3 Eltham Parish 8.5 12. Compared with 1901, the death rates of River, St. George's, Central, St. Nicholas and Eltham Wards were lower, and the remaining wards higher. Of the Woolwich and Plumstead Wards, Herbert again had the lowest rate, and River, as last year, the highest. Having obtained from the Census Office the population of each street in the River Ward, I have been enabled to estimate the population of North Woolwich, and the ward south of the river separately, and calculate death rates for each division. It is curious to find that the two death rates are exactly the same. 13. The following table gives the death rate in each parish for the past seven years:— 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902. Woolwich 20.4 17.3 20.1 21.0 21.8 16.8 17.1 Plumstead 15.6 13.6 16.2 14.0 15.8 13.2 14.3 Eltham 34.7 14.2 13.5 10.0 14.5 13.6 8.5 The death rate in Woolwich Parish was the lowest recorded, with the exception of 1901. Plumstead Parish had a lower rate in 1894, 1897, 1899 and 1901. Eltham has not had so low a rate since 1890. 14. Life capital saved.—If the years 1901 and 1902 had had the same average death rate as the ten years, 1892-1901, 15 viz., 16.6, there would have been in these two years 3,987 deaths instead of 3,565. There was thus a saving in these two years of 422 lives compared with previous years. This represents roughly a gain of life capital to the community of 12,000 years. This gain may be expressed in terms of money, for as Sir James Paget said, "the greater part of the national wealth is the income from the work which is the outcome from the national health." Sir Edwin Cbadwick estimated the value of each individual of the working class at £200. At this rate a saving of 422 lives represents a money gain of £84,400. But this is not all the saving, for every death represents say 25 persons attacked by some disease lasting on an average 30 days. One-third of these would be of the working age, and their wages about 4/- a day, making a further saving of £21,100. The cost of medical attendance and nursing at 1/a day, would make a further £15,825, making a gross saving of £121,325. I am far from inferring that all this saving of life and health is due to improved sanitary administration; indeed in view of the low death rate in London and the provinces during the two past years, I have no doubt that much of it is attributable to favourable meteorological or other general causes. But it is to be noted that whereas the Plumstead average death rate for 1901 and 1902, showed a reduction of 1.8 only compared with the previous ten years, Woolwich Parish showed a reduction of 2.7, and Eltham of 2.8. From these figures, I think it may be inferred, that a very considerable proportion (say one-fourth) of the saving in life capital above referred to, may fairly be attributed to the improved sanitary administration inaugurated by the Woolwich Borough Council, and it will be seen how remunerative is all well considered expenditure directed to the obtaining of improved sanitary conditions. The above remarks refer only to a recent improvement in sanitary administration, not by any means to the total saving of life and health which might be attributed to 16 the existence of a health department, but they show that the gain from such improvement is far in exccss of the total cost of the department, which is about £7,500. 15. The infant mortality as measured by the deaths under one year per thousand births, was 124. This is the lowest rate since 1890, with the exception of 1894, when it was 109. (See Table 1). The following table gives the rate in each parish and ward:— Woolwich Parish 119 Dockyard 98 St. Mary's 133 River—North 192 River—South 109 St. George's 127 Plumstead Parish 129 Burrage 123 Herbert 107 Glyndon 119 St. Margaret's 112 Central 135 St. Nicholas 152 Eltham 95 Greenwich 138 West Ham 149 East Ham 119 Erith 103 London 139 16. The following table shows the infant mortality per 1,000 births in each of the past seven years in each parish:— 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902. Woolwich 175 160 175 167 171 137 119 Plumstead 133 116 156 124 129 122 129 Eltham 176 120 150 198 156 141 95 17 Woolwich Parish had the lowest rate yet recorded, the next lowest having been in 1901. Its rate was for the first time lower than in Plumstead. 17. Compared with 1901, the infant mortality was lower in Woolwich and Eltham Parishes, and Dockyard, River, and St. Margaret's Wards, and higher in Plumstead Parish, and in St. Mary's, St. George's, Burrage, Herbert, Glyndon, and St. Nicholas Wards. 18. The high infantile mortality in the North River Ward is very marked, and partly explains the fact of the general death rate being as high in North Woolwich as in River Ward, South. From Table IV., we see that this high infant mortality arises from deaths by diarrhoea, whooping cough, bronchitis, premature birth, and "other nervous diseases" (mainly convulsions). I am informed by the Borough Engineer, that the sewers in North Woolwich are defective and have insufficient fall. The County Council main out-fall having been relaid at a lower level, a greater fall can now be obtained in the Borough Sewers, and the Council is considering the relaying of some of these sewers. I consider it is most desirable that this should be done, and have no doubt the result will be a great improvement in the infantile mortality of this district. 19. Table VII. shows how Woolwich compares with other Metropolitan Boroughs as respects infant mortality. Four Boroughs only had a lower rate. Zymotic Death Rate. 20. The Zymotic death rate, i.e., the deaths from Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea per 1,000 population, was 188 as compared with 1.51 in 1901, and 2.21 in London County. b 18 The Zymotic death rate was 177 in Woolwich Parish, 2.23 in Plumstead Parish, and 0.20 in Eltham. The following table shows the rate in each parish for each of the past three years:— 1900. 1901. 1902. Woolwich 3.8 1.61 1.74 Plumstead 2.1 1.42 2.20 Eltham 0.33 1.51 0.19 Deaths in Public Institutions. 21. Table 1 gives the total number of deaths in public institutions, inside and outside the Borough, and Table la, the institutions in which they occurred. Table lb gives a summary of the number of deaths, male and female, occurring in each of the principal institutions mentioned in Table la. Table IV. also shows how many deaths from each principal cause occurred in the institutions in the Borough. 247 deaths occurred in the Workhouse Infirmaries, 31 in the Military and Arsenal Hospitals, 45 in the large General Hospitals, 6 in the Chest Hospitals, and 32 in the various Lunatic Asylums. Of the deaths from phthisis 66, or about one-third of the total, took place in the Workhouse Infirmaries. Inquests. 22. There were 154 inquests compared with the same number in 1901. The following table gives particulars as to the causes of death:— 1. Natural causes 105 2. Accidental causes:— 105 Burns 6 Drowning 7 19 Falls 2 Fractures 3 Misadventure 11 Run over 5 Suffocation, being overlain in bed 3. Homicidal causes: — 5 – 39 Suicide 9 Murder—Manslaughter 0 – 9 4. Found drowned 0 Exposure 1 1 Total 154 Of the above, 6 were certified by the Coroner to be accelerated by alcoholism. Uncertified Deaths. 23. There were 21 deaths which were not certified either by a medical practitioner, nor by a Coroner after inquest. The rate per cent. of total deaths was 1.1 in the Borough, 1.4 in Woolwich Parish, 0.7 in Plumstead Parish, and 4.7 in Eltham. The rate in Plumstead was the lowest yet recorded. Small-Pox and Vaccination. 24. A full report on the recent outbreak of Small-pox in the Borough has already been presented and printed. It is appended to this report, and covers the period September, 1901, to June, 1902. Five cases and two deaths occurred in July, but no cases have occurred since. There were during the year, 228 cases, and 38 deaths. Tables III. and V. give particulars as to the cases and deaths occurring during the year. The case rate 1.82, and death rate 0.30, were the highest I have recorded. b 2 20 25. The following table kindly furnished by the Vaccination Officer, gives particulars as to the vaccination of the children born in 1901:— District. Births. Successful Insusceptible. Had Small-pox. Conscientious objections. Died unvaccinated. Postponed. Sent to other Vaccination Officers Gone—No address. Summoned. 1. East Plumstead 1706 1350 7 0 75 162 7 12 93 0 2.

Measles. 26. There were 41 deaths from measles, giving a death rate of 0.33, compared with 0.18 in 1891. All but two of the deaths were under five years of age, and 13 under one year. Table X. shows that the highest number of deaths occurred in January (10), and in April (11). Only two deaths occurred after June. 10 deaths occurred in Woolwich Parish—death rate 0.24 31 ,, „ Plumstead „ ,, 043 0 „ „ Eltham „ „ nil London death rate 051 646 notifications of measles were received from School Teachers, compared with 323 in 1901. The numbers for each School were as follows:—Purrett Road School, 81; Earl Street, 80; Aneon a Road, 69; Plumstead Road, 46; Vicarage Road, 41; Plum Lane, 37; Elizabeth Street, 34; Central, 32 21 Slade, 29; Burrage Grove, 23; St. Mary's, 20; and smaller numbers from 13 other schools. 27. The following classes or class-rooms of the infant departments of elementary schools were closed during a period of three weeks for the prevention of Measles:—Conway Road, rooms A and B; Mulgrave Place, room C; Central Schools, infant department; Slade School, room A; Plum Lane, room B; Burrage Grove, rooms C and B; Earl Street, rooms B, E and G; Vicarage Road, infant department; Elizabeth Street, infant department; Central School, infant department; Wickham Lane, room A; Christchurch, infant department; Greening Street, room A. The class-rooms closed were chiefly those containing the younger children, most of them under six years of age, so that the interference with education was not of a serious nature. At three schools the closure was in February, one in March, two in April, three in May, one in June, one in July, one in October and one in December. 28. The following table gives the death rate per 1,000 population from Measles, in each of Woolwich and Plumstead parishes, during the last 12 years compared with London:— Woolwich Plumstead London Year. No. Rate. No. Rate. Rate. 1891 26 0.63 33 0.62 0.43 1892 16 0.39 19 0.35 0.79 1893 14 034 47 0.84 0.38 1894 39 095 20 0.35 0.76 1895 6 0.14 24 0.41 0.60 1896 72 1.75 68 1.14 0.82 1897 1 0.02 3 0.05 0.43 1898 53 1.27 59 0.94 0.69 1899 13 0.32 3 0.04 0.48 1900 29 0.69 46 0.68 0.43 Average 10 years 0.65 ... 0.54 0.58 1901 11 0.26 9 0.13 0.43 1902 10 024 31 0.43 0.51 22 It will be seen from this table that the measles death rate was lower in each parish during the past two years than in any previous biennial period since 1890. The same is true of the measles death rate of the county during 1900 and 1901, but the county rate in 1901 and 1902 was higher than in the preceding biennial period. 29. Of the 41 deaths, 13 were under one year of age, 26 between one and five years, and only 2 over five years. 30. The following are the means adopted in the Borough for diminishing the spread of Measles:— (a). Special warnings sent to Head Teachers of Infant Schools when Measles is prevalent in adjoining districts. (b). The inspection of houses where Measles is reported by School Teachers, cards of precautions left, means taken to prevent the attendance of children from the house at any school, steps taken to abate nuisances found. (c). Infected classes temporarily closed, or certain children kept away from school. (d). Disinfection of infected class rooms. (e). A Special Enquiry into the spread of Measles, and the benefit of temporary closure of classes is being made in conjunction with the Medical Officers of the London School Board. Scarlet Fever. 31. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year, viz., 267, was the smallest on record, giving a rate per 1,000 population of 2.14, compared with 2.64 in 1901, which was the previous minimum. The following table shows the occurrence rates from Scarlet 23 Fever for the Borough and each Parish during the past two years compared with London. 1901. 1902.

Table III gives the age distribution and cases occurring in each ward, as well as the number of those removed to a Fever Hospital, and the number of cases regarded at the Hospital as a mistaken diagnosis. The age incidence was as usual mainly on the ages 1 to 5, and 5 to 15, or the school ages. There was no marked prevalence in any one ward. 32. There were only 8 deaths, giving a death rate of 0.06. The following table gives the case mortality for each parish compared with London in the past two years (per cent. of cases):— 1901. 1902.

Of the 267 cases, 230, or 86 per cent., were removed to one of the Asylums Board's Hospitals, most to the "Brook." In 1901, 85 per cent were removed. 7 cases, or 3.0 per cent. of admissions were reported not to be Scarlet Fever after observation at Hospital. 24 34. The following was the School most affected:— Elizabeth Street, North Woolwich—17 cases or 23 per cent. of numbers on the books. 35. Return Cases. 19 "return cases" were reported, compared with 7 in 1901. The interval between return and infection of secondary case varied from 0 to 31 days ; in two it was 2 days; in three, 3 days; one, 5 days; one, 6 days four, 7 days; and in five, over 7 days. In one there was a discharge from the ear, and in one, from the nose. The stay in Hospital of the infective cases varied from 5½ to 13 weeks; in five, it was under 8 weeks; in two, 8 weeks; in six, 9 weeks; and in three, over 9 weeks. Diphtheria. 36. There were 233 cases of Diphtheria compared with 365 and 216 in the two preceding years. The case rate was 1.87 compared with 184 in 1901, and, with the exception of that year, was the lowest rate recorded since 1894. There were 23 deaths; The death rate was 0.18 compared with 0.16 in 1901, and with the exception of that year was the lowest recorded death rate since 1891. (For the case and death rates in all years since 1899, see Table V.) 37. 71 cases were in Woolwich Parish, 151 in Plumstead, and 11 in Eltham. The following table shows the case rates in each parish per 1,000 population in the past two years compared with London:— 1901. 1902. The Borough 1.84 1.87 25 Woolwich Parish 1.56 1.67 Plumstead Parish 1.9 2.09 Eltham Parish 2.33 1.08 London 2.7 2.3 38. 189 cases were removed to Hospital, or 81 per cent. The case mortality was 9.9 per cent. compared with 8.8 in 1901, and 10.5 in London; 19 cases died in hospital giving a case mortality of 10.0; 4 cases died at home—case mortality, 9.0. In 1901, the case mortality was 9.5 at hospital and 3.6 at home. 39. The largest number of cases occurred in St. Margaret's and Glyndon Wards, but the largest number of deaths in the River Ward. 40. School Attendance.—Ancona Road was the School most affected, there being 28 cases among pupils of this school. No other school had more than 10 cases; 25 of the 28 cases at Ancona Eoad School occurred in November and December. 41. Up to the end of October the number of cases of Diphtheria did not attain the number reached in the corresponding period of 1901. In November and December, however, there were 81 cases of the disease, 25 being pupils of the Ancona Road School. Previous to this, 7 cases occurred in four neighbouring houses in Eichmond Place, for which personal infection was probably responsible. Another child, living in Eichmond Place, with no symptoms of Diphtheria or other diseases, having a scab in one nostril was examined by the medical attendant and found to have Diphtheria bacilli. 26 In November the following letter was sent to Medical Practitioners in the Borough :— "After an interval, in which the occurrence of Diphtheria has fallen to a comparatively low ebb, we appear, at the present time, to be confronted with a marked recrudesence of the disease, but mainly of a mild type. "But, what is most serious, and, in my experience, quite unusual, is the prevalence, during the past few weeks, of a mild type of nasal Diphtheria, without obvious membrane, and such as would not—in the absence of other grounds for suspecting an infectious disease— be regarded as more than an ordinary catarrh. "The accompanying notes of cases will show you how I have come to be aware of three such cases, which a bacteriological examination shewed to be Diphtheria, and which, I have little doubt, were the cause of communicating the disease to others. "It appears that where any such case of clinical Diphtheria has occurred in a family, any member with the least discharge or soreness of the nose, is to be regarded as a possible case of the disease and source of infection. "I thought that you would be glad to be made aware of these facts in case Diphtheria should occur among your own patients." 42. The following are the notes of the cases above referred to :— Case No. 1.—On the 11th of November, I was asked by Dr.—— to see M. H. W., age 4, S. J. W., age 2, and H. S. W., age 4, brother and sisters, with a view to confirming the diagnosis of Diphtheria, before removal to Hospital. This I had no hesitation in doing, but, at the same time, I observed a brother, 27 A. C. W., age 16, with soreness and running at the nose His throat was normal I was informed, however, that two weeks before, he had had a slight sore throat, for which he had stayed away from school for balf-a-day. A swab was taken of the nasal discharge, and found to contain Diphtheria bacilli. It was obvious that this boy, who probably had not had any clinical pharyngeal Diphtheria, and had not been ill in himself, had infected his brother and sisters with the disease. No other cases were notified at the school he was attending. Case No. 2.—On the 17th September, W. W., age 4, was taken with Diphtheria, moved to Hospital on the 19th, and died on the 30th. On the 1st November, M. W., sister of W. W., age 13, commenced with the same disease, and on the 2nd and 3rd November, respectively, E. W., age 6, and M. W., age 1 3/12, brother of W. W. On visiting the house, I discovered a lad, A. W., age 15, with a soreness and scab in the left nostril; throat normal. He was said to have had a slight sore throat for a week at the beginning of October, he had only stayed away from work for halfa-day. A swab was taken, both from the throat and left nostril, and the latter was found to contain Diphtheria bacilli. There appeared little doubt that A. W. had been infected by W. W., and had, after four weeks, transmitted the infection to his remaining brothers and sisters. Case No. 3.—On the 22nd November, R, B., age 15, commenced with Diphtheria, and on the 23rd her brother, W. B., age 17. These persons were not attending school, but brothers attended a school 28 where several cases of Diphtheria had recently occurred. I accordingly suspected an undetected case in the house, and, on visiting, discovered that Y. B., age 6, attending the school referred to, had bad cold, slight sore throat, earache, and was feverish on the 15th November, and had been kept at home since. I found that he had a slight mucous discharge from both nostrils, which under ordinary circumstances should not have regarded as more than a common catarrh. I took, however, a swab, and Diphtheria bacilli were found to be present. 43. The following report on the prevalence of Diphtheria was presented to you on the 3rd December:— "Facts coming to my knowledge within the last few months have impressed me with the wide-spread prevalence of the Diphtheria bacilli, causing, however, in most cases, very mild symtoms, and in some, no symptoms at all. Certain unknown conditions (meteorological or otherwise) appear to have given the germs increased virulence, and hence the present outbreak. This has, however, been specially connected with Ancona Eoad School. Immediately I observed that the School was implicated (21st Nov.), I wrote to the Medical Officer of the London School Board, calling his attention to the fact, and recommending that the children should be examined for the detection of mild and unsuspected cases of Diphtheria. Dr. Thomas, Assistant Medical Officer of the London School Board, came down on the 25th November and examined most of the children in the infant department. He picked out 16 cases for bacteriological examination, one of which had obvious 29 Diphtheria when I saw her, and one was found to have the Diphtheria germs in a nasal discharge. Four others were found to have pseudo Diphtheria germs in nasal discharges from which they suffered, In addition to these I found, on visiting the houses, three pupils of this school, and one pupil at another school, with undetected Diphtheria, not under medical treatment. Three of these were in attendance up to the day preceding my visit. With the exclusion of the children above mentioned, the outbreak at Ancona Eoad School has abated." 44. The measures described above had the desired effect, and during January of the current year, there was only a total of 17 cases of Diphtheria in the Borough, and only one was a pupil of Ancona Eoad School. 45. Bacteriological diagnosis. Secretion from 97 cases of suspected Diphtheria was examined at the Jenner Institute. The presence of Diphtheria bacilli was shewn in 27 cases, and in 7 cases pseudo-Diphtheria bacilli were found, or a total of 34 positive results. In 1901, 26 cases were examined with 7 positive results. 21 cases, or 11 per cent, of admissions were reported not to be diphtheria, after removal to Hospital. In two of these a bacteriological examination had been made on behalf of the Borough Council, in one with a positive, and in the other with a negative result. In 1901, 12 per cent, of admissions were reported to be a " mistaken diagnosis." I have no doubt, that the speedy way in which the epidemic prevailing at the end of the year was brought to an end, was largely due to the facilities provided for bacteriological diagnosis. 30 46. Arrangements have been made to keep a supply of diphtheria anti-toxin at the Health Office, to enable medical practitioners to obtain it promptly in an emergency. It is only supplied on payment, the Council having no power to provide it gratuitously. Enteric Fever. 47. There were 50 cases of Enteric Fever (excluding 8 cases found not to be Enteric Fever after notification), giving a case rate per 1,000 population of 0-40, compared with 0'52, 0'59and 0-58 in the three preceding years. This is the smallest rate recorded since 1891 (See Table V.) London case rate 0 74. The following were the cases occurring in each parish during the past three years:— 1900. 1901. 1902. Woolwich 23 21 17 Plumstead 39 32 24 Eltham 4 15 9 Eltham and Dockyard Wards had the highest number of cases proportionally to population. There were 13 deaths, giving a death rate of 0.10 per 1,000 population, and a case mortality of 26 per cent. London death rate 012, and case mortality 17 per cent. Six of the deaths belonged to Woolwich Parish (4 to St. George's Ward), 6 to Plumstead, and 1 to Eltham. 48. Source of Infection. Five cases were due to direct infection occurring in three houses, three of the cases living in the same dirty house as the primary case, and the other two being employed in nursing the primary case The primary case was in one instance a hawker, in another a greengrocer (in Kidbrook), and in the third had never been notified, but had suffered from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea two weeks before her 31 sister fell ill, and was in the habit of eating periwinkles. One case contracted the infection at Queenstown. Twelve cases had eaten shell fish within three weeks of infection, viz.; 3 mussels, 3 winkles, 2 cockles, and 1 scallops. One of these had eaten the cockles at Southend, where there had recently •been an outbreak of Enteric, due to cockles. Three cases had had ice creams, 2 fried fish, 2 lettuce, and 2 watercress. In the remaining cases no source of infection was discovered. Of the 9 Eltham cases 4 lived in Court Eoad and West Park, 1 was a greengrocer, 1 a hawker who had had cockles, 1 a carter who had had oysters, and 1 was due to direct infection outside the Borough. The following table gives the age, sex, date of commencement of illness, and milk supply (N.U.) of the Eltham cases :— Age. Sex. Date of Commencement. Milk Supply. Address. 12 F 4/1/02 N. " Lynfield," Eltham 34 M 6/2/02 U. 76, Eltham Eoad, Lee 23 F 2/3/02 N. 11, West Park 25 F 13/3/02 F.F. 2, West Park 35 F 28/6/02 D. 14, Pelham Terrace 30 F 18/6/02 N.

Bacteriological Diagnosis.—Blood serum from 30 cases of suspected Enteric Fever was submitted to the Jenner Institute for the application of the Widal re-action, compared with 27 in 1901. A positive result—showing the existence of Enteric —was obtained in 13 cases and a negative in 17. 52. 42 of the 58 cases notified were removed to a Fever Hospital, and eight were there found to be a mistaken diagnosis, or 14 per cent., compared with 12 per cent, in 1901. 32 Diarrhceal Diseases. 53. The deaths from Diarrhoea, Dysentery, and epidemic or Zymotic Enteritis, numbered 59, or 0 48 per 1,000 population, compared with 0-82 in 1901. The rate for London County was 0-54. There were, in addition, 18 deaths from Enteritis and Gastro-Enteritis, making a total of 77 deaths, due probably to the same disease denoted by different names. 54. Of the above 77 deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases, 62 were under 1 year of age. The following Table shews the death rate from these diseases per 1,000 births in each Ward and Parish in 1901 and 1902 :— Diarrhceal Diseases per 1.000 Births. 1901. 1902. Woolwich Parish 37 19 River Ward—North 62 37 River Ward—South 23 Dockyard Ward 32 17 St. Mary's Ward 19 18 St. George's Ward 20 7 Plumstead Parish 31 23 St. Nicholas Ward 43 29 Central 20 12 Glyndon 34 31 St. Margaret's Ward 22 25 Herbert Ward 21 11 Burrage Ward 23 22 Eltham Parish 39 9 55. During the two years 1901 and 1902, there was a saving of 103 lives from diarrhoea in Woolwich and Eltham Parishes, compared with 1900, but in Plumstead of only one life. 33 56. Table VIII. shows that the principal mortality from diarrhoea was in September and October, and that this did not commence for two months after the 3-foot thermometer had reached 59°. There was heavy fall of rain in the third week of August and the second week of September. 57. The table given above shows the River Ward North had far the highest death rate from diarrhoeal diseases and St. George's, Eltham, and Herbert Wards the lowest. There has been a marked improvement in the diarrhoeal mortality of River, Dockyard, St. George's and Eltham Wards. 58. It is much to be regretted that I do not receive copies of registration of births in the same way as is done with deaths. It would then be possible to instruct mothers by leaflets, as to the best mode of feeding infants, just at the time when such instruction was most needed. The slight expense this would entail is the merest trifle compared with the advantage that would probably result. I may mention that the leaflet in use in the Borough for this purpose, was referred to in an article by General Sir F. Maurice, in the January number of the " Contemporary Review," an article which ably enforced the great need that exists for educating mothers in this way. Erysipelas. 59. There were 98 cases of erysipelas notified, compared with 72 in the previous year. There was only one death from this cause as in 1901. Puerperal Fever. 60. There were 11 cases of Puerperal Fever, compared with 8 in 1901. There were 6 deaths, compared with 3 in 1901. Four cases were in Woolwich Parish, five in Plumstead, and two in Eltham. Seven were attended in the confinement by a c 34 registered medical practitioner, 3 by a midwife, and one had no skilled assistance, but was aided by a lodger in the house. 61. Two cases were attended by the same nurse, who also nursed a woman certified to have died of Influenza six days after confinement. The case of supposed Influenza preceded only by a few days the first case of Puerperal Fever; the second was two months later. There seemed reason for thinking that the supposed Influenza was really Puerperal Fever, and that the nurse was in some way responsible for all three. She was requested to thoroughly disinfect herself, and abstain from nursing any cases for three months. In one case the woman had been in contact with a case of Small-pox. The symptoms were said to be however characteristic of puerperal septicaemia. In another case, delivery was by instruments, and the husband—a mortuary keeper—assisted the doctor after disinfecting his hands. In one case a neighbour assisted the doctor. 62. A case of Scarlet Fever was notified in a parturient woman, commencing a few days after confinement. She was attended by a midwife who neglected to notify, but finally when the patient was desquamating, a doctor was called in. The case was of average severity, and did not present the ordinary features of Puerperal Fever. Influenza, Beonchitis, and Pneumonia. 63. Influenza caused 60 deaths, compared with 62 and 22 in the two preceding years. The deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia number 299, having been 407 and 245 in 1900 and 1901 respectively. Table VIII. shows that the highest number of deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia (13) occurred in the week following that which had the lowest mean temperature (30.4). 35 Tuberculosis. 64. There were 232 deaths from Tuberculous Disease compared with 269 in 1901. This number exceeds the sum of the deaths from Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Influenza, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever. The rate per 1,000 population was 1.86, compared with 2.29 in the year preceding. The deaths from Phthisis were 183, and the death rate 1.47, compared with 180 and 1.79 in the two preceding years. 65. The following table gives the death rate from Phthisis and other tubercular diseases per 1,000 population in each Ward during the past two years :— Phthisis. Other Tubercular Diseases. 1901. 1902. 1901. 1902. No. Rate. No. . Rate. No. Rate. No. Rate.

It appears then that there has been a marked decrease in the death rate from Tuberculosis of all forms and in all three parishes. The improvement is especially marked in the River Ward, where, iodeed, it was most needed. Eltham Ward again had the lowest death rate, Herbert and St. Nicholas Wards having the next lowest. River Ward South and St. George's again had the highest rates, River Ward North having the lowest rate of the Woolwich Wards. 66. The following table shows the death rate from Phthisis in recent years in Woolwich and Plumstead Parishes :— 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 Woolwich — 2.1 1.9 2.0 2.4 2.4 2.52 1.95 Plumstead 1.64 1.3 1.5 1.27 1.45 1.50 1.51 1.30 The rate for each parish in 1902 appears to be the lowest recorded with one exception. It is satisfactory to see that the efforts made in recent years to deal with this disease by instruction, disinfection, and especially during the past year by bacteriological diagnosis and voluntary notification are bearing fruit. I have no doubt that the improvement would have been more marked and appeared earlier if it had not been for the increase of intemperance in recent years. As to this, more is said under Alcoholism (paragraphs 83 and 84). 67. Notifications. Voluntary notification was in force during the whole of the year, having commenced at the end of 1901. 189 cases were notified, compared with 119 in 1901 (35 of which only were paid for). The largest number of notifications came from River and Glyndon Wards, and the smallest number from the Central and Eltham. 37 Of 151 cases notified between January 1st and September 30th, 43 died before the end of the year, 24 dying within one month of notification, and 17 more within six months. In 71 notified cases the previous duration of the disease was under six mouths ; in 21 between six months and a year; in 30 between one and two years ; and in 37 over two years. 68. In 21 houses where cases were notified the walls were dirty, and in 3 the walls were damp. 11 cases were said to be intemperate, 2 were said to be teetotallers. In 9 cases the source of infection was probably as follows, viz. : 1 father, 1 mother, 2 brothers, 1 stepfather, 2 lodgers, 1 sister, 1 husband. 69. Disinfection. Disinfection was performed in 89 cases, 45 being after death, and 44 were cases that had been notified and either removed to the Infirmary or Hospital, or were willing to allow disinfection while still in the house. In the two previous years, 18 and 86 premises, respectively, were disinfected. 70. Bacteriological diagnosis. Sputa from 36 suspected oases of diagnosis was submitted to the Jcnner Institute for bacteriological examination, and a positive result obtained in 12. The Council only commenced to provide for this valuable means of diagnosis at the end of 1901. I consider it is proving to be of the greatest value in detecting cases of phthisis and enabling early curative and preventive measures to be taken. 71. Age Distribution. The following table gives a comparison as to age incidence between cases notified and deaths from Phthisis during 1902. The totals being nearly 38 equal (viz. 189 and 183), the numbers are practically comparable. Age. 0-1 1—5 5—15 15—25 25—65 Over 65. Notifications 1 2 11 34 140 1 Deaths 2 1 6 25 147 2 So far as it goes this table indicates that phthisis is less fatal between 5 and 25 years of age than in after life. 98 cases were notified between 25 and 45 years, and 42 between 45 and 65. As there are over twice as many persons living at the earlier age, it is seen that susceptibility to phthisis is but little less over 45 than under. It will be seen from Table IV that when all forms of tuberculosis are considered, the deaths from this disease are from one third to one fourth the total deaths at each age period from 5 to 65. 72. The susceptibility to the disease seems to be greater at the earlier ages, and its fatality at the later ages. It must be remembered that forms of tuberculosis other than phthisis are not notified, being but slightly infectious, and also that they frequently exist without being recognised. But I have no doubt that a case of phthisis in a house where proper precautions are not taken, very commonly infects the children in that house with some form of tuberculosis. In recently investigating the deaths of three children from tubercular meningitis, I found that in two cases there was a person in the house recognised to be suffering from phthisis, and in the third case a man suffering from chronic winter cough and sputa, who refused to be examined as to whether or no be had phthisis. The latter and one other of the cases of phthisis was the father of the child ; the third was no relation. 73. Sex. 130 of the notified cases were males and 59 females. 39 74. Occupation. Of the 130 notified males, 67, or about one half, were Arsenal employees, of whom 32 were labourers. Probably considerably over one half the occupied males living in the Borough are employed in the Royal Arsenal. 21 outside the Arsenal were labourers (11 being dock labourers); 3 were soldiers, 3 bootmakers, 2 stablehands ; the remainder included a baker, a printer, a painter, a waterman, a lighterman, a tailor, a draper, an outfitter and a cabdriver. The 59 females included 3 servants, 2 laundry women, and a barmaid. Among the deaths were 4 persons engaged in the liquor trade, namely a beerhouse keeper, a potman, the wife of a beerhouse keeper, and a barmaid, giving a mortality of 4 3 per 1,000 persons employed in this trade, which is two-and-a-half times the Phthisis mortality of the Borough (see also par. 84). 75. Three, or 10 per cent., of the deaths of natives of Woolwich in Lunatic Asylums were from phthisis. 76. The prevention of promiscuous spitting.—The following steps for the prevention of dangerous habits of expectorating were taken during the year, in addition to those described in previous reports :—- (a) Notices requesting persons not to spit on the floor were distributed and fixed in the bars of all public houses in Woolwich Parish (this had previously been done in Plumstead). (b) A communication was addressed to the S.E.R. and the G.E.R. Companies, requesting them to take steps to prohibit spitting on the floors of their railway carriages. This request was, at the Council's suggestion, backed up by Greenwich and several other of the South Metropolitan Borough Councils. 40 (c) Pocket spittoons, as used in Manchester, have been obtained for the use of consumptives, to whom they are supplied at cost price, viz., 6d. 77. Regulations against spitting in public places are now in force in many foreign countries, in Glasgow, and in Glamorgan. There is no doubt that such a prohibition should be general, and should apply to public houses. Probably most adult men who contract phthisis, derive the infection from the public house. The Borough Council has the power to make a bye-law to prohibit spitting, and it is most desirable that this power should be exercised. A report making this recommendation was presented to your Council in July last. It would be better still if the County Council would make a byelaw for the whole County. 78. Sanatoria for Consumption.—It has been conclusively proved that by means of open-air treatment in properly equipped sanatoria, the large majority of cases of consumption may be cured, or have their disease arrested, if taken in the early stage. Such sanatoria are therefore necessary for treatment; but they are also most desirable for prevention, for every case properly treated in a Sanatorium ceases to be a source of infection to others, and during his stay in the institution will be trained in the steps necessary to avoid spreading the infection on his return home. Advanced cases are specially a means of spreading the disease, owing to the large amount of sputa they expectorate, and should be isolated in suitable homes when their circumstances prevent home isolation. Of the 183 deaths from Phthisis last year, 49 took place in the Workhouse Infirmary. I understand that the Phthisical inmates of the Infirmary are isolated so far as circumstances allow. It is of great importance that they should be altogether 41 isolated from other inmates, and that early cases should be given the benefit of the open air treatment. The Council has power to provide Hospitals under the Public Health (London) Act, and the neighbouring Boroughs of Greenwich and Lewisliam have been approached with a view to the joint establishment of a Sanatorium. Cancer. 79. There were 104 deaths from Cancer, compared with 84 and 82 in the two preceding years. 39 deaths were in Woolwich Parish, 59 in Plumstead, and 6 in Eltham. The increase was most marked in Woolwich Parish, and there was a decrease in Eltham. River, Burrage, Glyndon, and St. Margaret's Wards had the highest number of cases proportionately to population. River and Glyndon Wards were the two highest in 1901. The rate per 1,000 population was 0'83 in the Borough, compared with 0'70 in 1901, and 0'93 in the County in 1901. Alcoholism. 80. There were 18 deaths from Alcoholism, and 22 from Cirrhosis of the Liver, making a total due to intemperance of 40, compared with 52 in the preceding year. In addition to these, 371 deaths were attributed to diseases of the brain, nervous system, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys; probably at least a quarter of these deaths were directly caused by alcohol, and in another quarter alcoholism was a contributory factor. 81. Of the 40 deaths due to Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver, 26 or 0.61 per 1,000 population belonged to Woolwich Parish, and 14 or 019 to Plumstead. 11 were in the South River Ward, or 0.94 per 1,000 population, and 13 in the whole River Ward, or 0 86 per 1,000. 42 82. The following table shows the death rate from Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver in the two past years : — 1901. 1902. The Borough 0.44 0.32 Woolwich Parish 0.74 0.61 Plumstead Parish 0.27 0.19 Eltham Parish 0.25 Nil River Ward 110 0.86 River Ward, South — 0.94 It is satisfactory to find some general improvement in the death rate from intemperance. River Ward again has far the highest death rate, and the improvement has been less there than in the rest of the Borough. 83. An improvement in the death rate from Alcoholism has accompanied the lessened death rate from Tuberculosis, and the first is doubtless the cause of the latter. I find that in the past seven years the three years that have the lowest rates from Phthisis have also had the lowest rates from Alcoholism. The following table shows that the parts of the Borough which have the highest mortality from Alcoholism have also the highest percentage of public houses :— Public and Beer Houses. Total Houses. Percentage. The Borough 185 18,086 10 Woolwich Parish 110 5,441 2-0 Plumstead 62 11,292 0-5 Eltham 13 1,353 1-0 River Ward 61 2,112 2-9 84. Death Bate of Public Houses.—I have examined into the deaths occurring in a group of Public Houses, chiefly to find the incidence of Phthisis on such premises. 43 The 24 public and beer houses, lying between Powis Street and the river in the River Ward, were the ones selected, and the population found to be 125. 11 deaths occurred in these houses in the three years, 1900-1-2. These included 2 from Phthisis, 1 Enteric Fever, 1 Suicide, 1 Cirrhosis of the Liver, 1 Cerebral Haemorrhage, 1 Cerebral Meningitis, 1 Bronchitis, 1 Peritonitis, 1 Morbus Cordis, and 1 Premature Birth. The gross death rate was thus 29.3, or about twice that of the Borough; and the Phthisis death rate 5 3, or about three times that of the Borough. It must be remembered, however, that these figures only apply to persons living and sleeping on the premises. Potmen, barmen, and barmaids do not usually reside at the public house, and it is on them that the incidence of Phthisis is most heavy, being nearly twice as great as it is on inkeepers, and in London higher than on any other class of the community. Meteorology (see Table VIII.) 85. In the first, or winter, quarter the temperature was below the average in four weeks, above the average in eight weeks, and equal to the average in one week. The mean temperature was 40°.5, or 10.6 above the average. In the spring quarter the temperature was above the average in four weeks and below in nine ; the first three weeks of May had a lower average temperature than the first two weeks of January. The mean temperature was 51o,0. In the third or summer quarter the temperature was above the average in four weeks, and below in nine. The mean temperature was 59°-6. In the fourth or autumn quarter the temperature was above the average in nine weeks, and below in five. The mean temperature was 45°-2. 44 Thus the temperature, being above the average in the winter and autumn, and below in the spring and summer, was favourable to health. The temperature three feet below the ground averaged 59°.68 in the summer quarter, and never exceeded 61°.09. The highest temperature of the air was 86°.l in the third week of July, and the lowest 14° 3 in the last week in February. The highest number of deaths in one week occurred in the first week of March, i.e., the week following that in which the lowest temperature occurred. The week of highest average temperature was the last in June (viz., 64°.8), and that of lowest average the third in February (30°.4). The total rainfall of the year was 20.13 inches, of which 3 42 inches fell in the first quarter, 6 59 in the second, 5.91 in the third, and 4.21 in the fourth. In 1901 the rainfall was 20.16 inches. 45 Part II.—Administration. Water Supply. 1. The water supply has continued to be satisfactory on the whole, and no complaint has been received as to the quality of the water. Three houses in Eltham were found to have their water from surface wells. In two cases the well was exposed to sewage pollution and was consequently closed and Kent Company's water laid on. In the third instance the water was found pure and well protected from pollution and no action was taken. In one of these instances, although a cesspool lay within a few feet of the well, strong objections were offered by the occupier to the proposal to close it until an analysis proved the water to be seriously contamiuated with sewage. 113 defective and foul cisterns were found and cleansed or remedied. In 66 houses the supply was found deficient or temporarily cut off, and the proper remedy effected. 27 rain-water tanks were found foul or otherwise defective. The usual remedy applied was the filling in of the tank. 920 new houses were certified to have a proper and sufficient supply of water. 2. The Public Health (London) Act requires that every house shall have a proper and sufficient supply of water. The question has arisen in the case of large tenement houses whether one water tap (in the basement say) can be regarded as a sufficient supply for a house containing 20 persons in 3 or 4 families, some of whom live four floors above the water tap. The difficulty of providing water on the higher floors is the necessity for providing for waste and the prevention of soakage from splashing. It certainly appears, however, that until this is done the house cannot be said to comply with the Act. I 46 Food and Drugs Act. 3. 508 samples were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst, and 21 or 4.1 per cent. were found adulterated. In 1901 the percentage of adulterations was 5.5. Proceedings were taken in all cases, 18 being for milk, 2 for butter, and 1 for vinegar. Convictions were obtained in 18 cases, 1 was withdrawn on proof of warranty, and 2 were adjourned. Of the 18 milk adulterations, 13 were "fat abstracted" (from 10 to 33 per cent.), 3 "added water" (from 10 to 16 per cent.), and 2 " boracic acid added" (120 and 160 grains per gallon respectively). The highest penalty was £10 and 12/6 costs for 33 per cent, fat abstracted; other penalties varied from 10/- to £3, and costs from 12/6 to £5 5s. (see Table X.). 4. The Eeport of the Royal Commission on Food Preservatives, recommending that no preservatives should be used in milk, has strengthened the hands of Health Authorities in trying to put a stop to this injurious practice, which is antagonistic to all efforts made to obtain absolutely clean milk. 27 samples of milk were examined by the Public Analyst for the presence of Boric Acid; this was found in three, viz., 12 grains per gallon in one, 120 grains in another, aud 160 grains in a third; successful prosecutions were instituted for the two latter (see above). Food Inspection. 5. The special inspection of the market and principal shops on Friday and Saturday and other times for unsound food was continued. Inspector Barnes having resigned, Inspector Mackie now performs this duty. 47 6. Seven seizures of unsound food were made, and 13 lots were surrendered spontaneously by the owners. Four were butchers' meat, 2 rabbits, 9 fish, 1 eggs, and 4 fruit or vegetables. Each lot seized was condemned by a magistrate, and three owners were prosecuted ; one was fined £20, one was imprisoned three months in default of paying a fine of £20, and one case was dismissed in spite of very strong evidence that the food (rabbits) was unsound at the time of seizure, mainly because two days elapsed before it was taken to a magistrate owing to Sunday intervening. All food seized and surrendered was destroyed at the dust destructor. In 1901 there were 8 seizures and 9 surrenders of unsound food. Milk and Tuberculosis. 7. In my last report, I referred to action taken with respect to the occurrence of tuberculosis in the udder of cows and in milk. In 1902, 14 further samples of milk were examined bacteriologically for the presence of tubercle bacilli, with a negative result in all cases, two samples being from the same source as those previously found to contain tubercle bacilli. This result is satisfactory. Altogether, 22 samples have been examined in the two years, and 2, or 10 per cent, found to contain tubercle bacilli. All these samples were from milk imported from outside London, all cows in Metropolitan cowsheds being carefully inspected for tuberculosis by the London County Council. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885. 8. 164 dairymen are on the register, and the dairies have all been inspected once during the year. Defects were found and remedied at the instance of the Sanitary Inspector in 5 cases. No proceedings were taken under this Order, 48 9. Coivslicds—The 18 cowhouses were all inspected at least four times during the year by Mr. Wood, in Eltham, and Mr. Barnes, and latterly Mr. Mackie, in Woolwich and Plumstead. With the Chief Inspector, I personally inspected all the sheds in October. 13 notices were served, and objection was made to the renewal of the license in one case. (The license was finally granted after the work required was done). In all other cases the notice was complied with. The principal causes of complaint were dirty sheds and dirty yards; in one case there was defective ventilation. Slaughterhouses. 10. The 13 slaughterhouses were all inspected at least four times, the one in Eltham by Mr. Wood, and the remainder by Mr. Barnes. 5 notices were served, and the license of Mr. Rumsey's slaughterhouse in New Road, was objected to and refused. The County Council also refused to renew the license held by the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, on the ground that the house was not now used for slaughtering. There are consequently now only 11 slaughterhouses in the Borough. The cause of the refusal of Mr. Rumsey's license was neglect to attend to the frequent complaints made as to the dirty condition of the slaughter-house. Nuisances. 11. Complaints. 458 complaints of sanitary defects were received and 114 of non-removal of dust; the numbers in 1901 were 623 and 160 respectively (see Table VIII., which gives particulars of the work of the department). 12. Seivers have been repaired or re-laid in the following streets, owing to their being found defective or inadequate :— Warren Lane, New Road, Cross Street, James Street, Acorn Street, Green Lane (N. Woolwich), Lower Wood Street and Romford Cottages, Chapel Street. 49 13. Drains. 29 defective combined drains, draining 145 houses have been investigated and reported on, compared with 52 in 1901. These were all referred to the Borough Engineer's Department. 21 have been re-laid in addition to those outstanding from 1901; 18 were in Woolwich Parish, 10 in Plumstead and 1 in Eltham. 693 private drains found to be choked or defective were examined, cleared and re-laid at the expense of the owners. 351 of these were in Woolwich Parish, 215 in Plumstead and 127 in Eltham. In 1901 the number of private drains dealt with was 786; 1,444 water closets were repaired after notice and 120 foul pans cleansed. In 1901 the numbers were 1,864 and 54 respectively. The great majority of these were in Woolwich Parish. 14. Public Urinals. Several complaints were received as to nuisance arising from the foul condition of public house urinals, and also as to nuisances in streets and passages, partly due to lack of conveniences for females. The urinals have been systematically inspected and notices served and enforced where necessary. The only direct means of dealing with these urinals is by serving notice for a nuisance, a means quite inadequate to secure regular and efficient cleansing. A bye-law is required similar to that in forc9 for water closets : viz., " The occupier of any premises shall cause every water closet belonging to such premises to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as may be necessary for keeping it in a cleanly condition"; but the Public Health (London) Act at present gives no power to make such bye-law. 15. The Council, on my recommendation, decided to make one of the female conveniences in Nile Street free. Although this privilege is liable to abuse, the presence of a caretaker enables steps to be taken for limiting misuse and preventing nuisance. d 50 16. House Inspection. 4526 houses were inspected " house to house" and 10956 on account of infectious disease, complaints, etc. The corresponding numbers in 1901 were 4797 and 7123 respectively. The epidemic of Small-pox had the effect of slightly diminishing the house to house inspections and greatly increasing the special inspections. Table XII. shews the streets in each ward inspected house to house, the number of houses visited, and the number in which defects were found. The proportion of defective houses to total varied in the different wards from less than one-third in the Central and Glyndon Wards, to about three-fourths in the River, Dockyard, and St. Mary's Wards. In Elizabeth Place, Coak Yard, Meeting House Lane, Globe Lane, New Street, Lewis Place and Callia Alley every house had defects; in Godfrey Street every house but one, and in Orchard Street every house but two were in like case. In the total 2375 or just over one-half the houses inspected had defects. At 2,318 houses the interiors were cleansed or repaired, or both (as compared with 3,082 in 1901.) In 369, damp walls were found and remedied (in 1901 the number was 608), and in 185 through ventilation was provided (250 in 1901.) In numerous other cases ventilation was improved by having the upper sash of the window made to open. 1,008 dustbins were provided (269 in 1901). I made, personally, house to house inspections in Godfrey Street, James Street, Globe Lane, New Street, Cock Yard, and Gossage Road. 17. Overcrowding.—137 cases of overcrowding were found and dealt with, a slight diminution on the number for the previous year (145), St. Margaret's, Herbert, and Eltham Wards having the highest proportion. 51 The great demand for house accommodation has distinctly abated during 1902, owing to discharges from the Arsenal, but it is still difficult for persons with a family to obtain a house. Overcrowding, it must be remarked, is caused not only by the lack of houses, but also by the high ratio of rents to wages, and the slack work which produces empty houses may, at the same time, increase overcrowding in those occupied, Rents, which were inflated by the great demand for houses in 1900 and 1901 have not fallen, and cheap houses are even a more pressing demand than more houses, and power to fix a fair rent seems one of the much needed housing reforms. 18. Dampness—Breach of Building Act. In some houses recently built in Timbercroft Lane Inspector Little found serious dampness, and, searching for the cause, discovered that there was no concrete on the site. This breach of the L.C.C. bye-laws under the Building Act was pointed out to the District Surveyor, who required the builder to concrete the sites in accordance with the bye-laws. 19. Smoke Nuisance.—105 observations of smoking chimneys were made, and proceedings taken against four offenders for eight separate offences; convictions were obtained in each case. The fines inflicted were not excessive, varying from 10/to 40/- for each offence (see Table IX.) Although there is still a good deal of unnecessary smoke from the Arsenal chimneys, I am glad to be able to record a distinct improvement at these factories. 20. Defective Light.—One of the most serious of consumption and many other diseases is the absence of daylight, and especially sunlight in dwelling rooms. Light shews dirt, and secures cleanliness ; sunlight is directly antiseptic, and light is probably as necessary for growing animals as for plants. Un- D 2 52 fortunately, social, conventionalities cause much of the light that a window would admit to be excluded, but this only makes it more important to have large windows, for the object of blinds and curtains is not primarily to exclude the light, but to obtain privacy and for appearance sake. The lighting of staircases—especially where two and more families inhabit one house—is only secondary in importance to the lighting of living rooms. Much attention has been given to remedying nuisances of this nature. Windows were either provided or enlarged in 65 houses, 53 being in Woolwich Parish. In several cases the dark room was in the basement; in some the darkness was due to the nearness of an adjoining wall. In one case a new building had been erected in the garden of an existing house within two feet of the kitchen window. After proceedings at the Police Court this was remedied by enlarging the window. It is, unfortunately, quite possible—indeed, of frequent occurrence—to erect a new house that will shut off the light of an existing one, and be itself very dark, and yet comply with all the requirements of the Building Act. Borne houses in North Kent Grove, where two cases of Phthisis had occurred, were found to be very dark, being overshadowed by the Bed Barracks and the trees in the Barrack Grounds. On the attention of the Acting Commandant of the Garrison and the Officer Commanding the Royal Engineers being called to the injury to health caused by the trees, an undertaking was given to cut down all those specially causing the nuisance. 21. Condition of the River. No complaint was made as to nuisance arising from the state of the Thames, but this is probably due as much to the fact that there was a minimum of hot weather, as to the absence of sewage from the river. 53 22. Dust removal. 177 complaints of non-removal of dust were received, 35 being from Woolwich Parish, 60 from Plumstead, and 82 from Eltham. The Woolwich Parish collection (performed by the Couucil) has, continued satisfactory, and there have been no complaints as to the dust destructor, although it has been observed to produce a large amount of smoke of a light grey colour. The cost of the collection was about £1,600. The Plumstead collection (performed by Contractors) gave rise to fewer complaints in the past year than in 1901 (60 as compared with 101); I had to complain, however, that, in numerous cases, the pails were not effectually emptied. The amount paid for the contract has moreover reached the large figure of £3,100, which is the amount paid for last year's collection. The amount paid for year ending March 25th, 1900 was £1,002. I am of opinion that the collection would be better and more cheaply performed by the Works Department, as in Woolwich Parish. The Eltham dust collection (also performed by a Contractor) gave rise to so many complaints that the Contractor was fined £10 in July, since which the collection has much improved, and there have been very few complaints. The amount paid for the collection during the year was £480 (less £10 penalty deducted), as compared with £293 in the previous nine months. 23. The Plumstead dust shoot has continued to be 300 yards away from houses, but I found that nothing was being done in the way of burning or covering over the offensive part of the house refuse. This omission was remedied on my representation. 54 24. The dust destructor will probably be at work before Midsummer. The Council's land now used for a dust shoot will then be left free for another purpose. It could not in my opinion be put to a better use than being converted into a public recreation ground. There is a large population in its immediate vicinity, with many hundreds of children, who at present are largely dependent on the streets for a playground. They, and the surrounding population generally, would be greatly benefitted by having this ground kept free from buildings, to act both as a fresh air lung, and as a place of recreation. Removal of Trade Refuse. 25. The system of Trade Refuse collection described in my previous report has been continued. £98 5s. 3d. was paid by tradesmen during the year, for the removal of 7,861 receptacles of offensive refuse, £64 11s. 6d for 861 loads, and £8 9s. 2d. for 1,015 bushels of inoffensive refuse. The names of 135 tradesmen are on the books for more or less regular collection of trade refuse. The total amount received, £171 5s. 11d., does not cover the cost of the collection. But much nuisance is obviated, and an attempt to impose the full cost might mean refusal on the part of some tradesmen to avail themselves of the public collection, and a further raising of the expense of collecting from the remainder. For it must be remembered that the Council has no authority to collect trade refuse, except as required by the owners. Accumulations in Courts and Passages. 26. There are, in the River Ward especially, many courts and passages in which accumulations of offensive refuse are very liable to occur. Inspector Mackie has been specially charged with the duty of inspecting these, and of seeing that they are kept perfectly clean. 55 Housing of the Working Classes. 27. The following 10 houses were represented as unfit for habitation under Sect. 32, Part IT. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act:— Three houses in the rear of the "Army Beer House," Artillery Place; No. 1, Campbell Cottages, Nightingale Vale ; 11, Market Hill; 1, Beresford Street; 2, Globe Lane; 5, Globe Lane; 2 & 3, Lewis Place. In the first four mentioned the sanitary defects consisted mainly of dilapidations, dampness, and want of through ventilation; in the remainder the principal defects were want of light and insanitary basements. A Magistrate's Order was obtained for closing the houses behind the "Army Beer House," with £3 7s. Od. costs and 10/compensation to each tenant. 1, Campbell Cottages, 11, Market Hill, and 2 and 5, Globe Lane, were also put in a more sanitary condition by the owner on service of notice, the basement room being closed in one case, and the light being improved in the others. Proceedings were taken under the Public Health (London) Act for 1, Beresford Street, and the light improved by Magistrate's Order (28/- costs). As regards 2 and 3, Lewis Place, Form "A" under the Housing Act was served and the case adjourned on an undertaking to do the work required. 28. New Street and Globe Lane. I reported in October with respect to these two insanitary streets. The death-rate based on the census population of 197 (Globe Lane, 132 and New Street, 65) in the period January, 1900, to September, 1902 (16 deaths) was 29.5 per annum per 1,000 population, or 56 more than twice the death-rate of the Borough. I inspected most of the houses in these streets, and found many grave defects, such as want of proper light and ventilation. Two of the Globe Lane houses are referred to in paragraph 26 as to taking proceedings for a closing order under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. A large number of defects were remedied in the others after service of notice under the Public Health (London) Act. Several houses were improved by providing light and ventilation on the staircases, &c. The phthisis death-rate in Globe Lane was for the period mentioned, 2.7 per 1,000, or 50 per cent. more than that of the Borough, and in New Street for the 3¼ years ending March 31st, it reached the tremendous figure of 14 per 1,000, or more than the death-rate of the Borough from all causes. 28. In some of the houses, I regret to say, the state of darkness continues. Two of the cases of consumption occurred in rooms where the direct rays of the sun can never penetrate. Darkness of rooms is quite as serious from the health point of view as dilapidations or defective drainage, but, unfortunately, it does not appeal so forcibly to the mind of the average layman. 29. 32 old and insanitary houses at Eltham have been demolished and cleared by your Council for Municipal Buildings. These were situate in Sun Yard and High Street. I had, on more than one occasion, to report on the insanitary condition of these houses. Most of the tenants displaced obtained accommodation at New Eltham. 30. The 25 new houses being constructed under Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, at North Woolwich, are uow nearing completion. 57 Houses Registered under the Bye-Laws. 31. At the commencement of the year, there were 103 houses on the register, compared with 88 at the beginning of 1901. 37 were recommended for registration during the year, of which 26 were placed on the register (21 being in Woolwich and 5 in Plumstead), 2 houses were removed from the register, being occupied by only one family, leaving a total of 129 on the register at the close of the year, viz.:—100 in Woolwich, and 29 in Plumstead. All these houses were inspected twice during the year, and a large number four times. A large number of notices were served, and two prosecutions were undertaken for overcrowding, fines of £5 with 23/- costs, and 10/- with 2/- costs being inflicted respectively. No night visits were paid, but on certain occasions early morning visits were paid for the purpose of detecting overcrowding. The result of frequent inspection certainly was seen in improved sanitary conditions, and I believe no tenants had occasion to complain of any inconvenience or annoyance resulting from the houses being registered, whereas landlords must feel the benefit of the tenants having cleaner habits. Mr. Mackey is specially charged with the inspection of the registered houses in Woolwich Parish. The new bye-laws are still, as when writing my last year's report, under consideration, and in consequence only about one-tenth of those who require the protection of the bye-laws enjoy it. Common Lodging Houses. 32. There are 33 Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, one ha.ving been transferred from the County Council Register to the Borough Register of Houses under the Bye-laws. The County Council having now obtained power to require an annual renewal of licenses to let Common Lodging Houses, it 58 is to be expected that there may be considerable improvement in the very defective structural condition of these homes of the poorest classes. Underground Rooms. 33. Two cases of underground rooms separately occupied contrary to the Public Health (London) Act were met with. In one case the ground was lowered to obtain the requisite height, a new window was made, and other improvements completed so as to make the room comply with the Act; this was at 19, Barnfield Road. One underground room, though not separately occupied, was closed as being unfit for occupation. In others the insanitary conditions were improved. Factories and Workshops. 34. Workshops were especially inspected during the year by Inspector Wood in Woolwich and Eltham Parishes, and Inspector Little in Plumstead. The following table snmmarises the work done :— Parish. Number of Workshops. Number of Visits. Number in which Sanitary Defects were found. Number of cases of overcrowding. Number in which both sexes are employed. Woolwich (Inspector Wood) 58 167 20 3 19 Plumstead (Inspector Little) 101 315 31 14 6 Eltham (Inspector Wood) 7 14 1 2 0 Total 166 496 52 19 25 Of the 52 which defects were found, in 14 there was want of ventilation, 3 insufficient light, 7 insufficient w.c. accommodation, and 28 were dirty. 59 Two notices were received from H.M. Factory Inspector as to insanitary conditions found by him, and two workshops where females were employed, and no abstract of the Factory Act posted, were notified to him. Two workshops were also notified to H.M. Inspector of Factories where an insufficient temperature was maintained. The sanitary defects found have been remedied on the service of notices. No prosecutions were instituted, but occupiers were given to understand that ventilation must be maintained, and improvement in this direction is noticeable. Women are employed in 119 of the 166 workshops. 35. Several restaurants and eating-houses were inspected by the District Inspectors, and the insanitary conditions found were remedied. Outworkers. 36. The names and addresses of 147 outworkers, resident in the Borough, were received from employers, 7 being transmitted from other Boroughs. The names of 14 non-resident were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough in which they lived. In 1901, the names of 99 outworkers were received. The 147 addresses were inspected, and nuisances were found to exist at 40; these were remedied on the service of notices. Bakehouses. 37. One (underground) bakehouse in Spray Street, and two overground (Powis Street and Wellington Street) have been closed, and one (overground) has been opened at Well Hall Parade, leaving a total of 71; 34 being underground. These I inspected twice, in May and November. On the first inspection, 17, and on the second 18, were found to be dirty or otherwise defective. These defects were remedied without proceedings being taken. 60 The certification of underground bakehouses, under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1902, is now occupying the attention of the Health Committee. The Council has agreed to demand the following minimum requirements before a certificate is granted A.—Construction. (1) The Bakehouse shall be of a minimum capacity of 1,000 cubit feet, and shall be in every part thereof at least 7 ft. 6 in. high, measured from the floor to the ceiling. (2) The walls shall be smooth and impervious throughout. (3) The ceilings shall be properly ceiled with smooth and impervious material. (4) The floors shall be of smooth and impervious material throughout. (5) Any drain or sewer under the bakehouse shall be constructed of gas and water tight pipes. No gulley shall be within the bakehouse, unless the drain connected therewith bs made to discharge into a trapped inlet outside the bakehouse. (6) Provision shall be made for safe and suitable means of access to the bakehouse. B.—Light. (7) The bakehouse shall be sufficiently lighted by daylight. C.—Ventilation. (8) The bakehouse shall be properly and effectually ventilated by permanent inlets and outlets, communicating directly with the open air in such a way and at such a height above the street level as to prevent the entrance into the bakehouse of dust and dirt. Where natural ventilation is not effective, or in the opinion of the Council insufficient, artificial means shall be provided. 61 D.—All other respects. (9) There shall not be in direct communication with the bakehouse any coal or other cellar, room, unpaved yard or area which may be a nuisance, or cause contamination by foul air, dust or dirt. Disinfection. 38. Disinfection was performed after all notified cases of infectious disease with the exception of Chicken-pox and several cases of Erysipelas, where a certificate of disinfection was not applied for; 89 premises were also disinfected after Phthisis, all these being at the public expense. In a few cases disinfection was performed on payment, for vermin or other cause. A total of 945 houses were disinfected, compared with 687 in 1901. In most cases the disinfection was by Formalin Tablets, 25 being used per 1,000 cubic feet. In most cases of Small-pox, however, Defries' Equifex Spray Apparatus was employed, the disinfectant used being a 5 per cent. solution of Formalin. This was specially obtained to obviate the expensive practice of stripping and re-decorating rooms formerly in vogue after Small-pox. The time employed in spraying averaged three hours per room. Infected clothing, bedding, &c., was submitted to a pressure of 5 lbs., at a temperature of 227Q in the Washington Lyon's Steam Apparatus for half-an-hour. Since the lower temperature and pressure were used, in the place of 25 lbs. at 267° as formerly, no complaints of injury to articles have been received, nor has any case occurred suggesting that the disinfection was insufficient. Health Shelter. 39. The Health Shelter was used by 32 persons from 10 houses, 29 persons in connection with the occurrence of Smallpox, and 3 with Scarlet Fever. The average stay was one day. 62 One family stayed three days for observation re Small-pox, and 6 persons stayed only an hour while their clothing was disinfected. In 1901 the shelter was used by four families comprising 11 persons. The Mortuaries. 40. The Woolwich Mortuary in Sun Street was used for the reception of 164 bodies, compared with 156 in 1901. 10 were for custody only, and 154 for inques's. One of the bodies was a case of infectious disease, viz., Small-pox. This latter case gave rise to a complaint, bred doubtless of panic, as to danger of infection from the contiguity of houses to the mortuary. I advised that there was not any danger of infection being spread in this way. There was no complaint as to any nuisance connected with the mortuary and it was at all times maintained in a satisfactory manner. 41. The mortuary chamber for temporary custody of bodies at Eltham was completed in June. It was used for five bodies during the year; three of these were for post mortem examinations and inquests, a purpose for which this mortuary was not intended. It appeared that the Acting Coroner had authorised its use for the purpose, in ignorance of the Borough Council's intentions and the County Council's recommendations. Some inconvenience both to the friends of deceased persons, and to medical practitioners concerned is involved in holding inquests on Eltham bodies and making post mortems at the Sun Street Mortuary, and the question of adapting the Eltham Mortuary for post mortem examinations is now occupying the attention of your Committee. The keys of this mortuary are kept at the Eltham Health Office. 63 Cemeteries. 42. The two Borough Cemeteries were well maintained and gave rise to no nuisance. 695 bodies were buried in Woolwich Cemetery and 817 in the Plumstead Cemetery, compared with 691 and 783 respectively in 1901; 125 bodies were buried in the Plumstead Churchyard, compared with 146, 164 and 144 in the three preceding years. Owing to the absence of properly marked grave spaces it is impossible to either keep, or detect breaches of the regulations as to the burials in this ground in most cases. One breach was, however, observed and the attention of the Vicar called to it. Bye-Laws for Tents, Vans and Sheds. 43. These Bye-Laws were enforced and 76 inspections were made. No prosecutions were undertaken, the notices served being either complied with or the tents and vans moved away. Improved privy accommodation was provided for some sheds at Horn Park and the sheds themselves cleansed and ventilated; earth closets and dust pails were provided in several cases. The Cordwainers School. 44. This charitable institution for 32 boys and girls, under the care of the Cordwainers' Company, was the subject of report several years ago, and again last year, owing to the occurrence of infectious disease. In February two cases of Scarlet Fever and two cases of Chicken Pox occurred among the children; there was some doubt as to the first case of Scarlet Fever, and I was asked by the Medical Officer to see it re the diagnosis. When I called I found that a case of Chicken Pox had just occurred and could not be isolated because the one spare room was occupied by the Scarlet Fever case; this room is without a fireplace or any special means of ventilation, and 64 is barely large enough for one patient. I had previously recommended that proper means of isolation should be provided. The Company was again requested to provide means of isolation and on their neglecting to do so a copy of the correspondence was sent to the Charity Commissioners. Customs and Inland Revenue Act. 45. An application was received for a certificate to grant exemption under the Act from payment in full of inhabited house duty, with respect to a block of fiats in Nightingale Place, mainly occupied by married officers of the army. The certificate was refused on the ground that the houses did not offer suitable sanitary accommodation for the inmates, in the respect that the soil pipes were inside the walls of the house, and that there was no accommodation outside the flats for the dust pails. Royal Aesenal—Sanitary Improvements 46. The Arsenal is outside the scope of the Public Health Acts, but it is satisfactory to learn that its sanitary condition has received recently very considerable attention, both from the Medical Officers in charge and from Inspectors of the Factories and Workshops Department of the Home Office, with the result that great improvements have taken place in sanitary conveniences, ventilation and other directions. Public Ambulance. 47. It also deserves to be chronicled that a Public Ambulance for non-infectious cases has been provided by public subscription, vested in trustees (The Rector of Woolwich, Aldermen Turton and Kelham, W. H. Lewis, Esq., and the Medical Officer of Health) and put in the care of a cab proprietor (Mr. Chick) from whom it can be obtained on 65 cation on the same terms as an ordinary cab. Woolwich is the first Metropolitan Borough to possess a Public Ambulance for accidents and non-infectious illness. Since its provision, the ambulance has been used on an average twice a week. The Public Lavatories. 48. I found the Council's sanitary conveniences kept in a satisfactory manner. The question of providing a lavatory at Beresford Square for females is being considered. Sanitary Congress. 49. I attended the Congress of the Sanitary Institute held at Manchester in September. I gave special attention to the system prevailing there of dealing with the prevention of consumption. I reported at the time on the lessons to be learnt from this Congress. My account for expenses amounted to £2 18s. 11d. Sanitary Staff. 50. A list of the staff is given on a fly-leaf to this Report. The only change since my last Report is the substitution of Inspector Dee for Mr. Barnes, who obtained another appointment at Tonbridge. Mr. Dee commenced his duties on January 1st, 1903. The Health Committee appointed Inspector Mackie to take over the duties of Mr. Barnes, and Inspector Dee succeeded to the Glyndon and Central Wards vacated by Mr. Mackie. Two of the Inspectors have been granted bicycles by the Council, Mr. Wood (Eltham), and Mr. Tedham (St. Nicholas), the use of which probably doubles the amount of work these Inspectors are enabled to perform. Bicycles—the private e 66 property of members of the staff—are also frequently employed to economise time, and make inspections in urgent cases, and at times a bicycle is hired for the same purpose. An extension of this means of increasing the utility of the Inspectors deserves consideration. 51. In addition to the inspection of their own districts, the following Inspectors are charged with special duties, viz.:— Inspector Mackie—Pood Inspection, Market and principa shops; Registered Houses in Woolwich Parish; Cow-houses and Slaughterhouses; Deposits in Eiver Ward. Inspector Little—Workshops and Factories in Plumstead Parish. Inspector Wood—Workshops and Factories in Woolwich Parish. Temporarily, also Inspector Woolley is assisting in House to House Inspection in Eiver Ward and Inspector Wood in Dockyard Ward, owing to the importance of completing the House to House Inspection in these Wards. 52. Owing to the increase of Clerical Work it was found necessary to provide the Office with a second "Empire" type-writing machine. 53. In conclusion, I have to recognise with praise and gratitude the intelligent and hard work performed by the Chief Sanitary Inspector and all the Staff, to which may be largely attributed the early termination of the most serious and fatal epidemic which has attacked the Borough for seven years, 67 and the very marked improvement in the general death-rate. I have also to thank you, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, especially the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee, for the considerate way in which you have at all times received my recommendations. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, SIDNEY DAVIES. e 2 68 Table I.—Borough of Woolwich. Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1902 and previous Years. Year.
