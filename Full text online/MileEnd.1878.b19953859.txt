The Vestry, in presenting their Annual Report for the year ending 25th March, 1879, beg to follow the practice of former years, and present a comparison between the number of Meetings, and the attendances thereat, during the last twelve months, and those of the three preceding years: Meetings. Years. 1875—6. 1876-7. 1877—8. 1878-9. Vestry 21 23 22 20 Standing Committees 77 76 90 89 Special Committees 2 21 48 57 Tofals 100 120 160 166 Largest attendance at any Vestry Meeting 62 83 73 69 Smallest ditto 42 43 46 35 Average attendance 50.5 59.2 58 54.6 Some of the Committees have sub-Committees, to go into detail work, and report to the Committee thereon; and the Meetings of the sub-Committees are nof taken into account in the foregoing statement. In the early part of this year the Vestry formed itself into a Committee to consider the duties and emoluments of its various officers, and after a very lengthy and searching enquiry, the Vestry were of opinion that the duties in many departments had greatly increased during the last seven years, and accordingly resolved to increase the salaries of the Clerk and Surveyor £100 each, of the Assistant Clerk £50, and of the Inspector of Nuisances £40, such increases to commence from the 25th March, 1879. 8 The Vestry continues to pay serious attention to the Bills introduced into Parliament. During the Session of 1878, the Parliamentary Committee considered and reported on no less than nineteen Hills, some of which would have seriously interfered with the Vestry and the interest of the ratepayers, if allowed to pass without some amendment. They were 1—Corporation of London (various powers ) 2—Metropolitan Board of Works (Plumstead Common.) 3—Inns of Court, &c. (Metropolis Rating.) 4—Tower Bridge. 5—East Metroptn. Railway 0—Great Eastern do. 7—Metropolis Water Supply. 8—Corporation of London. 9—Metropolitan Board of Works (Election of Members.) 10—Metropolis Water Works (Purchase.) 11—Public Baths and Washhouses. 12—Public Health Act (1875) Amendment. 13—Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment 14—Highways. 15 — Valuation. 16—Valuation of Property. 17—County Government. 18—Qualification of Members of Town Councils, &c. 19—Epping Forest. The Vestry caused Petitions to Parliament, against the Bills numbered 6, 7, 9, 14, 16, 17 and 19, in the above list, to be lodged, and they also caused suggestions for the amendment of many ofhers to be sent to the County and Borough Members. The Session of 1879 will be a very important one, if the Bills promised to be introduced are proceeded with, as the interest and comfort of the inhabitants of this Hamlet will be affected by several, but nofably by the following, viz.:— Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railway. Thames River (Prevention of Floods.) Tower High Level Bridge. The result of the proceedings of the Vestry, with regard to the Whitechapel Haymarket, has been so beneficial that it is probable that so long as the Trustees of the Market continue to carry out the new regulations, no further steps to procure the abolition of the Market will take place. 9 The action, with regard to Trafalgar Square, has nof yet been tried, owing to a severe accident to the Judge before whom it is set for trial. The Vestry, at Michaelmas last, took over the work of dusting and slopping, and they hope to be able, at the expiration of twelve months, to show nof only that the work has been more efficiently performed, but that it has been done so at a less cost than formerly. In connection with this work, the Vestry have employed Mr. A. Baxter, as Superintendent of Labor, at a salary of £150 per annum. Difficulties have occurred with the Regent's Canal Company, in relation to the lay-bye at Riga Wharf, but the Vestry hope that matters may be amicably settled. The Vestry, nof being likely to at present require the house and shop in Canal Road, leased to them by Mr. Johnson, have let the same on lease for twenty-one years, at a rental of £50. The conveyances to the Vestry of most of the properties required for the street improvements, have been executed, and the Vestry hope soon to execute the works. The Vestry have continued to exercise the powers conferred on them, and have paved and made-up several new streets, at the expense of the owners, and they have also caused the foof-ways of several of the old streets to be flagged at the expense of the occupiers. The Vestry consider that the latter mode of charging to be very hard, but the law so prescribes. The Vestry have also put in force the Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1868, in some cases, but are pleased to be able to record that the owners themselves have invariably executed the works requisite. The Vestry feel that the lastly mentioned Act is a 10 most valuable one, and if judiciously put in force, might, except in some few cases, soon produce a much more sanitary condition in various parts of London. Under the powers of the Metropolis Management Acts, the following streets in the Hamlet have been re-named and the houses therein re-numbered:— Bridge Street Do. West Do. East And part id south Grove Bridge Street, E. Alfred Street Do. West Shandy Street. Albert Street (Bancroft Road) Moody Street. Bromehead Street and Old Church Road have been re-numbered. On the 11th April and 23rd June last, the Metropolis was visited by severe storms, which, unfortunately, again caused severe floodings in many parts of the Hamlet. The Vestry have used their utmost endeavour to impress upon the Metropolitan Board of Works the necessity of providing a remedy for the evil. The Vestry have in contemplation the re-construction of the sewers in Oxford Street and Richardson Street, and also the re-paving and widening of the foof-way on the north side of the Mile End Road, between Eagle Place and the western boundary of the Hamlet. The Metropolitan Board of Works having, under the powers conferred on them by the Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment Act, 1878, published nofice of certain bye-laws, which they proposed to make, the Vestry considered that these placed too great restriction on the rights of persons building, and also gave to the District Surveyors very dictatorial powers, the Vestry, therefore, lodged with the Secretary of State objections to the proposed bye-laws, and feel certain that several of them will be altered. 11 The value of property having considerably increased, and very large sums having to be collected for payment of the School Board and Metropolitan Board Precepts, rendered it proper, in the opinion of the Vestry, that the remuneration of the Collectors should be gone into, and the subject was therefore referred to a Committee. The whole matter was most carefully considered, and in the result, a fresh arrangement was made, limiting the remuneration which the Collectors will be entitled to receive for the future. The Vestry are sorry to have to report that they, nofwithstanding every effort, have nof been able to effect any reduction in the rates, although they can again satisfactorily show that this is nof owing to any fault of theirs. The Poor Rate shews some reduction, having been equal to 2s. 3d. in the £, as against 2s, 5d. in 1878, and 2s. 2d. in 1877. The aggregate amount of the General, Lighting, and Sewers Kates, has been exactly the same as last year, viz., 2s. 2d., that is to say— General Rate 1s. 9d. in the £. Lighting do. 0 3½ do. Sewers do. 0 1 do. 2s. 2d. in the £. As pointed out in previous Reports, the amount required by the School Board has to be collected in the General Rate, and therefore, in considering what the Yestry itself spends, the amount required by the School Board must be considered. The Yestry has again to lament a great increase in the School Board expenses, and thinking that it is very important that the ratepayers should be able, without 12 trouble, to compare that expenditure, they again set forth the amounts for which the School Board has issued its Precepts to this Vestry, viz.:— Years. £ s. d. 1871 536 17 3 1872 1001 8 10 1873 827 17 2 1874 1989 3 10 1875 3496 6 11 1876 5335 17 3 1877 6468 17 10 1878 6486 12 2 1879 7031 1 2 The sum actually required by the School Board during the Vestry's financial year, therefore, amounted to about £6650, which, with the expenses of collection, would represent a rate of very nearly sixpence in the pound. If this be deducted from the aggregate rate of 2s. 2d. in the £, it will leave 1s. 8d. in the £ as the sum with which the Vestry has met all its own liabilities. When compared with former years, it will be seen that the Vestry's own expenditure has been remarkably uniform. In 1875 the expenditure was equal to 1s. 8d. in the £. 1876 do. do. 1 8 do. 1877 do. do. 1 8 do. 1878 do. do. 1 8½ do. 1879 do. do. 1 8 do. The Metropolitan Board of Works Precept for Consolidated Rate has made an enormous stride, which is, in a great measure, attributable to the carrying out of the various street improvements and to the putting into operation the Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1875. 13 The following have been the amounts of the Metropolitan Board Precepts during the last few years:— In the year £ S. d. 1876 6091 1 9 1877 5986 1 8 1878 6166 9 0 1879 7509 1 4 The increase alone for the present year represents a rate of over one penny in the pound. In the foregoing Report, the Vestry thinks that all the principal events have been mentioned, but the Vestry beg to refer to the Reports of their Officers for the more detailed particulars in reference to them. The Accounts for the year have been duly audited, vouched, and allowed by the Auditors elected by the Ratepayers, who duly prepared an Abstract thereof, as prescribed by the Act of Parliament, and the same is, pursuant to the same Act, printed and published with this Report.

REPORT. Gentlemen, I beg again to lay before you a summary of the various works carried out under the direction of my department. carriageway paving. Although no new work has been executed under this head, I have reported to your Highways Committee on the necessity of paving some of the most frequented thoroughfares, and as a report on the subject will be shortly presented to you it would be presumption on my part to further discuss the subject here, more than to call your attention to the satisfactory state of the works executed by you in the Mile End and Commercial Roads, which have not cost anything up to the present time for repairs since the paving was laid. One hundred tons of 4-inch pitching have been used in paving crossings in Jubilee Street, Charles Street, Oxford Street and Turner Street, in which have been used tram stones purchased from the Limehouse District Board of Works in addition to those which the Vestry had of their own. 30 Footways. The ordinary repairs and small works of the Vestry consumed 9,800 feet of 2½ inch paving, and cost £281 15s. The experiment tried in New Street and other places with Victoria stone having proved satisfactory the same material has been laid in feet. in.

Macadamised Roads. The unusually wet seasons through which we have passed have kept up the cost of road repairs in addition to the increased traffic which is put upon them. You have now agreed to use Kentish rag stone in lieu of Hertfordshire ballast, which stone makes a good road if rolled in with any binding material, and although I do not anticipate any saving for the current year, yet in succeeding years the cost of repairs will be reduced by the adoption of this material. The following table will show the cost of each material for the past three years. ROAD MATERIALS. Year ending March, 1877 Year ending March, 1878. Year ending March, 1879. Yards. £ s. d.

During the year the water carts have been employed seventy-eight days at a cost of £728 19s. 9d. for horses and drivers, and £292 19s. 9d. for 6,861,000 gallons of water supplied by the East London Water Company. Removal of Dust. During six months of the present year this work has been done by men, horses and carts belonging to and employed by you. I believe this mode of carrying out the work has been satisfactory to the ratepayers generally The following table will shew the cost of doing the work for the past three years.

This work is now also done by horses and men belonging to and employed by you. The six months during which you have executed the work has been a very trying time, but nevertheless the cost of the work has not been largely in excess of the preceding year. The disposal of street refuse continues to be a source of anxiety to all the London parishes which are not suburban, and although we have at present a shoot at Hackney Wick, which is calculated to last for another year, yet the time is not far distant when the question will require very serious attention, and may probably have to be treated with a view to the requirements of the whole metropolis. The recent legislation respecting the foundation of houses, and the bye-laws of the Metropolitan Board made upon the subject, have seriously prejudiced the course which you have hitherto adopted. Probably the burning process, which is adopted by some of the large towns of the North, may have to be resorted to, but nothing can be so cheap as the course you have pursued for the past ten years, and as long as a place of deposit can be found within two miles of the Hamlet I do not advise any alteration.

The amount of claims made by freeholders and copyholders in Oxford Street was £3,514, and the amounts settled in respect of such claims was £3197. The amount claimed by tenants was £485, and that settled to be paid £325. The amount of claims of copyholds in Diamond Row was £570, and the amount settled to be paid £487. The tenants claim was £100, and the amount agreed to be paid by you is £50. Lighting. The public lamps, 860 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted, and cleaned, by the Commercial Gas Company, at a cost for the year of £3,708 7s. 3d. Steam Roller. During the year the engine has worked for the vestry 194 days, which would have cost, if hired, the sum of £436. The Vestry have received, for hire of roller, from adjoining Parishes, the sum of £144. The total cost of working, repairs, wages, and fuel, has been £190 0s. l1d. 39 Sewers. But very small new works have been done under this this head, but you have on hand a work of some importance in Oxford Street and Richardson Street, which is the first section of the reconstruction of a sewer which has been in an unsatisfactory state for many years. The are still some old sewers out of use, which are a source of annoyance to the inhabitants of the streets in which they exist, owing I believe principally to the large number of rats bred in them, and I shall be glad, as soon as your funds will permit, to demolish them. The total cost of cleansing, flushing and maintaining sewers during the year has been £813 8 2 The cost of the new work has been 230 9 7 £1043 17 9 The following Table will show the quantity of each description of sewer constructed during the year :— 15-in. pipe 224 feet 12 „ 430 „ 9 „ 174 „ Sixty-three houses have been connected with the sewers during the year. I regret to say, that the low lying portions of the district were again flooded by heavy storms which occurred during the spring and summer of last year, and much damage was done to underground rooms and cellars; the cause of the flood being the inability of the main sewers to carry off the storm water. It was 40 thought that the cause of the previous floods had been the fact that the storms had occurred at high tide, but this is now proved not to be the case, as one of the floods of last year occurred at nearly low water. During the last 25 years the districts drained by the main sewers have been largely increased, while the sewers have not been enlarged, and the paving of roads, the construction of houses, and paving of yards, tend to diminish the percolation of water into the soil, and thus increase the quantity of surface drainage to be carried away by means of the sewers. The sewers are sufficient for the house drainage and the ordinary rainfall, but not for the unusual quantity of water which falls during these now rather frequent storms. Repeated complaints have been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and a scheme has been prepared by their Engineer which will doubtless remedy the evil, but parliamentary powers, and a scheme for raising the money, will be necessary before the work can be carried out. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JNO. M. KNIGHT, Surveyor. Destry of the hamlet of mile end old Cown, ANNUAL REPORT UrON THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE HAMLET, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1879. BY MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. London Penny & Hull, Steam Printers, 121, Lemau Street, Whitechapel, E, 1879. EEPORT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the TwentyThird Annual Report upon the Public Health and general sanitary condition of the Hamlet, as required by the Metropolis Local Management Act. I have based the vital statistics upon an estimated population of 110,000 inhabitants, although I believe this number is now much exceeded. Births Exceeded those for previous years by 175, and the birth-rate rose from 37.5 to 39 per 1000 population. The natural increase of population for the year was 2035, being 281 in excess of the previous year. The Marriages were also 66 more than the previous year and 18.5 per 1000 of population. Increase in number of births and marriages generally indicates a proportionate increase of prosperity among the community wherein it occurs. Deaths. The total number of Deaths for the year ending March, 1879, was 2263 (Table I.), showing an increase of 28 over the previous year and a rate per 1000 population of 20.5. The deaths include those occurring in the Workhouses situated in Mile End. 44 The annual death-rate per 1000 population in Mile End was 20.5; that for the whole Metropolis for 1878 was 23.4 per 1000. The death-rate for seven principal infectious diseases was 3.26 per 1000 in Mile End and 13.77 in the Metropolis generally, and average of twenty largest towns 4.2, so that we compare favourably under all three heads of marriages, births and deaths, the rates per 1000 population in England and Wales under these beads respectively being as follow : England and Wales—marriages 16.6, births 35.7, deaths 21.8. In Mile End— 18.5, 39, and 20.5; all in the right direction. Of the 18 deaths from small-pox during the year, 16 occurred in the first quarter and 2 in the last, there being none in the summer quarters ; so that I hope we may consider this long continued epidemic (as such) is practically at an end. On the other hand, the mortality from scarlet-fever has increased; hooping-cough and diarrhoea were more fatal than during the previous year. Both these diseases of childhood are too often viewed lightly by parents and allowed to progress too far before skilled treatment is obtained, hence the large continuous mortality and, in cases of recovery, from hooping-cough especially, serious effects upon different organs and more or less permanent, are frequently left behind. The different kinds of fevers were much less fatal than in the previous year. Eight cases were certified as from cholera, but evidently not of the malignant epidemic character and probably the result of neglected diarrhoea. In all cases of infectious diseases coming under my notice, I directed printed Sanitary Instructions and Cautions to be left at the houses. Official notices were also served by the Inspector (see his Report). In this way, I am sure, a great deal of good has been done, in 45 limiting the spread of disease; and further, it has interested the general public in Sanitary and Public Health questions; persons applying to me daily for advice and assistance therein. In many extreme cases and where persons were not in a position to properly disinfect their own premises, this work has been done by persons employed by the Vestry. Table V., showing number of deaths at various ages is interesting. More than 28 per cent. of the total deaths in this Hamlet occurred between birth and the first anniversary thereof, and if we take the period up to five years of age it obtains 46.5 per cent. of the total mortality, or little short of half the figures given in the Table of Births are transferred to that of deaths during the first quinquennial period. Making every allowance for congenital diseases, defects and low vital powers from various causes, there must still be some remediable but not yet remedied cause, and for which we can only conclude that the powers that be are greatly responsible for this great sacrifice of young, and, doubtless in the large majority of instances, vigorous life. Of course the natural protectors are to be included in this responsibility. During the next five years the fall in the death-rate is remarkable, from 46.5 per cent. in the first five years to 2.3 in the second. It is satisfactory to see that 11 per cent. were between 60 and 70 years of age, and still more so that nearly 14 per cent. were above 80. Taking the greatest age at death, 1 for each month, 10 out of 12 were from 90 to 95 and 2 from 88 to 90 years of age. Water. The supply to this Hamlet is entirely from the East London Company. Although the solid and organic impurities have varied, still from the Reports of Drs. 46 Frankland and Tidy, this Company's water has compared favourably with the waters supplied to the Metropolis by other companies. With the exception of the East Ward, the whole of the Hamlet is now supplied by constant service. This is a very great boon, not only in giving a practically unlimited supply, but by enabling the abolition for domestic purposes of butts and cisterns in which water became contaminated with all kinds of filth. I am of opinion, however, that for the closet supply there should be an intervening: cistern between the closet waste preventer or flushing box and the main supply, otherwise I feel confident there will be danger of the water in the supply pipes and mains becoming poisoned by sewer gases, more especially if the apparatus of the box gets out of order, the communication between sewer and water supply being too direct, I believe I have traced mischief to this condition. I have also seen instances in which the pipes for the domestic and closet supplies were placed at such levels that the action of one stopped or emptied the pipe supplying the other, so that the water in the pipe supplying the closet was drawn off through the tap supplying the house. In this case defective valves would ensure the water being charged with sewer gases. An unlimited and cheap water supply would be the greatest aid to the physical, moral and sanitary improvement of the people. With such supply accessible, they would begin to learn the value and benefits of its more frequent and plentiful application and general use, both to themselves and their surroundings. As to its potable use, we must at present rely to a great extent upon the goodwill and energy of the various companies supplying the Metropolis. The East London Company appear to be doing their utmost to deliver to their consumers as pure a supply 47 as possible. Four new filter beds are being constructed at Lea Bridge, and the old ones are being re-constructed. A pair of powerful engines will shortly be in operation to give a better supply to the higher parts of their district. Hospital Accommodation for Non-Pauper Cases. This question will probably have to be again considered. Such provision would often be of immense advantage and enable the authorities to check epidemic diseases much more speedily. But, I consider the present Hospital accommodation is ample for the purpose if properly utilised. I do not think many people will voluntarily avail themselves of the Hospitals, and it would be impracticable to enforce, unless in exceptional cases, removal of patients without their own consent, that of their relatives and the medical attendant. In course of time a good deal of the prejudice against removal from home would be overcome, especially if their own medical advisers could continue in attendance. From a return kindly supplied to me by Mr. Thacker, I find there were 114 cases sent to the Small-pox and Fever Hospitals during the year ending Lady-Day, 1879. In conclusion, gentlemen, it may be satisfactory to you to know that all the measures enacted of late years in relation to the Public Health and Sanitary subjects had been previously forecast and recommended in my reports to you long previously. I have especially to thank the Sanitary Committee for their confidence in and consideration towards me in the discharge of my duties, most of which are performed without necessarily coming under the direct observation of your Board. I have also to thank the Parish Medical and Relieving Officers for much valuable information respecting the existence of infectious diseases and sanitary defects. 48 Summary of Reports to No. 3 Committer. 1878.

The following interesting and important Report was obtained at the instance of Mr. F. J. Wood, the representative of this Hamlet at the Asylums Board, and ordered by that Board to be printed and circulated— The Metropolitan Asylum District, 37, Norfolk Street, Strand. London, October 30 th, 1879. w. c. Sir, The severe nature of the Small-pox Epidemic which visited London during the autumn of 1876, and prevailed with more or intensity during the whole of 1877 and 1878 and part of 1879, induced the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District upon whom, in their Official capacity, devolved the treatment of a large proportion of the infected—to collect certain statistical facts which illustrate the advantages of efficient vaccination and re-vaccination, as evidenced by the experiences of the Medical Superintendents of the several Small-pox Hospitals under the control of the Hoard. The observations of these gentlemen confirm former opinions on the subject, and establish beyond doubt the mitigating influences in Small-pox cases of successful primary vaccination, and the preventive powers of efficient re-vaccination. The total number of Small-pox patients treated in the various Hospitals of the Managers, from the outbreak of the Epidemic 50 in 1878 until the commencement of the present month, has been 15,171, of whom 11,412 were vaccinated and 3759 unvaccinated; and it is believed that for each case treated in the Board's Hospitals, another was privately attended—hence some idea may be formed of the magnitude of the epidemic. The total number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals during the period under consideration was 2677. Of these 1008 were vaccinated and 1669 were unvaccinated cases. The per centago mortality upon the whole of the admissions was therefore 17.6, being at the rate of 8.8 per cent. of the vaccinated and no less than 44.4 per cent. of the unvaccinated. It may be observed that, among the 11,412 vaccinated patients admitted, are included the majority of those who stated that they had been vaccinated, but upon whom no traces of vaccination were discernable No case of Small-pox has come within the cognizance of either of the Medical Superintendents of any person who had been efficiently vaccinated and successfully re-vaccinated. The nurses and servants employed from time to time at the various Hospitals during the Epidemic, have enjoyed almost absolute immunity from infection; and the few—some half dozen amongst nearly one thousand—who contracted the disease whilst discharging their duties, had, from some cause or other, escaped re-vaccination before entering the Wards. Experience has therefore irrefutably proved that, were vaccination efficiently performed in infancy, within the period prescribed by the "Vaccination Act," and re-vaccination successfully accomplished at puberty, Small-pox, instead of being, as it is at present, a common and extremely fatal disease, would bo a comparatively rare one and so little fatal that few, if any, deaths would result from it. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. P. JEBB, Clerk. To M. Corner, Esq., M.D., Medical Officer of Health, Hamlet of Mile, End Old Town. 51 The following is the Sanitary Inspector's Report of Works executed during the year 1878-79. Houses and premises connected with sewers 49 Old drains abolished 36 Closets cleansed and repaired 41 Houses cleansed, &c 64 Houses disinfected in consequence of small-pox and other infectious diseases having occurred therein 222 Number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected by order of the Vestry 1033 Drains cleansed and repaired 196 Water-supply provided to houses 10 Accumulation of offensive matter removed from different premises 40 Premises from which pigs were removed, they being kept contrary to the Act 18 Defective paving repaired in yards of premises 42 During the year many inspections of premises where offensive works are carried on, have been made, and the necessary orders given for the abatement of nuisances. In all cases coming to my knowledge, I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from infectious diseases. In addition to the above, all bakehouses have been visited twice during the year and, where necessary, Notices were served, requiring the respective owners to limewhite and otherwise cleanse the same. The slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet have likewise been frequently visited, and many improvements effected. HENRY LESHAW, Sanitary Inspector. TABLE I.
