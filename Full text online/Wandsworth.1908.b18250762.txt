On the same day it was unanimously Resolved :— The Ex- " That the best thanks of the Council be given to Alderman Mayor. John William Lorden, J.P., for is able, courteous, and impartial conduct in the Chair, and for the time and attention bestowed by him in the discharge of his duties as Mayor of the Borough and as a Justice of the Peace during the year 1907-8." A copy of the foregoing resolution was sealed with the Common Seal of the Council and handed to Alderman Lorden. 3. At the same Meeting the Mayor (Councillor Archibald D. Dawnay), on behalf of subscribers (Members and Ex-Members of the Council), presented to Alderman Lorden his portrait in oils, painted by Mr. C. E. Butler, and a replica thereof by the same artist. The portrait having been unveiled by the Mayoress, Alderman Lorden thanked the subscribers and presented one of the portraits to the Council. The Mayor accepted the portrait on behalf of the Council, and it is now hung in the Council Chamber. 4. On the same occasion Councillor Wise, on behalf of the Presentation subscribers (Members of the Council), presented to to Mayoress. Mrs. Lorden three silver fruit dishes as a mark of appreciation of her services in the discharge of the duties of Mayoress during the past year. 30 5. The Council regret to record the deaths on the 13th October, 1908, of Alderman Rucker: on the 10th Obituary. February, 1909, of Councillor Palmer; on the 8th March, 1909, of Councillor Law; on the 19th February, 1909, of Mr. T. P. Ling; and on the 7th March, 1909, of Mr. J. Y. Henderson. Alderman Rucker had been a Member of the Council since its establishment in 1900. He was a regular attendant at Council and Committee Meetings; an active and generous supporter of philanthropic and other public institutions, and the valuable services which he rendered to the Borough for so many years are highly appreciated. Councillor Palmer had also been a Member of the Council since 1900, and regularly attended the Council and Committee Meetings. Councillor Law had been a Member of the Council since November, 1906. Mr. T. P. Ling was a Member from 1900 to 1906; and Mr. J. Y. Henderson from December, 1900, to November, 1903. 6. On the 2nd December the Council elected Councillor J. H.

The popularity of the Tooting Public Library which was Tooting Public presented to the Council by Sir William Lancaster Library. in 1902 having outgrown its capacity, Sir William kindly offered to bear the cost of extending it by adding a second storey. By this addition there is provided a capacious reading room and two magazine rooms, thus allowing the former reading and magazine room on the ground floor to be converted into a lending library, and the old lending library into a reference library. The offer of Sir William was communicated to the Council on the 6th May, 1908, when the following resolution was passed, viz. :— "That the best thanks of the Council be presented to Sir Wm. Lancaster, J.P., L.C.C., for his munificent offer to provide an addition to the Tooting Library, which he so generously presented to the Borough in 1902." 10. The additions were carried out under the supervision of and in accordance with plans prepared by Alderman W. Hunt, J.P., L.C.C. During the progress of the work the business of the library was carried on in the Boys' School Room, Church Lane, Tooting, and the library was re-opened on the 3rd December last. 11. The Council has pleasure in recording the fact that, Sir Frederick amongst the Birthday Honours, H.M. The King Lance, K.C.B. conferred the distinction of Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath upon General Lance, C.B., who has been a Member of the Council since 1900. 12. The Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors and principal officers Church Council attended in State services at the Services. following Churches in the Borough, viz. :— 6th Dec., 1908 Parish Church of Wandsworth, All Saints', High Street. 3rd Jan., 1909 Parish Church of Clapham, Holy Trinity, Clapham Common. 24th Jan., 1909 Parish Church of Putney, St. Mary, High Street. 14th Feb., 1909 St. Saviour's Church, Cedars Road, Clapham. 14th March, 1909 Parish Church of Streatham, St. Leonard, Streatham High Road. •9th May, 1909 Parish Church of Tooting, St. Nicholas, Church Lane. 32 13. The Council also attended, on the 10th June, 1908, the institution of the Rev. Prebendary Dalton as Rector of Clapham at the Clapham Parish Church. 14. The draft of the Scheme of the Charity Commissioners Weir Hospital reference to the Weir Hospital Trust, referred Trust- to in the last Annual Report, was received in July last, when a Special Committee of the Council was appointed to consider the matter. The following report of the Committee was adopted by the Council on the 23rd September, 1908, viz. :— 1. We have considered the proposed Scheme of the Charity Commissioners for the administration of the Weir Hospital Charity. 2. The Scheme is practically the same as that proposed by a majority of the Trustees and former Committee of Management, which was the subject of the Public Inquiry held by Mr. H. A. Baker, Assistant Commissioner, at Balham, on the 5th and 8th November last, when it was strongly objected to by the numerous inhabitants of Streatham who attended or were represented there. 3. The proposed expenditure of 50,000 of the Capital Funds of the Charity for completing and equipping the blocks of buildings of the Bolingbroke Hospital, situate in the Borough of Battersea, is contrary to the terms of Mr. Weir's Will, which contemplates a capital expenditure out of the accumulated income of such funds only, and for a dissimilar purpose. The Testator clearly directed that The Hawthorns, Grove Road, Balham, should be established as a Hospital, to be called the Weir Hospital, and did not intend to benefit any existing institution, more especially one not situate in Streatham. The expenditure of this sum of £0,000 would absorb more than one-half of the present value of the Charity Funds. 4. The Scheme would place the control of the Funds in the hands of a body consisting of eighteen members, of whom only six would be chosen in a similar way to that prescribed by the Will. The Scheme gives no indication of the manner in which the twelve other members are to be chosen. 5. The proposal to establish a home for forty nurses is not only not provided for by the Testator's Will, but as only three of the nurses would render gratuitous service it would not even be using the Funds for a charitable purpose. Trained nurses can be obtained by persons requiring them, at existing institutions. 6. As the Scheme is fundamentally opposed to the views set out in the Memorial to the Charity Commissioners, sealed by the Council on the 4th December last (a copy of which accompanies this report), it appears to us that it would serve no good purpose to suggest amendments to its details. We may, however, point out that the Scheme omits to provide (which it should do) for the annual expenditure of £20 for repairs to St. Mary's Church, Balham, or for the maintenance of Mr. Weir's tablet in that 33 Church, and of his grave and monument at Nunhead Cemetery, or for the annual sermon—all of which are prescribed by the Will. 7. The Scheme is in effect a diversion of tne funds for the benefit of the Bolingbroke Hospital, and is contrary to the directions of the Testator. It has not been shown—and in our opinion it cannot be shown—that it is not possible to apply the Funds in the way in which the Testator has directed them to be applied, and the Scheme is therefore wrong in law. 8. We have had an opportunity of considering a Scheme for the administration of the Charity which was submitted to the Charity Commissioners by the present Committee of Management in January last, which proposes to establish a Dispensary, Nurses' Home, and two small Casualty Wards, on the site of Mr. Weir's house, The Hawthorns, Grove Road, Balham, and includes a provis on for the maintenance in convalescent homes in the country, or at the seaside, of inhabitants of Streatham and the neighbourhood, including local patients discharged from general hospitals, who may be certified for such treatment by the Weir Dispensary Medical Officers. We approve of this Scheme, but we suggest that, in addition, an ambulance or ambulances should be provided at The Hawthorns, as proposed by the draft Scheme of the Charity Commissioners. The Committee of Management suggest, further, that by the accumulation of unexpended income a similar institution should at a future time be established in the southern part of Streatham. We also approve of this suggestion. 9. We recommend :— (a) That the Council suggest that the draft Scheme be amended by incorporating in it the above-mentioned proposals of the Committee of Management of January last, and by leaving out all reference to the Bolingbroke Hospital; and by providing (b) That the control and management of the Charity should be in accordance with the directions contained in the Will. (c) That it be referred to us to consider any further action which may be taken by the Charity Commissioners in the matter, and to recommend the taking of any such proceedings by the Council as we may be advised are necessary in opposing the Scheme of the Charity Commissioners and to secure the carrying into effect of the foregoing recommendations. 15. A copy of the foregoing report was forwarded to the Charity Commissioners, as the objections and suggestions of the Council upon the draft Scheme. 16. In December, the Charity Commissioners having published their Scheme for the administration of the Charity in substantially the same form as drafted, the Council applied to the Commissioners for authority to present a petition to the High 34 Court of Chancery against the Scheme. This authority was given, and the necessary steps are being taken to prosecute the appeal. 17. Alderman Hewett, and Councillors Anderson and Garrett, Junr., whose term of office expired on the 10th October last, were re-appointed the Council's representatives on the Committee of Management of the Weir Hospital Trust for the current year. 18. In September, 1908, a letter was received from the Putney Charity Commissioners suggesting that, in view of Charities. small endowment of the Putney Pest House Charity, so large a body of Trustees as at present was not necessary and that the body should consist of the Rector and the Ward representatives, that a scheme should be made to effect this alteration, and to vest the legal estate of the Charity in the Official Trustees of Charity Lands. This Council concurred in the opinion that the present Body of Trustees is too large, and recommended that the Trustees should be the Vicar and Churchwardens, exofficio, and nine persons to be appointed by the Councillors for the Putney Ward. The Charity Commissioners have not yet made any order in the matter. 19. In January, 1909, the Charity Commissioners proposed to Streatham establish a scheme for varying the scheme regulatCharities. ing non-ecclesiastical charities of Streatham, so as to provide that the number of pensioners may be increased if and as the charity permits, and that the receipt of Poor Law medical relief shall not disqualify a person from being an almsperson or pensioner of the Charity. The matter is under consideration. 20. Councillor Campbell was re-appointed a Representative Wandsworth Trustee of the Wandsworth Consolidated Charities Chanties for four years from the 13th April, 1908. In October, 1908, it having been reported to the Council that Alderman Lorden being no longer resident in Springfield Ward there was a vacancy as a Representative Trustee for that Ward, and that there was a vacancy for the Southfield Ward in consequence of the death of Alderman Rucker, the Council, on the 4th November, appointed Councillor Wise a Representative Trustee for the Springfield Ward, and Alderman Lorden a Representative Trustee for the Southfield Ward for a period of four years. 35 21. Councillor Campbell having resigned his position as a Wandsworth Representative of the Council on the Governing Technical institute. Body of the Wandsworth Technical Institute, the Council, on the 6th May, appointed Councillor Wise to fill the vacancy. 22. Councillor Lidiard, who had been for six years this Metropolitan Council's Representative on the Metropolitan Water Board. Water Board, resigned that position on the 26th March last, and the Council expressed its appreciation of his valuable services by passing the following resolution, viz. :— "That this Council has received with much regret the resignation of Councillor Lidiard as its representative on the Metropolitan Water Board. Councillor Lidiard has been a Member of the Board since its incorporation in 1903, and by his special knowledge of the subject of the water supply of the Metropolis was able to render great assistance in bringing into operation the Act of 1902, under which the various Metropolitan Water Companies were dissolved and their powers and duties transferred to the new Authority. This Council records its high appreciation of the valuable services which Councillor Lidiard has rendered, especially to this Borough, during his six years' Membership of the Water Board, and its sincere thanks for the ability and constant attention shown by him in the discharge of the laborious duties which devolved upon him during that time. The Council further desires to recognize the great service given to the public by Councillor Lidiard, as the first Mayor of the Borough and as a Member of this Council and of its predecessor, the District Board of Works, for the long period of twenty-five years." 23. On the 7th April the Council unanimously elected Alderman Lorden its Representative on the Metropolitan Water Board to fill the vacancy. 24. With the view of making the Wandsworth Town Hall Wandsworth more suitable for letting the room lately used as a Town Hall. General Office for the Rating Department and the small hall have been converted into one room. The walls of the entrance hall and staircase have been tiled and other works of decoration carried out; and the scale of charges has been revised. 25. Several firms having withdrawn their tenders for works, after acceptance by the Council, the following Withdrawal of Tenders. standing Order was passed, viz. :— "That the Council will not accept the tender of any person or firm who shall on any previous occasion have withdrawn a tender after the same has been opened by the Council or a Committee, unless the reasons for the withdrawal were satisfactory to the Council." 36 26. Alderman Robinson and Councillors Sir Frederick Lance Motor and Taylor were appointed this Council's RepresenOmnibuses. tatives to attend a Conference convened by the Poplar Borough Council to consider the subject of the excessive speed at which motor omnibuses are driven in the Metropolis. The following" resolutions were passed, viz. :— 1. That, having regard to the conditions of street traffic in London and the many accidents that have occurred, due to the speed at which motor omnibuses arc driven, this Conference is of opinion that in the interests of the safety of the public it is necessary the speed of motor omnibuses should be further limited in the London area. The Conference therefore urges the Local Government Board to amend Articles IV. of the Heavy Motor Car Order, 1904, so as to restrict the maximum speed of motor omnibuses within the County of London, outside the four-miles radius to 10 miles per hour, and within the four-miles radius to eight miles per hour. 2. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the maximum speed of motor cars passing through the County of London should be restricted to 15 miles per hour, and that representations be made to the Local Government Board to this effect. 3. That representations be made to the Home Secretary and the Chief •Commissioner of Police, as follows, viz. :— (a) That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable the Chief Commissioner of Police should be empowered to require, as a condition of the issue of a license for a motor omnibus or motor cab, the provision of a speed indicator of approved design. (b) That the various Motor Omnibus Companies should be compelled to adopt effective mud guards to remedy the intolerable nuisance to which pedestrians, and residents on the frontages, are subjected through the mud thrown up by the wheels of motor omnibuses in wet weather. 27. This Council decided to support resolution 3 (a), and made no order with reference to the others. 28. This Council considered a report of the Local Government Representation Records and Museums Committee of the London on County Council as to what steps can be taken to re-adjust the representations of County Electoral areas in London in order to remove the present inequalities of representation under which areas differing greatly in population and electorate return the same number of representatives. The report recommended 37 that application be made to Parliament in the Session of 1909 to amend the Local Government Act, 1888, so as to provide:— (1) As from 1st January, 1910, the areas of the Battersea, Clapham, Fulham, Lewisham, Wandsworth, and Woolwich Electoral Divisions of the Administrative County of London shall be sub-divided as follows:— Battersea 2 divisions. Clapham 2 „ Fulham 2 ,, Lewisham 2 „ Wandsworth 3 ,, Woolwich 2 „ (2) Each of such new electoral divisions shall return two Members to serve on the County Council. 38 Existing Electoral division and proposed new divisions. Population Census 1901. Electorate 1908. Contents and boundaries of proposed new electoral divisions. CLAPHAM — 120,761 27,805 East Clapham 54,325 12,812 The ancient parish of Clapham. West Clapham 66,436 14,993 The part of the ancient parish of Battersea situated within the existing Clapham Division. WANDSWORTH— 179,769 45,083 Putney 58,019 13,995 Polling Districts Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, comprising approximately Putney and Southfield Wards and the part of Fairfield Ward living to the north of East Hill and St. John's Hill. The boundary of the new division runs along St. John's Hill, East Hill, High Street, Wandsworth, and the River Wandle. Tooting 57,497 14,880 Polling Districts Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9, and that part of No. 10 lying to the west of Trinity Road and Tooling Bee Road, comprising approximately the remainder of Fairfield Ward, the Springfield and Tooting Wards and the south-western part of Balham Ward. It would consist of the middle portion of the existing Wandsworth division, the boundary on the south-east being Trinity Road, Tooting Bee Road and the old parish boundary of Tooting Graveney. Streatham 64,253 16,208 The remainder of Polling District No. 13 and the whole of Polling Districts Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. It comprisesapproximately the whole ot Streatham Ward and the larger part of Balham Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, together with Streatham detached, now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth. 39 29. This Council approved of the foregoing proposals, which were considered by the County Council in October last, when such Council decided that the Government should be approached with a view to legislation being introduced in the present Session to effect the suggested amendment of the Local Government Act, and that, failing action by the Government, the Council should endeavour to secure the introduction of a private Member's Bill for the purpose. No Bill on the subject has yet been introduced into Parliament. 30. The Council considered some additions proposed by the Westminster City Council to be made to the lations for costermongers made by the Commissioner of Police, and approved thereof, and appointed Councillors Turnbull and Wise its representatives to attend a Conference convened by the Westminster Council on the subject. The Conference was held on the 16th June, and certain additional regulations, with which this Council agree, were approved and forwarded to the Home Secretary and the Commissioner of Police. Costermongers. 31. The Council again had under consideration the subject of compounding for rates. It was found that since the compounding allowance was reduced from 25 to 20 per cent, in April, 1907, the number of rateable hereditaments in respect of which the owners, rated under Section 4 of the Act of 1869, declined to pay rates whether the premises were occupied or not, had increased from 2,205 to 6,516, and the Rating Committee pointed out that in those cases the owners received 15 per cent, allowance for occupied properties and paid no rates for "empties." The Council, being of opinion that such an arrangement was not of advantage to the Borough, rescinded the resolutions ordering owners to be rated under Section 4 of the Act, and decided that all agreements to compound be under Section 3, and upon condition that all compoundable properties in the Borough belonging to the same owner be included in the agreement; that the maximum rateable value of properties compounded for be £15; that the commission to owners agreeing to become liable for and pay the rates whether the hereditaments be occupied or not, be 15 per cent.; and that unless the rates be paid by the 15th day of the second month in the quarter in which they are due the commission be reduced to 5 per cent. The limit of rateable value c Compounding for Rates. 40 of compoundable property was, however, subsequently altered from £15 to £20. 32. In February last the Council considered a letter from the Chairman of the Territorial Force Association, County of London, asking- for the co-operation of the Council in the endeavour of the association to raise 28,000 men in the County for the Force. A Committee, consisting of the Mayor, Aldermen Anderson and Lorden, and Councillor Sir Frederick Lance, was appointed to deal with the matter. A public meeting was held at the Wandsworth Town Hall on the 16th March, at which the Mayor presided, and other meetings were held in different parts of the Borough with the view of increasing: the Territorial Force in London. Territorial Force. 33. The Council has on several occasions considered the subJect of the desirability of the promotion of a Bill to provide for the superannuation of its officers and servants. The Superannuation Allowances Act, 1866, authorized the Council to grant superannuation allowances to its officers without contributions from the officers, and it had been the practice of the Council and its predecessor, the late Wandsworth District Board of Works, to grant such allowances upon the scale set out in the Act. The Council also granted superannuation allowances to its workmen in accordance with a scale adopted in 1902. It was, however, doubtful whether the Council had power to superannuate workmen. Seven of the Metropolitan Borough Councils had obtained Acts of Parliament for the superannuation of their officers and servants and, having considered those Acts, this Council decided to promote a Bill in the same terms as the St. Marylebone Act, with any necessary modifications. The Bill was accordingly introduced in the Session of 1909, and received the Royal Assent on the 25th May last. The Act comes into force on the 31st March next, and steps are being taken by the Council to bring it into operation. The principal provisions of the Act are :— Superannuation Act. (a) Every officer or servant placed upon the permanent establishment who shall have completed 10 years service and become incapable of discharging his duties with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body, or of old age, or who shall have attained the age of 60 years and completed 40 years' service, shall be entitled, on ceasing to hold his office or employment, to receive out of the Superannuation Fund a 41 superannuation allowance of one-sixtieth af the average amount of his salary or wages and emoluments for each year's service. (b) Superannuation allowances to officers and servants who at the commencement of the Act have attained 65 years of age, or 60 years and have completed 40 years' service, are to be paid out of the General Rate, and not out of the Superannuation Fund. (c) Officers and servants ceasing to hold office in consequence of misconduct forfeit all claim to superannuation. The Council may, however, return to them part or all of their contributions. (d) Officers and servants who resign before being entitled to superannuation, or lose their office or employment by reason of reduction of staff, or cease to hold their office or employment by reason of bodily injury not occasioned by their own default, are entitled to receive a sum equal to the amount of their contributions, and the Council (except in the case of voluntary resignation) may also grant them a gratuity not exceeding two years' salary or wages. (e) In the event of an officer or servant dying before being entitled to superannuation the Council is to pay to his legal personal representatives a sum not exceeding the amount of all, and not less than one-half, of the contributions of such officer or servant. (f) The contributions of officers and servants are as follows, viz. :— With less than five years' service at the commencement of the Act, 2 per cent, of salaries or wages. With more than five years' service, 2½ per cent, of salaries or wages. With more than 15 years' service, 3 per cent, of salaries or wages. (g) The Superannuation Fund to be formed under the Act consists of : (i.) The primary annual contribution out of the General Rate. (ii.) The contributions of officers and servants. (iii.) Dividends and interest arising out of the income of the fund ; and (iv.) Such amount of the General Rate as may be required to meet any deficiency. (h) An actuarial investigation is to be made every five years to fix the primary annual contribution above-mentioned, and this is not to be less than £400. 34. The following- Parliamentary Bills were considered by the Council, viz.:— London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). London County Council (General Powers) London United Tramways. Parliamentary Bills. 42 London and District Electric Supply. London Electric Supply. London (Westminster and Kensington) Electric Supply Companies. South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railways. Gas Light and Coke Company. River Wandle Protection. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. Old Age Pensions. Representation of the People. Municipal Franchise (Mercantile Corporations and Companies). Housing, Town Planning, etc. Shops. Elementary Education (England and Wales). Moveable Dwellings. Education Board Provisional Orders Confirmation (London). Daylight Saving. Education (Continuation Schools). Breaches of Bye-Laws. 35. This Bill proposed to authorize the County Council to Construct new tramways, and to re-construct exist- ing tramways in various parts of London. London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). 36. The proposed tramways in this Borough were tramways Nos. 9, 9A to 9H (from the existing tramways at Putney Bridge to York Road, Wandsworth, by way of High Street, Putney, Upper Richmond Road and High Street, Wandsworth, with single lines along Oxford Road, Putney, and Broomhill and Buckhold Roads, Wandsworth), and Nos. 10 and ioa (from the existing tramways in Mitcham Road, Tooting, along Southcroft Road and Mitcham Lan'e to the new tramway at Streatham High Road). 37. This Council objected to the proposed route from Putney Bridge to York Road, Wandsworth, and suggested the construction of tramways along High Street, Putney, Putney Bridge Road and High Street, Wandsworth, and that they should be continued along High Street and East Hill to the existing terminus at the Council House. The provisions relating to the County Council's 43 scheme were subsequently withdrawn from the Bill, and in May, 1909, a deputation from this Council had an interview with a SubCommittee of the Highways Committee of the County Council on the subject, when the Sub-Committee stated that the question of submitting a fresh scheme for the construction of the tramways along the route proposed by this Council would be considered. 38. The proposed tramways Nos. 10 and ioa are tramways which this Council suggested to the County Council should be constructed (see page 64 of last Annual Report). This Council approved of the proposals, subject to the amount of its contribution towards the cost of widenings at Southcroft Road and Mitcham Lane being limited to £5,816. Provisions in the Bill to which the Council objected having been withdrawn, this Council did not further oppose the Bill. 39. Part III. of this Bill contained similar provisions with regard to unwholesome milk to those contained in the General Powers Bill of last year, and withdrawn because of the Statement that the Government proposed to introduce general legislation on the subject of milk supply. These provisions would authorize the Medical Officer of the London County Council to take, at any railway station, samples of milk for examination, and the Medical Officer of Health of any Sanitary Authority to take samples of milk sold, offered or exposed or deposited for sale at any place (not being a railway station) within the district, and, provided that if such milk should be found to contain any matter rendering it unwholesome or unfit for food, the person producing or consigning it would be liable to a penalty of 40s. for a first, and /~5 for a subsequent conviction. The provisions would also empower the London County Council to prohibit the supply of milk within the County from any dairy outside the County from which the unwholesome milk was supplied. London County Council (General Powers;. 40. Part IV. would empower Sanitary Authorities to require sufficient and suitable accommodation for the storage of food in tenement houses not so used before the passing of the Bill. Part V. would amend the provisions of the London Building Act relating to buildings of iron and steel or reinforced concrete construction. 44 41. This Council suggested an amendment of the provisions relating to the division of samples of milk, and that Medical Officers of Health of Sanitary Authorities should have power to require information as to the dairy in which milk is produced, as well as the Medical Officer of the County Council. This Council approved of the provisions as to the storage of food, and decided to take no action with regard to the other provisions of the Bill. 42. After correspondence with the County Council this Council decided not to oppose the Bill. Part III. was eventually struck out of the Bill, which, as amended, received the Royal Assent on the 16th August, 1909. 43. This Bill proposed to authorize the London United Tramways Company to run over and use with their cars tramways of the County Council, and the County Council to use tramways of the London United Tramways Company upon such terms as, failing agreement, may be determined by arbitration, and to require the County Council within six months from the passing of the Bill to exercise its powers under the Act of 1903 for the construction of a tramway from the County boundary at Wimbledon Road to Garratt Lane, failing which those powers were to be transferred to the Company. This Council petitioned against the Bill, which was rejected by a Committee of the House of Commons on the 14th May. London United Tramways. 44. In the last Annual Report, page 46, it was stated that these Bills had passed the House of Lords and would be considered by a Committee of the House of Commons in the autumn Session. That mittee reported that the preamble of the first-mentioned Bill was not proved, and amended the London Electric Supply Bill so as to authorize undertakers and electric lighting companies to enter into agreements for mutual assistance, and to connect mains, and to provide that every power to purchase any undertaking of a supply company which, but for the Act, would be exerciseable by a Local Authority in any part of London, shall be transferred to the London County Council, that such Council shall also be empowered to purchase all the electric lighting undertakings in the County not purchaseable by a Local Authority. The County Council is to give three years' notice of its intention to purchase, and is not to purchase one undertaking London and District Electric Supply, and London Electric Supply. 45 unless at the same time it purchases the whole of the electric lighting undertakings in the County; the undertakings, if purchased, are to be paid for upon the terms in Section 2 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1888. The County Council may proceed to purchase in August, 1931, or at the expiration of any subsequent 10 years, and may discharge not more than three-fourths of the purchase-money by the issue to the company of London County stock. The power of the Corporation of London and the Camberwell Borough Council to purchase the electric lighting undertakings in their respective areas is retained until August, 1927, and the power of the Lambeth Borough Council to re-purchase the undertaking in that Borough is retained until 1928. If not purchased before those dates the power to purchase is to be transferred to the County Council. The Bill, as amended, received the Royal Assent on the 21st December last. 45. The object of this Bill was to enable the five electric lighting companies mentioned in the Bill to enter into agreements for mutual assistance, and to lay connecting mains. As the Bill was referred to the Committee of the House of Commons as the two last-mentioned Bills, this Council presented a petition against it. A clause, providing that neither of the companies in question should oppose any Bill to constitute the County Council the purchasing authority of their undertakings having been inserted in the Bill, this Council took no further steps with regard to the measure, which received Royal Assent on the 21st December last. London (Westminster and Kensington) Electric Supply Companies. 46. This Bill proposed to extend for seven years, from the 6th August, 1909, the time limited by Section 8 of the Company's Act of 1907 for the compulsory purrequired for railway widenings near Wandsworth Road Station and other places, and for the execution of works in connection therewith, authorized by Sections 4 and 34 of the Company's Act, 1900. The Council took no action with regard to the Bill, which received the Royal Assent on the 16th August, 1909. South Eastern and London Chatham and Dover Railway. 47. This Bill proposed to repeal certain provisions of the Cornpany's Acts relating to the price of gas, dividends and profits, and provides that the standard rate of dividend on the ordinary stock shall be £4 per cent, per annum, Gas Light and Coke. 46 and the standard price for gas 3s. 3d. per 1,000 cubic feet, and that 14 candles shall be substituted for 16 as the standard illuminating- power. Clause 39 of the scheme for the amalgamation of the company with the London Gas Light Company in 1883 provided that the company should not charge for gas in the districts of the London Gas Light Company south of the Thames a higher price than the price for the time being charged by the South Metropolitan Gas Company for gas of the same illuminating power. The Council petitioned against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of a clause providing that the company shall not charge in their southern district a higher price than that charged by the South Metropolitan Company. The company having agreed to the insertion of such a clause the Council withdrew its opposition to the Bill, which was passed on the 16th August, 1909. 48. This Bill was promoted by riparian owners on the River Wandle with a view to checking the reduction of spring-water by pumping operations by the Croydon Corporation. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, and authorized the Medical Officer of Health and Borough Engineer to give evidence in support thereof. The Bill, as passed, provides that the Croydon Corporation shall not sink any well upon, or construct any works for taking or intercepting water from any lands, if such taking or intercepting materially diminishes the flow of water in the Wandle, unless the works and lands upon which the same are to be constructed are specified in an Act or Order confirmed by Parliament; that the Corporation shall not abstract from the Waddon wells more than 50 million gallons of water in every period of 30 days, except so far as they may be hereafter authorized by Parliament, and that they shall keep daily records of the water pumped at Waddon wells. River Wandle Protection 49. The Bill on the subject of combined drainage, introduced in 1908, did not reach second reading. It has been introduced again this Session, and the Council has presented a petition in favour of it. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. 50. The Council considered the provisions of this Bill and passed the following resolution thereon, viz. :— "That it is important to avoid anything tending to check thrift, and that the bestowal of pensions largest in amount for those who have saved least is an obvious discouragement to those who save, and tfiat in the Old Age Pensions. 47 opinion of this Council equal pensions on a contributory basis would be most in the public interest." 51. The Council was also of opinion that in London Local Pension Committees should be appointed by the Borough Councils instead of the County Council. This suggestion was not adopted, and the London County Council appoints the Local Pension Committee for the County of London which has been divided into thirteen districts, for each of which a Sub-Committee has been appointed. This Borough and the Borough of Battersea form one district, and the Sub-Committee consists of two Members of the Local Pension Committee, one representative of this Council, one representative of the Battersea Borough Council, and five other Members appointed by the Local Pension Committee. Alderman Anderson is this Council's representative and has been elected Chairman of the Sub-Committee. 52. This Bill was introduced by Sir Henry Kimber, Bart., M.'P. Its object was to make the representation of the people in the House of Commons more nearly proportioned to population by giving to every constituency containing a population of more than 65,000 per member an additional member for every complete 65,000 in excess of the first 65,000, and by enlarging every constituency containing less than 50,000 per member to bring it up over that number, but not over 100,000 per member. This Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which, however, did not reach second readings Representation of the People. 53. This Bill, introduced in 1908, provided that where any Corporation aggregate, or joint stock or other companv, is in occupation of any land or tenement of the yearly value of not less than 10, an officer of such Corporation or Company shall be entitled to be entered in the Local Government Register of Electors and to vote in any election except for a Member of Parliament. This Council approved of the principle of the Bill, but were of opinion that the representation of Companies and Corporations should be in proportion to the rateable value of the premises occupied by them. The Bill passed the House of Lords, and was read a first time in the House of Commons, and then dropped. The Bill has been introduced again this Session, and the Council has petitioned in favour of it. Municipal Franchise (Mercantile Corporations, and Companies). 48 54- This is a Government measure, and proposes to make Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, compulsory, deals with the compulsory acquisition of land under Part III. of the Act of 1890, proposes to authorize the Public Works Loan Commissioners to advance loans for the purposes of the Act, to authorize Local Authorities to lay out streets, to authorize the Local Government Board to enforce the execution of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts by Local Authorities, and to abolish the necessity of orders of such Board for the compulsory purchase of land being confirmed by Parliament, to authorize such Board to make inspection and enquiries as to the condition of any area, to amend the procedure for closing and demolition orders, to double the rateable value of premises to which Section 75 of the Act of 1890 applies, and to authorize the Local Government Board to require from Local Authorities reports as to any area and to determine whether the Housing Acts should be put in force in such area. The clauses relating to- town planning provide that Local Authorities may, if authorized by the Local Government Board, prepare schemes with respect to land likely to be used for building purposes, and remove buildings which are not in accordance with the scheme; and that the Local Government Board may order a scheme to be made or carried out in default of the Local Authority. Housing, Town Planning, &c. 55. The Council presented a petition against the Bill, objecting to, among other provisions, those relating to the making of Part III. of the Act of 1890 compulsory, the alteration of the procedure for closing and demolition orders, to the proposed enquiries, the extension of the rateable value for the purpose of Section 75 of the Act of 1890; suggesting that any further legislation dealing with the Housing of the Working Classes Act should be by consolidating and amending the existing law into one Act of Parliament, and stating that whilst in favour of further powers being given to Local Authorities with regard to the width, direction, and levels of streets and other matters in connection with the laying out of land for building purposes, the Council was of opinion that the Town Planning provisions of the Bill would unduly interfere with private rights and would not effect an improvement at all commensurate with the public expenditure which would be involved. 49 56. The Bill passed the Committee Stage in the House of Commons and was withdrawn on the 10th December. It has been introduced in the House of Commons this Session, as amended, and the Council has again presented a petition against it. 57. This Bill proposed to amend the Shop Hours Act, 1904, by making it compulsory on Local Authorities to make closing orders while empowering them to refer to the ratepayers the questions whether any order shall come into operation, and whether any alteration shall be made in the order. The County Council would have been the Local Authority for London. This Council petitioned against the Bill, which was dropped after second reading. Shops. 58. This Bill was introduced by the Government, and proposed that rate aid should not be given to nonprovided schools; that the existing law as to Parliamentary grants should be amended; and that trustees of schoolhouses held under charitable trusts might, notwithstanding those trusts, transfer the schoolhouse to the Local Education Authority. The Council presented a petition against the Bill on the following, among other, grounds, viz. : its reactionary character from an educational standpoint, its subversion of trust deeds, and its confiscation of voluntary school buildings. The Bill was read a second time and referred to a Committee of the House of Commons, but was withdrawn before consideration by the Committee. Elementary Education (England and Wales). 59. This Bill, referred to in the last Annual Report, did not reach Third Reading in the House of Lords. A similar Bill has been introduced in the present Session, and the Council has presented a petition in favour thereof. The Bill is awaiting consideration by a Committee of the House of Lords. Moveable Dwellings. 60. No action was taken with reference to the other Bills above mentioned. 61. The subject of the provision of a new Mortuary and Coroner's Court for Wandsworth has continued to receive the consideration of the Council. Plans have been prepared for the erection or a suitable Mortuary and Coroner's Court on part of the land which was Proposed Mortuary and Coroner's Court. 50 acquired for the cemetery in Magdalen Road, adjoining Earlsfield Station. The suggestion was submitted to the Local Government Board, who expressed their willingness to consider an application of the Council for leave to erect the Mortuary and Coroner's Court on the land in question. Enquiries were also made of the London County Council with regard to the rent which that Council would be willing to pay for the use of the Coroner's Court, if erected. Several objections to the Council's proposal were received from residents in the district. 62. A Departmental Committee having been appointed to enquire into the law relating to Coroners and Coroners' Inquests, and into the practice in Coroners' Courts. Alderman Anderson, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, gave evidence on behalf of the Council with reference to the boundaries of the coroners' districts in the Borough, and the difficulties which the Council has experienced in the matter of the provision of a Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Departmental Committee also considered as to making recommendations that Parliament should empower authorities such as the London County Council and this Council to apply to the Privy Council for an Order in Council for the better allotment and administration of coroners' duties, and that the duty now imposed upon inquest juries to view bodies should be abolished. The question of proceeding further with the proposal has been adjourned, pending the report of the Departmental Committee. 63. Other information relating to public health is contained in the Medical Officer's Report, Appendix H. 64. The scheme for the administration of the Foundations of the St. Mary's National Schools, Summerstown, referred to in the last report (page 58), has been settled by the Board of Education. Authority is given to sell the present premises, the proceeds to be invested, and the yearly income applied in providing religious instruction and physical or gymnastic instruction in the district of Summerstown. The Council has appointed Councillor Cresswell as Representative Trustee under the scheme. Schemes re Schools. 65. Two other schemes relating to the Frogmore School Foundation, Wandsworth, and the Walcott Educational 51 tion, Lambeth, respectively, have been submitted by the Board of Education to the Council for its information. 66. The attention of the London County Council has been drawn to the unsuitability of iron buildings for use as permanent schools, and such Council was urged to complete the West Hill School, Wandsworth, and thus do away with the necessity for the iron buildings in use there. The County Council stated in reply that iron buildings were only utilized to meet urgent needs, steps being always taken to replace such buildings by permanent premises, and that the use of the iron buildings at West Hill would be discontinued on the opening of the new "Southfields" School. Use of Iron Buildings as Schools 67. The County Council has given notice of its intention to provide a new public elementary school for about 800 children in the district of Littleton Street, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, and to enlarge the school conducted by such Council in the Workhouse of the Guardians of the Union in Swaffield Road, Wandsworth, by providing additional accommodation for about 108 children. New Schools. 68. A return, prepared by the London County Council, showing the names of the Managers who, during the year ended 30th June, 1908, had made fewer than three attendances at Meeting's of Managers, and fewer than four visits during school hours to the schools in the group, has been considered by the Council, and the attention of the Council's Managers in question was drawn to the return. The County Council was so informed, and that the Council hoped this might result in better attendances at Managers' Meetings and visits to the schools in future, but felt that until the powers and duties of the Managers were largely increased, and their reasonable requisitions supplied, there would be great difficulty in inducing Managers to take more interest in the work of the schools. Attendances of Managers and Powers and Duties of Managers. 69. The Council decided to support the action of the Bermondsey Borough Council in urging the London County Council to enlarge the powers of School Managers, and appointed delegates to a Conference convened by the Bermondsey Council to consider what further action could be taken in the matter. 25 City and Borough Councils were represented at the Conference, 52 and a resolution was passed to the effect that it was desirable that a closer connection should be established between such Councils and the schools in their respective localities, and urging the London County Council to delegate to the City and Borough Councils greater powers in the management of the schools. The Council wrote to the County Council in support of the resolution, and was informed in reply that it was considered that ample opportunity for Managers to assist the cause of education might be found in the duties assigned to Managers, and that the Committee of the County Council shared the desire to secure the interest of Managers in the schools, but were unable to agree in thinking that the powers and duties already delegated to Managers would fail to secure this end. 70. Alderman Hewett has been re-appointed as this Council's Representative on the Metropolitan Paving Committee. Metre polit 111 Paving Committee. 71. The deputation appointed by the London County Council to wait upon the Prime Minister in favour of the establishment of a Traffic Board upon the lines indicated in the report of the Royal Commission on London Traffic was received by the Prime Minister on the 26th November, 1908. In reply to the representations made by the deputation, the Prime Minister stated that there were strong prima facie objections to the creation of any new authority for London, but he promised that H.M. Government would give the matter very careful consideration. Metropolitan Traffic Board. 72. The attention of the Council having been called to the danger to the public arising from fast motor traffic through Putney, the Council asked the London County Council to apply to the Local Government Board for a regulation to be made prohibiting the driving of motor cars at a speed exceeding 10 miles per hour in High Street, Putney, between Putney Bridge and the south side of Upper Richmond Road. The County Council declined to make the suggested application, but decided to erect four sign posts in suitable positions near the intersection of High Street and Putney Hill at Upper Richmond Road, in addition to the warning notices and signs already placed there by the Borough Council and the Automobile Association. Motor Car Traffic through Putney. 53 73- In view of the danger to the public arising from motor vehicles being driven at a high rate of speed along Roehampton Lane, Putney, between Upper Richmond Road and Portsmouth Road, the London County Council asked the Local Government Board to make a regulation prescribing a maximum speed not exceeding 10 miles an hour for motor cars in that thoroughfare. The application is now under the consideration of the Local Government Board. 74. The work of constructing the tramways in Lower Richmond Road and across Putney Bridge to Hammer- smith, authorized by the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Acts, 1902 and 1908, has been completed. The lines, which are worked on the overhead trolley" system of electric traction, were inspected by the Board of Tradt and opened for traffic in January last. Putney to Hammersmith Tramways. 75. The tramways in Queen's Road, Clapham and Battersea, having been reconstructed for the underground conduit system of electric traction, the lines were inspected by the Board of Trade and re-opened for traffic in January last. Queen's Road Tramways. 76. Arrangements having' been made with the County Council. as to the reconstruction for electric traction of the tramways in Wandsworth Road and East Hill, and the widening and re-paving of those roads in connection therewith, and the Board of Trade having approved the system of traction (underground conduit) proposed to be adopted, the works were put in hand in January last, and are still in progress. Under the agreement which was entered into with the London County Council the property required for the widenings is being acquired by the County Council, and that Council is executing the whole of the paving works. The agreement also provides that the Borough Council shall relieve the County Council of the obligation to maintain any portion of the carriageway except the part between the tramway rails and margins 18 in. in width outside the rails, an allowance being made by the County Council in respect of this relief; and that the Borough Council shall contribute onethird of the cost of the improvement and of the paving works outside the tramway area, less the above-mentioned allowance, the Borough Council's contribution being limited to the sum of £9,273. Wandsworth Road and East Hill Tramways. 54 77. In connection with this scheme, the Borough Council arranged for the road in front of Nos. 8 to 24 (even, inclusive), East Hill to be raised to a more convenient level and for the road to be widened by the addition to the public way of a strip of the forecourts of the premises above mentioned. The Borough Council also agreed to a strip of the Mount Nod (Huguenot) Burial Ground and part of the forecourt and land at the side of the Council House being thrown into the public way. 78. The construction of tramways from Lavender Hill via Cedars Road, Clapham Common, North Side, and Long Road, to Clapham Common, South Side, was authorized by the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Act, 1906. The Act provided that the construction of these tramways shall not be commenced until the County Council commenced the reconstruction of the tramways in Wandsworth Road, Lavender Hill, and Queen's Road. The tramways in Queen's Road having been reconstructed, and the work in Wandsworth Road and Lavender Hill being in hand, the County Council are now in a position to commence the line from Queen's Road to Claoham Common, South Side. Cedars Road, ,&o , Tramways. 79. The agreement, dated 10th August, 1906, between this Council and the County Council, relating to the construction of these tramways, provides (1) for the removal of the sanitary convenience in Cedars Road, near Lavender Hill, the County Council paying the sum of £8oo in respect thereof; (2) for the widening of the carriageways of Long Road and Clapham Common, North Side, by setting back the kerbs where approved by this Council; (3) for the construction by the County Council of a surface water sewer, with gullies, in Long Road ; and (4) for the County Council to pave with wood, if required by this Council, so much of the carriageway of Clapham Common, North Side, as lies between the tramway margins and the kerb, the Borough Council to pay the cost of such work, less the estimated cost of joining up the tramway margins which would be rendered unnecessary. 80. Application was made by the County Council for the approval of the Board of Trade to the system of traction (underground conduit) proposed to be adopted, and the Borough Council approved thereof, subject to the terms of the above-mentioned agreement, to the margins of the tramways and the part of the 55 carriageway between the outer tramway rails in Cedars Road and Clapham Common, North Side, being paved with wood, and to the usual other conditions. The County Council, however, declined to agree to the condition as to wood-paving unless the Borough Council paved with wood the remainder of the carriageway of the roads referred to within a period of two years. The Borough Council concurred in this proposal, and the tramway works will probably be put in hand shortly. 81. As stated in last year's report, an agreement was entered into between the Boroueh Council and the London County Council with regard to the extension of the tramways along Streatham High Road, from the former terminus opposite the Tate Public Library to the County boundary at Norbury, and the widening and paving of the road in connection therewith. The work of constructing the tramways was begun in January last, and the Borough Council from time to time pressed the County Council to proceed therewith as expeditiously as possible. The tramway and paving works and certain of the essential widenings were completed in July, 1909, when the lines were inspected by the Board of Trade and opened for traffic. The part of the carriageway along the tramway route, for the maintenance of which the Borough Council is responsible, was paved throughout with wood, and the footpaths with stone, the estimated cost of this work being £15,720. The wood-paving was carried out by the County Council for the Borough Council simultaneously with the tramway works. Streatham High Road Tramways. 82. Repeated applications were made to the County Council for permission to round off the corner of Streatham Streatham Common at the junction of Streatham High Road with Streatham Common North. The Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the County Council having rgain refused to accede to the Borough Council's request, a further communication was addressed to the County Council on the subject, and the matter is still under consideration. "Widening at corner of Streatham Common. 83. A fatal accident having occurred in Clapham Common, North Side, the Borough Council obtained permis- sion from the County Council to widen the road by throwing a strip of Clapham Common into the public way. The carriageway between Long Road and Macaulay Road was made Clapham Common (North Side). D 56 of an uniform width and a footpath formed on the Common side of the road. 84. With the consent of the County Council the way across Tooting Common, opposite Furzedown Drive, was widened and made up by the Borough Council, and re-opened for vehicular traffic. It will be tained in future as a highway. Under the agreement with the County Council the Borough Council has power, when it deems fit, to provide a footpath on the Common on each side of the road. "Widening Roads across Tooting Common. 85. For the purpose of widening the way across Tooting Common between Church Lane and Rectory Lane, opposite Mantilla Road, two small pieces of the Common were, with the County Council's consent, added to the public way. The Borough Council also proposed that Church Lane should be widened by throwing into the public way two small pieces of Tooting Common at the corners of Mantilla Road. The County Council did not see its way to surrender the piece of the Common at the eastern corner, but arrangements are being made for the piece at the western corner to be added to the public way. 86. With one exception, the whole of the property required for widening Mitcham Road in connection with the construction of electric tramways along that thoroughfare from Tooting Broadway to the County boundary at Tooting Junction railway station, has been acquired, and the land thrown into the public way paved. The piece of forecourt needed to complete the improvement is only a few yards in extent, and, having regard to the high price asked by the owners, the Borough Council concurred in the proposal of the County Council that no further steps should be taken at present for its acquisition. Some of the surplus land purchased in connection with the widening was sold to the London County Council for the purpose of a tramways electricity sub-station, and steps are being taken with the view of the disposal of the remainder. Two-thirds of the cost of the improvement will be borne by the County Council. Miteham Road "Widening. 87. Most of the forecourts required for the widening of York Road, Wandsworth, in connection with the electrification of the tramways there, have been acquired, and the necessary paving works executed. With the view of com- York Boad Widening. 57 pleting the improvement as soon as possible steps are being taken for the compulsory purchase of the outstanding interests in the remaining forecourts. High Street, Wandsworth, and St. Ann's Hill Widening. 88. The London County Council having acquired the site of the old Vicarage in High Street, Wandsworth, for the purpose of erecting a technical institute thereon, the Borough Council offered to transfer its interest in the vacant land and cottages, at the corner of High Street and St. Ann's Hill, to the County Council so as to enlarge the area of land available for the institute, and give it a more important frontage. The offer of the Borough Council was conditional upon the County Council widening to 54 feet the part of High Street upon which the premises abutted, throwing into the public way the site of the bay windows of the cottages in St. Ann's Hill, and contributing two-thirds of the cost of the paving works to be executed in connection with the proposed improvement. The London County Council accepted this offer, an agreement was entered into, and the consents of the Local Government Board and the Board of Education obtained. The necessary steps are being taken with the view of the widening being effected as soon as possible. Footbridge over River Wandle. 89. The new footbridge over the River Wandle, by McMurray's paper mills, Garratt Lane, referred to in last year's report, was constructed at a total cost, including the acquisition of a small piece of land required for the western abutment, of £190 16s. 5d. The estimated cost was £200. The new bridge is in a more convenient position and more commodious than the old one, which has been removed. Putnev Bridge Road Widening go. The Borough Council's applications for contributions towards the cost of widening certain parts of Putney Bridge Road are still awaiting the decision of the London County Council. At the request of the County Council that Council was furnished with a plan showing the widenings which it was suggested should be carried out should a line of tramways be constructed along the road from Putney to Wandsworth, and an estimate of the cost of such widenings is in course of preparation. The County Council promised to consider the Borough Council's applications when this estimate is supplied. 58 9i- The widening of Putney Bridge Road between the London and South-Western Railway bridge and a point near Fawe Park Road was completed at a total cost of £1,847 17s. iid. The estimated cost was £1,700. The County Council has not yet dealt with the Borough Council's application for a contribution towards this improvement. High Street, Putney, Widening. 92. The greater part of the land required for widening High Street, Putney, at Nos. 58 to 68 (even, inclusive) under the agreement entered into with Brandon's Putney Brewery, Limited, in 1903, having been thrown into the public way and paved, the Council came to an arrangement' with the company for the completion of the widening at Nos. 66 and 68 to be postponed for the present, and for the improvement, when executed, to be continued in front of No. 70, High Street, to the corner of Lacy Road. Lower Richmond Road Widening. 93. The completion of this improvement in accordance with the scheme approved by the Council is still in abeyance, difficulties having arisen with regard to certain property required for the widening. The matter is in the hands of the Highways Committee, who will continue to give it their attention. Charlwood Road Widening. 94. The suggested widening of Charlwood Road in connection with the erection of a County Council School in that road at the corner of Hotham Road, referred to in last year's report (paragraphs 129-130), was again the subject of correspondence between the Borough Council and the County Council. The widening of the road to 40 feet having been rendered impossible, except at great cost, by the London County Council erecting the school close to the highway, a proposal was made that sufficient land should be given up to widen the road 20 feet from the centre, the Borough Council executing the necessary paving works. The Borough Council agreed to this modified widening, but the County Council then proposed that the Borough Council should also bear the cost of erecting a new boundary wall to the school. The Borough Council decided to inform the County Council that the question of the erection of the wall was a new point which had not been raised before, and the Borough Council could not entertain the suggestion, and that upon sufficient land being given up to widen the road 20 feet from the centre in front 59 of the school, the Borough Council would execute the necessary paving works free of cost. The matter is now under the consideration of the County Council. West Hill Widening. 95. When the Borough Council decided to widen West Hill, Wandsworth, the estimated cost of the property and paving works, including the cost of widening the road in front of the police station, was £25,000. The London County Council, however, decided that the widening should commence on the western side of the police station, and estimated the cost at £23,800, of which such Council promised to contribute two-thirds, not exceeding £15,866. The total cost of this part of the improvement was £28,457 5s. 3d. The County Council's estimate of the cost was somewhat low, and the excess of the actual over the estimated cost of the improvement was caused chiefly by (a) the large sum awarded by the jury to the sub-lessee and tenant of No. i, West Hill (coffee shop); (6) the cost of acquiring the leasehold interest in Priorsdean House (wheelwright's premises); (c) the amount of the vendor's solicitors' costs and surveyors' fees payable by the Council; and (d) the piece of surplus land between the Public Library and the Convent not yet having been disposed of. This surplus land (part of the sites of Nos. 30 and 32, West Hill) was offered for sale by public auction on two occasions, but was not sold. The approved plan showed a widening at No. 3, West Hill, but, owing to the excessive claims and to the very small strip of property required, the improvement line was re-arranged, additional land being obtained on the opposite side of the road so as to secure the full width of 60 feet without interfering with No. 3. 96. The London County Council was informed of the reasons for the excess of the actual cost over the estimated cost of the improvement, and was asked to increase the amount of its promised contribution. This application is now awaiting the -decision of the County Council. 97. The total cost of widening West Hill at the police station, in accordance with the modified scheme approved by the Council, was 3s. 3d., of which two-thirds (£49 8s. iid.) was contributed by the County Council. The total estimated cost of the improvement was £95. The saving upon the estimate was due to the work of setting back the forecourt fences, etc., costing less than was anticipated. 6o High Street, Clapham, Widening. q8. Terms have now been agreed for the purchase of all the interests proposed to be acquired in the strip of property required for widening High Street, Clapham, and arrangements are being made with the view of the improvement being effected when the leases of the premises expire in 1910. The County Council is contributing one-third of the cost Valley Road Widening. 99. The Council came to an arrangement for the widening to 40 feet of the part of Valley Road, Streatham, between Sunnyhill Road and Wellfield Road. The owner of the property on the eastern side of the road gave up the necessary land and erected a new fence to an approved give-andtake line. The paving works were executed by the Council at its own cost. Tooting Bee Rad and Upper Tooting Rad Widening 100. The total cost of widening Tooting Bec Road and Upper Tooting Road, when the Stapleton House estate was developed for building purposes, was £2,045 4s. 2d. The estimated cost of the improvement was £ 1,900. Unemployment 101. The following works, upon which unemployed workmen were engaged, were carried out in conjunction with the Central (Unemployed) Body for London, viz. :— (a) Planting trees in various parts of the Borough. (b) Alteration of gradients, Rectory Lane, Tooting, and Streatham. (c) Diversion of stream and construction of concrete vert at Garratt Park. (d) Filling in ditches and widening Tooting Bee Road, between The Avenue and the railway bridge. The estimated cost of these works was as follows, viz. : — 6i Unskilled labour. Skilled labour. Materials. Total. £ £ £ £ Planting trees 82 10 00 276 Alteration of gradients, Rectory Lane 1,122 42 243 1407 Diversion of stream and construction of concrete culvert at Garratt Park 617 107 660 1,384 Filling in ditches and widening Tooting Bee Road 828 72 1,540 2.440 Totals £ 2,649 231 2,627 5,507 102. The Council bore the expense of the materials and of the skilled labour, the Central Body defraying the cost of the unskilled labour. 103. The extension of the sewer in Rectory Lane, and the construction of additional gullies there, formed part of the Rectory Lane scheme, but the Central Body declined to undertake this work, which was executed by the Council at its own expense, the estimated cost being £360. This is not included in the statement above. 104. The Borough Council also submitted to the Central Body a scheme for the excavation of the bed of the Bell Lane Creek, the construction of a concrete embankment wall at the Council's wharf there, and the alteration of the levels of the wharf in connection therewith. The estimated cost of the work was as follows, viz.: unskilled labour, £1,447 i6s. 8d.; skilled labour, £.312 17s. 6d. ; materials, £775 14s.; contingencies, £128 11s. 10d.; total, ,£2,665. The Borough Council offered to provide the necessary materials for the work, and to pay the cost of the skilled labour, but the Local Government Board did not see their way to make a grant to the Central Body to cover the cost of the unskilled labour, and the further consideration of the matter was adjourned. 105. The Borough Council suggested to the London County Council that the work of laying out and embanking the two strips 62 of land between the River Wandle and Garratt Lane, near McMurray's paper mills, and the formation of bowling- greens at Wandsworth Park, Wandsworth Common, and Tooting Common would be suitable work for the unemployed. The County Council concurred in the first-mentioned suggestion, but declined to arrange for the provision of the proposed bowling greens. 106. As in previous years the Council executed, at a cost of about £2,000, a quantity of channelling, kerbing, etc., works, upon which the unemployed were engaged. 107. The Borough Council also lent to the Vacant Land Cultivation Society several small pieces of vacant land in various parts of the Borough for cultivation by the unemployed, and other persons of small means, under the direction of the society. Tooting Bee Boad Widening 108. After repeated applications the London County Council approved the modified proposal of the Borough Council for widening Tooting Bec Road, referred to in last year's report (page 65, paragraph 121), and consented to surrender strips of Tooting Common for this purpose, subject to a post and rail fence being provided on the southern side of the road as well as between the horse ride and the footpath on the northern side, and to the footpath on the Common, south of Tooting Bec Road, being efficiently lighted. These conditions were agreed to by the Borough Council, and, as stated above, the work was carried out in conjunction with the Central (Unemployed) ody. Blackshaw Road Improvement- i09. The widening of Blackshaw Road, Tooting-, between the Lambeth Cemetery and Tooting High Street, has been completed at a total cost of £1,480 6s. id. The estimated cost of this improvement was £1.620. Ravensbury Road and Revelstoke Road. 110. An agreement was entered into with the Wimbledon Corporation as to the maintenance of parts of Merton Road, Ravensbury Road, and Revelstoke Road, Southfield, adjoining the boundary of the Boroughs of Wandsworth and Wimbledon. Coronation Gardens. 111. Applications having been received for permission to play lawn tennis in Coronation Gardens, two courts were provided on the grass plot on the southern side of 63 the gardens. Regulations similar to those in force at Leader's Gardens were made for the use of the courts. Intercepting Traps in House Drains. 112. Towards the end of last year a Departmental Committee was appointed by the President of the Local Government Board to enquire and report with regard to the use of intercepting traps in house drains, and, at the request of the Board, the Council authorized the Borough Engineer and the Medical Officer of Health to give evidence before the committe, if desired House Refuse Removal. 113. In December last the Council again had under consideration the subject of the collection and disposal of house refuse in the Clapham, Streatham, Balham, and Tooting Wards. The work of collection was then carried out by the Council's men and carts and hired horses, the stabling accommodation being provided by the Council. Part of the refuse collected was dealt with at the Council's destructor at Tooting, the remainder being conveyed by rail to shoots in the country. Upon the recommendation of the Highways Committee the Council decided to invite tenders for carrying out the work by contract under the following schedules, viz.:— Schedule No. 1.—Collection and disposal of house refuse from the above-mentioned Wards. Schedule No. 2.—Collection of house refuse from the above-mentioned Wards, and disposal thereof, with the exception of the disposal of about 245 loads per week, to be delivered by the contractor at the dust destructor at Tooting, and to be disposed of by the Council without expense to the contractor. 114. The tenders received having been carefully considered, together with a report by the Borough Engineer as to the cost of the work during the past few years and the estimated cost during the year beginning on the 31st March last, the Committee came to the conclusion that it would be to the advantage of the Council to accept the lowest tenders under Schedule No. 2, the estimated saving being over £1,000 per annum, and the practice of sorting refuse during collection being abolished. The Council concurred in these views, and accepted the following tenders for a period of three years from the 31st March, 1909, viz.:— 64 Schedule No. 2. £ Clapham Wards Mr. J. Guyatt 9,600 Streatham Ward Mr. J. Cronk 7,200 Balham Ward Mr. J. Guyatt 4,500 Tooting Ward Mr. J. Guyatt 3,000 The necessary contracts were entered into, and the work is now being carried out in accordance therewith. 115. The Council's railway wagons, dust vans, etc., which were no longer required, were disposed of advantageously. 117. The number of interments in the Council's Cemeteries during the years ended 31st March, 1907, 1908, and Interments. 1909 respectively, was as follows :— 1907. 1908. 1909. Putney Lower Common Cemetery 32 26 22 Putney Vale Cemetery 352 334 341 Streatham Cemetery 1,642 1,644 1,6l2 Wandsworth Cemetery 2,018 1,918 1,970 Total 4,044 3,922 3,945 Hoarding Licences and Advertisements on Hoardings. 116. Having regard to objections which were made to the amount of the Council's charges for permission to advertise on hoardings erected on the public way, the general question of the licensing of these hoardings and the placing of advertisements thereon was reconsidered. After careful enquiry, the Council decided to adhere to the practice of granting licenses for a period of one month, upon payment of a fee of 5s. for each licence; and to reduce the charge in respect of advertisements one-half, i.e., from is. to 6d. per square yard per month in main streets, and from 6d. to 3d. per square yard per month in other streets. The Borough Engineer was authorized to sanction the affixing of advertisements to hoardings, if he sees no objection thereto; and directions were given for a note to be placed at the foot of the licences giving particulars of the Council's charges in the matter. 65 118. The number of grave spaces purchased during the last Grave Spaces. three years was Year ended March, 1907. Year ended March, 1908. Year ended March, 1909.

Some alterations have been made to the furniture and Chapels, Putney fitting's in the Church of England Chapel at Putney Vale Cemetery. Vale Cemetery, and new stained-glass windows provided there. These works have been carried out at the expense of the Misses Trollope, and the Council expressed its thanks to the donors for the gift. The Council has carried out some painting, etc., works, in the Nonconformist Chapel. Wandsworth Cemetery. 120. Two further plots of ground at Wandsworth Cemetery have been taken in for burials, situate between the older portion of the cemetery and the recreation ground. Soman Catholic Ground, Wandsworth Cemetery. 121. It having been found that the piece of land at Wandsworth Cemetery set aside for Roman Catholic burials was becoming filled, the Council, with the sanction of the Secretary of State, has allotted a further piece of land for such burials. Randsworth Cemetery. 122. A large shelter has been erected at the entrance to Wandsworth Cemetery, and a new water closet and urinal for men has also been provided. Extension of Cemeteries. 123. The subject of acquiring additional land for burials, to meet future requirements, has been under consideration. Two proposals were before the Council, one for the extension of Streatham Cemetery, and the other for the extension of Putney Vale Cemetery. With regard to the Streatham proposal it was found that only a small area would be available for burials, and the price of the land was considered to be too high. The Council eventually decided to purchase, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, 15 acres of land (at £400 per acre) adjoining Putney Vale Cemetery, and a provisional agreement for purchase has been entered into. 66 125. The number of bathers, admissions to the gymnasium, and the income since the opening of the baths in - High Street, Wandsworth, in July, 1901, are as follows :— Income. Year. Bathers. Gymnasium.

Swimming Championship Trophy. 127. The competition for the swimming trophy presented by Sir William Lancaster, J.P., L.C.C., and competed for annually by men resident in the Borough, was held on the 16th September, at the annual entertainment of the Church Institute Swimming Club; entries were received and the trophy was won by Mr. E. F. Ellis. Sir William Lancaster again gave a prize for the winner, as a memento of the occasion, and the Mayor (Alderman Lorden) provided prizes for Mr. Jas. Symons and Mr. A. J. M. Owen, who finished second and third respectively. Women's Medal. 128. The competition for the medal for women residing in the Borough, presented by the late Mr. John Bell, J.P., was held on the 24th September, at the annual 67 entertainment of the ladies' section of the Wandsworth Swimming Club, and was won by Miss N. Treversh. Swimming Competitions for School Children. 129. The Council decided, as an encouragement to children to learn swimming, to arrange competitions and to award a free pass to the second-class bath, available during the following year, to the successful boy or girl from each school attending the baths for instruction in swimming, the passes to be available out of school hours and before seven o'clock in the evening. The competitions were held at the baths on the 23rd October, and were largely attended by children and their parents. Sir William Lancaster, J.P., L.C.C., kindly presided. There are 62 schools in the Borough, 29 departments send pupils to the baths for instruction in swimming, and of these 26 entered for the competitions. The number of children taking part in the competitions was 136—68 boys and 68 girls. Proposed Alterations at the Wandsworth Baths. no. The subject of the use of the first-class swimming bath during the winter season, which, when floored over, has been used as a gymnasium, has been further considered. The building has been let on several occasions during the past winter for a poultry show and whist drives, and for certain purposes appears to supply a want, where the Town Hall would not be available or a less expensive hall is required.

General Report on Testing of Gas supplied (I) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company; (2) by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company, during the year ended March 31st, 1909. Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company. During the whole of this year, ended March 31st, 1909, in accordance with instructions which I received from the Council, and which came into force on July 1st, 1907, I have tested the gas supplied by this Company on two days weekly at irregular intervals, and have occasionally made extra tests, instead of making daily tests as I had previously done from October, 1903, to June, 1907. The Tables appended, showing averages of illuminating power sulphur and pressure, and the curves (in Table III.), indicating the fluctuations of the first two, are therefore based on these less frequent testings. The times of testing, however, are still those laid down by the somewhat antiquated Gas Works Clauses Act, 1871 (with an extension of one hour in advance of those times by special arrangement with the Company in 1906), viz., from April to September inclusive, between 8.0 and 11.0 p.m., and from October to March inclusive, between 5.0 and 10.0 p.m. I mention this point as I understand that some members of the Council are of opinion that the gas, like other Metropolitan gas, should be tested at all reasonable times; an opinion which I have frequently urged in the past, with only slight success so far. Another reason for reviving this contention is the possibility that at some future date the Council might desire to make tests of the calorific power, and it is generally felt that, as regards these, no limit as to time of testing would be reasonable; since gas ntay be used for heating and other purposes at any time of the day or night. I will refer to this point later in connection with recent legislation. Wandsworth Borough Council. Table III, showing Weekly Averages of Illuminating Power and Sulphur of Gas supplied by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company from bi-weekly testings at Disraeli Road, Putney from April l?t 1908. to March 1909. 137 Illuminating Power. The illuminating power has varied much as usual between 14.5 and 15.5 candles, seldom being lower than I4.5 and occasionally only somewhat higher than 15.5 candles, with a general average of 14.9 candles, for the year ended March 31st, 1909. The statutory limit is 14.0 candles. Table I. shows the monthly averages, and in Table III. a curve is given showing the weekly fluctuations in the illuminating power. Tests with flat-flame burners have not been made, and it may be remarked that the use of this form of burner is becoming rapidly less as time goes on. Sulphur. The average amount of sulphur (other than sulphuretted hydrogen) in the gas has considerably increased during the year ended March 31st, 1909, being 29.5 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas, as compared with an average of 25.6 grains for the previous year. Table I. shows the monthly averages of this constituent of the gas, and indicates a variation between 22 8 grains (March, 1909), and 39.7 grains (July, 1908). In Table III. a curve is drawn which indicates the fluctuations of sulphur from week to week. From this Table it will be seen that the highest amounts occurred between July and October, 1908 (the average for these four months being 35 grains) the maximum point (43.9 grains) being reached during the week ending July 25th, 1908. During the last five months of the year ended 31st March, 1909, however, it decreased, the average from November, 1908, to March, 1909, being only 25.4 grains. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. There has been no sulphuretted hydrogeu found in the gas at any testing, during the year ended March 31st, 1909. Pressure. From Table I., which shows the monthly averages of pressure based on bi-weekly observations, it will be seen that these averages have varied between 2.4 inches (December, 1908) and 3.2 inches (July, 1908), the general average for the whole year ended March 31st, 1909, being 2.8 inches. I made a special Report to the Council on the subject of pressure, in December, 1908. 138 Calorific Power and recent Legislation. Tests of the calorific power of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company's gas have not hitherto been made, as it was felt by the Council that they would prefer to await the results of tests made by the London County Council which were commenced in January, 1906. Since that date, daily tests have been made of the calorific power of the gas supplied by the Metropolitan Gas Companies, and it is considered that the time has now arrived when a standard calorific power can safely be fixed. The increasing use of gas for heating and cooking, for small fuel purposes in certain manufactories, for motor power, and especially also for illuminating purposes in incandescent burners, coupled with the steadily decreasing use of flat-flame burners, all tend to emphasise the importance of testing the calorific power of gas. Although from experiments made, there seems to be, so far, no very clearly defined relation between calorific power and illuminating power, it would appear that, ceteris paribus, a gas of high calorific power will give a greater illumination than one of lower calorific power. As a practical outcome of long continued experiments, a clause has been inserted by agreement, after conference between the Gas Light and Coke Company and the London County Council (in a Bill which has recently passed the Committee stage of the House of Commons, authorising the acquisition of the undertaking of the West Ham Gas Company by the Gas Light and Coke Company), fixing the standard of calorific power at 125 calories net (see Miuutes of Proceedings, L.C.C., March 23rd, 1909, p. 672). It is also generally agreed that the calorific power, if tested at all, should be tested at all reasonable times, since the gas may be used for heating and other purposes both by day and night. Mitch am and Wimbledon Gas Company. As pointed out in my last Annual Report on Gas Testings made during the year ended March 31st, 1908, the testings of the gas supplied by this Company at the new testing place in Haydon's Road, South Wimbledon, instead of at the Works of the Company as heretofore, commenced in January, 1908, in accordance with the Mitcham 139 and Wimbledon Gas Act, 1907, and have since been there continued during the whole of the year ended March 31st, 1909. Illuminating Power. The standard illuminating power is 14.0 caudles, but the testings have indicated, on the whole, a much higher figure. Thus Table II., which gives the results of all fortnightly testings made, shows the yearly average to be 16.0 candles, while the lowest result indicated is 14.9 candles. The pressure has varied between 2.6 and 4.2 inches, with a Pressure. general average of 3.3 inches. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. There has been no sulphuretted hydrogen found in the gas at any testing during the year ended March 31st, 1909. H. Wilson Hake, Ph.D., Gas Examiner. 140 TABLE I.

I have not audited the Capital Funds shown in the Accounts as £108,687 17s. 2d. Stocks valued at ,£107,438 0s 7d., and held by the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds—the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds being a Department of the Government. The Official Trustees have given me a Certificate certifying that on December 31st, 1908, such sum of £ 108,687 17s. 2d. Stocks was held by them in trust tor the Weir Hospital Charity, and I certify that the Dividends received from the Stocks held by the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds have all been brought into the Accounts of the Charity. In my opinion the Balance Sheet is properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the Charity's affairs according to the information given to me, and as shown by the books of the Charity, and the investments set out correctly represent the Capital of the Trust Funds after the sale of £6,1o6 18s. 9d.

The particulars entered on the Record Papers were investigated and verified by personal visits to the homes of the applicants by the investigators, and references as to character were obtained from previous employers. No personal investigations were made outside the Borough. Classification. The Sub-Committee considered the completed Record Papers and classified the applications into four divisions :— Preference, Eligible, Ineligible, and Disqualified. In recommending applicants to the Central Body as suitable for employment, migration, or emigration, the Sub-Committee gave preference to men of good character, and distinguished as far as possible, between the habitual "out of work," and the applicant who was unemployed through trade depression, or kindred causes. Payment of Wages. The wages of the men from this Borough employed on the Non-Colony Works were paid on Saturday morning at the Office of the Committee; the week's work being from Monday morning to Friday night. The rate of wages was 6d. per hour. Family Allowance- The men sent to the Working Colonies receive 6d. per week, in addition to their board and lodging, a weekly allowance being made to the family on the following scale :—10s. to the wife, 2s. for the first child under 14, is. 6d. for the second child under 14, and is. for each other child under 14 years; but in no case was 17s. 6d. to be exceeded. The allowances are paid at the homes of the men on Wednesdays. The men are allowed a furlough at the end of each month, their fares being paid for them.

Number of such applicants submitted and approved and given work—7. 192 Effect of the Provision of Work. The effect produced upon those who obtained work, through the medium of the Distress Committee, varied according to the character of the applicant. In the case of those anxious to work and keep their homes together it was noticeable that after a week's wages, when nourishing food had been obtained, they gradually improved in efficiency. Advantages of Colony Work. Colony work has the advantage of fresh air and healthy surroundings, and of removing men from many local temptations. For various reasons, a number of applicants have declined to leave their homes for any period, preferring to wait for local employment. Experience in Administering the Act. In administering the Act the Committee found reason to believe that a false impression was created amongst the unemployed, who, after having had the enquiry forms filled up and having received visits from the Investigators as to the correctness of the statements, felt that work was certain. As only 425 out of 1,756 applicants obtained 9 weeks' work, the disappointed balance lost confidence in the usefulness of the Act, and to some extent also in those administering it. The impression that work was coming also slackened their efforts to obtain employment elsewhere. Volunteers. The Committee has not availed itself of the services of additonal voluntary workers. Preliminary Investigation. The Committee had referred to them before investigation all cases where there appeared to be a technical disqualification, and if the applicant did not comply with the regulations issued by the Local Government Board no further action was taken. Applications from single men and married men without families were not investigated, unless the application was for Emigration. 193 The foregoing remarks are the same in substance as those made last year. An additional year's experience confirms the opinions of the Committee then expressed. ALEX. GLEGG, Chairman. PERCIVAL REES, Vice-Chairman.

The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the TwentySecond Annual Report on the work of the Clapham Library. The number of books issued during the year was 125,278 in the Lending Library and 6,198 in the Reference Library (exclusive of books in open cases), being a total issue of 131,476 volumes, and a daily average issue of 539 volumes. These figures are much higher than those for any year since the library was opened, and show an increase of issues of 17,631 volumes over the previous year, and a daily average increase of 78 volumes issued. The number of books now in stock is 18,198, of which 14,820 are in the Lending Library and 3,378 in the Reference Library. Advantage has been taken of the preparation of a new catalogue of works of fiction and juvenile literature (to be published in the forthcoming summer) to weed out a number of obsolete and worn-out books. 3,973 readers' ordinary tickets (including renewals) and 947 students' tickets were issued during the year. The issue of students' tickets has been very successful, and, no doubt, accounts to some extent for the large increase in the number of books taken out. The Sub-Committee desire to express their cordial thanks to the various donors of books, periodicals, pictures, etc., during the past year. The Sub-Committee regret that, owing to the theft of several books from the open cases in the Reference Library, they have been reluctantly compelled to discontinue placing books on shelves accessible to the public. 199 The Borough Council in November, 1908, appointed the Mayor (Councillor Dawnay), Alderman Bulcraig, and Councillors Cundall, Downer, Law, Monday, and Richardson, as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1909. Alderman Bulcraig was elected chairman, and a vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Downer for his services as chairman during the previous year. Councillor W. E. Law, a member of the Sub-Committee, died on :8th March, and the Committee passed a sincere vote of condolence with the family. The only change in the staff was the appointment of H. Hetherington as a junior assistant in February. The Sub-Committee desire to express their entire satisfaction with the excellent manner in which the Librarian and his Staff have performed their duties, and especially with the services of the assistants during the absence, through illness, of Mr. Welch, in November and December last.

BRADLEY. 206 REPORT OF THE PUTNEY LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE,. For the Year ended 31ST March, 1909. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the twenty-first annual report of the library. In December, 1908, Alderman Parker, Councillors Hoile, Jackson and Mathias were appointed by the Borough Council to act as the Sub-Committee for the year 1909. At the first meeting Alderman Parker was re-elected chairman for the year. The issue of the quarterly list of additions to the libiary hasbeen discontinued. A catalogue key to the indicator for classes F & J has been issued and has proved useful to many readers. The Sub-Committee take this opportunity of thanking all who* have furthered the usefulness and interest of the institution by the gifts of books or otherwise. The special thanks of the Sub Committee has been accorded to Mr. George Allen for his generous gift of an oil painting of old Putney Bridge; and to Sir W. J. Lancaster, J.P., for his gift of a water colour drawing of Putney Church. A list of donors will be found on page 211. The Finance Committee passed estimates of expenditure amounting to £1,265, and during the year this sum has been expended. Lending Department. During the year there has been an increase in the stock of this department of 642 volumes, 635 of which were added by purchase, and seven volumes by donation. The total number of volumes now available for issue is 10,816. Notwithstanding these additions to the stock, the Sub-Committee regrets to report that there is a slight decrease in the number of volumes issued for home reading. During the year 791 volumes have been rebound, 320 worn-out books have been replaced by new copies, while 71 obsolete books have been withdrawn from the stock. On March 31st, 2,145 boirowers' tickets, and 134 students' tickets were available for use in this department. 207 Reference Department. The books in this department are shelved in open cases, and readers have free access to the books, a privilege which is highly appreciated by the residents of Putney. The department is also used by many persons residing in the neighbouring districts. No records are kept of the books consulted, but it is estimated that upwards of 150 readers use the room daily. During the year 43 volumes have been added to the department, making the total stock at present 2,350 volumes. Magazine Rooms. These rooms continue to be used by a large number of readers, and it is very unusual to be able to find a chair vacant after 7 p.m. Thirty-eight monthly magazines and reviews, five quarterlies, and 49 weekly periodicals are placed in these rooms. The magazines and reviews are transferred to the lending department at the end of the month, where they are in great demand for home reading. News Room. The list of newspapers, &c., provided in this room includes 31 daily newspapers, among which are Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Manchester, and Plymouth daily journals, 56 weekly newspapers and periodicals and 52 monthly and quarterly publications. The Sub-Committee again have much pleasure 111 recording their satisfaction with the work of the Librarian and his staff. Tables of information relating to the issues of books, classification of stock, &c., will be found on pages 209 and 210.

In presenting their report for the year ended 31st March, 1909, the Sub-Committee have pleasure in stating that the Streatham, Balham, and Tooting Libraries continue to be extensively used in every department. The Tooting Public Library having become too small for the needs of the district Sir William J. Lancaster, J.P., L.C.C., most kindly supplemented his gift of five years ago by adding another storey to the building, and made such alterations and additions as were necessary for adapting the whole of the ground floor to Lending and Reference library purposes. The enlarged building, which is handsomely furnished throughout in oak, was formally handed over to the Borough Council on November 30th, 1908. It comprises—entrance hall, lending library, reference department, librarian's and staff rooms on the ground floor ; and a spacious well-lighted newsroom and two magazine rooms on the first floor. All the rooms are laid with oak block flooring, and are lighted throughout by means of electricity, the fittings being of special design. The new Lending Department is provided with bookcases toaccommodate 11,000 volumes, with room for further additions. In the planning, furnishing, and equipment of the building everything has been provided that would in any way conduce to the comfort of readers or promote the efficieut administration of the Institution. During the alterations and enlargement of the building the work of the library was carried on during four months at the Boys' School,. Church Lane. Books Issued. The number of books issued at the three libraries was. 416,333, an increase of 12,379 on last year's return. 217 This is the highest aggregate issue for one year since the establishment of the libraries :— The Tate Library, Streatham 183,675 Balham Public Library 156,004 * Tooting Public Library 76,6S4 Total 416,333 It is also gratifying to record the increasing use which is made of the more educative and technical sections of the libraries. • This is particularly noticeable at the Tate Library where the issue of books for home reading in the classes of literature other than Fiction and Juvenile Literature numbered 43,853 volumes. The number of books issued in the several classes of literature at each library is given in the following table :— CLASSIFICATION OF BOOKS ISSUED. Class. The Tate Library, Streatham.

A General Subject-Catalogue of the books in the Balham Library was published in October. The Card Catalogues at each Library have been revised, and the usual supplementary and other lists issued at intervals during the year. Attention has also been given to the preparation of Subject-Catalogues for the Streatham and Tooting Libraries. Beading Booms. The iucreased accommodation provided at the Tooting Library, by the liberality of Sir William J. Lancaster, has relieved the crowding which frequently occurred there at busy times of the day. The rooms are supplied with a comprehensive selection of the leading newspapers and periodicals, and the large number of readers who constantly use the departments is an indication of their great popularity and usefulness. A list of the papers and magazines provided at each library is appended. See pages 224-229. Library Cash Beceipts. The following is a statement of the receipts from the sale of catalogues, fines, etc., at the three libraries:— £ s. d. The Tate Library, Streatham 142 14 7 Balham Public Library 82 3 1 Tooting Public Library 46 5 0 Total £271 2 8 Donors. A list of the Donors of books, etc., during the past year is given on page 223. The Sub-Committee desire specially to thank the Misses Lancaster, of Putney Hill, for their very kind gift of a graudfather's clock for the Tooting Public Library. The work of altering and completing the basement at the Balham Library was carried out -during the summer months. By these improvements ample room for storage and other purposes has now been provided at this library. 221 The increasing work at the Tate Library, combined with the difficulties arising from the present insufficient accommodation, will necessitate, at an early date, an extension of the building. The SubCommittee regret, however, that in consequence of the limitation of their funds, it will be impossible at present, without seriously curtailing the amount required annually for the purchase of books, to make such additions as are necessary for the growing requirements of the district, so as to increase still further the usefulness of this institution. The Sub-Committee are pleased to express their appreciation of the satisfactory and efficient manner in which the Librarian and his Staff have discharged their duties during the past year.

Librarian in-charge at Allfarthing Lane Branch Library: G. R. GATLAND. f 232 REPORT OF THE WANDSWORTH SUB-COMMITTEE For the Year ending 31st March, 1909. The Sub-Committee have again to report a most satisfactory increase in the issue of books, the number for the three libraries being 153,095, as compared with 137,762 in the year 1907-8—an increase of over 11 per cent, in the year and 82 per cent, since the Council took over the Library in 1901-2. It is especially gratifying to find that the Branch in Earlsfield, where from 1899 till 1904 no public library facilities existed, has increased its issue of books from 9,659 in 1907-8 to 15,193 in the past year—an increase of over 56 per cent. Eight books were stolen from the libraries by a man who had taken over 100 volumes from public libraries in or near London, and who was caught at Croydon and sentenced to six weeks imprisonment. Two sections of the Cotgreave Indicator, one for 4,000 and one for 2,000, have been purchased and placed—the former at West Hill and the latter at Allfarthing Lane. Vacant situations boards have been fixed outside the libraries at West Hill and Allfarthing Lane for the display of advertisements from the Daily Chronicle, Daily News, Daily Telegraph, and The Times, also for lists sent by the Wandsworth Employment Exchange. Boards have also been fixed, by consent of the Council, on their property in Magdalen Road and Pirbright Road. In consideration of exhibiting the advertisements of vacant situations, the proprietors of the Daily Telegraph present three copies of their paper daily, and those of The Times two copies daily. An agreement with the Metropolitan Water Board has been entered into in place of the old one with the late Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company. A clock has been purchased and fixed in the Earlsfield Branch Library. The only change in the staff has been caused by the resignation of R. Cruttenden, who has entered the service of the London County Council. A. Freeman has been appointed in his place. 233 The Sub-Committee desire to thank those who have kindly presented books, periodicals, &c., to the Libraries. A list of donors will be found below. The Sub-Committee are glad to state that the librarian and his assistants have ably and efficiently discharged their duties during the year. On behalf of the Sub-Committee, W. J. HARRISON, Chairman.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1908. Population. The population of the Borough as estimated by the Registrar General was, in the middle of 1908, 289,506, an increase of 8,087 compared with 1907, but this estimate, in my opinion, is much under the actual population. The population on which all the rates in this Report are calculated has been obtained in a similar manner to that adopted in 1905, 1906, and 1907, by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Census, 1901, by the number of rated hereditaments in that year. The factor thus obtained represents the number of persons per rated hereditament, by which the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1908 is multiplied. b 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The population for the purposes of the Equalisation of Rates Act was estimated in 1906 as 296,020, in 1907, 308,663, and in 1908, 318,603, these populations being calculated from the number of rated houses. Table I. shows the population of each Ward and the number of rated hereditaments in 1901, the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1908 and the estimated population. TABLE I. Ward.

The estimated uncorrected population for 1907 was 325,850, and in 1908 335,500, or an increase of 9,650, while the corrected population was, in 1907 320,120, and in 1908 329,700. The corrected population in Table II. is used to calculate the rates in this Report. The difference between the corrected and uncorrected population is made up by the population in the Public Institutions of /the Borough, which are as follows:— Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putney:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham:—St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish.) Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tooting:—Tooting Home. Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals — The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. Wandsworth:—The Workhouse. Royal Hospital for Incurables. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). H.M. Prison. The total population of these Institutions was about 6,300, but as a proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to this Borough, a deduction of 5,800 made from the uncorrected total population gives, approximately, the corrected population, viz.:—329,700, compared with 320,120 in 1907, 310,310 in 1906, and 285,910 in 1905. Births. During the 53 weeks ending the 2nd January, 1909, 7,33r Dirths, 3,741 of males and 3,590 of females, were registered, compared with 7,036 in 1907, 7,057 in 1906, and 6,892 in 1905. The total number of births registered in this Borough was 7,321, but 80 births occurred in Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough, and 70 births in Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, making a corrected total of 7,331. In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough. 9 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In Clapham, Streatham and Wandsworth the rates were lower than in 1907, while the rate for the whole Borough was .17 per 1,000 lower, and was the lowest yet recorded. The lowest birth-rate was in Putney, where it was only 17.67, and the highest in Tooting, viz.:—33.65. 11 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the decennial average the birth-rate in all the sub-districts, with the exception of Tooting, and also in the whole Borough, was lower. In Clapham it was 4.18, in Putney 3.57, in Streatham 2.86, and in Wandsworth 4.33 lower, while in Tooting it was 2.10 higher. The birth-rate for the whole of London was 25.82 per 1,000, compared with 25.68 in 1907, 26.6 in 1906, 27.0 in 1905, and 28.14 the decennial average; while for England and Wales the rate was 26.5, compared with 26.3 in 1907, 27.0 in 1906, 27.2 in 1905, and 28.10 the decennial average. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths was 11.98, compared with 11.30 in 1907, 11.59 in 1906, and 12.50 in 1905. Owing to the low death-rate during the year 1908, the rate of natural increase is higher than in the two previous years. Compared with the decennial average there has been a fall in the crude birth-rate of 12.2 per cent., compared with 12.27 per cent. in 1907, but as the changes in the age and sex population have been marked, it is therefore necessary to calculate the proportion of births to the number of possible mothers, or the total number of women living in the Borough at ages 15 to 45. In the year 1901 this rate was 88.6 per 1,000, while in 1907 it was only 74, and in 1908, 73; while for the whole of London the rate for 1906 was 97.5, and for 1907, 94.1. The legitimate birth-rate, calculated on the married female population was, in 1901, 215 per 1,000, and in 1908, 174; while for the whole of London it was, in 1907, 201.7, and for the five years 1902-06, 217.2. These rates are only approximately correct, and necessarily so, as all estimates of sections of the population become less reliable as the interval from the last Census increases. 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 155 births occurred in the Workhouse, nine of these belonging to Clapham, six to Putney, 23 to Streatham, 10 to Tooting, 38 to Wandsworth, 63 to Battersea, and six to other places. Of these 155 births 93 were illegitimate, and of these four belonged to Clapham, six to Putney, 17 to Streatham, six to Tooting, 15 to Wandsworth, 41 to Battersea, and four to other places. In the Borough, with the exception of the Workhouse, 129 illegitimate births were registered, 30 in Clapham, 13 in Putney, 23 in Streatham, 25 in Tooting, and 38 in Wandsworth. One illegitimate birth occurred in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum. The total number of illegitimate births was 177, 34 of which belonged to Clapham, 19 to Putney, 40 to Streatham, 31 to Tooting, and 53 to Wandsworth, compared with 189 in 1907, 203 in 1906, and 165 in 1905. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2.41, compared with 2.68 in 1907, 2.87 in 1906, 2.4 in 1905, and 3.7 for the whole of London for 1907. The following Table shows the percentage of illegitimate births to total births for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and for the two previous years. 1906. 1907. 1908.[/### Clapham 3.0 2.7 2.45 Putney 1.6 2.8 3.42 Streatham 2.8 2.5 2.08 Tooting 3.7 3.2 2.88 Wandsworth 2.8 2.5 2.20 Whole Borough 2.87 2.68 2.41 13 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Deaths. During the 53 weeks ending the 2nd January, 1909, 3,230 deaths, 1,560 of males and 1,670 of females, were registered in the Borough, compared with 3,337 in 1907, 3,341 in 1906, and 3,241 in 1905. The total number of deaths is 107 less than in 1907, and 872 less than the decennial average corrected for increase of population. A still larger decrease in the number of deaths has occurred if the number of deaths be corrected for the additional week included in 1908. The total number of deaths after correction was 169 less than in 1907, and 934 less than the corrected decennial average. It is important to note that all the rates per 1,000 for the year 1908 should be reduced by the fraction 3/3 6/7 4/1 so as to compare more exactly with the rates in previous years. The uncorrected death-rate for the Borough was 9.63 per 1,000, compared with 10.24 in 1907, 10.57 in 1906, and 11.12 in 1905. The average for the decennium 1898-1907 was 12.21, or 2.58 above the rate for the year 1908. In the separate sub-districts this rate shows considerable variation, in Streatham the rate being only 7.17, while in Tooting it was 24.16. The reason for this high rate in Tooting is that in that sub-district there are a large number of Public Institutions, as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting Home, and Tooting Bee Asylum, where persons from other localities are received, and among whom the mortality is very high. 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Out-lying Institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The total number of deaths for the 53 weeks, corrected for both internal and external Institutions was 3,380, compared with 3,416 in 1907, 3,461 in 1906, 3,320 in 1905, 3,417 in 1904, 3,023 in 1903, 3,328 in 1902, 3,130 in 1901, and 4,209, the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The number of corrected deaths for the 53 weeks of the past year was less than the number of deaths in the 52 weeks of 1907. During the year 731 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 87 in other places not institutions in the Borough. Of these 818,633 deaths were of persons not belonging and 185 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table V. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table VI. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table VII. of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred. 15 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the Middlesex County Asylum the deaths were 22 less, in the Tooting Bee Asylum six more, in the Hostel of God three less, in the Tooting Home 15 more, in the Fever Hospitals 32 less, in the Workhouse 15 more, in the Prison the same, in the Royal Hospital for Incurables the same, in St. Anne's Home five more, in the Priory two more, and in other places 30 more, compared with the year 1907. 16 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the deaths in other places not Public Institutions 15 occurred in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 28 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 16 in Wandsworth. Table VI. shows the deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, arranged as to ages, causes of death, and Institution in which the death occurred. The greatest number of deaths was due to Old Age, and of the 156 registered, 109 occurred in Tooting Bee Asylum, and 21 in the Tooting Home. In the Middlesex County Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, Bright's disease, and all other causes, which include all diseases of the nervous system. In Tooting Bee Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, Old Age, Bright's disease, Cancer, and all other causes; in the Hostel of God from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, and diseases of the Respiratory Organs. In the Fever Hospitals, one death occurred from Measles, 46 from Scarlet Fever, compared with 49 in 1907, 27 from Diphtheria, compared with 45, one from other forms of Tuberculosis, one from Developmental diseases, and two from all other causes. 17 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the next Table the number of deaths in Institutions outside the Borough is given in detail, but a complete list of these Institutions with the number of deaths that occurred in each during the year, is given after Table I. of the Local Government Board's Tables. As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other parishes in the Borough in Institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in Internal Institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham, the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, the Tooting Bee Asylum, and the Royal Hospital for Incurables. The three deaths in the Prison, all of which were due to Tubercular diseases, were of persons described in the Registrar's returns as homeless, but in all probability they did not actually belong to this Borough. 21 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of deaths in out-lying Institutions was 783, 432 of males and 351 of females, compared with 739 in 1907, 731 in 1906, and 689 in 1905. 326 of these deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary, compared with 376 in 1907, 433 in General and Special Hospitals, 68 of which occurred in Public Lunatic or Imbecile Asylums, compared with 357 in 1907, and 14 in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, compared with six in 1907. Of the 433 deaths in General and Special Hospitals, 69 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, 43 in Bolingbroke Hospital, 24 in Belgrave Hospital, 18 in Victoria Hospital, 18 in St. George's Hospital, 15 in Westminster Hospital, 15 in Guy's Hospital, 15 in Horton Asylum, 12 in Banstead Asylum, 12 in Charing- Cross Hospital, and nine in Cane Hill Asylum. The number of deaths in these and other Institutions outside the Borough is shown on Table XII. The corrected number of deaths after adding the deaths of persons belonging to the Borough and subtracting those of persons dying in the Borough and not belonging thereto, was 3,380, 1,669 °f males and 1,711 of females, a decrease of 36 compared with 1907, and a decrease of 829 compared with the corrected •decennial average. The corrected death-rate for the year was 10.25, compared with 10.67 in 1907, 11.15 in 1906, 11.6i in 1905, 12.93 in 1904, 12.24 in 1903, 13.43 in 1902, and 15.33 in 1901. Corrected for the additional week included in the year 1908, the number of deaths was 3,315, and the death-rate 10.05 Per 1,000. Table IX. shows the total number of deaths and the deathrates for each sub-district and for the whole Borough, corrected and uncorrected for deaths in Public Institutions. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 14.75 Per 1,000, compared with 14.55 in 1907, 15,07 in 1906, 15,1 in 1905, i6.10 in 1904, 15.6 in 1903, and 17.2 in 1902. 23 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate in England and Wales in 1908 was 14.7 per 1,000, compared with 15.0 in 1907, 15.4 in 1906, 16.2 in 1905, and 16.2 in 1904; in the 76 Great Towns 14.9, compared with 15.4; and in the 142 Smaller Towns 14.o, compared with 14.5. If a comparison is to be made with other places it is necessary to again correct the corrected rate, viz. :—10.25, for age and sex distribution. This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained by dividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales, at the Census of 1901, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period. This factor has been ascertained to be 1.0547, which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1908 of 10.81 per 1,000, compared with 11.25 in 1907, 11.76 in 1906, 12.24 in 1905, 13.6o in 1904, 12.87 in 1903, and 14.00 in 1902. The following Table shows the standard death-rate, the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected death-rate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29 Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1908. The figures are extracted from the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar General for the year. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 25 TABLE X. AREA. Standard Death-rate. Factor for Correction.

In the separate sub-districts of the Borough the corrected death-rate was lowest in Streatham, viz. :—9.01, and highest in Tooting, viz. :—12.14. With the exception of Clapham the rate for the 53 weeks of 1908 was lower in all the sub-districts than the rate for the 52 weeks of 1907. The greatest reduction occurred in Tooting, where the rate for 1907 was 13.25 and in 1908 12.14 per 1,000. The rates in this Table do not agree with the rates in Table XI., as the rates in the latter Table are calculated on the total population without deducting the population of non-parishioners in Public Institutions in the Borough. The first Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough for each fortnight compared with the average for the quinquennium 19031907. This Chart shows that only on three occasions was the rate higher, viz. :—the first and second fortnights of February, and the first fortnight of March. In May, June, July, August, September and October the fortnightly rates were much under the quinquennial average, in the first fortnight of August the rate having been only 6.80 per 1,000, compared with 10.52, the quinquennial' average. On only one occasion, viz. :—in the first fortnight of February was the rate above 14 per 1,000, while on 15 occasions the rate was under 10 per 1,000. The next Chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 during the 53 weeks of the year for the whole of London and for each fortnight for the whole Borough. During the whole year the rate was under the rate for the whole of London, and this was specially the case in the first five months of the year, and also in the months of October and November.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 2 7 In London and in this Borough there was only a slight increase in the months of August and September, due to the number of deaths of infants from Diarrhoeal diseases. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the 10 preceding years; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various sub-districts. It also shows these for each year since 1898, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last 10 years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to hospital. Table IV. is the General Mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. 28 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. TABLE XVI. Sub-Districts. Under 1 year. 1 to 5 years. 5 to 15 years. 15 to 25 years. 25 to 65 years. 65 years and upwards Clapham 18.81 7.88 2.90 2.77 37.49 30.15 Putney 17.48 5.18 2.59 3.23 34.95 36.57 Streatham 16.79 7.37 1.19 6.07 37.16 31.42 Tooting 34.47 13.95 3.68 3.42 25.79 18.69 Wandsworth 23.35 8.81 3.63 3.06 35.02 26.13 Whole Borough 21.31 8.46 2.72 3.87 35.09 28.55 Compared with 1907 the percentage of deaths under one year was .38 higher, due to the slight increase in the number of deaths of infants from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis; from one to five years .35 lower; from five to 15 years 1.11 lower; from 15 to 25 years .12 higher; from 25 to 65 years 2.80 higher; and from 65 years and upwards 1.84 lower. There was a considerable diversity in these rates in the different sub-districts. In Streatham the rate under one year was only 16.79, while in Tooting it was 34.47, while over 65 years of age Tooting has a rate of 18.69 and Putney of 36.57. Again, at from one to five years the rate was still high in Tooting and low in Putney, and also at ages five to 15 and 15 to 25 years, while at ages 25 to 65 and over 65 the Tooting rate was much lower and was the lowest of the five sub-districts. 34 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. As stated in previous reports, these differences are due to the difference in age distribution and social conditions in the subdistricts. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year was 720, compared with 715 in 1907, 874 in 1906, 818 in 1905, 851 in 1904, and 743 in 1903. Of these, 136 occurred in Clapham, 54 in Putney, 155 in Streatham, 131 in Tooting, and 244 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality, or deaths under one year to 1,000 births was 98, compared with 101 in 1907, 125 in 1906, 118 in 1905, 123 in 1904, and 110 in 1903. This rate was 98 in Clapham, compared with 90 in 1907 and 124 the decennial average; 97 in Putney, compared with 109 and 125; 80 in Streatham, compared with 88 and 112; 122 in Tooting, compared with 148 and 152; and 101 in Wandsworth, compared with 97 and 133. In the whole Borough the rate was 3 per 1,000 births under that for 1907, and 28 under the decennial average. The rate in 1908 was much lower than any rate ever recorded, and in each sub-district it shows a marked diminution as compared with the decennial average, in Putney showing a difference of 38, and in Wandsworth of 32 per 1,000, compared with that average. The following Table shows the number of deaths, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year and for the three previous years for each sub-district and for the whole Borough.

The Tables which follow are inserted at the request of the Local Government Board and show in detail the deaths of infants under one year, arranged in monthly age periods and from certain diseases. Table XIX. shows the deaths in the whole Borough and the six following Tables the deaths in each registration sub-district. The total number of births was 7,331, of which 7,154 were legitimate and 177 illegitimate, and the total deaths 720, 653 legitimate and 67 illegitimate. There were five deaths from the notifiable diseases, one from Scarlet Fever and four from Diphtheria. One of the deaths from Diphtheria occurred in Clapham, one in Tooting, and two from Diphtheria and one from Scarlet Fever in the Springfield sub-district. 14 deaths occurred from Measles, 25 from Whooping Cough, 148 from Diarrhoeal diseases, 290 from Wasting diseases, 26 from Tubercular diseases, 134 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, eight from Meningitis, seven from Syphilis, and 68 from other causes. Compared with 1907, there has been an increase in the number of deaths from the notifiable diseases, from Diarrhoeal diseases, Wasting diseases, and Tubercular diseases, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Measles, Whooping Cough, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, Meningitis, and other causes. In all the deaths, with three exceptions, two in Putney and one in Streatham, the cause of death was certified by a medical man or by a coroner after inquest. 32'6 per cent. of the deaths occurred in the first month, compared with 33.7 in 1907 and 32.03 in 1906; 55" 1 per cent. in the first three months, compared with 53 and 51.7; and 77.7 in the first six months, compared with 73 and 72.6. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 37 The Table also shows that 290, or 40,3 per cent, of the deaths occurred from Wasting diseases, and of these 181, or 62.4 per cent. occurred under one month. Of the total deaths under one month, viz. 235, 181 or 77 per cent. occurred from Wasting diseases, compared with 74 per cent. in 1907. From Diarrhoeal diseases only 13 deaths occurred under one month. The greatest mortality from these diseases occurred at two to three months. From Tubercular diseases 26 deaths occurred, compared with 19 in 1907, 42 in 1906, and 34 in 1905 ; and from diseases of the Respiratory Organs 134, compared with 158, 112 and 136. Eight deaths were registered as due to Meningitis, but enquiries of the medical attendant showed that these were due to Posterior-basic Meningitis with two exceptions, both occurring in hospital, where the deaths were registered as having occurred from Cerebro-spinal Meningitis.

The preceding Table shows approximately the proportion of deaths per 1,000 births for each week under one month, and for each month to one year of age, from four groups of diseases. Compared with 1907 the rate from common infectious diseases is lower, this having been due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Measles and Whooping Cough. From Diarrhœal diseases the rate is higher, from Wasting diseases slightly lower, from Tubercular diseases higher, and from other causes lower. Compared with the rate for England and Wales for 1907, the proportion of deaths under one year from infectious diseases is lower, having been 6.16 in Wandsworth, compared with 8.67. The proportion of deaths from Diarrhœal diseases was 20.72 in Wandsworth, and in England and Wales 14.06. From Wasting diseases the rate in this Borough was 38.92,. compared with 43.18 in England and Wales for 1907. From Tubercular diseases the rate in this Borough was 3.64, compared with 2.75 in 1907, and with 4.54 in England and Wales for 1907. Compared with the rate in England and Wales for the five years 1902-1906 the rate in this Borough was, from infectious diseases 227 lower, from Diarrhœal diseases 4.37 lower, from Wasting diseases 6.07 lower, from Tubercular diseases .90 lower, and from other causes 18.60 lower. The rate for 1908 thus compares most favourably with the rate for England and Wales for the quinquennium 1902-1906. It will also be seen from the preceding Table that the rate from common infectious diseases was highest at 10-11 months, from Diarrhœal diseases at two to three months and five to six months, from Wasting diseases under one week, from Tubercular diseases at 9-10 months, and from other causes at one to two and two to three months. From all causes the rate was highest under one week and lowest at 11-12 months. 47 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Table which follows shows the infantile mortality rate per 1,000 births for the whole Borough, and for each sub-district, from certain causes, and from all causes. From Premature Birth the rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Clapham, from Developmental diseases lowest in Wandsworth and highest in Tooting, from Measles and Whooping Cough lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, from Respiratory diseases lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, from Tubercular diseases lowest in Wandsworth and highest in Streatham, and from other causes lowest in Clapham and highest in Wandsworth. From all causes this mortality was lowest in Streatham, being only 81 per 1,000 births, compared with 87 in 1907, and highest in Tooting, 122 compared with 146. 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Compared with 1907 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhœa, other Continued Fevers, and other Septic diseases, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Influenza. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from other Continued Fevers, and a decrease in all the other Zymotics. The greatest decrease occurred from Diarrhoea, Measles, Whooping Cough and Diphtheria. From all Zymotic diseases the death-rate was 114 per 1,000 (1.09 in Clapham, .94 in Putney, 1.03 in Streatham, 1.69 in Tooting, and 1.17 in Wandsworth), compared with 1.34 in 1907, 1.70 in 1906, 1.57 in 1905, 1.93 in 1904, and 1.91 the decennial average. The rate from the principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:—Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhœa, was .82 per 1,000 (.82 in Clapham, .61 in Putney, .67 in Streatham, 1.34 in Tooting, and .86 in Wandsworth), compared with .97 in 1907, 1.36 in 1906, 1.30 in 1905, 1.60 in 1904. The rate in London was 1.37 per 1,000, compared with 1.37 in 1907, 1.94 in 1906, 1.68 in 1905, and 2.14 in 1904. The rate for England and Wales was 1.29, compared with 1.26 in 1907; in the 76 Great Towns 1.59, compared with 1.54; in the 142 Smaller Towns 1.26, compared with 1.29; and in Rural England and Wales .99, compared with .91. The rate for the year 1908 is the lowest yet recorded, and the great decrease is due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, and to a less extent from Diphtheria, Measles, and Whooping Cough. In out-lying Institutions 54 deaths occurred from Zymotic diseases (16 belonging to Clapham, four to Putney, 10 to Streatham, six to Tooting, and 18 to Wandsworth), compared with 48 in 1907, 52 in 1906, 67 in 1905, and 58 in 1904. Of these deaths 19 occurred in the Workhouse Infirmary, four from Measles, one from Influenza, five from Whooping Cough, three from Diarrhoea, one from Erysipelas, four from Puerperal Fever, and one from other Septic diseases; 22 in General and 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Special Hospitals, one from Measles, one from Scarlet Fever, two from Influenza, two from Diphtheria, nine from Diarrhoea, two from other Continued Fevers, one from Erysipelas, and four from other Septic diseases; two in Public Lunatic Asylums, one from Diarrhoea, and one from Erysipelas; and 11 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, two from Scarlet Fever, four from Diphtheria, four from Enteric Fever, and one from Erysipelas. In Institutions in the Borough 82 deaths from Zymotic diseases occurred of persons not belonging thereto, compared with 106 in 1907, 90 in 1906, and 89 in 1905. The decrease in 1908 is largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Diphtheria. Of these deaths, 73 occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, 46 from Scarlet Fever, 27 from Diphtheria, and one from Measles. One death from Influenza occurred in the Tooting Home; one from Influenza in the Royal Hospital for Incurables; and one from Influenza in St. Anne's Home. Of the total deaths from this group of diseases, 41 occurred In the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, 17 from Scarlet Fever, and 24 from Diphtheria; and one death from Influenza in the Tooting Home. Compared with 1907, this shows a decrease of three deaths from Scarlet Fever, and of four deaths from Diphtheria. The next Table shows the death-rates from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1908, as well as for the preceding 10 years, and the rates above or below the decennial average are also shown. 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting, while, compared with the decennial average, Wandsworth shows the greatest reduction and Tooting the next. The rate for Tooting was .53 above the decennial average in 1907, but in 1908 there was a very marked improvement, the rate falling from 2.99 to 1.69. There has been a slight increase in this rate in Clapham and Streatham, but a marked decrease in Putney, Tooting, and Wandsworth, compared with the year 1907, but in all the subdistricts there is a very decided reduction in this mortality compared with the decennial average. 53 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Compared with 1907 there has been a decrease in the number of cases of all the notifiable diseases with the exception of Cerebrospinal Meningitis, but only five cases were notified, compared with three in 1907. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been a decrease in the number of cases of all the notifiable diseases with the exception of Scarlet Fever, which shows a slight increase. The total number of cases notified was 2,095 (375 in Clapham, 119 in Putney, 449 in Streatham, 362 in Tooting, and 790 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,270 in 1907, 2,030 in 1906, 2,211 in 1905, and 1,540 in 1904. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 6.97, compared with in 1907, 6.42 in 1906, and 7.5 in 1905. The rates in the sub-districts were as follows:—In Clapham 5.50, compared with 5.34 in 1907, 5.36 in 1906, and 6.2 in 1905; Putney 3.85, compared with 5.57, 3.3, and 3.2; Streatham 4.36, compared with 6.00, 5.3, and 5.4; Tooting 10.83, compared with 15.45, 10.2, and 10.5; and Wandsworth 7.89, compared with 6.77, 7.4, and 11.3. In the County of London this rate was 7.50, compared with 8.72 in 1907, 7.5 in 1906, and 7.0 in 1905. In Public Institutions within the Borough two cases of Erysipelas were notified from the Workhouse; one case of Erysipelas from the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum; two cases of Scarlet Fever and two of Diphtheria from the Fountain Fever Hospital; 19 cases of Scarlet Fever and 19 of Diphtheria from the Grove Fever Hospital; one case of Enteric Fever, one of Scarlet Fever, and one of Erysipelas from the Prison; and one of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria from the Intermediate Schools; a total of 50, compared with 111 in 1907, 88 in 1906, and 94 in 1905. The number of cases notified from these Institutions during the year thus show a satisfactory decrease. From Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough notifications of infectious diseases were received as shown in the following Table. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Table XXXIII. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1907. It shows the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham.

This is a decided decrease compared with the four previous years. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and in the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1907, as well as for the 10 years 18971906. The average for the 10 years is also shown on this Table. Compared with 1906 there has again been a decrease in the percentage of successfully vaccinated in all the sub-districts, this 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. decrease having been greatest in Clapham and least in Putney, while in the whole Borough there has been a decrease of 4.5 per cent. Compared with the decennial average there has been a considerable increase in Putney, but a decrease in all the other subdistricts. 466 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 6'6, compared with 8.1 in 1906, 8.4 in 1905, and 8.6 in 1904. Of the 1,904 infants remaining, 27 or .38 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination; 292 or 4.1 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received; 317 or 4.4 per cent. had vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 952 or 13.4 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for; while 316 or 4.4 per cent. remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 10.1 per cent. as removed, etc., in 1906, and 7.7 in 1905; and 3.1 remaining as unvaccinated in 1906, and 3.1 in 1905. There has been an increase of 3.3 in the percentage of cases removed, and this increase chiefly occurred in the sub-districts of Streatham and Wandsworth. If the total number of infants who died unvaccinated be deducted from the total number of births registered, then of 6,613, the remaining infants, 71.2 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 78.1 in 1906, 81.5 in 1905, and 80.5 in 1904; .41 were insusceptible, compared with .23, .3 and .48; 4.8 per cent. were under certificate of postponement, compared with 5.1, 4.2 and 3.4; 4.4 per cent. in regard to whom certificates of conscientious objection had been obtained, compared with 2.8, 2.2 and 2.1; leaving 19.1 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination, compared with 14.5, 11.8 and 13.1. 59 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

It will here be seen that of the total number of cases remaining on the books as unvaccinated, viz.:—316, no less than 223 were in the Clapham sub-district. It is difficult to account for the enormous difference between the sub-districts except on the grounds that the administration of the Vaccination Act in Clapham is defective. If Small-pox once gets a footing in this sub-district, its spread will be rapid and its results disastrous. Panic vaccination is expensive and not always efficient, and I am of opinion that this matter merits the serious consideration of the Borough Council. The percentage of children remaining unvaccinated, including cases postponed, to total births during the last 10 years was as (follows for this Borough and for the Metropolis:— 6o Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 Wandsworth 20.8 17.7 15.6 15.0 15.7 15.9 15.3 14.6 18.0 22.4 Metropolis 33.0 27.7 25.8 24.1 21.3 20.7 19.1 18.5 ... ... The above Table shows that in Wandsworth this percentage is higher than it has been for the last 10 years. Scarlet Fever. 1,232 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year,, compared with 1,330 in 1907, 1,069 in and 1,494 in 1905. 232 of these were in Clapham, 66 in Putney, 270 in Streatham, 218 in Tooting, and 446 in Wandsworth. 1,072 or 87 per cent. of these cases were removed to hospital' where 19 died, and 160 or 13 per cent. were treated at home with two deaths. The total number of deaths was 21, of which four were in Clapham, two in Putney, five in Streatham, one in Tooting, and nine in Wandsworth. The percentage of cases removed to hospital, viz.:—87, is the highest recorded, as in 1907, 84.8 per cent, were removed; in 1906, 83.8; in 1905, 84.1; in 1904, 81.6; in 1903, 78.1; in 1902, 75; and in 1901, 70.6 per cent. The case mortality was 1.7 per cent. compared with 1.65 in 1907, 1.78 in 1906, 1.87 in 1905, and 1.74 in 1904. The mortality among cases removed to hospital was 1.77 per cent., compared with 1.77 in 1907, and among those treated at home 1.25, compared with .99 in 1907. The mortality among the home treated cases is much lower than among those cases treated' in hospital, while in 1907 the rates were respectively 1.77 and .99. 61 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 3.67, compared with 4.08 in 1907, 3.4 in 1906, 5.1 in 1905, and 2.8 in 1904, and in the County of London 4.60, compared with 5.53, 4.3, 4.1 and 2.89. The proportion of cases notified was thus .93 per 1,000 lower in this Borough than for the whole of London, while in 1907 it was 1.45 per 1,000 lower. The following Table shows the rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year and the three previous years, as well as the corresponding rates for the whole of London.

In Clapham the greatest number of cases was notified in October, and the smallest number in May. There was a decrease in the number of cases in Putney in 1908, compared with 1907, 66 cases having been notified, compared with 82. The greatest number was notified in January viz.:—11, and the smallest in May, viz.:—three. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Streatham the total number of cases was 108 less than in 1907. The maximum number of cases was notified in January and the minimum in April, June and August. In Tooting, although the number of cases notified per 1,000 of population is still high, yet compared with the previous year there has been a marked reduction. In 1907, 318 cases were notified, 47 of these occurring in Institutions, while in 1908 only 218, 21 in Institutions, were notified. The rate of notified cases per 1,000 of population was 6.52, compared with 9.80 in 1907, and if the cases in Institutions are deducted, 6.3, compared with 8.6. The maximum number of cases in Tooting occurred in October, and the minimum in March. In Wandsworth, Scarlet Fever was more prevalent than in the two previous years, the rate per 1,000 having been 4/45, compared with 3.66 and 3.7. The maximum number of cases occurred in January, and the minimum in July. In the Borough the maximum number of cases was notified in January, and the minimum in June and July. As in previous years the prevalence of the disease was due very largely to its mild nature, and consequent unrecognised cases, and this was specially the case in Tooting and Wandsworth. There was no special outbreak in any part of the Borough during the year, but in Tooting and Wandsworth infection at school played a considerable part. This was to a certain extent the case in Clapham, as will be noted later in the Report when dealing with Scarlet Fever and schools. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1908, and for the whole year. 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXVI.

Scarlet Fever and Schools. The next Table shows the number of cases of Scarlet Fever for each month of the year among children in attendance at elementary and other schools for each sub-district, also the number for the whole Borough, the number of cases among persons not at school, the number attending schools outside the Borough, as well as the number of cases in which, as far as could be ascertained, the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever was incorrect. Of the total number of cases, viz.:—1,232, the diagnosis was incorrect in 44 or 3.5 per cent.; 632 or 51.3 per cent. were in attendance at schools in the Borough; 71 or 5.8 per cent. attended schools outside the Borough; while 485 or 39.4 per cent. did not attend school, being either above or under school age. The percentage of children attending school varied somewhat in the sub-districts. For example: in Clapham 109 out of 232, or 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 47 per cent. were at school; in Putney 25 out of 66, or 38 per cent.; in Streatham 144 out of 270, or 53.3 per cent.; in Tooting 94 out of 218, or 43.1 per cent.; and in Wandsworth 260 out of 446, or 56.1 per cent. The percentage in Tooting is lower for two reasons than it is in reality, one being that a number of children in Tooting attend schools in Balham, and the other that 21 cases were notified from the Fever Hospitals and the Tooting Bec Asylum. The two schools chiefly affected in Clapham were Old Town and St. Andrew's Street, 18 cases having occurred among scholarsattending the former and 26 the latter. 19 of the cases in St. Andrew's Street school occurred in September, October and November, but on visiting the school I was satisfied that everything possible was being done to prevent the spread of the disease. The names and addresses of all absentees were noted and their homes visited and, as a result of the measures taken, no cases occurred in December. In Streatham, Broadwater Road and Smallwood Road schools were chiefly affected, and in both the cases chiefly occurred in the last four months of the year. In Tooting, Ensham Street, Tooting Graveney, and Sellin court Road schools had the largest number of cases, and in the first-mentioned 12 cases occurred in the month of November These were due chiefly to unrecognised cases. In Wandsworth, Scarlet Fever was most prevalent at Swaffield Road school, 49 cases having been notified during the year. These cases occurred in every month, but the greatest number was notified in October. The reason for this increase was that of 13 cases notified in that month, six were in one house, and 10 in the same street. In St. Faith's school out of 18 cases, 12 occurred in January these having been due to unrecognised cases. 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXVII. SCHOOLS. January. February. March.

In this week the disease was prevalent in each subdistrict with the exception of Putney and Streatham. The increase in the latter part of the year was not confined to this Borough, but was general all over London. Of the total number of cases notified, viz.:—1,232, 13 or one per cent. were under one year, compared with nine or .6 per cent. in 1907; 318 or 25.8 per cent. were from one to five years, compared with 322 or 24.2 per cent.; 716 or 58.1 per cent. from five to 15 years, compared with 786 or 59.1 per cent.; 110 or nine per cent, from 15 to 25 years, compared with 143 or io'8 per cent.; and 75 or 6.1 per cent. from 25 to 65 years, compared with 70 or 5.3 per cent. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during the year shows a satisfactory decrease compared with 1907, and is also under the average number for the last 10 years. The following Table shows the number of cases notified, and the number of deaths that occurred in the separate sub-districts and in the whole Borough for the years 1898-1907 inclusive, the average for the 10 years, and the number of cases and deaths in 1908. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of cases notified was 581 (91 in Clapham, 39 in Putney, 137 in Streatham, 89 in Tooting, and 225 in Wandsworth), compared with 629 in 1907, and 566 in 1906. This number, although 46 above the uncorrected, is 114 under the corrected decennial average In Clapham there has been an increase of 12, in Putney a decrease of 26, in Streatham a decrease of 20, in Tooting a decrease of 49, and in Wandsworth an increase of 35, compared with 1907. The greatest number of cases occurred in Wandsworth and the smallest in Putney. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 1.73, compared with 1.93 in 1907, and 1.79 in 1906, and in London 1.64, compared with 1.65 and 1.70. 469 or 80.7 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital where 33 died, and 112 or 19.3 per cent. were treated at home with four deaths. The case mortality was 6.3 per cent., compared with 6.3 in 1907, 8.9 in 1906, 8.9 in 1905, and 10.8 in 1904. The case mortality for the whole of London for the year 1908 was 9.2 per cent., compared with 8.89 in 1907, 8.7 in 1906, and 8.5 in 1905. The case mortality among cases treated in hospital was 7.03 per cent., and among those treated at home 3.6 per cent. The great reduction in the mortality is to a large extent due to the earlier use of antitoxin, both in the cases treated in hospital and in those treated at home. During the year, however, a considerable proportion of the cases admitted to hospital have been of a more virulent type, and consequently the mortality is slightly increased. The following Table shows the number of cases, the caserate per 1,000 living, for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts.

The highest case-rate was in Tooting, and the lowest in Putney. The case-rate for the Borough is .1 under that for the whole of London, and the death-rate is .04 per 1,000 lower. The death-rate per 1,000 in the Borough was .11, compared with .12 in 1907, .16 in 1906, .11 in 1905, and .20, the decennial average. In Clapham the death-rate was .10, in Putney .03, in Streatham .10, in Tooting .19, and in Wandsworth 12 per 1,000. Tooting and Wandsworth show a decrease compared with the previous year, but in Clapham, Putney and Streatham there was a slight increase in this rate. CHART Showing the number of cases of DIPHTHERIA notified during each week of the year 1908. 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases, viz.:—21, was notified in the second week of April, and the minimum, viz.:—two, in the fifth week of August. The period of school holidays in July and August was particularly free from the disease. In September and October the number of cases slightly increased, and another maximum was reached in the second week of November, when 15 cases were notified. At no period of the year was there any definite outbreak, and this is doubtless due to the methods adopted, not only in this Borough, but in the Metropolis generally for dealing with cases of Diphtheria in schools. The Medical Officer to the Education Department, London County Council, receives copies of all notifications of infectious disease, and when his attention is called to a succession of cases in one school means are at once taken to swab the throats of all children in the classrooms in which cases have occurred. Meanwhile, the officers of the Sanitary Authority have obtained lists of absentees from schools, and all the homes are visited, and if any cases of sore throat are found the throats of these children are at once swabbed and a bacteriological examination made. In this way any outbreak is prevented, and no child who has had sore throat is permitted to return to school until a negative bacteriological result has been obtained. This method has been carried out during 1908 most successfully, and I am certain that it was the means of preventing serious and fatal outbreaks in several schools in the Borough. Diphtheria and School Attendance. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relation to the schools in the Borough. 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL.

Of the remaining cases, viz.:—338, in 54 or 9.3 per cent., the diagnosis was incorrect, and 294 or 50.6 per cent. were not in attendance at school. 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From these figures it would appear that school infection was not so important a factor in the spread of Diphtheria as in 1907, when the percentage of children in attendance at school was 49, and not in attendance 44. A further examination of the Table shows that in Putney four cases only occurred in connection with schools in the last nine months of the year, and if it had not been for the eight cases which occurred in Roehampton in January, only 11 cases would have been notified from that sub-district. Of the total cases notified, 54 were incorrectly diagnosed, compared with 44 in 1907, leaving a total of 527, compared with585 in 1907, 531 in 1906, and 312 in 1905. Only 11 cases occurred in connection with private schools, compared with 21 in 1907, and 48 in 1906. No cases of Diphtheria were notified as having occurred in children attending the following elementary schools in the Borough. In Clapham:— Aristotle Road. Cavendish Road. Clapham Parochial, Macaulay Road. St. Mary's Roman Catholic, Crescent Lane. St. Mary's Roman Catholic, Park Place. In Putney:— All Saints', Lower Common. Convent School, Roehampton. Deodar Road.

In all, 21 schools remained free from Diphtheria, compared with 17 in 1907, and of these 17 were non-provided schools. In one school, viz.:—Immanuel School, Streatham, swabs were taken by the Assistant Medical Officer, London County Council, during the year, and as a result of this three "carrier" cases were discovered in Standard I., in which standard all the notified cases occurred. These cases were kept under observation and not permitted to return to school until a bacteriological examination had been made and a negative result obtained. Swabs were also taken at Roehampton School on several occasions during the year for the purpose of ascertaining if possible how long the Klebs Loeffler bacillus continues in the throats of school children, and also how long the virulence of the bacillus lasts, but this investigation is still going on, and so far no definite report can be made. With regard to the 60 cases notified from the Union Infirmary, these all occurred during the first four months of the year. Of these, 48 were stated to have come from the Workhouse, one from the Intermediate Schools, and 11 from houses in this Borough. With few exceptions, all these were cases of bacteriological Diphtheria, that is, they were only notified as Diphtheria after swabs had been taken. All the 60 cases were removed to hospital, and further bacteriological examinations at the hospital showed that in 21 of the cases the Klebs Loeffler bacillus was found, but in only six was the bacillus virulent. In 39 of the cases examined at the hospital the Klebs Loeffler bacillus was absent. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the six positive cases, five had been in the Infirmary over two months, while one was admitted seven days prior to notification. This case was sent to the Infirmary from the Workhouse on account of Bronchitis, and no symptoms of Diphtheria were at that time observed by the Medical Officer of that Institution. No deaths from Diphtheria occurred among- these 60 cases, but one child notified died from Whooping Cough, from which disease it was suffering when removed. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria, 22 or 3.7 per cent, occurred among children under one year of age, 210 or 36.1 per cent, occurred among children from one to five years, 262 or 45.0 per cent, from five to 15 years, and 87 or 14.9 per cent, over 15 years. Of the 469 cases removed to hospital, 54 were reported not to be suffering from Diphtheria. Drainage defects were found in 56 of the houses in which cases of Diphtheria occurred, compared with 92 in 1907. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 57 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 41 in 1907, 24 in 1906, 51 in 1905, and 17 in 1904. There were also 17 return cases of Diphtheria, compared with one in 1907. Three of the return cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in Clapham, six in Putney, 17 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 21 in Wandsworth. 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the return cases of Diphtheria one occurred in Clapham, nine in Streatham, one in Tooting-, and seven in Wandsworth. The following- Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent case, and the number of days elapsing- between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. The average number of days the cases of Scarlet Fever were in hospital was 63.6, and in the cases of Diphtheria 57.4 days. 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLI.

It is difficult to account for the increased number of return cases as only in nine cases was there any visible discharge from the mucous membranes. Every care seems to have been taken in hospital, and the average time of detention in hospital has not appreciably lessened. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Inquiry into the return cases of Diphtheria revealed some facts which were, from an administrative point of view, of importance. Cases 4, 5, 6, and 7, were all members of the same family and were presumably infected by Case 5, which had been removed to hospital on March 20th, suffering from Scarlet Fever, and discharged on May 14th. The mother of this child, No. 4, was taken ill on May 16th, with Diphtheria, followed by definite clinical cases of Diphtheria in the case of other two members of the same family, the first symptoms in these latter appearing about the 23rd. The return case was also removed to hospital on the 21st, after a swab had been taken from the throat, in which a positive result was obtained, showing that this case was a definite one of Post Scarlatinal Diphtheria. Cases 10 and xi were also cases of Post Scarlatinal Diphtheria, No. 10 having been 11 days at home before definite symptoms appeared, but No. 11 was ill when it returned home. Nos. 12 to 17 were all members of the same family, and the diagnosis was verified in all these cases by bacteriological examination. No. 15 was the case removed on February 12th, and returned on March 26th. As it was suspected that this case was the cause of the other eases, a swab was taken from his throat, and a positive result was obtained. None of these six cases proved fatal. Enteric Fever. 60 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year (14 from Clapham, five from Putney, 12 from Streatham, nine from Tooting, and 20 from Wandsworth), compared with 70 in 1907, 96 in 1906, and 96 in 1905. 43 of the cases were removed to hospital where four died, and 17 were treated at home with three deaths. 82 Report ot the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of deaths was seven (three in Clapham, one in Putney, two in Streatham, none in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth), compared with 10 in 1907, 15 in 1906, 11 in 1905, and 11 in 1904. The number of deaths was three less than in 1907, and 15*1 under the decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 18, compared with .21 in 1907, .30 in 1906, and .33 in 1905, and with .28 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from Fever was '02 per 1,000, compared with .03 in 1907, .048 in 1906, .04 in 1905, and .04 in 1904, while the rate for the whole of London was '04, compared with .04 in 1907, .05 in 1906, .05 in 1905, and .06 in 1904. Of the 43 cases removed to hospital, 13 or 30 per cent, were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever, compared with 23.3 per cent, in 1907. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during the year. In 20 of the weeks during the year no cases were notified, one -case each in 13 of the weeks, two cases each in 15 of the weeks, three cases each in three of the weeks, and four cases each in two of the weeks. Of the 60 cases notified, 14 were not Enteric Fever, 13 being hospital cases, and one treated at home, while one was notified from the Prison, leaving 45 cases in which special inquiries were made as to the probable cause of the disease. In 11 of the cases the disease was in all probability contracted by eating shell-fish, in eight it was contracted outside the Borough (one in Ireland, one in Manchester, one in Devonport, one abroad, one in Ramsgate, and three in other places), in two the infection was contracted from other cases, in one probably from watercress, while in 24 no history of infection could be ascertained. With regard to the 11 cases caused by shell-fish, three were from oysters, five from mussels, and three from winkles. CHART Showing the number of cases of ENTERIC FEVER notified during each week of the year 1908. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following are the particulars of these cases :— (1.) A. G., aged 35, notified on the nth January. Had oysters on 25th December at Burnham-on-Crouch. (2.) J. W., aged 32, notified on the 11th November. Had oysters which were sent from Southend on the 12th October. Inquiry at Southend showed that the oysters had been gathered from a presumably infected ground. Other two persons in the house also had oysters and suffered from sickness and Diarrhœa. (3.) VV. H., aged 51, notified on the 15th December. Had oysters on the 18th and 25th November in hotels in London. This case proved fatal. (4.) M. R., aged 32, notified on the 8th October. Had mussels on the 22nd September, which had been purchased at Billingsgate by her husband. (5.) E. R., aged 11, notified on the 15th October. Had mussels about 14 days previous to appearance of first symptoms. (6.) G. B., aged 27, notified on the 3rd November. Was a regular consumer of mussels. This case proved fatal. (7.) E. C., aged 36, notified on the 18th November. Had mussels on the 5th, purchased from local dealer. (8.) F. W., aged 26, notified on the 23rd November. Had mussels on the 26th October, purchased from a local dealer. The first symptoms in this case appeared about the 10th November, or 15 days after he had the shell-fish. (9.) A. N., aged 26, notified on the 19th March. Had winkles on several occasions in February. (10.) A. S., aged 33, notified on the gth November. Had winkles on two occasions in October. 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (11.) A. W., aged 13, notified on the 7th October. Had winkles frequently previous to the appearance of the first symptoms. In only two cases had any of the members of the patients' family previously had an attack of Enteric Fever, but so long a period had elapsed that it was not considered necessary to make any further investigations. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In no cases (44 of Scarlet Fever, 54 of Diphtheria, and 12 of Enteric Fever), information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease, compared with 111 in 1907, 93 in 1906, 97 in 1905, and 94 in 1904. Of the 1,584 cases removed to hospital, in no or 6.9 per cent, the diagnosis was incorrect, compared with 6.5 per cent, in 1907, 6.7 in 1906, 5.2 in 1905, and 10 in 1904. There has been a marked decrease in the percentage of incorrect diagnosis in Scarlet Fever, an increase in Diphtheria, and an increase in Enteric Fever, compared with the previous year. TABLE XLII.

In 1907, the percentage of cases of mistaken diagnosis for the whole of London was: for Scarlet Fever 6'8, compared with 5.2 in 1906; for Diphtheria 17, compared with 18.3; and for Enteric Fever 29.1, compared with 33.7. Cerebro-Spinal Fever. Five cases of Cerebro-spinal Fever were notified during the year (one from Clapham, two from Streatham, one from Tooting, and one from Wandsworth), compared with three in 1907. One of the cases was notified from St. Thomas's Hospital, one from the Belgrave Hospital for Children, and one from the Westminster Hospital. These cases proved fatal. The diagnosis in these cases was confirmed by lumbar puncture and bacteriological examination. In the other two cases, which recovered, no bacteriological examination was made. In London 85 cases of this disease were notified during the year, compared with 153 in 1907. 17 deaths were registered as having been caused by Meningitis (four in Clapham, two in Putney, six in Streatham, and five in Wandsworth). Six of these were of infants under one year, five from one to five years, and six over five years of age. As in previous years, inquiries were made from the medical attendant, and in all the cases the disease was stated to have been simple Meningitis. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 491 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 466 in 1907, 407 in 1906, 174 in 1905, 121 in 1904, 125 in 1903, 98 in 1902, and 66 in 1901. G 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of examinations in each sub-district and for the whole Borough, also the disease for which the examination was made and the result of such examination.

It has been altogether due to the greater use made by individual medical practitioners, as well as to the fact that in certain suspicious contacts the medical attendants have been advised by me to take swabs as an aid to diagnosis. In 162 out of 467 examinations for the bacillus of Diphtheria the result was positive, and in nine out of 24 examinations of blaod in suspected cases of Enteric Fever, the Widal reaction was obtained. Puerperal Fever. 14 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 25 in 1907, 25 in 1906, 18 in 1905, and 14 in 1904. One case occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, one in Streatham, two in Tooting, and eight in Wandsworth. 87 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Six of the cases (one in Putney, one in Streatham, one in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth), or 42 per cent, were fatal, compared with 40 per cent, in 1907, 44 per cent, in 1906, and 44.4 per cent, in 1905. Six of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, where four died. The death-rate was .018 per 1,000, compared with .031 in 1907, and .035 in 1906. The case-rate per 1,000 births was 1.9, compared with 3.5 in 1907, and for the whole of London 1.8, compared with 2.1. Two nurses had free baths, and of the others, two came from Fulham, two were district or surgical nurses, and the remainder had baths at their own homes. In four cases the personal clothing of the nurse was disinfected. Erysipelas. 203 cases of Erysipelas were notified during the year and six deaths occurred. 36 of the cases and two of the deaths occurred in Clapham, seven cases and one death in Putney, 27 cases and one death in Streatham, 43 cases and one death in Tooting, and 90 cases and one death in Wandsworth. In 1907, the number of cases notified was 210 and the -deaths 10. 22 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary where two deaths occurred. Measles. During the year 45 deaths, 24 of males and 21 of females, were due to Measles, compared with 68 in 1907, 65 in 1906, 89 in 11905, and 104 in 1904. 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 19 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, six inStreatham, five in Tooting-, and 13 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 23 less than in 1907, and is 64.8 under the corrected decennial average. 14 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 28 from one to five years, and three from five to 15 years; 93.3 per cent, of the deaths having occurred under five years of age. The death-rate was .14 per 1,000, compared with .21 in 1907, 21 in 1906, and .31 in 1905. The death-rate for the whole of London was .31, compared with .37 in 1907, for England and Wales .22, and for the 76 Great Towns .31 per 1,000. During the year, 1,506 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Measles, 267 in Clapham, 13 in Putney, 575 in Streatham, 177 in Tooting, and 474 in Wandsworth. The next Table shows the number of premises disinfected after Measles in each sub-district for each month of the year. The total number of premises disinfected was 884 (139 in Clapham, 11 in Putney, 311 in Streatham, 139 in Tooting, and 284 in Wandsworth), compared with 955 in 1907, 902 in 1906, 798 in 1905, and 1,115 in 1904- The greatest number of disinfections was carried out in July, this being due to outbreaks in Streatham and Tooting. The greatest number of cases occurred in May, June and December. In August, September, October and November the number of disinfections was small as there were very few cases in any part of the Borough. 89 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL1V.

Eight of the deaths occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, 17 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 18 in Wandsworth. 25 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 32 of children from one to five years, and two from five to 15 years. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate was .18 per 1,000, compared with .32 in 1907, and '20 for the whole of London. This disease was less prevalent in London and in this Borough in the year 1908 than in the previous year. In the subdistricts of Putney and Tooting it was slightly more prevalent. The number of cases notified from schools was 612, compared vyith 930 in 1907, 200 of these being from schools in the subdistrict of Streatham, and the schools chiefly affected in that sub-district were Broadwater Road, Oldridge Road, Fircroft Road, and Mitcham Lane. There were also 188 cases notified from schools in Wandsworth, the schools chiefly affected being the Wandle, Swaffield Road, and Earlsfield. The greatest mortality from Measles and Whooping Cough occurs among children under five years of age. Of the 104 deaths that occurred from these diseases, 99 or 95 per cent, were deaths of children under five years. Closure and Disinfecting of Schools. During the year the following schools were closed and disinfected, or disinfected only, on account of the prevalence of either Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Measles or Whooping Cough, or a combination of these diseases. (1.) St. Andrew's, Polworth Road. Eight rooms disinfected on the 19th March on account of the prevalence of Measles. Classroom closed from 19th to 23rd March. (2.) Hearnville Road School, Infants' Department. 10 rooms disinfected on the 30th June on account of the prevalence of Measles and Whooping Cough. This department was closed from 23rd June to 6th July. (3.) Eltringham Street School. One room disinfected on account of Scarlet Fever on the 20th July. 93 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (4.) Cavendish Road School. Two rooms disinfected on account of Measles and Whooping- Cough on the 29th July- (5.) Smalhvood Road School, Girls' Department. One room disinfected on account of Scarlet Fever on the 24th September. (6.) Immanuel School, Infants' Department. Three rooms disinfected on account of Diphtheria on the 3rd October. (7.) SmallWood Road School, Infants' Department. Two rooms disinfected on account of Measles on the 21st October. (8.) Waldron Road School. Two rooms disinfected on account of Measles on the 12th November. (9.) Franciscan Road School. Three rooms disinfected on account of Scarlet Fever on the 17th November. (10.) Ensham Street School. Three rooms disinfected on account of Scarlet Fever on the 25th November. (11.) Immanuel School. Four rooms disinfected after Diphtheria on the 1 st December. Epidemic Influenza 82 deaths, 30 of males and 52 of females, were due to this disease, compared with 88 in 1907, 70 in 1906, and 41 in 1905. There has thus been a decrease of six deaths compared with the previous year, and of 10.9 compared with the corrected decennial average. 14 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, eight in Putney, 31 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .25 per 1,000, compared with .27 in 1907, .22 in 1906, and .14 in 1905. 94 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 38 of the deaths were of persons from 25 to 65 years, and 37 of persons over 65 years. Diarrhoea. 101 deaths, 53 of males and 48 of females, occurred from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis during the year, compared with 65 in 1907, 218 in 1906, 137 in 1905, and 208 in 1904. There has thus been an increase in the number of deaths from these diseases compared with the previous year, but a decrease of 97^3, compared with the corrected decennial average. 16 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, nine in Putney, 28 in Streatham, 18 in Tooting, and 30 in Wandsworth. In all the sub-districts the number of deaths was, with the exception of Tooting, greater than in 1907, the greatest increase having been in Streatham and Wandsworth. In Clapham the number increased from 10 to 16, in Putney from six to nine, in Streatham from 11 to 28, in Wandsworth from 10 to 30, while in Tooting the number decreased from 28 to 18. The death-rate was .30 per 1,000, compared with .20 in 1907, and '70 in 1906. The death-rate for the whole of London also shows a slight increase, it being .53, compared with .33 in 1907, but in the three previous years the rates were: .95 in 1906, .72 in 1905, and ro3 in 1904. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:—In Clapham .23, compared with .15 in 1907; in Putney .29, compared with .19; in Streatham .27, compared with .11; in Tooting .57, compared with .92 ; and in Wandsworth .31, compared with .10. Of the total number of deaths registered, 74 or 73 per cent, were of infants under one year, compared with 83 per cent, in 1907, 86 per cent, in 1906, and 87 per cent, in 1905. 95 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Including Enteritis, the total number of deaths was 183, compared with 127 in 1907, 289 in 1906, 203 in 1905, and 301 in 1904. Of these 183 deaths, 136 or 74 per cent, were of infants under one year. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhœa and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1908, and for the five previous years. TABLE XLVI. 1903 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908.

The proportion of deaths in this quarter to total deaths from Diarrhœa is much smaller than in previous years with the exception of 1907, and was due to the fact that the mean temperature in that quarter was much under the average. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis under one year represents 19 per cent, of the total mortality at that age, compared with 13.8 per cent, in 1907, 33 per cent, in 1906, 21.1 per cent, in 1903, and 28.8 per cent, in 1904, so that the diminution of the mortality under one year is, as in the 96 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. previous year, largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths of infants from the above causes. In 115 out of the total deaths under one year, special enquiries were made, and the following Table shows the nature of the food given. TABLE XLVIL Method of Feeding.

In 60, or 60 per cent., cows' milk, either alone or with condensed milk or farinaceous food, was given; while in 23, or 23 per cent., condensed milk only was given. In only one case, a child of under three months, had farinaceous food only been given; while in 16 cases no information could be obtained (three in Clapham, one in Putney, six in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 13 in 97 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Wandsworth). Of these 16, seven occurred in Out-lying Institutions, and four of these were not known at the addresses given. The parents of the other nine had removed and could not be traced. Four of the deaths were of twin children, and one was the eldest of triplets. The next Table shows the result of the enquiries made after these deaths, arranged in Wards, and there is also shown the number of infants who had been previously visited, the number of illegitimate infants, and the social status of the parents. It is interesting to note that only eight of the infants who died from Diarrhoea had been fed in accordance with the instructions given in the pamphlet left by the Inspectors, and also that of the total number visited, viz. :—99, the large number of 41 were either children born prematurely or who had been delicate from birth. 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Although the mortality from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis was greater than in 1907, yet it was much under the average, and without taking the increase of population into consideration, the total number of deaths was less in only three years of the decennium, viz. :—1902, 1903, and 1907. In these years, as in 1908, climatic conditions were not favourable to the disease. In only 31 days of the 92 in the third quarter was the temperature above the average, and these days were confined to the first and last weeks of July, the first week in August, and the last 10 days of September. Another important factor which has, in my opinion, had a beneficial effect, was the work done by the female Sanitary Inspectors, and although this cannot be put in statistical form, yet, from the reports made to me fortnightly by these Inspectors, it is evident that their labours have been largely helpful in preventing the occurrence of these diseases. In Tooting, which had the highest Diarrhoea mortality, a considerable amount of supervision is exercised by these Inspectors, and in that sub-district the mortality has diminished most markedly; the number of deaths having been reduced from 28 to 18, and the death-rate from .92 to .57. During the year the female Sanitary Inspectors have continued the work begun in 1905, in visiting homes where births occurred, and the following report gives the results of such visits and a general account of the work carried out:— "We have the honour of submitting to you a report of our visits amongst infants during the year 1908. "It is gratifying to be able to state that we have in a measure widened the scope of our work, having visited infants in Putney and Southfield in addition to Tooting, the Fairfield and Springfield Wards of Wandsworth, and the poorer parts of Balharn, to which our work was limited in former years. More second visits, too, have been paid in Tooting and Wandsworth. 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "We have found, during the year, many mothers anxiously awaiting us, whom we had visited previously with other children; the pamphlets were carefully kept, many things we had told them remembered, and the older children shown with much pride as having been brought up according to our advice. "In only one instance was the pamphlet refused, and in that case the mother was a foreigner who did not seem to understand the trend of the conversation. Several fathers have expressed their gratitude to us for our visits, and have desired their wives to follow carefully our instructions, in contrast to one or two men in former years who forbad their wives to admit us or to take the pamphlet. One or two midwives have asked for copies also. "The total number of visits paid after notification of births will be found in the first of our Tables, No. XLIX., which also shows the method of feeding at the first visit, and the number of infants visited who died during the year. Although the number of homes visited where deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis had occurred was far greater this year than last (115 as against 76 in 1907), only 20 had been previously visited by us (Balham three, Tooting six, Wandsworth eleven). Of the 20, five were delicate from birth, two were twins, and one was the eldest of triplets, three were entirely breast-fed, two of whom died in October from bronchitis and pneumonia in addition to Enteritis, and the other was delicate from birth. "Tooting is not the 'black spot' it was last year, the proportion of deaths being considerably lower. "Of the 1,996 infants visited during the year, 46 died in addition to the 20 previously mentioned, who succumbed to Diarrhoea and Enteritis. Of the 46, 4 died from Prematurity —2 being twins; this may seem a small proportion, but the majority of deaths from this cause occurred within a few days of birth. 13 died from Bronchitis and Pneumonia, which have been exceedingly prevalent this winter, and indeed, on some days in nearly every house we visited, the baby was Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 101 found to be suffering from one or other of these complaints. Only one death, however, occurred from Whooping Cough. 10 were registered as having died from Marasmus and Atrophy. Eight died from Tuberculous diseases, one being from Phthisis. The other deaths were from various causes, chiefly Dentition and Convulsions. "There is a decrease in the number of ineffectual visits as compared with last year, this being due to the fact that, instead of making five or six attempts to see the mother, as before, this year, after two or three unsuccessful visits, we wasted no further time and thus were enabled to visit more infants. At the same time we found the proportion of mothers who were forced to go to work early after confinement quite as high as in former years, and for the same cause—the lack of employment among the men. Wrong addresses are still occasionally given, the reason in many instances being a desire to evade vaccination. "The second Table, No. L., shows the number of revisits—many more than last year—and the method of feeding then found, the average age at the second visit being from four to five months. "Comparing the result of our investigation with regard to feeding at the first visit with that of last year (as shown in Table XLIX.) it is gratifying to note that the number of mothers giving food in addition to the breast is much less. This is a point on which we have laid great stress in our visits, the 'food' being always bread sop or biscuit. The reason the mothers give us is that it soothes the child, sends it to sleep, and 'makes it more contented.' Often young mothers tell us that they have given the food on the advice of neighbours, and are generally willing to discontinue it when we point out to them how unnecessary it is, and also how very risky. There is a foolish fallacy among mothers that breast and cows' milk will not agree. This prejudice is being gradually overcome, as may be seen by the increased number now giving both. There is a growing tendency to use condensed milk, especially during the summer, when there is a difficulty in keeping cows' milk, another reason being the H 102 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. inability through poverty, this year, to buy cows' milk. We are sorry at the same time to note the prevalent habit of dipping the 'comforter' into the tin of condensed milk, it thus becoming a fruitful source of intestinal trouble. "The use of farinaceous food alone is slightly on the decrease. A contrast in the attitude of mothers with regard to patent foods is shown in the following cases :—One was found, at the first visit, to be already following the pamphlet given at the birth of an older child, who was proudly shown as never having had a day's illness, 'and,' the mother added, 'I will never buy patent foods again.' The other was feeding her infant of less than six weeks on condensed milk and a certain patent food. It was impossible to influence her, as she was going in for that particular patent-food prize. "Again, the use of boat bottles is largely on the increase. 315 boat bottles were used (Putney two, Balham 23, Tooting 126, Southfield four, Fairfield 54, Springfield 106), as against 55 tube bottles (Balham six, Tooting 12, Fairfield 13, Springfield 24). Both tube and boat bottles were in use in 11 instances (Balham two, Tooting four, Southfield one, Fairfield 3, Springfield 1), and spoons were used in preference to either in 96 cases (Putney one, Balham 12, Tooting 50, Fa'rfield nine, Springfield 24). Several mothers have told us that they would use the boat shape but that they cannot afford it, every penny being of importance when the husband is so frequently out of work. The large number of spoons used is due to the fact that mothers are often afraid that giving a bottle may wean the baby from the breast. "It has again been difficult to keep in touch with the mothers of illegitimate children. In the Springfield \\ ard one, and in Tooting two, wrong addresses were given, and it was impossible to trace them. 13 had removed immediately after the birth (Putney one, Balham one, Tooting four, Southfield two. Springfield five), and of these, five came into the Borough for the confinement only, and two of the infants had died from prematurity before the mother's removal. Therefore we were only successful in visiting 46 (Balham four, Tooting 19, Southfield five, Fairfield eight, Springfield io), Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 103 and of these, nine had removed before we could visit them a second time. Many of the mothers were at work outside the Borough, but came home to their relatives for the confinement and left the babies to be nursed here when they returned to their situations. "24 were entirely breast-fed at the first visit (Balham one, Tooting six, Southfield five, Fairfield four, Springfield eight), the five in Southfield representing the total number of illegitimate infants visited there. 24 re-visits were made (Balham two, Tooting 10, Fairfield five, Springfield seven), and of these, nine were still entirely breast-fed (Tooting one, Fairfield three, Springfield five). "A very large proportion of illegitimate deaths occurred in Tooting, five out of the seven deaths belonging to that district, the other two being in Balham and Fairfield. None of the illegitimate children registered in Wandsworth were premature, or delicate from birth, but in Tooting four were delicate, and one was premature, and of these, two died. Pneumonia was the cause of death in two instances (Balham one, Fairfield one). Diarrhoea in three (Tooting), and Erysipelas in one (Tooting); diseases which suggest a certain amount of neglect on the part of the mother or nurse—and Prematurity one (Tooting). "We had the help of a voluntary worker at intervals during the year, at first to make good arrears of work caused by absence through illness during the whole of February and March. When the work was brought up to date she devoted her attention to the Southfield Ward, hitherto untouched, and later we made a beginning in Putney, but shortly after that she left to take up an official position and we had to restrict our work to its former limits. "With regard to the employment of midwives. Out of the 1,996 mothers visited, 807 availed themselves of their services. Of these, 528 employed midwives registered under the London County Council (Putney 11, Balham 49, Tooting 169, Southfield 16, Fairfield 69, Springfield 214). The non- 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. registered midwives were employed chiefly by the very poor (Putney two, Balham 40, Tooting 100, Southfield 20, Fairfield 57, Springfield 60). "The sanitary defects discovered in the course of our visits were remedied, or, if involving structural work, leferred to you. In Balham 21 intimation notices were served, in Tooting 66, in Wandsworth 65 (Southfield six, Fairfield 31, Springfield 28). Three statutory notices were requited in Balham, seven in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth (Fairfield one, Springfield three)." ios Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLIX.

Of the' 1,996 infants visited, it was found that 1,601, or 8o'2 per cent., were wholly breast-fed, while 395, or ig"8 per cent., were otherwise fed. If, however, we add to the number wholly breast-fed the number of children in which other foods were given in addition we find that the percentage is increased to 89" 1, a slight increase compared with the previous years. 112, or 5.6 per cent., were fed on cows' milk only, but 22 had other foods in addition, raising the percentage to 6.7, a decrease compared with 1907, when the percentage was 7.1. 62 had condensed milk only, and nine had condensed milk and food, a total of 71, or 3'5 per cent., an increase of '4 per cent, compared with 1907. Eleven infants were led on farinaceous food only, compared with nine in the previous year. With reference to the cases re-visited, it was found that out of a total of 1,098, 726 or 66.7 per cent, were still breast-fed only, compared with 64'6 per cent, in 1907; while taking other foods with the breast the percentage was nearly 77. The total number of deaths among those infants visited by the Inspectors was 66, and of these only 20 died from Diarrhoea or Enteritis. As stated by the Inspectors, further inquiry after death showed that of these 20, five were delicate from birth, two were twins, one was the eldest of triplets, and three were entirely breast-fed. The mortality rate among the infants visited was thus only 33 per 1,000, compared with 98 over the whole Borough. As in former years the visits of the Inspectors are almost wholly confined to the poorer classes among whom this mortality is high. 108 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following' Table shows the death-rate from Zymotic diseases for the whole Borough for the year, as well as for the five previous years. TABLE LI.

Of these, eight were stated to have been due to Septicaemia or Pyasmia, three to Ulcerative or Malignant Endocarditis, and one to Glanders. The death caused by Glanders was a male of 20 years, and as he was a clerk and not engaged in looking after horses it was difficult to trace the source of infection. The only source of infection that could be ascertained was that he, when playing at a certain cricket match, stroked a horse in the cricket field, which afterwards was found to be suffering from the disease. This information was not obtained until after the inquest. 109 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. NON-ZYMOTIC DISEASES The next Table shows the number of deaths from these for the year, as well as for the previous decennium for the whole Borough. The numbers for the years 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907 and 1908 are corrected for External and Internal Institutions. TABE LII.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer and other malignant diseases was 274, 112 of males and 162 of females, compared with 272 in 1907, 256 in 1906, an increase of two, but a decrease of 5.3 compared with the corrected decennial average. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The corrected death-rate was .83 per 1,000, compared with .86 in 1907, .82 in 1906, .78 in 1905, .92 in 1904, and .98 in 1903. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each sub-district was as follows :—Clapham 59 and .86; Putney 30 and .97; Streatham 89 and .87; Tooting 21 and .67; and Wandsworth 75 and .77. Three of the deaths occurred at ages from five to 15 years, three from 15 to 25 years, 173 from 25 to 65 years, and 95 over 65 years.

Two of these deaths occurred Ill Report of the Medical Officer of Health. in the Tooting Home, two in the Hostel of God, and two in private nursing homes. 80 of the deaths, 46 of males and 34 of females, occurred in external Institutions, 22 in the Union Infirmary, and 58 in General and Special Hospitals. 75 of the total deaths occurred among females from Cancer of the Breast or Uterus, compared with 81 in 1907, 59 in 1906, 47 in 1905, and 69 in 1904. The next Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 for each of the sub-districts and for the whole Borough for the year and for the 10 preceding years. TABLE L1V.

It is satisfactory to note that there has been a slight decrease in the rate from this disease compared with the previous year and with the decennial average, and this slight decrease would have been more decided if a further correction be made for the additional week included in the registration year. 112 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tubercular Diseases. The total number of deaths from diseases of a Tuberculous nature was 382, compared with 352 in 1907, 376 in 1906, 360 in 1905, and 380 in 1904. 273 of the deaths were due to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 58 to Tubercular disease of the Brain, and 51 to other forms of Tubercular diseases. The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and other Tubercular diseases and the rates per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown in the next Table. The corrected death-rate from Tubercular disease of the Lungs was '83 per 1,000, compared with '81 in 1907, "86 in 1906, •93 in 1905, and 1*07 in 1904; from other Tubercular diseases '33, compared with '28, '35, "33, and "36; and from all Tubercular diseases r 16,. compared with i'og, i'2i, i'26, and i'43- TABLE LV.

From all Tubercular diseases the rate per 1,000 was lower in Putney and Wandsworth, but higher in Clapham, Streatham and Tooting than in 1907. With regard to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, the rate for Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth were under, and that for Clapham and Streatham above last year's rate. From other Tubercular diseases the rate is .05 higher than in 1907. This rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting, and the rate for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was lowest in Putney and highest in Wandsworth. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year, as well as for the preceding 10 years.

In Streatham, owing to a change in the social constitution of the population this rate is higherer than it has been since 1904, but it is the same as the decennial average. Three deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs occurred in infants under one year, two in persons from one to five years, four from five to 15 years, 55 from 15 to 25 years, 195 from 25 to 65 years, and 14 over 65 years. From other Tubercular diseases 23 deaths occurred under one year, 44 from one to five years, 15 from five to 15 years, eight from 15 to 25 years, 16 from 25 to 65 years, and three over 65 years.

Labourers and clerks again head the list as in previous years, 18 deaths each having occurred in these classes, compared with 20 and 17 in 1907. Among females, of 109 deaths, 15 only were engaged in some occupation, six of them being domestic servants and three laundresses, 50 were wives, widows, or daughters of artisans, 20 of labouring classes, seven of travellers or clerks, while 16 had no occupation. The next Table, which appears in this Report for the first time, shows the deaths and death-rates in males and females from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, and for other Tubercular diseases, as well as the deaths and death-rates among children under five years from other Tubercular diseases, for the 10 years 1898-1907, and for the year 1908. As a comparative Table it is of great value as it shows clearly where the greatest reduction in mortality has occurred. Among 1 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. males the rate for 1908 was 1.08, compared with 1.19 the decennial average, a reduction of .11 per 1,000, but among females the rate was only .57, compared with .8o, a reduction of .23 per 1,000, or more than double the reduction among males. Again, from other forms of Tubercular diseases the rate for 1908 was, among males .34, compared with .47, the decennial average, while among females the rate was .31, compared with .31, the decennial average, showing that from other forms of Tubercular diseases the reduction in mortality has been almost wholly among males. Among children under five years the rate was .20, compared with .26, the decennial average, only a slight reduction. Why the death-rate among females should show this marked reduction is due in all probability to the fact that housing conditions have improved, that home infection is less frequent owing to the removal of cases to hospitals, infirmaries, and sanatoria, and consequent less personal nursing. The smaller reduction in the mortality among males is probably due to their greater exposure to outside infection, to overfatigue, alcoholic excess, and confinement in badly ventilated offices and workshops. 119 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Voluntary Notification of Consumption. During the year 85 cases of Consumption were notified bymedical practitioners, seven from Clapham, six from Putney, seven from Streatham, 10 from Tooting, and 55 from Wandsworth, compared with 49 in 1907, 74 in 1906, 104 in 1905, 118 in 1904, and 88 in 1903. Three of the cases were from five to 15 years of age, and 63 from 25 to 65 years. Of the 85 cases notified, 10 were notified from the Workhouse, 15 from Brompton Hospital, two from St. Thomas's Hospital, and two were notified on discharge from the Army. In five of the cases no inquiries were made at the request of the medical attendant, and in three of the cases notified from the Brompton Hospital wrong addresses were given. 25 of the cases died, 12 were removed to the Infirmary, and one left the Borough, leaving 29 still under observation. At the close of 1907 there were still 11 cases under observation, and during 1908 six of these removed to other places outside the Borough, and one was removed to the Union Infirmary, leaving four of these cases still under observation. Of these four, one was notified in 1904, one in 1905, one in 1906, and one in 1907. The total number at the close of 1908 on the Register under observation is thus 33. In all 97 visits were made during the year by the female Sanitary Inspectors in connection with cases of Consumption. In 18 of the cases visited for the first time during the year a definite history of infection by a previous case in the family was obtained. The next Table shows the number of cases reported, exclusive of those reported from external Institutions, from 1903 to 1908. 121 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the total number, viz.:—432, 230 have died, 122 removed to other districts, 23 were stated to have recovered, six were stated after inquiry not to be suffering from Consumption, in 31 cases no inquiries were made, leaving 20 cases still living at the close of 1908. For statistical purposes it is unsatisfactory that the number of removals was so large, but in the majority of these cases it was impossible to ascertain the address to which the patient had gone. During the current year this will to a large extent be obviated, as the system of notification in force by District Medical Officers and Medical Officers of Poor Law Institutions, in combination with the notification of change of address by the Relieving Officer 'will, it is hoped, diminish the numbers under this heading.

The rate in the Union Infirmary showed a very slight increase, but the rate in the General and Special Hospitals was the same as the average. Previous to 1908 these rates showed a tendency to increase, the rate in 1907 having been 39.1 and in 1898 only 23.7, but in 1908 this rate dropped to 28.9, the greatest difference between 1907 and 1908 being in the rate in General and Special Hospitals. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 72 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute, six from Clapham, four from Putney, 23 from Streatham, five from Tooting, and 34 from Wandsworth.

Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. 294 deaths, 164 of males and 130 of females, were registered as having occurred from these diseases, compared with 285 in 1907 35 in 1906, and 317 in 1905. The number of deaths is thus nine above last year, but is 72 under the corrected decennial average. 119 of the deaths were due to Premature birth and 175 to Developmental diseases. 285 were of infants under one year, and nine of children from one to five years. 125 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths from these diseases is shown more in detail in Tables XIX. to XXV., which deal with Infantile Mortality in an earlier part of this Report.

From Accidents and diseases of Parturition 15 deaths occurred, all from 25 to 65 years. This, added to the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever, viz.:—6, gives a total of 21 deaths after childbirth, or a proportion of 2.8 per 1,000 births. In England and Wales for the year 1907, which is the latest available report, this rate was 3.83, and in the 10 years immediately preceding the average proportion had been 4.39 per 1,000 births. Of the 15. deaths three occurred in Clapham, eight in Streatham, two in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth. Nine of the deaths were due to Cardiac Syncope, three to Convulsions, two to Extra-uterine Gestation, and one to Haemorrhage. Diabetes Mellitus was the cause of 34 deaths, eight in Clapham, five in Putney, 11 in Streatham, and 10 in Wandsworth. From Acute Appendicitis there were 17 deaths during the year, four in Clapham, three in Putney, six in Streatham, and four in Wandsworth.

The number of deaths from Violence, although 17 more than in 1907, is 24 under the corrected decennial average. Inquests. The next Table shows the number of Inquests held in the Borough during the year. The total number was 205, compared with 181 in 1907, 215 in 1906, 177 in 1905, and 196 in 1904. 50 of the Inquests were held on persons who died in Clapham,. 23 in Putney, 38 in Streatham, 34 in Tooting, and 60 in Wandsworth.

Deaths and Causes of Death in Public Institutions. In the Public Institutions in the Borough 818 deaths occurred during the year, compared with 807 in 1907, 771 in 1906, 729 in 1905, and 669 in 1904. Of these 633 deaths were of persons not belonging to the Borough, compared with 660 in 1907, and 185 of persons belonging to the Borough, compared with 147 in 1907. The increase was due to the increase in the number of deaths of persons belonging to the Borough. In Clapham 55 deaths occurred in the Hostel of God, six of these being Borough residents. Of these 30 were due to Cancer, 21 to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, one from Organic disease of the Heart, one from other Tubercular disease, one from Old Age, and one from other causes. Seven deaths occurred in the Priory, Roehampton, two from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, two from Old Age, and three from other causes. In Streatham there were 18 deaths in St. Anne's Home and six in the Middlesex County Asylum Annexe. Of the 18 in St. Anne's Home one was from Influenza, nine were from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, one from Old Age, one from Bright's disease, one from Accident, and five from other causes. Of the six in the Middlesex County Asylum Annexe two were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, one from other forms of Tubercular diseases, one from Organic disease of the Heart, and two from other causes. In Tooting 535 deaths occurred in Public Institutions, 130 of which were of persons belonging to the Borough. Of the 268 deaths in the Tooting Bee Asylum, 115 were from Old Age, 10 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 48 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, 22 from diseases of the Heart, 33 from diseases of the Nervous System, 11 from Bright's disease, 10 from Cancer, four from Accident, and 15 from all other causes. 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the Fever Hospitals 126 deaths occurred, 48 of which belonged to the Borough, compared with 53 in 1907, 55 in 1906, 50 in 1905, and 106 in 1904. 63 of these deaths were from Scarlet Fever, 51 from Diphtheria, none from Enteric Fever, one from Measles, two from Tubercular diseases, one from Alcoholism, three from Developmental diseases, one from Organic disease of the Heart, one from Accident, and three from all other causes. 132 deaths occurred in the Tooting Home, 64 of which were Borough residents. 45 of these were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 37 from Old Age, 22 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, six from Cancer, two from Organic disease of the Heart, two from Influenza, one from Accident, and 17 from all other causes. In Wandsworth 85 deaths occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, 12 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, five in the Prison, and 23 in the Workhouse. Of the 85 deaths in the Middlesex County Asylum, 11 were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 13 from Old Age, nine from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, seven from Bright's disease, two from Enteritis, two from other forms of Tubercular diseases, 30 from diseases of the Brain and Nervous System (of which 21 were from General Paralysis of the Insane, and three from Apoplexy), one from Obstruction of Intestines, and 10 from other causes. Of the 12 deaths in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, one was from Influenza, two from Cancer, two from Chronic Bronchitis, one from Old Age, and six from all other causes. Of the five deaths in the Prison, two were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, two from other forms of Tubercular diseases, and one from other causes. Of the 23 deaths in the Workhouse, two were from Premature birth and Developmental diseases, 13 from Old Age, two from Organic disease of the Heart, one from Cancer, one from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, and four from other causes. 133 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In other places not Institutions 87 deaths occurred, 15 of these being from Accidents, three from Cancer, eight from Suicide, four from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, two from disease of the Heart, eight from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, four from Old Age, three from Nephritis, one from Influenza, one from Erysipelas, and 19 from all other causes. 27 of these deaths occurred in Private Nursing Homes, and eight in the River Thames. There has been a marked increase in the number of deaths in Institutions, and to show that the increase has been going on for for some years the following Table has been prepared. The comparative percentages for London are also shown, and it will be noted that in the 20 years 1888-1907 this increased in London from 23.6 to 39.8, with an average of 30.2, and in Wandsworth from 15.2 to 25.9, with an average of 18.6. In this Borough the percentage is lower than for the whole of London, and this is what might be expected in consequence of the social condition of the population, but in spite of the better social condition it is rather startling to find that over 25 per cent, of the total deaths occurred in Institutions, and that for the year 1908 12. per cent, occurred in Pauper Institutions. Compared with the 20 years' average the greatest increase has occurred among the deaths in General and Special Hospitals, while the deaths in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals show no marked difference.

In the Report for 1907 a Table was given showing the total number of female employees in laundries and other workshops in the Borough, but no further inquiry was made this year, as the conditions of employment have not changed to any extent. The number for 1907 may be taken as approximately correct for 1908 also. The next Table was also given in 1907 and the figures in the Report for 1908 do not materially differ, and they are, as in the former year, too few in number to draw any decided conclusions as to the effect of employment.

Among the 66 mothers employed industrially there were six deaths of infants, three of these being legitimate and three illegitimate, while among the 77 otherwise employed there were six deaths, and among the 1,853 who had no occupation there were 53. infantile deaths. Cutting-off Notices. During the year 60 notices with respect to 75 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 37 of these notices referred to premises in the Lambeth District supply, and 23 in the Southwark District supply. Five of the premises were in Clapham, 12 in Putney, 34 in Streatham, 16 in Tooting, and eight in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rate from 31 premises, from 26 premises in consequence of defects, in 16 the premises were empty, and in two the supply was withdrawn by request. Compared with 1907 there has been a considerable diminution in the number of notices received. There has been a diminution in the number of notices received in consequence of non-payment of rate, but an increase in the number where defects in the service existed. Mortuaries. No change has taken place in the four Mortuaries during the year. I have inspected them on several occasions and am able to report that the Regulations and By-laws made by the Council in 1905 have been in all cases complied with. The site of the new Mortuary for Wandsworth has not yet been decided on, and the matter is still under the consideration of the Public Health Committee. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 137 In Clapham 51 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, compared with 33 in 1907 ; in Streatham 38, compared with 49; and in Wandsworth 115, of which 56 were from Wandsworth, 29 from Putney, and 30 from Tooting; a total of 204, compared with 171 in 1907. General Sanitary Work in 1908. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year :— (1.) By request of the Licensing Justices the Council instructed me to inspect and report on the following public-houses, and also to give evidence before the Compensation Committee at the Sessions :— (a) "The Turk's Head," Garratt Lane, Wandsworth. (b) "The Horse and Groom," Garratt Lane, Wandsworth. (c) "The Sir Geoffrey Dunstan," Summerstown, Wandsworth. (2.) In consequence of a communication from the Local Government Board with regard to a letter received by them complaining of an open drain on Wimbledon Common, I made an inspection of all the ponds and ditches of that part of the Common which is situated in this Borough, and also of those on Putney Heath. No nuisance of any kind was discovered, and with respect to the particular drain complained of the following report was made :— 6th February, 1908. "In reply to the extract from Dr. Denny's letter to the Local Government Board with regard to the open drain from Kingsmere Lake, on Wimbledon Common, I have to report that Kingsmere is drained by a ditch into Scio Pond, from Scio Pond there is a ditch running to the way-side pond in Roehampton Lane, the overflow from which flows into a drain carried along Roehampton Lane, 138 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. then partly by drain and by open ditch through Manresa House grounds, Mount Clare grounds, and Richmond Park to Beverley Brook. The overflow from the Chelsea Water Works Reservoir flows into the ditch between Scio Pond and the way-side pond. "There is at no point in the course of this drain any connection with the sewage system, and no sewage from any of the houses enters the drain. The way-side pond in Roehampton Lane is 200 yards from the Infants' School, and was, at my request, cleaned out by the Conservators at the beginning of October, 1907. I inspected the pond at the time it was being cleaned out, and the material taken out consisted wholly of vegetable matter and earth which had been washed from the road and banks. "In my previous report on the outbreak at Roehampton I stated that all the drains, sewers and gullies had been inspected and thoroughly flushed, also that the drains at the school had been tested with water with a satisfactory result and a certificate granted in 1907." (3.) Special inspections were made of all the premises where offensive trades were carried on, for the purpose of examining the means adopted to comply with the London County Council By-laws as to the ventilation of such premises. The three premises dealt with during the year were :— (1.) Harrison, Barber & Co., Garratt Lane, Wandsworth. (2.) Ford's, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth. (3.) Dallett's, High Street, Putney. In all these some system of mechanical ventilation had been installed, and I am able to report that the By-laws have now been complied with. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 139 (4.) Special inspections were made on several occasions of the River Wandle, and some gaugings were taken for the purpose of ascertaining the normal discharge of the river. These gaugings were taken as a Bill had been introduced into Parliament to prohibit the Croydon Corporation from extracting more water from the Wandle at its source. The River Wandle enters this Borough at Summerstown, and for over half-a-mile forms the boundary between it and Wimbledon. For the one-and-a-half miles to the River Thames it is wholly in this Borough. On several occasions during the last 15 years I have called the attention of the Council to its polluted condition, and to the foul deposits which accumulate in the bed of the river in its whole course in the Borough. This deposit is, in my opinion, increasing, owing very largely to two causes : 1st, the greater amount of sewage which is discharged from the four outfalls, viz. :—those of Croydon Corporation, Carshalton District Council, Croydon Rural Council, and Wimbledon Corporation, this sewage containing a considerable amount of suspended matter; and 2nd, to a diminution of water in the river, this being caused by the lessened amount of water finding its way into the river from its natural gathering grounds owing to the great increase in the number of houses in Tooting and Wandsworth. There has also been a diminution in the amount of water from the River Graveney owing to the same cause. Roughly speaking, one sixth of the whole volume of the river water from Wickens-Pease's works consists of water from sewage farms, and I am decidedly of opinion that any further abstraction of water from the Wandle at its source would cause an increase in the amount of solid matter and therefore greater pollution. On the 2nd July I gauged the flow of the river at Penwith Road bridge, and I calculated that at the time the 143 Report,of the Medical Officer of Health. charge was only a little over 30 million gallons in the 24 hours, a considerable diminution from the gaugings made about the same place in the year 1851, which gave a discharge of over 80 million gallons. (5.) Special inspections were again made this year of several localities in consequence of complaints of smells from sewer ventilators. These complaints were more numerous in 1908 than in 1907, chiefly on account of the increase in the number received from Putney. In all 143 complaints were received, six from Clapham North, 10 from Clapham South, 33 from Putney, 24 from Streatham, eight from Balham, 11 from Tooting, 24 from Southfield, eight from Fairfield, and 19 from Springfield Wards. All these complaints were forwarded to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who reported that in every case the necessary cleansing and flushing or other work had been carried out. (6.) Numerous inspections were again made of several mews and passages during the year, and it is satisfactory to be able to report that several of these have been effectually dealt with, while others will be completed during the early part of the current year. (a) Passage in rear of 122, 124, 126, Upper Tooting Road, paved. (b) Passage in rear of 1-16, The Parade, Tooting, paved. (c) Passage in rear of 17-24, The Parade, Tooting, paved. (d) Passage between 41 and 43, High Street, and in rear of 43 and 45, High Street, Tooting, paved. Report of the Medical Officer of' Health. 141 (e) Passage off Montserrat Road, and in rear of 97-109, High Street, Putney, paved. (f) Passage off Disraeli Road in rear of 137-151, High Street, Putney, paved. (g) With reference to the passage at the rear of 152-180, Streatham High Road, as no work was being done to abate the nuisance proceedings were taken against the owners, but before the hearing of the summonses work was begun and this will shortly be satisfactorily carried out. (h) Road between 205 and 207, Brixton Hill. The condition of this road has been the cause of several complaints by the occupiers of houses in Holmwood Gardens, and many difficulties have arisen with respect to ownership and consequent responsibility as to the persons liable to abate the nuisance. A satisfactory settlement has, however, now been arrived at, and I anticipate that in the spring of the current year the road will be properly made up and the nuisance abated. (i) Field's Alley, Wandsworth, is still in hand, but the necessary paving has not been done, owing chiefly to change of ownership. This also will be paved satisfactorily during the current year. (k) With regard to land at the rear of Blackshaw Road, owing to the difficulty of ascertaining the owners as defined by the Public Health Act, nothing has been done, but as soon as the actual owners are found the necessary notices will be served. (7.) In consequence of complaints from the tenants of the houses in Floss Street, Putney, I made an inspection of them on the 4th May, 1908, and reported to the Committee that, in my opinion, the basement tenements were at that time unfit for habitation in consequence of an accumulation of water in the 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. yards, which extended into several of the basements. Notices were served on the owners, and although some of the occupiers vacated the houses, no work was done to permanently abate the nuisance. The matter came before the magistrate and was adjourned, as the owners promised to arrange with the Ranelagh Club, whose premises adjoin the houses, to construct a drain to the Beverley Brook. This was done and all the water was satisfactorily drained away. The subsoil and the basements still continued damp and I advised the owners to construct a drain in the yards to discharge into the drain which had been made by the Ranelagh Club, and at present this is being done. The owners have also carried out a considerable amount of other work in the houses themselves, sothat they will, during the current year, be again rendered fit for habitation. (8.) Special inspections were made in Fairfield and part of Southfield Wards for the purpose of ascertaining the number of empty houses in these districts available for the working classes. This inspection was necessary to enable me to give evidence at the Local Government Board Inquiry into the demolition of houses in Fairfield Ward by the Wandsworthand Putney Gas Light and Coke Company. (9.) Special house-to-house inspections were made in the following streets during the year :— Clapham.— St. Alphonsus Road. Lower Orchard Street. Nelson's Row. White Square. Carfax Square. Putney.— Norroy Road. Weiss Road. Biggs' Row. Russell Place. Brewhouse Lane. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 143 Streatham.— Larch Road. Foss Road. Hazelhurst Road. Danbrook Road. Wandsworth.— Wardley Street. Point Pleasant. Hill's Yard. Cumber's Yard. Guelph Street. Lydden Grove. (10.) In accordance with the instructions of the Public Health Committee I made, in March, an inspection of the River Wandle at the outfall of the Croydon Rural Sewage Farm, and another sample of the effluent was taken. This sample showed the following results, and for comparison the results of the analysis of the sample taken in September, 1907, is also given :— September, 1907. March, 1908. Grains pererallon.

Including the above house-to-house inspections, but excluding the routine inspections of bakehouses, slaughterhouses, cowsheds, and offensive trade premises, 1,046 inspections were made of premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance was necessary at the Police Court on 12 occasions during the year. Revenue Act. During the year 20 certificates were granted under the above Act, two were deferred and three refused. The certificates granted referred to 71 houses or 156 separate tenements. Sanitary Operations. The Table of Sanitary Operations shows in detail the amount and nature of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,645, compared with 1,836 in 1907, 1,595 in 1906, and 1,357 in 1905. There was an increase in Putney, Balham, Tooting, and Southfield Wards, and a decrease in both Wards in Clapham, Streatham, Springfield, and Fairfield Wards. 13 of these complaints were made to the London County Council, and these were all at once attended to. The number of houses and premises inspected was 24,892, an increase of 662 compared with the previous year. There was an increase in the number of houses and premises inspected in Putney, Streatham, Southfield, Fairfield, and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Clapham North and South, Balham, and Tooting Wards. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 145 The total number of house-to-house inspections made was 5)575) compared with 5,718 in 1907, 5,686 in 1906, 6,290 in 1905, and 6,440 in 1904. There has been an increase in the number of house-to-house inspections in the Putney, Streatham, Balham, and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Clapham North and South, and Tooting Wards. The decrease in house-to-house inspections which, however, was not great, was due partly to the great amount of illness from which members of the staff suffered during the year. This was altogether due to Influenza, which attacked nearly every member of the staff in one form or another. The decrease was also partly due to the increased amount of necessary work to be carried out by the Inspectors, and to the amount of infectious diseases that occurred in some of the districts. At the close of the year an additional Sanitary Inspector was appointed, and I anticipate that during 1909 there will be an increase in the amount of house-tohouse inspections, especially in Tooting and Streatham Wards. 146 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In 3,303 out of a total of 5,575 houses inspected, or 59.24 per cent., sanitary defects necessitating the service of an intimation notice were found. The highest percentage was in the Streatham Ward, where the percentage was 72.02, and the lowest in Southfield Ward, where it was only 42.97, the next lowest being Clapham North Ward, where it was 48.40. The following Table, which is prepared from the figures given in the summary, shows the percentage to total number of families of those living in one, two, three or four rooms and upwards, in the separate Wards and in the whole Borough, in the premises Inspected in 1908.

The greatest number of intimation notices was served in Balham and Spring-field Wards, and the smallest number in Southfield and Streatham Wards. The greatest number of statutory notices was served in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Putney and Fairfield Wards. 154 of the statutory notices served in 1908 were not complied with.

Putney, 93 from Streatham, 22 from Tooting, and 86 from Wandsworth) were received during the year. These complaints were as in previous years attended to by the Dusting Inspectors. Removal of House Refuse. No change has taken place in the methods of removal or disposal of house refuse during the year, details of which have been given in previous reports. During the 12 months ending March, 1908, the quantity of dust collected and disposed of was approximately 58,623 tons, compared with 53,536 tons in the previous year, and the total cost of collection and disposal was £16,288, compared with ,£17,076. 172 statutory notices were served under section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide ashpits in accordance with the By-laws, and these have been complied with. 1,025 yards in connection with dwelling houses, and 135 in connection with stables, were paved, drained or cleansed, compared with 1,084 and* 84 in 1907. 5,856 rooms and 1,327 staircases and passages were cleansed or repaired, compared with 5,456 rooms and 945 staircases and passages in 1907. The greatest number of rooms cleansed was in the Balham Ward, where 1,266 were done, and in Springfield Ward, where 1,127 wee done, and the smallest number in Putney and Southfield Wards. 1,272 drains were cleansed or repaired and 99 rain-water pipes disconnected from the drains. 124 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent to the Borough Surveyor from this Department: 18 in Clapham, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 161 pared with 25 in 1907; nine in Putney, compared with five; 41 in Streatham, compared with 70; 12 in Tooting, compared with 12 ; and 44 in Wandsworth, compared with 45. The total number of houses where the drains were reconstructed during the year was 289, 43 in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 106 in Streatham, 30 in Tooting, and 94 in Wandsworth. 361 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice, compared with 266 in 1907, 59 in Clapham, 46 in Putney, 159 in Streatham, 40 in Tooting, and 57 in Wandsworth. There has been an increase in the number of cases dealt with in all the sub-districts. 55 notices were served for the periodical removal of the manure every 48 hours, compared with 33 in 1907, 16 in 1906, and 20 in 1905.

This nuisance was most common in Streatham and Springfield Wards, Wandsworth, and the animals kept were chiefly ducks and hens. 90 smoke nuisances were reported during the year, three in Clapham, nine in Putney, nine in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 67 in Wandsworth. Proceedings were taken in one case during the year, and a fine of 20s. was inflicted and 7s. costs. 162 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 15 complaints of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department of the London County Council with regard to 22 premises, and 13 complaints from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society with regard to 21 premises. These complaints were all at once attended to and the premises kept under observation. 125 soil pipes were repaired, 16 in Clapham, 18 in Putney 58 in Streatham, one in Tooting, and 32 in Wandsworth, compared with 184 in 1907, and 185 in 1906. 945 leaky roofs and gutters were repaired, compared with 812 in 1907. 97 unwholesome or dilapidated houses were cleansed and repaired, 30 in Clapham, 15 in Putney, 12 in Streatham, 19 in Tooting, and 21 in Wandsworth, compared with 56 in 1907.

The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 2,868 (497 in Clapham, 140 in Putney, 788 in Streatham, 495 in Tooting, and 948 in Wandsworth), compared with 3,206 in 1907, 2,794 in 1906, and 2,947 in 1905. The decrease was chiefly due to the decrease in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever. 1,826 lots of bedding were stoved at the Disinfecting Station, compared with 1,948 in 1907, 1,669 in 1906 and 1,778 in 1905. The 1,826 lots of bedding included the following —1,301 beds, 1,290 bolsters, 2,856 pillows, 1,219 mattresses, 505 palliasses, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 163 2,227 sheets, 1,983 quilts, 736 cushions, 5,730 articles of clothing-, 3,608 blankets, 543 carpets, and 2,236 extra articles, a total of 24,034 articles, compared with 29,102 in 1907, 28,885 in 1906, and 30,477 in 1905. 884 premises were disinfected after Measles and 184 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs, compared with 955 and 135 in 1907. 22 beds, 11 bolsters, 32 pillows, 36 mattresses, 39 palliasses, eight sheets, eight quilts, 27 cushions, 88 articles of clothing, 18 blankets, 11 carpets, and 159 extra articles, were removed and destroyed by request of the owners during the year.

The disinfection by steam was carried out at the Station at Tooting, and I am pleased to report that this Station has proved most satisfactory in every way. I have regularly visited the Station during the year, and am able to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. Only two complaints of damage to goods by disinfection have been received, and on inquiry it was found that the goods were damaged or stained before being placed in the disinfecting chamber. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was as follows — 164 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. £ 5. d.

Cost per lot of bedding 13s. 9d. Cleansing of Persons Act. The baths at the Disinfecting Station have been more used this year, chiefly owing to the number of adults dealt with. The names of 125 children, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In the majority of cases only the heads of the children were verminous, but in a considerable number the bodies and clothing were also verminous. Of these latter, 29, 19 boys and 10 girls, were cleansed at the baths, and the clothing was at the same time stoved with beneficial results. 12 adults also had baths, two being nurses who had been in attendance on cases of Puerperal Fever, six were contacts with cases of Scarlet Fever, while four, three males and one female, were verminous. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 165 Inspection of Urinals in connection with Licensed Premises. The number of urinals inspected was 127, 36 in Clapham, 20 in Putney, 27 in Streatham, 14 in Tooting-, and 40 in Wandsworth. 366 inspections were made during the year and 64 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served and complied with. Police Court Proceedings. The list* which follows shows particulars of Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. The total amount of fines inflicted was £27 4s., and the costs £11 11s., compared with £99 8s. 6d. and £14 6s. 5d. in 1907. The majority of the summonses served were with respect to nuisances or contravention of By-laws, but three of the cases were for permitting a house to be occupied without first having obtained a certificate from the Sanitary Authority that the premises had a proper and sufficient supply of water. Two were for exposing unsound food for sale, one for carrying carcase of a horse through the street in an improper vehicle, and one for carrying on the business of a purveyor of milk without being registered.

At the close of 1907 there were 364 milkshops on the Register, 37 have been added in 1908 and 34 removed, leaving 367 on the Register at the end of 1908. During the year 874 inspections were made of these premises and 59 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. One prosecution was instituted for carrying on the business of a dairyman without being registered and a fine of 8s. was imposed with 7s. costs. 170 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Special attention has again been given this year to the enforcing of the Milkshop Regulations, and the notice of all registered purveyors of milk was called to the regulations which deal with the protection of milk against infection or contamination. Very important and necessary powers have been given to Sanitary Authorities by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5, to remove from or refuse to enter on the Register the name of persons carrying on the trade of cowkeepers or dairymen or purveyors of milk upon premises which are, in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority, for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk therein. During the present year a special inspection will be made of all these premises and a special report made on the subject. Cowsheds.

During the year 365 inspections were made of these, but it was only necessary to serve three notices for cleansing. The usual cleansing was carried out by the occupiers at the proper times. During the year the Inspectors inspected the carcases of 300 cattle, 2,221 sheep, 215 pigs, and 46 calves in Slaughter-houses and Butcher's Shops, and reported that all the animals were healthy. 172 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In all 272 inspections of these were made during the year, but it was only necessary to serve two notices, which were at once complied with. With regard to No. 3 no boiling or melting has been done on these premises during the year. At all the other premises the By-laws with respect to ventilation have been complied with. Ice Cream Premises. At the end of 1907 there were 235 of these on the Register. During 1908 47 were added and 31 removed, leaving a total of 251 on the Register. 345 inspections were made of these premises during the year and 23 notices were served, all of which were for cleansing. Houses Let in Lodgings. At the end of 1907 there were 229 houses let in lodgings on the Register. 39 were added during 1908 and one removed, making a total of 267 on the Register at the end of 1908. 705 inspections of these were made during the year, and 434 notices were served, 17 for overcrowding and 417 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. With regard to one premises a summons was issued for failing to cleanse, and a conviction was obtained. 175 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. No difficulties have arisen during the year in carrying out these By-laws, and I am again able to report that all these premises have been kept in much better condition since being placed on the Register. Offensive Trade Refuse. In June I made the following report to the Public Health Committee with regard specially to the removal of fish offal— "25th June, 1908. "On the 21 st May, 1908, I received a report from one of the Sanitary Inspectors that at 7.40 a.m. on that date he saw a four-wheeled van, with a large iron tank inside, proceeding along Upper Richmond Road, the smell from the van being most offensive. It stopped at the rear entrance in Charlwood Road of the fishmongers at 306, Upper Richmond Road. The Inspector examined the tank and found it was covered with sacking over the rear half, the other half being uncovered. The tank was full of fish offal. The name painted on the van was Fred. S. Hempleman, Crow's Road, West Ham, and the driver's name and address was Henry Monk, 20, Ranleigh Road, West Ham. On receipt of this report I communicated with Messrs. Hempleman, who asked for an appointment to talk over the whole matter. "Messrs. Hempleman's representative called on the 25th May and informed me that it had always been their practice since the beginning of the contract to collect the fish offal from seven premises in Putney with an open van, as they were aware that this method of collection was carried out in Putney by other contractors. "1 have had an inspection made of all the premises in the Borough from which fish offal is removed, and of 122 the offal is removed by Messrs. Hempleman in 82, and in 40 by other contractors. Out of the 82 premises from which it is removed by Messrs. Hempleman, in 75 it is removed in tins as agreed on and in seven by open van. In the 40 premises 176 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. from which this offal is removed by other contractors, in 36it is removed by open vans and in four by tins. "The following Table shows the method of removal in the different Parishes:— Parish. Removed by Hempleman. Removed by other Contractors. Clapham 20 tins. 7 vans. Putney 4 „ 7 vans. 5 „ 2 tins. Streatham 33 „ 2 „ Tooting 9 „ 1 „ Wandsworth 9 „ 21 „ 2 „ Whole Borough 75 „ 7 „ 36„ 4 „ "The arrangement with Messrs. Hempleman was entered into in 1903, and the following circular was sent to those requiring the removal of offensive trade refuse:— " 'Council House, " 'Wandsworth, S.W., " '20th February, 1904. " 'Sir, " 'Collection of offensive trade refuse. " 'Referring to my circular letter of the 12th June,. 1901, with reference to the removal and disposal of fishmongers' and butchers' offal, the Council has again had the subject under consideration, and I am directed to inform you that, owing to the difficulty experienced in disposing of the offal, the Council has been compelled tomake other arrangements for the service. "A contract has therefore been entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, who undertake to collect and dispose of trade refuse in a similar 177 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. manner to that adopted by the Council, leaving the requisite number of empty tins when removing those containing waste, upon the undermentioned charges, which are practically the same as made by the Council, viz. " 'Where the quantity removed does not exceed three tins per week.—One shilling. " 'Where the quantity exceeds three and does not exceed six tins per week.—Two shillings. " 'Where the quantity exceeds six and does not exceed nine tins per week.—Three shillings " 'Where the quantity exceeds nine and does not exceed twelve tins per week.—Four shillings. " 'Any greater quantity than twelve tins to be charged for at the same rate. " 'Yours obediently, (Signed) " 'Henry George Hii.ls, " 'Town Clerk.' "The only alteration that has been made since that date was that the minimum charge was increased to two shillings instead of one shilling. During the time the contract has been in operation I have had very few complaints with regard to the removal carried out by Messrs. Hempleman, but I am of opinion that it would be advisable for the Council to issue a new circular which could be sent to the 122 occupiers of premises from which such offensive trade refuse requires to be removed. "The removal of fish offal in vans is not an infringement of the By-laws made under Sec. 16 (2.) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provided that the van is 'constructed and furnished with coverings so as to prevent the escape of any matter or liquid therefrom, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom.' No pressure can therefore be brought to bear upon the other contractors provided they comply with this By-law, but I think it would be advisable for the occupiers of the premises from which offensive trade 178 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. refuse is removed by contractors other than Messrs. Hempleman, to be informed that such refuse should be stored on their premises in proper receptacles, and that fresh receptacles should be left every time such refuse is removed." Messrs. Hempleman informed me in July that the removal of fish offal from the shops in Putney which was formerly done by means of a tank van was now being carried out by means of proper sealed tins. No other complaints were received during the year with reference to the removal of offensive trade refuse. Unsound Food. During the year 1 box of Catfish, 2 boxes of Codfish, 1 box of Sprats, 1 box of Plaice, 2 boxes of Mackerel, 2 cases of Coalfish, 3 boxes of Herrings, 1 box of Whiting, 1 box of Dabs, 1 box of Soles, 3 boxes of Grapes, 1 case of Bananas, 7 baskets of Currants, 10 boxes of Tomatoes, and 16 baskets of Strawberries, were destroyed at the request of the owners, and the usual certificates granted. Factories and Workshops. Although there has been a slight decrease in the number of inspections of factories and workshops during the year, owing chiefly to illness among members of the staff, yet a large amount of work has been successfully carried out, and I am able to report that the condition of these is generally satisfactory. Outworkers' lists have again been the cause of a considerable amount of correspondence, but the circular issued in 1907 has been productive of beneficial results, a greater proportion of the lists having this year been sent in twice without a reminder. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both male and female Inspectors is there summarised in a concise form. 179 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,804, including 160 retail bakehouses, 149 workshop laundries, 313 dressmakers' and milliners' premises, and 1,182 other workshops, but not including 302 factories, 910 workplaces, and 331 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1908 3,347 premises, compared with 3,281 in 1907, 3,096 in 1906, 3,045 in 1905, 2,987 in 1904, and 2,676 in 1903. The total number of inspections made during the year was 5,801, compared with 6,048 in 1907, 5,997 in 1906, 4,933 in 1905, and 4,946 in 1904. The total number of notices served was 434, 403 intimation and 31 statutory, compared with 453 in 1907, 427 in 1906, 462 in 1905, and 465 in 1904. There was only one prosecution under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for the emission of black smoke. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. In all 614 inspections were made of 302 factories, and 51 notices, 48 intimation and three statutory, were served. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,804, 149 of which were workshop laundries, 160 workshop bakehouses, and 1,495 other workshops. The increase in the number of workshop laundries is due to the repeal of Section 103 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. All laundries where there is employment are now classed as workshops. 180 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all 3,130 inspections of these were made, compared with 3,148 in 1907, 3,233 in 1906, and 2,628 in 1905, and 216 intimation and 19 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 910, and 1,676 inspections were made, while 109 intimation and 10 statutory notices were served. The total number of defects found was 609, including 16 cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses, compared with 545 and 16 in 1907. To abate these nuisances 373 intimation and 32 statutory notices were served, all of which, with the exception of 12, were complied with at the end of the year. The 12 outstanding were complied with, with two exceptions, in the first month of this year. These two exceptions were two laundries which were given up shortly after service of the notices. In all, 609 defects were found and 532 remedied, but only 373 intimation notices were served, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises. i8i Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Table which follows and which relates to Home Work is similar to the one in last year's Report, except that the number of notices served on occupiers as to keeping or sending- lists is given. There has been an increase of 18 in the number of lists sent in twice a year, and a decrease of three in the number sent in once a year. 184 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all, 148 lists were received twice in the year, containing the names and addresses of 38 contractors and 476 workers, and 15 lists once in the year, containing the names and addresses of seven contractors and 17 workers. The total number of addresses received from other Councils was 352, compared with 322 in 1907, and 173 in 1906, and 301 addresses were forwarded to other Councils,, compared with 325 in 1907, and 122 in 1906. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers:—Battersea 66, Lambeth 59, Stepney 58, Camberwell 17, Merton 14, Fulham 11, Southwark 10, Chelsea seven, Hammersmith six, Bethnal Green and Croydon five each, East Ham, Stratford, Bermondsey, Ilford and City of London four each, Hampstead and Hackney three each, Poplar, Islington, St. Pancras, Westminster, Wimbledon, and Chiswick two each, Willesden, Holborn, Finsbury, Stoke Newington, and Penge one each. 63 names and addresses were forwarded to this Borough in error and are not included in the above Table. The number of notices sent to employers during the year was 140, and these had a most satisfactory result, although in some cases it was also necessary for the Inspector to call and warn them that if such lists were not sent proceedings would be taken. At the end of 1907 there were 290 outworkers' premises on the Register, 102 were added and 61 removed during the year, leaving 331 on the Register. 381 inspections were made of these premises during the year, and 30 notices, all for cleansing, were served and complied with. During the year 22 cases of infectious disease were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers, compared with six in 1907, six in 1906, and five in 1905. 185 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. † The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. § In view of the wide discrepancies found to exist between the totals in the two columns when the returns are added together, it is desired that care may be taken to give exact figures. Only those addresses should be counted which have actually been received from or forwarded to other Councils during the year covered by the report. 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five divisions: (1) factories, (2) workshops, (3) •domestic workshops, (4) workplaces, and (5) outworkers' premises. The total number of inspections was 2,263, compared with 2,408 in 1907 and 1,964 in 1906, and re-inspections 1,394, compared with 1,298 and 1,649. 809 of the inspections and 1.41 of the re-inspections were in Clapham, 245 and 481 in Putney, 454 and 166 in Streatham, 152 and 63 in Tooting, and 603 and 544 in Wandsworth. Three workshops where males were employed were notified to H.M. Inspector, and eight were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. In all the workshops under the supervision of the male Inspectors only five cases of overcrowding were discovered, and these were at once remedied. 188 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of premises inspected was 1,869 (406 in Clapham, 264 in Putney, 482 in Streatham, 107 in Tooting, and 610 in Wandsworth). 191 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 161 inspections were made of factories, 1,054 of workshops, '88 of domestic workshops, 370 of workplaces, and 196 of outworkers' premises, while 348 premises were visited for enquiry and no workroom found. There were only four cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with four in 1907, five in 1906, 12 in 1905, and 17 in 1904, and these were at once abated. One was insufficiently ventilated, and 25 were found to be in a dirty condition, compared with 13 and 66 in 1907. In every workshop inspected there were separate water closets for the sexes, but in 13 factories and 19 workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in three factories, 27 workshops, six domestic workshops, 26 workplaces, and eight outworkers' premises, and these have all been abated. It was only necessary to serve 111 intimation and two statutory notices, and these were all complied with with the exception of 11, five in Streatham, one in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth. Two of these premises ceased to be workshops, and the notices for the others were complied with in the beginning of the current year. It was not necessary to take any proceedings during the year. 38 workshops and five domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector of Workshops, and 32 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. Only five of the workshops reported by H.M. Inspector were unknown to the Sanitary Inspectors. The other 27 had been previously reported by me, or were already on the Register.

Table LXXXVIII. shows the number of factories, workshops, domestic workshops, and workplaces on the Register at the close of 1907, the number removed from, the number added during 1908, and the number on the Register at the end of 1908. The number of workrooms in workshops is also shown. The factories and workshops are divided into dressmakers' and milliners' premises, laundries, and miscellaneous premises; and the workplaces are divided into laundries and miscellaneous premises. Of the total number of factories where women are employed, 70 are laundries and 17 other factories, while of the total workshops, viz.:—514, 313 are dressmakers and milliners, 149 laundries and 52 other workshops, a decrease of 10 dressmakers and milliners and of four other workshops, and an increase of 35 laundries, compared with 1907. 194 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of workplaces on the Register is 294, of which 85 are laundries, and 209 miscellaneous premises, chiefly dressmakers and milliners. Table LXXXIX. shows the nature of the trades carried on in the workshops inspected. There has again been a slight decrease in the numbers, chiefly due to dullness of trade, and also to the fact that several small laundries which were classed as workplaces have now been given up. The number of dressmakers, milliners, etc., remains about the same as in the previous year. The total number, viz.:—887 (165 in Clapham, 114 in Putney, 298 in Streatham, 79 in Tooting, and 231 in Wandsworth), is 25 less than in 1907, the greatest decrease having occurred in Clapham. 196 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the year 65 inspections of Canal Boats were made, but no notices were served. The condition of all the boats inspected was reported to be satisfactory. 197 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Statement of Work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the past year 1,004 samples of foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, compared with 989 in 1907, and 905 in 1906. Of these, 88 or 8.76 per cent. were reported to be adulterated, compared with 8.49 per cent. in 1907, and 9.29 per cent. in 1906. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 6.9, compared with 10.97 in 1907, and 10.26 in 1906. In sixteen of the adulterated milk samples the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of the sale, decided not to prosecute the vendor, so that the percentage of prosecutions was only 3.8, compared with 5.9 in 1907. In 50 out of the 88 cases in which adulterations were detected proceedings were instituted against the vendor, compared with 52 in 1907. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year amounted to £82 5s., and the costs to £36 4s. 6d., making a total of £118 9s. 6d., compared with £167 4s. in 1907. 198 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The system whereby the Inspector is allowed to employ his own assistants continues to work admirably, enabling him to change his agents from time to time as he thinks desirable, and although there are, and must necessarily be, offenders who remain undetected, I am convinced from the methods adopted that the resulting percentage of adulterations, viz.:—8'76, represents as nearly as may be the actual amount of adulteration. Much valuable assistance and information has been given to the Inspector during the year by the officers of adjoining Boroughs, more especially with regard to that class of trader who is increasing in numbers, viz. :—the peripatetic milk vendor and butter hawker, persons who trade here, there, and everywhere with no special trade connections, who are frequently not registered in the Borough, and who have no permanent residence. 202 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the average per 1,000 of population, the number of adulterations detected, and the percentage of adulterations.

The system of notifying to the various public bodies the figures of analysis obtained with respect to samples so taken is still continued. Much might be done to prevent the sophistication of milk supplied to Public Institutions by wholesale contractors were some such system adopted as that which is in operation at an Institution under the Metropolitan Asylums Board in this Borough. I am informed that upon the arrival of every consignment of milk at this particular Institution it is personally received by the Steward, samples are taken from each churn, and arc analysed by means of a small centrifugal machine whilst the carman waits. Should any milk fall below the required standard it is not accepted, the carman has to take it away, and in accordance with the terms of the contract the Steward is empowered to purchase what he requires elsewhere and charge the same to the contractor. This system 203 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. has been in operation for some considerable time with very satisfactory results. I am informed that the Metropolitan Asylums Board have decided to extend this practice to each of their Institutions. 30 samples have been procured in course of delivery at the various railway stations in the Borough, only one of which proved upon analysis to be adulterated. In this case the Public Health 'Committee did not consider the amount of adulteration sufficient to warrant proceedings being taken. Of the three samples taken at private premises, one proved to be adulterated. The particulars of this case were as follows:- A., a baker and confectioner in the Borough, was in the habit of obtaining a considerable quantity of butter from a large wholesale firm, for which he paid a good price. After being supplied for a short period he found he could not obtain satisfactory results with his pastry and endeavoured to ascertain the cause. His suspicions were aroused, and he came to the conclusion that it was due to the quality of the butter. The Inspector was called in and arranged to procure a sample as it was delivered. This done it was discovered that the article which was being delivered as butter was really a mixture containing no less than 87 per cent, of margarine. The following Table gives the results of the analyses of the samples taken as above stated at the various Public Institutions, railway stations and private premises, and the percentage of adulterations in each case.

Of these, 13 were found to be adulterated, this being a percentage of nine, compared with 7.1 in 1907, and 7.08 in 1906.

In the case of the potted meats, however, the adulteration was confined to a boron preservative which in no single instance was in such quantity as would permit of proceedings being taken. This, in my opinion, is a very satisfactory 205 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. feature of the work done in connection with the Acts in question. They are of necessity preventive measures and if the manufacturers and wholesale dealers find that active steps are being taken to abolish the use of such preservatives within fair limits, then they must perforce adopt a different system in the preparation of the goods. Whilst referring to the subject of potted goods it may be noted that in one instance where potted beef was asked for and the article served was delivered in a tin bearing the label "Potted Beef," it was found on analysis to consist entirely of bloater paste. With regard to the adulteration detected under the heading of confectionery and jam, viz.:—33 per cent., it must be borne in mind that only three samples were purchased. Again, the sample of black currant jam which was found to be adulterated was taken owing to a communication received from the officer in another Borough, but it was found that although adulterated with 75 per cent. of apple pulp an ambiguously worded disclosure was attached by label to the jar. This the Council's solicitor deemed sufficient to protect the vendor, and advised that a conviction could not be obtained. Of the total number of samples taken, 799 or 78 per cent. were purchased by deputies. The Inspector has had during the year five female and four male assistants, as well as two young girls and two boys. It has been found necessary during the past year to procure more supplementary samples than during the previous years, and in several instances a person has been employed for periods ranging from two to six weeks, obtaining goods at various shops prior to an official sample being taken. This has been done with the view of allowing the assistant engaged to become known to the trader as a customer, but it seems to me to be desirable that some arrangement might be made whereby these supplementary samples could be roughly analysed in order that the Inspector could better form an opinion as to the methods adopted by the trader in question. Official figures relating to such test samples prove that the informal samples thus taken afford a better indication of adulteration than is given by formal sampling. 2o6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the period under notice the Inspector has reported to me on many occasions that he has had great difficulty in obtaining several samples in one locality, in fact in several instances he has found that after taking one sample in a neighbourhood before he can get to the next shop information has been given to other traders in the neighbourhood. On one occasion, a Saturday night, two loafers saw the officer sampling in a shop and made it their business to call at every shop in that road, doubtless to give information to the traders. This is difficult of proof, and even if proved could not in law be held to be obstruction, but from the reports received from other districts there is no doubt that such men are recognised and find it to their advantage. To those intimately acquainted with the work of detecting adulteration it is well known that some fraudulent traders make it a practice to sell adulterated goods intermittently, so as to have a better chance of evading detection, and it does not necessarily follow that because an adulterated sample is sold in one instance the article supplied to another purchaser will also be adulterated. In one case reported to the Board of Agriculture, suspicion as to the methods of a certain trader having been aroused, no less than 40 test samples were taken and analysed, 28 of these were reported genuine whilst 12 were illegal mixtures. During the year considerable attention has been directed to procuring samples on Friday and Saturday nights, and also to sampling milk in the early morning, as it was felt that it was principally during the busy marketing hours that fraud was practised, and the results obtained have amply justified that conclusion. In only three cases during the year have summonses been dismissed owing to the defendants pleading the warranty clause. In each instance the article in question was milk. As I pointed out in my last Report every effort should be made by Local Authorities to procure the abolition of this, the easiest defence that can possibly be set up, as it is a constant menace to the effective prevention of adulteration. It is my duty to again call attention to the great increase in the number of itinerant milk vendors who are selling separated 207 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. milk in the Borough. The evils attached to the sale of this commodity are much greater than would at first appear. If separated milk is sold as such well and good, but I know from experience that much of the evil practices in connection with the milk trade is due solely to this source. The following are a few instances which have been brought under my notice during the year :— A vendor residing outside this Borough—as indeed most of them do—advertised very extensively by means of handbills that he was prepared to deliver pure new milk three times daily at 2jd. per quart. The Inspector endeavoured to procure a sample, but he found on applying for it the seller stated that he had three kinds of milk, viz.:—new milk, hand-skimmed milk, and machine-skimmed or separated milk, and he could have which he wished. Knowing that there was no hand-skimmed milk consigned to the Borough the Inspector then asked him where he procured the article, and he obtained the somewhat astonishing answer that "he made it." Upon inquiring further how, the officer was informed that half a churn of new milk was mixed with half a churn of separated milk, and that hand-skimmed milk was the result. This article is undoubtedly foisted on the unsuspicious poor for genuine new milk. It is also interesting to note that in every instance the vessels containing these various milks are distinctly marked, but needless to say it is impossible for the ordinary purchaser to notice this, as the inscription being on the top of the lid when the can is closed, it follows that it cannot be seen when it is open and the vendor is serving. Another instance of the same kind :— A., an itinerant seller, procured a small contract to supply a cookery school in the Borough at a uniform price of 4d. per quart, the ordinary retail price. Information reached the Inspector as to this, and knowing the character of the dealer in question, he managed, after some considerable difficulty, to obtain a sample, which proved on analysis to be deficient in cream to the extent of 208 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 26 per cent. In this case the magistrate inflicted a penalty of £20 with £3 5s. costs. The sale of separated milk offers very great temptation to the ordinary milk carrier, that is, the servant employed by the retailer, and it is known that many of these separated milk vendors sell a quantity to carriers in order that the said carriers may supplement their wages. This is a grave menace to the honest retailer, who is entirely at the mercy of his servant, for as the present law stands the master is liable for the action of his servant, and in one instance during the year the Inspector was successful in actually seeing the adulteration committed. In any future legislation with regard to milk it is imperative that the sale of separated milk should be prohibited entirely, or as an alternative it should only be sold from churns and vessels distinctly coloured, say a bright red, as is done in Chicago, and that new milk shall not be sold from the same barrow or cart. The public would thus be protected from the substitution of the inferior for the genuine article. Whilst dealing with this subject I may point out the diminution in the number of cases in which milk is found to be adulterated with water. This class of offence is rapidly dying out, and in my opinion it is principally due to the facilities which obtain at the present time for the dishonest trader to obtain separated milk, there being not so great a risk of detection in the addition of separated milk to new milk as in the old method of dilution by water. I am pleased to report that in no instance during the year has it been necessary to institute proceedings against any tradesman for refusing to serve the Inspector, or for obstructing him in the execution of his duty. 209 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Staff of the Department. An additional Sanitary Inspector was appointed towards the -close of the year, and the following report was made as to the alterations of the districts that would be necessary. The report was adopted by the Council, and the new Inspector, who was transferred from the Borough Engineer's Department, commenced his duties on the 27th November, 1908.

No change is necessary in this district, the present Inspector being able to overtake the work. "No. 2 district. Owing to the large increase in the population of the Southfield Ward, and owing to the large area of the district, I would propose that a portion of this district be taken away and added to No. 3 district, reducing the area to 1,200 acres, and the estimated population to 35,950. "No. 3 district has not appreciably increased in population since the Census in 1901, and I would propose that a portion of No. 2 district be added to this. This would increase the area to 514 acres and the population to 28,200. "No. 4 district. No change. "No. 5 district. No change. 211 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "No. 6 district. With regard to No. 6 district, which included the whole of Tooting and the southern portion of Balham Wards, I would propose that a considerable portion of Tooting be added to No. 10 district. No. 6 district would then have an area of 682 acres and a population of 27,500. During the past seven years the number of cases of infectious diseases has increased considerably, as well as the amount of sanitary supervision necessary. I would also propose that the new Inspector, Mr. Robert Brown, be appointed to this district. "No. 7 district. The old district included a portion of the South Ward, Clapham, but owing to the large increase in the population of the South Ward and the proposed division of the Streatham Ward I would propose that the North Ward, Clapham, should constitute one Sanitary Inspector's district, with an area of 487 acres and an estimated population of 32,000. "No. 8 district. With regard to No. 8 district, which included a portion of Streatham, I would propose that this district should comprise the whole of the South Ward, Clapham, which has an area of 588 acres and an estimated population of 36,200. "No. 9 district. This district would include the greater portion of Streatham Ward with an area of 1,528 acres and an estimated population of 37,000. This district, although large in area and in population, has a considerable amount of land which is not at present built on, and it also contains the whole of Streatham Common and a portion of Tooting Bec Common. The houses are inhabited by persons of good social standing, and a large proportion of the district does not at present require much sanitary supervision. I would propose that Mr. Herbert E. Brown, who is at present the Inspector for No. 6 district, should be appointed to this district, and that he should reside in the district. 212 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "'No. 10 district. This district would include the rest of Streatham and a portion of Tooting. Although the area is only 570 acres and the estimated population 27,450, yet in all probability in a few years there will be a considerable increase in population. That part of the district which is situated in Tooting Ward requires a large amount of sanitary supervision." I have again much pleasure in reporting that the whole of the work of the Department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.
