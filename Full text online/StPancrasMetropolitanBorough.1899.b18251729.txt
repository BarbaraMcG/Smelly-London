If the last four be withdrawn, and the four added below be substituted, it becomes a table of the " principal zymotic diseases." I 19 Phthisis.—This disease, the type of the tubercular group of diseases, was the cause of 481 deaths, compared to 484 in 1898, 486 in 1897, and 468 in the year previous to that. The incidence of this disease in the Sub-Districts was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 73 1.91 103.1 Tottenham Court 80 2.96 137.9 Gray's Inn Lane 76 2.53 106.4 Somers Town 89 2.71 107.5 Camden Town 23 1.54 78.8 Kentish Town 140 1.40 75.7 St. Pancras 481 1.98 96.8 London 8510 1.87 94.9 Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Pleurisy.—These diseases, as typical of the respiratory group diseases, caused 963 deaths, compared tb 733 deaths in 1898, 820 in 1897, and 755 in 1896; the incidence in the Sub-Districts being as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 143 3.75 202.0 Tottenham Court 109 4.03 187.9 Gray's Inn Lane 133 4.44 186.3 Somers Town 166 5.06 200.5 Camden Town 63 4.22 215.8 Kentish Town 349 3.49 188.8 St. Pancras 963 3.96 193.7 16149 3.55 180.1 20 Diarrhoea nomenclature.—Various synonyms have been used in certifying diarrhoea, and these have been variously classed. The Registrar-General has classed as diarrhoea the following terms: — Diarrhœa. Epidemic Diarrhoea. Intestinal or Enteric Catarrh. Gastro-intestinal or Gastro-enteric Catarrh. And as diseases of the Alimentary Canal the following terms : — Gastro-enteritis. Muco-enteritis. Gastric Catarrh. The Royal College of Physicians have recently recommended the disuse of these synonyms by the medical profession, and have authorised the use of the term " Epidemic Enteritis," or " Zymotic Enteritis," with a view to uniform classification. The Notifiable Infectious Diseases. — The number of deaths from this group of diseases in the Sub-Districts, and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 total deaths, were as follows :— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 25 0.65 35.3 Tottenham Court 17 0.63 29.3 Gray's Inn Lane 16 0.53 22.4 Somers Town 35 1.07 42.3 Camden Town 15 1.01 51.4 Kentish Town 97 0.97 52.5 St. Pancras 205 0.84 41.3 London 3744 0.82 41.8 21 The Principal Zymotic Diseases.—The number of deaths from this group of diseases in the Sub-Districts, and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths, were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 75 1.96 105.9 Tottenham Court 67 2.48 115.5 Gray's Inn Lane 81 2.70 113.5 Somers Town 122 3.72 147.4 Camden Town 37 2.48 126.7 Kentish Town 284 2.84 153.6 St. Pancras 666 2.74 134.0 London 11,228 2.48 125.2 Table 5a shows that measles caused 99 deaths, compared with 110, 89, and 130 in the three previous years; that whooping cough resulted in 141 deaths, against 85, 122, and 121; and diarrhoea and dysentry gave rise to 247 deaths, the numbers in 1898, 1897, and 1896 having been 261, 262, and 217. COMPARATIVE MORTALITY OF THE SUB-DISTRICTS. Of the six Sub-Districts, per 1000 of population, the Somers Town had the highest general death rate, followed by the Gray's Inn Lane and Tottenham Court Sub-Districts, and the Kentish Town and Regent's Park Sub-Districts the lowest. The death-rate of children under one year per 1000 births was heaviest in the Tottenham Court Sub-District, followed by the Gray's Inn Lane and Somers Town, and all three were considerably above the average rate for Loudon. The mortality from the principal Zymotic Diseases was highest in Somers Town, followed by Kentish Town, and Gray's Inn Lane. Phthisis showed the highest death rate in Tottenham Court Sub-District, followed by Somers Town and Gray's Inn Lane. The typical Respiratory Diseases produced the heaviest rates in Somers Town, Gray's Inn Lane, Camden Town, and Tottenham Court. It will thus be seen that the Sub-Districts embracing the southern half of St. Pancras have higher mortalities all round than those in the northern. Influenza.—The following Table gives the number of deaths from this disease, and the ages at death, since the epidemic period commenced :— 22 ST. PANCRAS.

Outbreak of Typhoid Fever.— On the 27th September, 1899, I reported that at a house in Haverstock Street occupied by three separate families, in one of the families, consisting of eleven persons, nine cases of typhoid fever occurred as follows:— Initials.

F. 43 15th Sept. 17th Sept. 18th Sept. 19 th Sept. All the cases were removed to hospital on the dates shown in the above table, but it will be observed that the first case was nursed at home for a week before removal to hospital. 26 The origin of the first case was obscure, but, in my opinion, the cause of the spread of the disease was personal infection, because neither the water nor the milk supply appear to have been the cause of any other cases in the neighbourhood, and although the drainage of the house was defective, no member of the other two families in the house suffered. The relative frequency of sick room infection in typhoid fever had recently been the object of an inquiry by Dr. Herbert Peck, Medical Officer of Health, Chesterfield Rural District, reported in the British Medical Journal of the 2nd September, 1899. He found 13½ per cent. of 206 cases were undoubtedly brought home to sick-room infection, and in other cases it was possible. This danger of sick-room infection from person to person, as I have for years constantly urged, points to the advisability not only of not nursing typhoid fever cases at home amongst other persons not sick, but also of not nursing them in the general wards of hospitals amongst other patients not suffering from typhoid. Erysipelas.—Following the inquiries made as to the action taken in other London Districts upon the notification of erysipelas, the summarised replies to which were set out in the Annual Report for 1895, in this disease also inquiry is now made, the best isolation obtainable is advised, the bedding and clothing are disinfected, sanitary inspection of the premises is made, and the drains are tested.

It is not generally known that any person whether lay or medical, may make application by telephone, telegram, or letter in the form as stated, and an infectious case will be removed if provided with the. medical certificate as required. METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. Ambulance Service. For Infectious Cases only. 1.—Application to be made:— In day time (9 a.m. to 8 p.m.) To the Chief Office (Ambulance Department) ' Postal Address : Victoria Embankment (corner of Carmelite Street), E.C. Telegraphic Address : Asylums Board, London. Telephone Numbers 1601 and 1602, Holborn. N.B.—Applications in the latter part of the day must be dispatched in time to reach the Office before 8 p.m. At night time (8 p.m. to 9 a.m.) To the Ambulance Stations: Eastern Ambulance Station, Brookby's Walk, Homerton, N.E.

South-Eastern Ambulance Station, New Cross Road (near Old Kent Road Railway Station), S.E. Brook Ambulance Station, Shooters Hill, Kent. 2.—Removal to the Board's Hospitals. (a) Only persons suffering from Small-pox, Fevers, or Diphtheria, are admitted into the Board's Hospitals. (b) Every application must state the name, age, and full address of the patient, from what disease suffering, and in cases of fever the particular kind of fever ; and also the name of the person making the application. 28 (c) Unless a Medical Certificate of the nature of the disease be handed to the Ambulance Nurse the patient will not be removed. (d) Patients should leave all valuables, money, &c., and all outside clothing at home, should wear body linen only, and be wrapped in the blankets provided for the purpose. (e) The Ambulance Nurse will leave, at the house from which the patient is removed, a notice stating the Hospital to which the patient is to be taken, and a copy of the regulations as to visiting, &c. N.B.—In any case of failure to remove on the day of application, in consequence of pressure on the accommodation in the Board's Hospitals, the application must be renewed every morning so long as the patient continues in a fit state for removal and removal is desired. Each application must contain a statement of the circumstances which render the removal urgent. Similar applications must be made in respect of patients taken from General Hospitals or other places to their homes, owing to there being no vacant bed available in the Board's Hospitals. Forms of application for the use of Public Officials may be obtained upon application to the undersigned. 3.—Conveyance to other places. (а) Persons suffering from any dangerous infectious disease* may be conveyed by Ambulance to places other than the Board's Hospitals. (б) Every application for an Ambulance must state : — (i.) Name, sex, and age of patient. (ii.) Description of disease, and, in the case of fever, the particular kind of fever. (iii.) Full address from which the patient is to be conveyed. (iv.) Full address to which the patient is to be conveyed. ("Arrangements for the reception of the patient must be made before application for the Ambulance.) (c) The patient must be provided with a Medical Certificate of the nature of the disease, to be handed to the Driver of the Ambulance. (d) The charge for the hire of the Ambulance, including (when the patient is over ten years of age) the services of a male attendant, is 5s. The amount must be paid to the Driver, who will give an official receipt for the same. (e) One person only will be allowed to accompany the patient, and such person may be conveyed back to the place from which the patient was conveyed. If desired, a Nurse will be supplied at an additional charge of 2s. 6d. for her services. * Dangerous Infectious Diseases include the following: Small-pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued, and Puerperal Fevers. The Ambulance Committee have also authorised the use of their Ambulance for Measles and Chicken-pox. 29 (f) The Ambulance may be sent outside the Metropolitan district only by special sanction of the Ambulance Committee or of the Clerk to the Board, and in such cases an extra charge will be made of 1s. for every mile outside the Metropolitan area. 4.—The Drivers of the Board's Ambulances are not allowed to loiter on their journeys or to stop for refreshments on pain of instant dismissal. It is particularly requested that any breach of this regulation, or any neglect or incivility on the part of the Drivers, Nurses, or Attendants may be immediately reported to the undersigned. The Servants of the Board are forbidden to accept any gratuities or refreshments. By Order, T. Duncombe Mann, Dated 26th March, 1900. Clerk to the Board. N.B.—Penalty—By Section 70 of the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," it is enacted that—"It shall not be lawful for any owner or driver of a public "conveyance knowingly to convey, or for any other person knowingly to "place in any public conveyance, a person suffering from any dangerous "infectious disease, or for a person suffering from any such disease to enter "any public conveyance, and if he does so he shall be liable to a fine not "exceeding Ten pounds . . . ." Power of Femoral to Hospital.—Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 66, and the Public Health Act, 1875, section 124, a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disease who is without "proper lodging or accommodation" may be removed to a hospital by order of a Justice. Warwick v. Graham. In the case of Warwick v. Graham* the words "proper lodgings and accommodation" received a definite interpretation. This case decided on appeal from the decision of the Justices of Workington, by a Queen's Bench Divisional Court, consisting of Mr. Justice Day and Mr. Justice Lawrance. It appeared that the respondent Graham and his family, which consisted of seven persons, lived in a four-roomed house. One of his sons, who suffered from scarlet fever, was kept apart in the parlour on the ground floor, but it was impossible to isolate him, and it was proved there would be danger of infection to the other people in the house if he continued to occupy the room. The boy was properly nursed and fed, and had adequate medical attendance, and, so far as he himself was concerned, had proper accommodation. The Workington Corporation applied to the Justices for an order to remove the boy to the hospital, but the Justices held that the words "without proper lodging or accommodation" must be construed with regard to the wants of the infected person, and dismissed the application. * "The Times," 12th June, 1898. 30 On the appeal, however, the Court held that the section was clearly directed to the protection of persons from infection, and not only to the protection of the infected person himself, and that the Justices ought to have made an order for the removal of the boy. Queen v. Davey. In the case of the Queen v. Davey,* a further point was decided, namely, that an order for removal may be made by a Magistrate ex parte as urgent, provided it is made upon a certificate or certificates in proper form. This case was heard in the Queen's Bench Division, before Mr. Justices Darling and Channell, on 2nd May, 1899, on a rule for a mandamus to Justices of Glamorganshire to state a case for the opinion of the Court, upon the hearing of an information preferred by the Inspector of Nuisances to the Margam Urban District, against Mary Hannah Skryne, for obstructing the execution of an order, based on the certificate of a duly certified medical practitioner, for the removal of Ada Olive Skryne, suffering from a dangerous infectious disorder—to wit, scarlet fever, and being then without proper lodging or accommodation—to a suitable hospital. Section 124 of the Public Health Act, 1875, provides that if it shall appear on the certificate of a medical man that a child is labouring under an infectious disorder, and that the parents are in want of proper accommodation, a Magistrate may make an order for removing the child to a hospital. Mr. S. T. Evans appeared to show cause against the rule, and said it was contended on the other side that an order made ex parte without the parents of the child having been heard could not be impeached, and that a magistrate on a formal Report, without any personal examination of the accommodation in the house and without hearing any evidence thereon, could make an order for removal. Such a proposition was contrary to the general principles of law. There was a decision that diseased meat could be condemned on an ex parte application, but when it came to condemning the butcher who had it it was then necessary to hear what he had to say. Following the analogy it was possible that, though the child might be removable at once on the ex parte order, yet that the parent could not be convicted without a hearing. The facts of this particular case showed how hardly the system might work. Mr. Ryde, appearing in support of the rule, relied on the case of "Booker v. Taylor" (reported in "The Times," November 21, 1882), and contended that the Justices could not inquire into the facts on which the order was made. The following cases were also referred to:—"White v. Redfern" (5 Q.B.D., 15), "Vintner v. Hind" (10 Q.B.D., 63), "Waye v. Thompson" (1 Q.B.D., 342). The Court, in the result, upheld the principle that the Justices could not go behind the order, but, in their discretion, discharged the rule for the case to be stated. Mr. Justice Darling said that in this case it appeared that the mother of a child ill with scarlet fever had allowed the child to be taken to a hospital. After * "The Times," 3rd May, 1899. 31 a time she made the discovery that the hospital was not, in her opinion, properly managed, and that some of the attendants were drunk. She thereupon removed the child, which had not been sent to the hospital by order of Justices. The mother took the child home and made there very good provision against infection. Thereupon a medical officer procured ex parte from a Magistrate, under Section 124 of the Public Health Act, 1875, an order to remove the child again to the hospital. The mother prevented this order being obeyed, and the proceedings against her were taken under Section 124. On the hearing before the Magistrate it was contended that the Justices had no power to go behind the order, and a case reported only in "The Times" was cited to that effect. The case was "Booker v. Taylor," November 21, 1882, which was decided ex parte. That case bound the Justices to say that they could not inquire into the facts on which the order was made. It had been pressed upon the Court that this was arbitrary, but the question was, had a person the right to obstruct the execution of the order, and at the hearing of a summons against her for so doing raise the whole question of the facts ? The Legislature meant to protect the public from infectious diseases. The whole legislation would be useless if the operations in such cases were dilatory. If persons could obstruct and delay the operation of the order the whole purpose of the Legislature would be defeated. What was meant was to give a summary remedy. In the opinion of the learned Judge the case cited was rightly decided, and the Magistrates had no power to go behind the order. But, as under the circumstances it did not appear that anything more than a nominal fine would be inflicted on the mother by the Justices if the case came before them again, it was not worth while to direct the Justices to state a case. Mr. Justice Channell concurred. He thought "Booker v. Taylor" right. As to a general principle of law an order could not be made in respect of the person or property of any one without his being heard upon the matter. But there were exceptions—namely, when it could be seen from the words of an Act of Parliament that the thing might be done ex parte. That was allowed in cases when it was necessary to act promptly, as, for instance, when diseased meat had to be destroyed. The removal of a person suffering from infection was very similar in character. Prompt action was equally necessary. He thought that in strictness the Magistrate making the order of removal ought to satisfy himself not only of the existence of the due medical certificate but also to the other conditions—namely, that there was a suitable hospital within a convenient distance, and that the person suffering was without proper lodging or accommodation. The matter was one of urgency, however, and the offences charged consisted in a person wilfully disobeying an order for removal under those circumstances. Though ex parte orders were often made on insufficient grounds the Justices could not go behind an order such as that in this case. It would seem to have been wrong, if the circumstances were such as were described, for the Medical Officer to have procured an ex parte order against the mother who had removed her child because the attendants were drunk. There must be some mode of questioning such an order, probably by certiorari, or by writ of habeas corpus, but the Magistrates were wrong in thinking that they could go behind it. He agreed, however, that it was not worth while to call on them to state a case. 32 DISINFECTION.

Private Open Spaces.—Open Spaces in connection with dwelling-houses may be maintained either as gardens or not If an open space is intended to serve as a garden the soil should be cultivated and planted, otherwise it may become an unhealthy nuisance rather than a healthful pleasure. If not intended as a garden the surface should be levelled and drained, and be kept in a solid condition, either by firmly rolled gravel, with binding material, or by paving. If the surface adjoin a dwelling-house, it should be imperviously paved so as to stand wear and tear, and to properly drain away surface water, and be kept periodically cleansed. 38 The condition in which many yards are kept call for these remarks, particularly since, as stated in previous Annual Reports, experiments and experiences have shown that pollution of the surface soil is a most fertile source of disease. § 3.—DWELLINGS. House-to-house Inspections.—The number of streets, or parts of streets, inspected from house-to-house during the year, was 4; consisting of 112 houses, all occupied, containing 428 rooms, 425 occupied, and 3 unoccupied; let to 230 families, consisting of 543 adults, and 280 children under 10 years of age. Upon these houses 35 notices were served. Houses occupied in separate dwellings.—These consist of houses (1) so constructed, or (2) adapted as to be occupied in dwellings that may be (A) selfcontained, or (B) not self-contained. (A.) Houses occupied in separate and self-contained dwellings.—A list of houses let in separate and self-contained dwellings is appended to this Report. Selfcontained implies a structural severance of one dwelling from another iu addition to the structural severance of one room from another. Self-contained dwellings may be (a) completely self-contained or (b) partly self-contained, the latter embracing those where the w.c, scullery, or washhouse, is not situated within the structurally severed dwelling, but although situated elsewhere in the house is reserved for the exclusive use of the dwelling and not used in common by two or more families. (B.) Houses occupied in separate but not self-contained dwellings.—These embrace (1) new houses constructed (a) so that the w.c.'s washhouses, balconies, &c., any one or more of these, are used in common, forming a partly common dwelling house, and in some cases (b) so that every room opens separately and directly on to a staircase or corridor, as in an ordinary type of old house, forming a wholly common dwelling house, and (2) old houses originally constructed for occupation by one family, and made down to let out in separate dwellings to more than one family, and formed into a wholly common dwelling house. Underground dwellings.—During the year, in 21 cases underground rooms let separately from the rest of the house were discontinued as dwellings. Registered houses.—The number of houses let in separate dwellings or lodgings to members of more than one family was 293 at the end of the year. Registered Common Lodging Houses.—The number of these houses in St. Pancras is 25, as set out in the List in the Appendix, and they are supervised and controlled by the London County Council. Canul Boats.—Sixty-one canal boats used as dwellings, and moored in this District, were inspected during the year and found satisfactory. INSANITARY AREAS. Churchway Area.—Under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, in the bands of the London County Council the Scheme for this Area is in progress of execution. The roadway to be formed by Churchway uniting Drummond Crescent and Grafton Place will convert several smaller culs-de-sac into one larger cul-de-sac, every road entering into which will return into the 39 same street, namely, Seymour Street. It is fully recognised how undesirable it will be to leave at the angle of Grafton Place and Churchway the present narrow foot-passage into Euston Road, and how equally undesirable it would be to close it, and that the only satisfactory solution will be to make a proper roadway at this point from Churchway into Euston Road. The London County Council has declined to take this course, but the Yestry will doubtless so amend and improve the Scheme of the Council if it is reasonably possible. Brantome Place and Prospect Ttrrace Areas.—In consequence of the Local Government Board requiring the Vestry to furnish copies of amended scheme and plan showing among other things additional lands to be acquired for the purpose of re-housing displaced persons, to the number of 372, who will not be accommodated on the Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas which are to be cleared, the Vestry, on the 21st December, 1898, were furnished with particulars of sites, namely:— Early Mews, Equity Buildings, Harrison Street, Wakefield Mews, Greenland Place, Elm Road, Great College Street Stone Yard, Camden Street, Rochester Place, Leighton Road, Cromer Street, Georgiana Street Stone Yard, and Purchese Street. And later on with particulars of further sites, namely:— Vacant land on the south side of Cromer Street belonging to the London School Board; the St. Pancras Iron Works Company's premises in the Pancras Road; and vacant land and the premises numbered 18 to 30 (even numbers), in King's Road. On the 28th June, 1899, the Vestry resolved that the site at present used as a Stone Yard at the corner of Great College Street and King's Road, with the outbuildings and urinal thereon, and also the two houses 2 and 4, Great College Street, is a site eligible for the erection of dwellings for the re-housing of persons displaced by the Vestry's schemes under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and that this site be devoted to that purpose. That the necessary additional plans and revised estimates of the schemes be prepared. East of Chalton Street Area.—On the 15th November the Health Committee reported to the Vestry that, pursuant to reference, they had considered a communication from the Local Government Board stating that they had under consideration a Report made by their Inspector, Mr. Law, after the Inquiry held by him in June with reference to the petition presented by the Vestry, under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, for the issuing of orders sanctioning these schemes. The Board pointed out that they are satisfied from this Report that the circumstances, as regards each area, are such as to require a scheme of reconstruction, but they are advised that the alternative proposals which have been forwarded by the London County Council with regard to the manner in which the areas should be dealt with are, on the whole, so far as can be judged from the particulars furnished, preferable to those of the Vestry, inasmuch as the Eastnor Place area does not, in the opinion of the Board's advisers, afford a suitable site for the reconstruction of new dwellings, while the scheme of the London County Council for the reconstruction of the Chapel Grove area, provides for a better air space about the dwellings proposed to be erected on that area than is provided for 40 in the Vestry's scheme, and that it is proposed to sanction the schemes, subject to the modification suggested by the London County Council, and to the condition that dwellings for the accommodation of not less than 460 persons of the labouring class shall be provided on the Chapel Grove area. As the proposals of the London County Council, as regards the Chapel Grove area, would necessitate the acquisition of Nos. 13, 15, and 17, Chapel Street, the Board requested that the Vestry would ascertain and inform them whether these houses can be acquired by agreement; and the Board further requested to be furnished with plans illustrating the modified schemes, including plans and elevations of the dwellings to be erected on the Chapel Grove area, together with an estimate of the cost of each scheme as modified. The Vestry resolved that steps be taken for ascertaining whether Nos. 13, 15 and 17, Chapel Street, Somers Town, can be acquired by agreement, and also that all necessary plans and estimates as to the cost of the modified schemes be prepared. HOUSING SCHEMES AND THE COST OF LAND. At the end of 1898 a circular letter was sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the London Vestries and District Boards, and of the County Boroughs, asking for information as to the prices paid per square yard for bare land—(a) in unhealthy areas, and (b) in places outside unhealthy areas, for the erection of additional dwellings, and explaining that in the case of land with buildings upon it the cost should include all the interests in the buildings and the land, and the cost of demolition less the value of materials. From these circular letters, and from a Return of the London County Council, dated October, 1899, showing the cost of the Council's housing schemes the following Tables have been compiled:— Schemes initiated and carried out by the London County Council. Date of Act Authorising Scheme. Scheme. Gross Cost. Approximate Area in Acres.

The above return, with regard to women, embraces the work of both the present Woman Inspector and her predecessor. The time of the Inspector of Men's Workplaces was partly occupied in acting also as District Inspector during the resignation or absence of Inspectors from various causes. The time so spent was as follows:— Southern portion of West Division 4 months, 2 weeks. ,, ,, East ,, 2 ,, Western „ South „ 1 „ 4 „ Eastern „ „ „ 1 „ 1 „ Total 8 months, 1 week. 47 The following is the Report of the Sanitary Inspector of Workshops for Women:— To the Medical Officer of Health. 13th January, 1900. Sir, I beg to submit a report of the work done by the Woman Sanitary Inspector of Workshops for the year 1899. During the period, 1st January to 10th March, Miss Vines was occupied in finishing the winter inspection of workshops, and had begun the first halfyearly inspection of Laundries. Since the 11th of July I have inspected the following:— Workshops.—Three hundred and twenty on register. I paid 594 visits, completing a summer inspection, and have begun the winter inspection. The 11th of July was too late to begin the summer inspection, the rush of summer work being over, and in August the majority of workshops were either closed for holidays or working with a very reduced staff. Thirty-five workshops have been added to the register since July, while 56 have been taken off owing to removal or giving up business or ceasing to employ hands. Laundries.—One hundred and twenty on register. I paid 134 visits in the summer inspection Work was very slack, owing to customers being at the sea-side. Factories.—Fighty-two on register. I completed the annual inspection of factories in September Schools.—Twenty-eight public schools, 89 public elementary, making a total of 112. In the public elementary schools (girls and infants) I found in the majority of cases there was sufficient number of sanitary conveniences and that they were in good order. In one school additional and separate sanitary accommodation was required and has been provided; in a few other schools the w.c.'s were not kept in a cleanly condition; this has been improved on being pointed out to managers. The sanitary accommodation in Board Schools varies greatly and is not always up to the standard of 1 to 20, but is probably in accordance with the School Board's complicated standard. Outworkers' Lists.—I have visited 100 shops and copied 53 lists of outworkers. In no shop did I see a list kept on the prescribed form. I left a copy of the Secretary of State's Order II. with each employer, with a view to their obtaining proper forms for future use. Tailors are the chief employers of out-door labour, and a few bootmakers. Of the 125 names or lists, about half were in St. Pancras, the rest were distributed among 18 Districts, the majority (tailors' out-workers) being in Whitechapel. 48 Domestic Workshops.—Among the names on the Outworkers' Lists were 45 Domestic Workshops in St. Pancras District. I paid 65 visits to these workshops, and found 33 were tailors, chiefly women, working alone at waistcoat-making. The conditions on the whole were satisfactory. The clerical work since July 11 has included:— Compiling new Workshop Register. „ new Factory Register. „ Register of Public Elementary Schools (Girls and Infants). „ Register of Domestic Workshops „ Register of Shops. Keeping posted up to date the Register of Laundries. „ List of work places not employing hands. „ List of Outworkers' names and adddresses received from other Sanitary Authorities. Sending notifications to H.M. Inspector of Factories— (a) As to protected persons (33). (b) As to non-affixing of abstracts and notices (3). „ to other Sanitary Authorities. ,, as to names and addresses of out-workers employed in St. Pancras but living and working in other districts (68). In addition to keeping a Diary and other office work, I append a tabular statement of the number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year. * I am, &c., A. J. Safford. Sanitary Inspector of Workshops (Women). "OUT-WORKERS." The subject of "out-workers" was raised by the circular letter of the Vestry of St. Mary, Battersea, dated 4th October, 1898. The Battersea Vestry considered that arrangements should be made by which they should be advised of the addresses of "out-workers" residing in the Parish who, in consequence of working in a district other than that in which the work is given out, sometimes escape the extra sanitary supervision necessary, and desired to know the views of the Vestry as to an interchange of information relative to outworkers, and whether the Vestry would be willing to co-operate in the matter. To obtain a correct view of the position it is necessary to refer to the Order of the Secretary of State as to out-workers, in the preamble to which Order the sections of the Factory and Workshop Acts bearing upon out-workers are also get out. * These are included in the tabular statement at the commencement of the Section. 49 ORDER.OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. The "out-workers' section "(Sec. 27) of the Act of 1891, was materially amended and extended by Section 42 of the Act of 1895. The Order made in 1892 under the former section was therefore recalled, and a new Order made applying to the same industries, but giving full effect to the new provisions of the 1895 Act. The Order is in the following terms :— Whereas by Section 27 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, it is enacted that:— "(1) The occupier of every factory and workshop (including any workshop conducted on the system of not employing any child, young person, or woman therein), and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop shall, if so required by the Secretary of State by an Order made in accordance with Section 65 of the principal Act, and subject to any exceptions mentioned in the Order, keep in the prescribed form and with the prescribed particulars, lists showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workman or as contractor, in the business of the factory or workshop, outside the factory or workshop, and the places were they are employed, and every such list shall be open to inspection by any Inspector under the principal Act or by any Officer of a Sanitary Authority. " (2) In the event of a contravention of this section by the occupier of a factory or workshop, or by a contractor, the occupier or contractor shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings." And whereas, by Section 42 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, it is enacted that:— " (1) Every occupier of a factory or workshop to whom Section 27 of the Act of 1891 for the time being applies, and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop shall, on or before the first day of March and the first day of September in each year, send to the Inspector for the district in which the factory or workshop is situate a list showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workmen or contractors, in the business of the factory or workshop, outside the factory or workshop, and the place where they are employed, and in default of so doing shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. " (2) Section 27 of the Act of 1891, and this section shall apply to any place from which any work of making wearing apparel for sale is given out, and to the occupier of that place, and to every contractor employed by any such occupier in connection with the said work, as if that place were a workshop.'' Now I, the Right Honourable Sir Matthew White Ridley, Baronet, one of Her Majesty's Priucipal Secretaries of State, by the Order, made under Section 65 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and Section 27 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, as amended by Section 42 of the Factory Act, 1895, require: — 50 The occupier of every factory and workshop (including any workshop conducted on the system of not employing any child, young person, or woman therein) in which is carried on :— The manufacture of articles of wearing apparel, The manufacture of electro-plate, Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work, or The manufacture of files, And every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop, and also The occupier of every place from which any work of making wearing apparel for sale is given out, and every contractor employed by any such occupier in connection with such work, to keep in the form and with the particulars prescribed in the schedule hereto, lists showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workmen or as contractors, in the business of the said factory, workshop, or place, outside the factory, workshop, or place, and the places where they are employed; and every such list shall be open to inspection by any Inspector under the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878 to 1895, or by any Officer of a Sanitary Authority ; and every such occupier and contractor shall send to the Inspector for the district a list of such out-workers on or before the first day of March and the first day of September in each year. The Order of 31st October, 1892, under section 27 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, is hereby revoked. This Order shall come into effect on the first day of February, 1896, and shall continue in force until revoked. M. W. RIDLEY. Whitehall. 27th January, 1896. The occupations principally concerned are those in which wearing apparel furniture, and upholstery are made. The outworkers in these trades work either in workshops for mixed persons, in workshops for adults only, in workshops for male adults only, in domestic workshops, or in their own rooms. Workshops for mixed persons employ children, young persons, women, and men, the control of employment for the protected persons (that is, all except the men) being under the supervision of the Factory Inspector and the Home Office, and the control of the sanitary condition of the premises being under the Workshop Inspector and the Sanitary Authority. Workshops for adults only, employ women and men, the control of employment of the women being under the Home Office, and the sanitary condition of the premises under the Sanitary Authority. Workshops for male adults only are subject only to the control of sanitary conditions by the Sanitary Authority. Domestic Workshops, that is, places used as workshops in which only members of the same family dwelling there are employed, are subject to regulations with 51 regard to the hours of labour under the control of the Home Office, and to the supervision of sanitary conditions by the Sanitary Authority. In their own rooms out-workers may work subject only to the supervision of sanitary conditions by the Sanitary Authority. A large number of out-workers work in their own rooms, and a large number in domestic workshops. Briefly, the object of these lists of out-workers is threefold: firstly, to control the employment of out-workers as to limits of age, fitness, hours, and periods, and as to safety from fire, accidents, and injury ; secondly, to control the sanitary condition of premises; and thirdly, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. With reference to the two last, the following sections specially apply. Factory and Workshops Act, 1895, Section 5. 1.—If an inspector gives notice in writing to the occupier of a factory or workshop, or to any contractor employed by any such occupier, that any place in which work is carried on for the purpose of or in connection with the business of the factory or workshop is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein, then, if the occupier or contractor, after the expiration of one month from receipt of the notice, gives out work to be done in that place, and the place is found by the court having cognizance of the case to be so injurious or dangerous, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. 2.—This section shall apply in the case of the occupier of any place from which any work is given out as if that place were a workshop. 3 —Provided that this section shall not apply except in the case of persons employed in such classes of work and in the case of persons giving out employment and employed within such areas, as may from time to time be specified by the Secretary of State by Order made in accordance with Section 65 of the principal Act, and no such order shall be made except with respect to an area where, by reason of the number and distribution of the population or the conditions under which work is carried on, there are special risks of injury or danger to the health of the persons employed and of the district. Factory and Workshops Act, 1895, Section 6. If any occupier of a factory or workshop or laundry or of any place from which any work is given out, or any contractor employed by any such occupier, causes or allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned, or repaired in any dwelling house or building occupied therewith, whilst any inmate of the dwelling house is suffering from scarlet fever or small-pox, then, unless he proves that he was not aware of the existence of the illness in the dwelling-house, and could not reasonably have been expected to become aware of it, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. It is evident that the duties of the Sanitary Authority in reference to outworkers are as important as those of the Home Office although different in kind, but whereas the 1'actory Inspector is supplied with lists of outworkers every six months, the Workshop Inspector is restricted to inspecting the lists at the factories and workshops. 52 In order to carry out the proposal of the Battersea Yestry, it must be necessary for the Sanitary Authority twice a year to make copies of the lists of out-workers at the factories and workshops in the District, a proceeding which is not provided for in the Act, but which if assumed to be the intention of the Legislature must occupy a large amount of time. The first step towards carrying out their duties periodically in regard to out-workers in a continuous manner by the Sanitary Authorities would be to provide that these A uthorities should be supplied with lists, either in the same manner as Factory Inspectors are now supplied, or else from the Home Office. If this initial facility is not given, one must reluctantly conclude that the Government intends to attach less importance to the duties of Sanitary Authorities in reference to out-workers than to those of the Home Office. § 6.—W ATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The condition of the waters supplied by the West Middlesex Water Works and the New River Companies during the year, as stated in the returns of the Registrar-General, has been already reported in the Monthly Reports presented to your Vestry. § 7.—DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.

Bye-laws as to Drainage.—On the 1st August, an Act (62 and 63 Vict., Cap 15) to amend the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Bye-laws received Royal assent. The principal provision of this Act relates to the deposition of plans, sections, and particulars before constructing drainage, and runs as follows in Section 2 :— 2. The powers of the London County Council for making bye-laws under Section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, shall extend and apply to authorise the Council to make bve-laws for the following purpose: Requiring persons about to construct, reconstruct, or alter the pipes, drains, or other means of communicating with sewers, or the traps and apparatus connected therewith, to deposit with the sanitary authority of the district such plans, sections, and particulars of the proposed construction, reconstruction, or alteration as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining whether such construction, reconstruction, or alteration, is in accordance with the statutory provisions relative thereto, and with any bye-laws made under the said section. Provided that any such bye-laws shall not require the deposit of any plan or section in the case of any repair which does not involve the alteration or the entire reconstruction of any such pipe, drain, or other means of communicating with sewers, or the traps and apparatus connected therewith. Provided that any such bye-laws shall not require the deposit of any plans, sections, and particulars before the work is commenced in any case in which the alteration of the drains must be carried out at once, but the bve-laws may require such deposit to be made within a limited time from the commencement of the work. The importance of this amending Act lies in the fact that there was no provision in the Metropolis Management Acts requiring notice to be given of the repair, alteration, extension or reconstruction of existing drains. The only provision for notice to be given to the Vestry or District Board was in the case of connecting a drain with a public sewer, when seven days' notice must be given in writing, under Section 76 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1.855 (18 & 19 Vict., c. 120), before making such a drain. There is no prohibition and no penalty for making a sewer without the consent of a Vestry or District Board. The Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict., c. 102), Section 47, only provides that in case a sewer is to be made or branched into a public sewer the sanction, in writing, of the Vestry or District Board shall first be obtained, and Section 61 provides for a penalty in default of obtaining the sanction before making the connection with the public sewer. There is, therefore, nothing to prevent the conversion of any house drain into a sewer by diverting a waste pipe, or rain-water pipe, or gutter, from one house into the drain of another house, and if this take place at the rear the whole house-drain becomes a sewer, maintainable by the Vestry or District Board, and the owner has relieved himself of all liability. 54 § 8.—REFUSE REMOVAL. Dust receptacles.—In connection with the removal of domestic refuse, the size and form of receptacle is of considerable importance from the point of view of economy and expedition. A vault, cellar, enclosure, or room, whether below or above ground, in which dust, ashes, and other domestic refuse is placed cannot be regarded as a refuse receptacle. In the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. the expression ash-pit means any ash-pit, dust-bin, ash-tub, or other receptacle for the deposit of ashes or refuse matter. Under the Bye-laws of the London County Council, under Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, when any person shall provide an ash-pit in connection with a building, he shall cause the same to consist of one or more movable receptacles sufficient to contain the house refuse which may accumulate during any period not exceeding one week. Each of such receptacles shall be constructed of metal, and shall be provided with one or more suitable handles and cover. The capacity of each of such receptacles shall not exceed two cubic feet. § 9.—NUISANCES. Nuisances from Animals.—These may arise from— (a) Keeping of animals. (b) Receptacles for dung. (c) Removal of manure. A.—Keeping of Animals. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Section 2 (1). For the purposes of this Act— ******** (c) Any animal kept in such a place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious to health shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Section 16 (1). Every sanitary authority shall make bye-laws— ******** (c) For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. ******** Vestry Bye-laws. (8) The occupier of any premises shall not keep nor allow to be kept any animal on such premises in such a place or in such a manner as to pollute, or be likely to pollute, any water supplied for use, or used, or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, or any water used or likely to be used in any dairy. (9) Every occupier of a building or premises wherein or whereon any horse or other beast of draught or burden, or any cattle may be kept, shall deposit or cause 55 to be deposited iu a suitable receptacle all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or noxious matter other than wine and other liquid filth which may, from time to time, be produced in the keeping of any such animal in such building or upon such premises. He shall likewise provide in connection with such building or premises a sufficient drain, constructed in such a manner, and of such materials, and maintained at all times in such a condition, as effectually to carry away all urine and liquid filth or refuse therefrom. Except where the Sanitary Authority by notice duly given under the statutory provision in that behalf shall have otherwise required, he shall, once at least in every week, remove or cause to be removed from such buildings or premises all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or obnoxious matter produced in or upon such building or premises, and deposited in a receptacle as hereinbefore required. Provided that this requirement shall not apply to the occupier of any stable or cow-house from which the Sanitary Authority remove or contract for the removal of manure and other refuse matter. Where for the purpose of preventing the keeping of any horse or other beast of draught or burden or any cattle on any premises so as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, it is necessary that the floor of the building in which such animal is kept should be impervious to liquid matter, no person shall keep any animal in such building unless or until the floor thereof shall have been paved with a hard and impervious pavement, evenly and closely laid, and so sloped as to effectually carry off all liquid matter therefrom to a properly trapped inlet to the drain hereinbefore required to be provided. B.—Receptacles for Dung. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Section 39. 1. The County Council shall make bye-laws with respect to water-closets, earth-closets, privies, ash-pits, cesspools, and the receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof, in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. * * * * 3. It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority to observe and enforce the bye-laws under this Section, and any direction given by the Sanitary Authority under this Act shall be in accordance with the said bye-laws, and so far as they are not so in accordance shall bo void. London County Council's Bi/e-laws as to Receptacles for Dung. 24. A person shall not use as a receptacle for dung any receptacle so constructed or placed that one of its sides shall be formed by the wall of any room used for human habitation, or under a dwelling-house, factory, workshop, or workplace, and he shall not use any receptacle in such a situation that it would be likely to cause a nuisance or become injurious or dangerous to health. 25. Every owner of any existing receptacle for dung shall, before the expiration of six months from the date of the confirmation of these bye-laws, and every person who shall construct a receptacle for dung, shall cause such receptacle to be so 56 constructed that its capacity shall not be greater than two cubic yards, and so that the bottom or floor thereof shall not, in any case, be lower than the surface of the ground adjoining such receptacle. He shall so construct such receptacle that a sufficient part of one of its sides shall be readily removable for the purpose of facilitating cleansing. He shall also cause such receptacle to be constructed in such a manner and of such materials, and to be maintained at all times in such a condition as to prevent any escape of the contents thereof, or any soakage therefrom into the ground or into the wall of any building. He shall cause such receptacle to be so constructed that no rain or water can enter therein, and so that it shall be freely ventilated into the external air. Provided that a person who shnll construct a receptacle for dung, the whole of the contents of which are removed not less frequently than every forty-eight hours, shall not be require! to construct such receptacle so that its capacity shall not be greater than two cubic yards. And provided that a person who shall construct a receptacle for dung, which shall contain only the dung of horses, asses or mules, with stable litter, and the whole of the contents of which are removed not less frequently than every fortyeight hours, may, instead of all other requirements of this bye-law, construct a metal cage, and shall beneath such metal cage adequately pave the ground at a level not lower than the surrounding ground, and in such a manner and to such an extent as will prevent any soakage into the ground; and if such cage be placed near to or against any building he shall adequately cement the wall of such building in such a manner and to such an extent as will prevent any soakage from the dung within or upon such receptacle into the wall of such building. C.—Removal of Manure. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 36. • • * * 2. Notice may be given by a Sanitary Authority (by public announcement in the district or otherwise) requiring the periodical removal of manure or other refuse matter from stables, cow-houses, or other premises, and where any such notice has been given if any person to whom the manure or other refuse matter belongs fails to comply with the notice he shall be liable, without further notice, to a fine not exceeding Twenty Shillings for each day during which such noncompliance continues. Vestry's Notice:— VESTRY OF SAINT PANCRAS. Health Department. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Notice is hereby given that the Vestry of St. Pancras, as the Sanitary Authority for the Parish of St. Pancras, in the County of London, require all manure and other refuse matter to be removed from all stables, cow-houses, and other premises within the Parish at least once in every period of three days. 57 Provided that all manure and litter stored in metal cages shall be removed not less frequently than every forty-eight hours. If any person to whom such manure or other refuse matter belongs shall fail to comply with this notice, he will be liable, without further notice, to a fine not exceeding Twenty Shillings for every day during which such non-compliance continues. By Order of the Vestry. William Mallison, Deputy Vestry Clerk, Health Department, Vestry Hall, St. Pancras. Dated the 11th day of March, 1896. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 36. 1. The Sanitary Authority, if they think fit, may employ a sufficient number of scavengers, or contract with the scavengers, whether a company or individuals, for collecting and removing the manure and other refuse matter from any stables and cow-houses within their district, the occupiers of which signify their consent in writing to such removal, provided that— (a) Such consent shall not be withdrawn or revoked without one month's previous notice to the Sanitary Authority, and (b) No person shall be hereby relieved from any fine to which he may be subject for placing dung or manure upon any footways or carriage-ways or for having any accumulation or deposit of manure or other refuse matter so as to be a nuisance, or injurious or dangerous to health. • • • • Notices. A new form of Intimation for the abatement of nuisances under Section 3, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was approved by the Vestry on the 26th April. The practical effect of the adoption of the new Intimation form was to cease to specify the works to be executed for the abatement of a nuisance. The following are the sub-sections and schedule applying to the service of a Statutory Notice for the abatement of a nuisance:— Public Health (London) Act, 1891. SECTION 4. (1) Notice requiring abatement of nuisance.—On the receipt of any information respecting the existence of a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act the Sanitary Authority shall, if satisfied of the existence of a nuisance serve a notice on the person by whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance arises or continues, or if such person cannot be found, on the occupier or owner of the premises on which the nuisance arises, requiring him to abate the same within the time specified in the notice, and to execute such works and do such things as may be necessary for that purpose, and, if the Sanitary Authority think it desirable (but not otherwise), specifying any works to be executed. 58 (2) The Sanitary Authority may also by the same or another notice served on the occupier, owner, or person, require him to do what is necessary for preventing the recurrence of the nuisance, and if they think it desirable, specify any works to be executed for that purpose, and may serve that notice, notwithstanding that the nuisance may for the time have been abated, if the Sanitary Authority consider that it is likely to recur on the same premises. • • • • THIRD SCHEDULE. Form A. Form of Notice Requiring Abatement of Nuisance To (person causing the nuisance, or owner or occupier of the premises at which the nuisance exists, as the case may be) Take notice that under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, the (describe the Sanitary Authority) being satisfied of the existence at (describe premises where nuisance exists) of a nuisance being (describe the nuisance, 1or instance, premises in such a state as to b° a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, or for further instance, a ditch or drain so foul as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health) do hereby require you within (specify the time) from the service of this notice to abate the same (and to execute such works and do such things as may be necessary for that purpose, or and for that purpose to specify any works to be executed) and the said (authority) do hereby require you within the said period to do what is necessary for preventing the recurrence of the nuisance and for that purpose to, &c.) Where the nuisance has been abated, but is likely to recur say, being satisfied that at, &c., there existed recently to wit, on or about the the following nuisance, Damely (describe nuisance), and that although the said nuisance has since the last mentioned day been abated, the same is likely to recur at the said premises, do hereby require you within (specify time) to do what is necessary for preventing the recurrence of the nuisance (and for that purpose to, Sfc.). If you make default in complying with the requisitions of this notice (or if the said nuisance, though abated, is likely to recur) a summons will be issued requiring your attendance before a petty sessional court, to answer a complaint which will be made for the purpose of enforcing the abatement of the nuisance, or prohibiting the recurrence thereof, or both, and for recovering the costs and penalties that may be incurred thereby. Dated this day of ,19 Signature of Officer of Sanitary Authority 59 On 19th July, 1899, the Vestry Resolved— 1.—That the works required to be executed be not specified in the Statutory Notice. 2.—That the prevention of the recurrence of the nuisance be required in the Statutory Notice. 3.—That the works for the prevention of the recurrence of the nuisance be not specified in the Statutory Notice. § 10.—SUMMONSES.

Pakes, and the following were the results :— May 10th, 1899. W. G. A. 1. Apparently normal. No increase of leucocytes. No tubercle bacilli found. 62 W. G. A. 2. Increase of leucocytes. Marked increase of bacteria. No tubercle bacilli found. W. G. A. 3. Increase of leucocytes. Marked increase of bacteria. No tubercle bacilli found. W. G. A. 4. Apparently normal. No increase of leucocytes. No tubercle bacilli found. W. G. A. 5. Apparently normal. No increase of leucocytes. No tubercle bacilli found. May 17th, 1899. H. N. 1. Contained a fair quantity of pus and a few tubercle bacilli. Not fit for human consumption. H. N. 2. Dirty, contained vegetable debris, hairs, etc., otherwise normal. Neither pus nor tubercle bacilli found. II. N. 3. Dirty, contained vegetable debris, hairs, etc., otherwise normal Neither pus nor tubercle bacilli found. H. N. 4. Contained an increase of leucocytes amounting to pus. No tubercle bacilli found. Not fit for human consumption. H. N. 5. Apparently normal. June 26th, 1899. J. O. 1. Contained an enormous amount of organisms, showing that sufficient care had not been exercised in the collection and handling of the milk. Was very dirty. J. 0. 2. Contained an enormous number of organisms, showing that sufficient care had not been exercised in the collection and handling of the milk. Was very dirty and beginning to clot. J. 0. 3. Contained a very definite excess of leucocytes, but no tubercle bacilli were found. Sample suspicious, and not advisable for consumption as food. J. 0. 4. Normal. J. 0. 5. Normal. July 3rd, 1899. G. R. 1. Contained a considerable amount of pus, and a few tubercle bacilli. This sample was totally unfitted for corosumption as food. G. R. 2. Contained an amount of pus pointing to a very definite mastitis (inflammation of the udder) of one or more of the Cows supplying the milk, but no tubercle bacilli were found. The sample was not fit for consumption as food. G. R. 3. Contained pus pointing to very definite mastitis (inflammation of the udder) of one or more of the Cows supplying the milk, but no tubercle bacilli. The sample was unfit for consumption as food. G. R. 4. Contained a very definite excess of leucocytes, but no tubercle bacilli were found. Sample suspicious and not advisable for consumption as food. G. R. 5. Normal. 63 August 28th, 1899. J. L. 14. Contained a very considerable amount of leucocytes, but no tubercle bacilli found. One or more of the Cows from which the milk is derived are probably suffering from some form of mastitis, and the milk should be looked upon with suspicion. J. L. 15. Contained an enormous number of organisms, and had already begun to clot. Sample unfit for consumption. Satisfactory search for tubercle bacilli impossible. J. L. 16. Normal. No tubercle bacilli found. J. L. 17. Normal. No tubercle bacilli found. J. L. 18. Contained pus and a few tubercle bacilli. Quite unfit for consumption. H. G. W. 826. Normal. H. G. W. 827. Contained a fair amount of pus, a large number of squamous epithelial cells, some vegetable debris, and many streptococci, together with an enormous numb(^ qf bacteria. No tubercle bacilli found. Sample unfit for consumption. H. G. W. 828. Contained a very large number of bacteria, and beginning to clot. Excess of leucocytes and a fair amount of vegetable debris. Sample unfit for consumption. H. G. W. 829. Contained little masses of pus, as iftene or two Cows out of several were affected with mastitis. No tubercle Dacilli found. Sample suspicious. n. G. W. 830. In addition to being dirty contained a considerable amount of pus and a few doubtful tubercle bacilli. Sample unfit for consumption. 6th September, 1899. II. G. W. 831. Contains an enormous number of bacteria, as the sample was partially clotted. Sample unfit for consumption. No pus or tubercle bacilli found. H. G. W. 832. Normal. H. G. W. 833. Did not contain any excess of leucocytes nor could any tubercle bacilli be found. Contained a considerable excess of streptococci which gives rise to a certain amount of suspicion. H. G. W. 834. Normal. H. G W. 835. Contained masses of pus. No tubercle bacilli found. Sample unfit, for consumption. C. W. 914. No tubercle bacilli found. Normal. C. W. 915. Contained a large number of bacteria, but neither tubercle bacilli nor pus could be found. Normal. C. W. 916. Contained a large amount of pus. No tubercle bacilli found. Sample totally unfit for consumption. C. W. 917. A few tubercle bacilli were found as well as a fair amount of pus. Sample unfit for consumption. 64 C. W. 918. Contained an enormous amount of bacteria, and there was a partial clotting. Certain amount of leucocytosis but no tubercle bacilli found. Sample unfit for consumption. 14th November, 1899. H. J. W. 111. Contained a small amount of pus, a large number of bacteria, and a very considerable amount of dirt and vegetable debris. No tubercle bacilli found. Sufficient care has not been exercised in the collection and storage of this milk, and there is a distinct suspicion that one or more of the cows may be suffering from some affection of the udder. H. J. W. 112. Contained a considerable number of bacteria, but there was neither pus nor vegetable debris, and no tubercle bacilli could be found. Sample normal. H. J. W. 113. Sample normal. H.J. W. 114. Contains little masses of pus cells scattered throughout the preparations, but neither bacilli nor excess of bacteria could be found. Milk probably derived from several cows one of which has some affection of udder. If this is the case the milk cannot be looked upon as altogether safe. H. J. W. 115. Contains neither pus, tubercle bacilli, nor excess of bacteria. Sample normal. H. J. W. 116. Very dirty, and contains much vegetable debris, squamous epithelial cells and mineral matter. There was no excess of leucocytes nor could any tubercle bacilli be found. The milk can be looked upon as normal, but the conditions under which it has been collected and stored must have been very bad. H. J. W. 117. Contains perhaps a slight excess of leucocytes, but no tubercle bacilli could be found. Sample normal. H. J. W. 118. Contains a large amount of pus, so much in fact, that the centrifugalised deposit is indistinguishable from the contents of an ordinary abscess. A fairly large number of streptococci were present, but no tubercle bacilli could be found. Sample totally unfit for consumption. H. J. W. 119. Consists almost entirely of pus as regards the centrifugalised deposit. Large number of streptococci, but no tubercle bacilli. Sample totally unfit for consumption. H. J. W. 120. Contains a fairly large quantity of pus and a few tubercle bacilli were found. Sample quite unfit for consumption. The experience gained in the course of the year led to the following circular letter being sent out from the Health Department :— 65 ST. PANCRAS, COUNTY OF LONDON. Health Department. Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, N.W., March, 1900. Sir or Madam, Milk. The Vestry of St. Pancras has had its attention directed to the question of impurities in Milk, and such samples as it has already submitted to examination disclose serious dangers to the public health. In discharge of its duty as a Sanitary Authority, the Vestry has determined for the future that samples of Milk be subjected to microscopical and bacteriological examinations, and that in regard to samples found to be unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man, legal proceedings be instituted, and that a circular be issued to all Cowkeepers in St. Pancras, informing them of this intention, that they may take every necessary precaution. These examinations of milks are made with the object of ascertaining whether the bacillus of tubercle or consumption is present, and whether proper attention is paid to the examination and maintenance of Cows, so that the milk produced for consumption shall be healthy milk; and also whether proper care is exercised to prevent contamination by uncleanliness. As illustrating the results of such examinations, appended to this circular will be found a Summary of the Reports of the fifty examinations made under the instruction of the Vestry during 1899. No inoculation experiments were made, but if they had been, no doubt a larger number of the samples would have shewn the presence of the organ isms of consumption, at least this is the experience of other Sanitary Authorities. In case any Cow-keeper, at the periodical examination of his Cows, has any doubt as to the perfect health and condition of the Cows, it would be advisable as a measure of protection, both for himself and the public, to obtain the advice of the Veterinary Surgeon, and to cease to sell the milk of such Cows until assured of the good health and condition of the animals. The common prevalence of tuberculosis or consumption amongst milch-Cows, and the danger of infecting human beings consuming the milk, points towards taking the course now pursued by many dairy farmers of having the Cows tested by tuberculin, and removing those responding to the test altogether from the sheds, so as to prevent others becoming infected. Although there may be some little expense attending the course suggested, it should be regarded, as in other businesses, as a means of insurance. With reference to the avoidance of other contamination and the prevention of uncleanliness, these depend upon the vigilance of the Cowkeeper as to the 66 places and vessels in which milk is drawn, stored, and sold, and also as to the habits and methods of employees engaged in handling the Cows and the milk, particularly as to cleansing the udders and teats of the Cows, and the hands and pails of the milkers, before milking.

During the year a number of Public Acts of sanitary interest were added by Parliament to the Statutes, a new Order was issued by the Board of Agriculture, and several leading cases were decided by the High Courts. London Government Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict., cap 74).—This Act alters areas and creates new bodies to be called Metropolitan Boroughs, simplifying and adding dignity to local administration. The Act comes into force in November, 1900, when upon the new St. Pancras Borough Council will fall the duty of enforcing the Bye-laws with respect to Slaughterhouses, Knacker's Yards, and offensive businesses; and regulations with respect to Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops [Section 6 (4) ]. The Registration of Dairymen will also be transferred to the Borough Councils (sch. 2, part 1). Furthermore, the power of adopting Part 3 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, which enables lodging houses for the working classes to be provided, is given to the Borough Councils (sch. 2, part 2). Metropolis Management Acts Amendment [Bye-laws) Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict., cap. 15).—This Act gives power to the London County Council to make Bye-laws under Section 202 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, requiring persons entirely constructing, reconstructing, or altering any pipe or drain to deposit such plan, section and particulars that may be necessary before commencing work. Metropolis Water Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict., cap. 7).—This Act enables and requires the Metropolitan Water Companies to supply one another with water in cases of emergency. When emergency arises it is to be put in force by the Local Government Board. Seats for Shop Assistants Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict., cap. 21).—This Act is to be put in force by the London County Council, and compels the provision of seats for female assistants in retail shops, the seats to be in proportion of not less than one seat for every three female assistants. Baths and Washhouses Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict., cap. 29).—This Act amends the Act of 1878. with respect to the uses which may be made of Baths provided under the Acts of 1846 to 1896, and enables licenses to be obtained for music and dancing in covered or open swimming baths under certain conditions. Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict, cap. 44).—An Act giving power to a Local Authority to advance money to residents in a house of moderate value, enabling the applicant to acquire the ownership of that house, provided that " any advance shall not exceed " (a) Four-fifths of that which, in the opinion of the Local Authority, is the market value of the ownership: or " (b) Two hundred and forty pounds, or, in the case of a fee simple or leasehold of not less than ninety-nine years unexpired at the date of the purchase, three hundred pounds, and an advance shall not be made for the acquisition of the ownership where, in the opinion of the Local Authority, the market value of the house exceeds four hundred pounds." 71 The interest is to be low, for it will not exceed 10s. above the rate at which the Local Authority can at the time borrow from the Public Works Loan Commission ; the repayment is to be made within a time agreed upon, not to exceed thirty years. There are certain conditions of proprietorship to be observed, such as residence in the house, insurance against fire, and keeping it in good sanitary condition. The Westminster Vestry forwarded the following copy of a Case which they submitted to Counsel, and his Opinion thereon, in regard to the meaning of the word " house " in this Act:— Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster. CASE TO ADVISE. Herewith are sent:— Copy of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899, and of a Circular thereon issued by the Local Government Board on the 19th September last. By Section 1 (1) of the Act a Local Authority for any area is empowered, subject to the provisions of the Act, to advance money to a resident in any house within the area for the purpose of enabling him to acquire the ownership of that house. The amount to be advanced is limited by the Act, and the section goes on to provide, amongst other things, that no advance shall be made where in the opinion of the Local Authority the market value of the house exceeds £400. By Section 2 of the Act the Local Authority, before making the advance, must satisfy themselves, inter alia, that the applicant is resident, or intends to reside in the house; but this is modified by Section 7 (1), which provides that an advance may be made to an applicant who intends to reside in a house, as if he were resident, if he undertakes to begin his residence therein within such period, not exceeding six months, as the Local Authority may fix. Further, Section 10 (1) provides that a person shall not be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be resident in a house unless he is both the occupier of and resident in that house. The estate in a house that a resident may be assisted to purchase (referred to as the “ownership ”) is defined by Section 10 (2) as "such interest or combination “ of interests in a house as together with the interest of the purchaser of the “ ownership will constitute either a fee simple in possession or a leasehold interest “ in possession of at least 60 years unexpired at the date of the purchase." The statutory conditions on which the house is to be held and the remedies for enforcing the same are set out in Section 3. Under the Act, therefore, it would seem that an advance can only be made to a person residing or intending to reside [see Section 7 (1) ] in and occupying a house worth not more than £400 to enable him or her to acquire the freehold, or a lease with 60 years still to run. It is obvious that the operation of the Act in London must necessarily be very restricted. The Local Authority in Westminster is the United Vestry of the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, a Committee of which Vestry have recently had the Act under their consideration, which the Vestry are anxious if possible to adopt. It appears that there exist no houses in Westminster the 72 ownership [see Section 10 (2) ] of which could be represented by any sum so low as £400, nor would the price of land there admit of the erection of houses which could be sold at the price contemplated by the Act. The Committee, however, notice that the Act contains no definition of the word “ house,” and it is suggested that it might be held to include a “ tenement” or “ flat,” or dwelling approached by a staircase used in common by tenants of other similar dwellings, and forming part of a block of such dwellings. Attention may also be drawn to the tenure and ownership of portions of buildings such as the Albert Hall and Drury Lane Theatre, where boxes are held, and can be disposed of as freehold. The shares in the London Institution, Finsbury Circus, may also be cited as an illustration of the same position. The Local Government Board was applied to for the definition of the word, but declines to express an opinion. The meaning of "house" is prima facie a dwelling place ; a meaning which has been extended under various Acts passed for various purposes. Thus under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, it is held to include any building in which persons are employed. Under the Parliamentary and Municipal Registration Act, 1884, it has been held to include any part of a house where that part is separately occupied for the purposes of any trade, business or profession, and “ dwelling house” is defined as including any part of a house where that part is separately occupied as a dwelling. But the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act would appear to contemplate a far narrower meaning of the word “ house ” ; the magnitude of the interest required by the borrower; the stringency of the conditions, especially those relating to the sanitary condition and repair of the house and its compulsory insurance; and the nature of the remedies furnished to the Local Authority for enforcing compliance with the statutory conditions would all seem to indicate, as indeed the title to the Act asserts, that the Act is intended to apply only to small houses each standing within its own curtilage, such as are inhabited by persons of the artizan class, and in which they can and do acquire a beneficial interest to the extent required by the Act. Counsel will please advise the above-named Vestry:— (1) What in his opinion is the definition of the word “ house ” used in the above-mentioned Act. (2) Whether it can be taken to include a “tenement” or “flat” of dwelling approached by a staircase used in common by tenants of other similar dwellings, and forming part of a block of such dwellings, so that the Local Authority, if all the other statutory conditions were observed, may make an advance of money thereon. OPINION. It seems to me that the Legislature in using the term “ house ” throughout the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899, have properly used a word which is capable of wide significance, and have carefully refrained from placing any limitation upon the meaning of such word by means of a definition. A “ house,” then, 73 to which the Act. applies is, I think, any place of abode the fee simple of which can be acquired, or in which a leasehold interest can be acquired for a term of not less than sixty years, provided, of course, that the express provisions of the Act as to residence, sanitary condition, &c., are complied with. It follows, in my opinion, that the word “ house ” in the Act of 1899 can be taken to include a “ tenement” or “ flat ” or a dwelling approached by a staircase used in common by other tenants of the building, comprising such tenement, flat, or dwelling. R. Cunningham Glen, New Court, Temple, 13^A December, 1899. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899 (62 and 63 Vict. ch. 51).—This Act makes several important alterations in the law on this subject. Sec. 2 enables the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture to procure samples for analysis, the fee for analysis being payable by the Local Authority. If the result of the analysis shows adulteration it would be the duty of the Local Authority to cause proceedings to be taken. Sec. 3 makes it compulsory on every Local Authority entrusted with the execution of the laws relating to the sale of food and drugs to appoint a public analyst, and to put in force the powers with which they are invested, and, in particular, to direct their officers to take samples for analysis. It is presumed that the expression “Local Authority entrusted with the execution of the laws relating to the sale of food and drugs” refers to the same Local Authority as is defined in Sec. 25 of the Act to mean “any Local Authority authorised to appoint an analyst for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.” Sec. 4 empowers the Board of Agriculture to make regulations for determining a standard of purity for milk, cream, butter or cheese. Sec. 5 extends the Margarine Act, 1887, to margarine cheese ; Sec. 6 requires any package containing margarine or margarine cheese to be branded or marked; Sec. 7 contains provisions as to manufacturers of and dealers in margarine and margarine cheese; and Sec. 8 restricts the amount of butter fat in margarine. Sec. 9 provides that every person who, in any highway or place of public resort, sells milk or cream from a vehicle, or from a can or other receptacle, shall have conspicuously inscribed on the vehicle or receptacle his name and address. Sec. 11 requires that every tin containing condensed, separated or skimmed milk must bear a label on which the words “Machine-skimmed Milk” or “Skimmed Milk” are printed in large and legible type. Sec. 12 requires that the label referred to in Sec. 8 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, shall be so written or printed that the notice of mixture is not obscured by other matter on the label. Sec. 14 enables samples of every article of food to be taken in course of delivery upon the request or with the consent of the purchaser or consignee. Sec. 19 prohibits the institution of any prosecution after the expiration of twenty-eight days from the time of the purchase, and requires the summons to 74 state particulars of the offence alleged and the name of the prosecutor, and not to be returnable in less time than fourteen days from the service thereof, and to be accompanied by a copy of the analyst's certificate. Sec. 20 provides that a warranty shall not be available as a defence unless the defendant has, within seven days after the service of the summons, sent to the purchaser a copy of such warranty with a written notice that he intends to rely on it. Sec. 22, that the production by the defendant of a certificate of analysis by a public analyst shall be evidence. Sec. 26 defines “food” as including every article used for food and drink by man, other than drugs or water, and any article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of human food ; and shall also include flavouring matters and condiments. The Act came into operation on January 1st, 1900. Infectious Disease (Notification) Extension Act, 1899.—On the 1st January, 1900, this Act came into force, so that now the notification of dangerous infectious diseases is compulsory throughout England and Wales, having been compulsorily extended by this Act to the few districts that had not yet adopted the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. The following Order of the Board of Agriculture, dated 17th January, 1899, has been made. Anthrax Order of 1899. The Board of Agriculture, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in them vested under the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1894 and 1896, and of every other power enabling them in this behalf do order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows:— Notice of Disease. 1.—(1) Every person having or having had in his possession or under his charge a diseased or suspected animal, that is to say, an animal affected with, or suspected of, anthrax, shall, with all practicable speed, give notice of the fact of the animal being so diseased, or suspected, to a constable of the police force for the police area wherein the animal so diseased or suspected is or was. (2) The constable shall forthwith give information of the receipt by him of the notice to an Inspector of the Local Authority, who shall forthwith report the 6ame to the Local Authority. (3) The Inspector of the Local Authority shall forthwith give information of the receipt by him of the notice to the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary District in which the diseased or suspected animal is or was. 75 The further provisions are under the following heads :— Duty of Inspector to act immediately. Veterinary Inquiry by Local Authority as to Existence of Anthrax. Milk of Diseased Cow not to be removed. Restriction on Movement of Animals out of or into Place of Outbreak. Provision as to Removal of Dung, &c., out of Place of Outbreak. Disposal of Carcases. Digging up. Disinfection in case of Anthrax. Occupiers to give facilities for Cleansing. Prohibition of Exposure or Movement of Diseased or Suspected Animals. Movement of Animals, &c., with Licence of Board. Powers of Board of Agriculture. Local Authority to enforce Order. Weekly Returns of Anthrax. , Extension of certain Sections of Diseases of Animals Act, 1894. Presumption of Knowledge of Disease. Offences. Interpretation. Revocation of Order. Extent. Commencement. Short Title. Vines v. North London Collegiate School.—This was an important case heard in the Queen's Bench Division on 18th January, 1899, before Mr. Justice Lawrance and Mr. Justice Channell, deciding that entry can only be exercised upon reasonable ground, and in the case of obstruction it is for the magistrate to decide whether the ground of entry is reasonable or not. Warwick v. Graham.—This appeal case, as already related in Part III., settled the definition of the words, "proper lodging and accommodation" as applied to the removal of the infectious sick to hospital. The Court held that the words were directed to the protection of other persons from infection, and not only to the treatment of the sick person. Logsdon v. Booth.—This was an appeal by the London County Council against a decision of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, to the effect that, relying on the case of Booth v. Ferrett, such places as the Salvation Army Shelters, being charitable institutions, were exempt from being registered as Common Lodging Houses under the Lodging House Acts. The Court held that Booth v. Ferrett was wrongly decided. The Lord Chief Justice said in the course of his decision : — "It appears that the Acts of 1851 and 1853 (the Common Lodging House Acts), are Sanitary Acts. They deal with houses to which the very poorest and most wretched class of the population resort, and with conditions in which numbers of 76 that class herd together, availing themselves of the sordid accommodation offered, for which a very low price is charged. In such persons uncleanliness to a large extent, and unhealthiness and even actual disease, infectious or non-infectious, will probably be found to exist. If, therefore, care is not taken to insure cleanliness and other healthy conditions as to air supply, water supply, and so forth, these houses may become a source of danger, not only to their inmates, but to the general public. The legislation, therefore, on this subject had for its object, by inspection and control, to secure for the poor in these houses conditions safeguarding health and preventing the spread of disease, which people better off are supposed to be able to secure for themselves (see per Lindley J. in Langdon v. Broadbent, Justice of the Peace, January, 1878, page 56). The statutes in question are therefore to be regarded simply as measures of sanitarv protection. Applying these considerations to the first ground on which the decision in Booth v. Ferrett was based, it seems impossible to admit that the fact that the house or building in question was carried on for charitable objects and not for gain, would take it out of the measure of sanitary protection if otherwise it would be within it. The question is not with what object or with what motive the house is carried on, but whether the house is such or is so carried on as a lodging house as to be within the provisions of the Act, as it is clearly within the mischief aimed at by the Act. It is to be observed that the learned Judges in Booth v. Ferret differentiated the house in that case from a common lodging house only on the two grounds which I have mentionel. If large numbers of the most wretched class are sleeping in common rooms, insanitary conditions are, in the absence of inspection, supervision and control, not unlikely to arise, and it was the object of the law to secure that inspection, supervision and control. We fail to see the relevance in this connection of the motive actuating the keeper of such a house, whether it be philanthropic or mercenary." SPECIAL REPORTS. In reference to these the following correspondence has taken place: — Health Department, Vestry Hall Pancras Road, N.W. 19t.h February, 1900. The Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. Sir, Public Health (London) Act. 1891. Regulations as to Medical Officers of Health. General Order of 8th December, 1891. In the General Order of the Local Government Board relating to Medical Officers of Health, dated 8th December, 1891, Clause 16, it is provided that the 77 Medical Officer of Health shall transmit to the Local Government Board " a copy of any Special Report made by him." Would you be so good as to inform me what meaning the Board attach to the word special, or would you kindly inform me what class of reports it is held to embrace. I am, &c., John F. J. Sykes. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 30th March, 1900. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 19th ultimo with reference to the meaning of the word "special" in Article 18 (16) of their Order of the 8th December, 1891, prescribing Regulations as to Medical Officers of Health in London. In reply, I am to state that for the purposes of the Article referred to reports which deal only with individual nuisances or the smaller details of sanitary work, as also reports which are made by the Medical Officer of Health in the ordinary course, including monthly, quarterly, or other short period routine reports, need not be regarded as "special" reports, copies of which are to be sent to the Board and to the London County Council, unless they happen to include mention of some unusual matter or event that has occurred during the period. Reports, however, that are made for any special purpose, such, for instance, as (1) reports giving an account of the sanitary state of a district, or of any section of it, and intended to form a basis of systematic work by the Medical Officer of Health in the future ; (2) reports on the need for adoption or revision of regulations or of bye-laws, or on their enforcement; (3) reports on schemes dealing with areas under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, or dealing with the condition of groups of dwellings of any particular class or in any special locality; and (4) reports on the occasion of outbreaks of disease and reports advising the closing of public elementary schools, should, in the Board's view, be considered “ special.” I am, &c., John Lithiby, Assistant Secretary. 78 Table 1.
