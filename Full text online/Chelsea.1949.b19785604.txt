Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the health and sanitary conditions of the Borough during 1949. The population of the Borough was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 5l,990, as compared with 50.890 1948. The birth rate was l6.8 compared with 17.4 in 1948, whilst the crude death rate was 11.1 as against 11.7 in 1948. (The Registrar-General is, however, now providing a comparability figure which enables any area to obtain a standardised death rate comparable either to that for the country as a whole or in respect of any other locality. By this process the death rate in Chelsea for 1948 is found to be 10.5). The infant mortality rate continued to decline, being 2o as against 40 and 44 in 1948 and 1947 respectively. There was a marked decrease in the total incidence of notifiable infectious disease, the number of notifications received totalling 616 as against 894 in 1948. This welcome reduction is largely accounted for by Measles 303 (404 in 1948) and Whooping Cough 123 (230 in 1948). Only 37 cases of Scarlet Fever were brought to the notice of the Department, as compared with 66 in 1948. Both food supplies and premises concerned with the manufacture, storage, and sale of food were under close inspection throughout the year. Details of work in this connection will be found in this report. I should like to make appreciative reference to the work of my predecessor, Dr. W.H.L. McCarthy who was Medical Officer of Health for 26 years until his retirement in February 1950. He desires me to record his thanks to members of the Council for their consistent consideration and support during his tenure of office. He also wishes to place on record his appreciation of the loyal service he received at all times from members of the Staff of the Public Health Department. Having been similarly privileged since my assumption of this office some six months ago, I should like cordially to associate myself with these expressions of gratitude. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.H. WEIR M.D., B.S., B.Hy., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chelsea, S.W.3.

Organisms wore isolated in two instances only, viz: Typhi-Murium, and Salmonella Aetrycke, respectively. There were no deaths. POLIOMYELITIS. 18 notifications were received, but confirmation was received in fourteen instances only, of which - 1 has been discharged as cured 1 is being nursed at home and 12 are receiving treatment at special hospitals, either as in or out patients. Three cases suffered no form of paralysis. TUBERCULOSIS. 65 new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and 2 new cases of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified during the year. In addition, 49 new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 4 new cases of Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health through other sources, making a total of 120. (Pulmonary - Males: 63, Females: 5l. Non-Pulmonary - Males: 1, Females: 5). The total number of cases of Tuberculosis in the Borough at the end of the year was 389, made up as follows:- Pulmonary - Males: 176 Females: 186 Non-Pulmonary - Males: 7 Females: 20 TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. During the period under review, 363 new cases were examined, of which 24 were found to be definitelytubercular. 1.979 attendances were made at the Dispensary, whilst 2,308 visits were made to the homes of patients, either by the nurse or social worker. 115 patients were referred to the Tuberculosis Officer by medical practitioners. 179 specimens of sputum were examined, and 1,084 X-Ray examinations carried out. Artificial pneumo-thorax treatment was given to 15 patients. CHELSEA TUBERCULOSIS CARS, COMMITTIEE. The Committee met on nine occasions during 1949, and gave consideration to 180 cases. As has always been the practice, close co-operation was maintained with other voluntary services. SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS. During the year, four hudred sample a were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of this number, one hundred and ninety were "Formal", and two hundred and ten "Informal" The following table shows the complete list of samples taken:- Article Number examined Number adulterated, etc. Formal Informal Total Formal Informal Total Apple Turnover - 1 1 - - - Bacon - 1 1 - - - Baking powder - 1 1 - - - Biscuits - 1 1 - - - Breakfast foods - 7 7 - 1 1 Breadfast - 4 4 - - - Butter - 6 6 - - - Cake - l 1 - - - Cake mixture - 3 3 - - - Cheese - 5 5 - - - Cloves - 1 1 - - - Cocoa - 5 5 - - - Coffee - 3 3 - - - Coffee & Chicory - 4 4 - - - Coffee & Chicory Essence - 1 1 - - - Confectionery - 11 11 - - - Cooking fat - 5 5 - - - Custard powder - 2 2 - - - Dessert powder - 1 1 - - - Fish, bottled - 1 1 - - - Fish, tinned - 6 6 - 1 1 Fish paste - l l - - - Flavourings - 3 3 - - - Flour, pea - 1 1 - - - Flour, plain - 1 1 - - - Flour, self-raising - 3 3 - - - Fritter mixture - l l - - - Gelatine - 1 1 - - - Gravy browning - l 1 - - - Gravy powder - 3 3 - - - Herbs, mixed - 1 1 - - - Ice Cream - 8 8 - - - Ice Lollies - 2 2 - - - Jam & Marmalade - 13 13 - - - Jelly - 1 1 - - - Lemonade powder - 1 1 - 1 1 Macaroni products - 2 2 - - - Malt preparations - 3 3 - - - Margarine - 6 6 - - - Meat extracts - 3 3 - - - Milk 162 22 184 - - - Milk ('Yoghourt') - 9 9 - - - Milk powder - 1 1 - - - Mustard - 3 3 - - - Pastry mixture - 1 1 - - - Pie fruit - 1 1 - - - Pudding mixture - 2 2 - - - Rennet essence - 1 1 - - - Salad cream - 4 4 - - - Scones - 1 1 - - - Semolina - 1 1 - - - Soup, dried - 2 2 - - - Soup, tinned - 4 4 - 1 1 Sauce - 5 5 - - - Spice, mixed - 1 1 - - - Stuffing, Parsley & Thyme - 1 1 - - - Sugar - 1 1 - - - Tea - 1 1 - - - Tomato juice - 1 1 - - - Vegetables, tinned - 3 3 - - - Vegetables, bottled - 1 1 - - - Vinegar - 5 5 - - - C/F 162 196 358 - 4 4 10 B/F 162 196 358 - 4 4 DRUGS Blood Purifier - 2 2 - 1 1 Castor Oil - 1 1 - - - Cough Cure - 1 1 - - - Cough Lozengas - 1 1 - - - Cream of Tartar - 2 2 - - - Glycerine, Lemon & Ipecachuana Balsam - 1 1 - 1 1 Gout & Rheumatic powders - 1 1 - 1 1 Syrup of Figs - 2 2 - - - SPIRITS Brandy 4 - 4 - - - Gin 10 1 11 1 - 1 Rum 7 1 8 1 - 1 Whisky 7 1 8 - - - TOTALS: 190 210 400 2 7 9 adulterated samples Article Formal or Informal. Adulteration or irregularity. Action taken Bread Informal Found to contain small section of adhesive plaster. Bakery concerned thoroughly investigated. No further action taken, as manufacturers had taken all reasonable stops to prevent contamination. Gin Formal 41.6% below Proof. 10% added water. Case dismissed. Court officials failed to ser??? Defendant with copies of Analyst's certificates. Rum Formal 53.5% below Proof. 2o% excess water. Case dismissed. Court officials failed to serve Defendant with copies of Analyst's certificates. Soup Informal Contravention of Labelling of Food Order. This particular sample formed part of a consignment from Australia. The Minister of Food were appro ached and it was subsequently agreed that no action ??? taken having regard to the difficulties encountered by importer Lemonade Powder. Informal Contravention of Labelling of Food Order. Enquiries brought to light the fact that the manufacture of this particular powder was discontinued in 1945. The vendor concerned held approximately another two dozen 10 ??? bottles, which wore immediately withdrawn from sale. 11 Lemonade Powder (Continued) No saleable stock being available, it was not possible to secure a 'formal' sample, which obviated further action. Blood Purifier Informal Found to be mouldy. This condition was found to arise from unsatisfactory packing methods. The manufacturers were approached and agreed to adopt a more efficient packing process. A subsequent sample from another consignment, proved, on analysis, to be satisfactory. Gout and Rheumatic Powders. Informal Name and address of retail vendor not indicated on packet, thus contravening the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. Sample was purchased from local small general store and was the last of a small stock of this preparation. No formal sample could, therefore, be secured. Retailer warned of breaches of Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933, and it was also pointed out he was not a registered pharmacist. Glycerine and Lemon and Ipecachuana Balsam Informal Contained only 2.5% of Glycerine. Purchased from retailer of preceding sample. Again, no further stock was held, preventing the purchase of a 'formal' sample. Vendor stated he was discontinuing sale of these particular lines Smoked Herring Spread Informal Contained 2,700 parts per million of iron. On examination, can was found to be corroded, a condition which had undoubtedly arisen owing to use of a faulty die stamp. Manufacturers withdrew the whole of the consignment. 12 MILK SUPPLY. During the year, a considerable amount of legislation relating to milk came into operation. This included, inter alia, the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, which re-enacted, with amendments, the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1926 to 1943, the principal changes being consequent upon the provisions of the Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944, and of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions)Act 1949. It is the duty of a local authority to maintain a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in the district, and of all premises within the district which are used as dairies, not being dairy farms, and to remove from such register the name of any person who ceases so to trade, and the address of any premises which cease to be so used. On the 31st December, 1949, the number of persons registered as distributors was 33, and the number of premises registered as dairies was 39. 258 inspections of dairies were carried out during the year. Further Regulations consequent upon the provisions of the Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944, and the Milk (Special Designations) Act, 1949, were the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, which re-enacted, with amendments, the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936 to 1948. The former Regulations apply solely to raw milk, the special designations being "Tuberculin Tested" and "Accredited" and the latter Regulations apply to heat treated milk. They provide for a new special designation - "Sterilised", the other special designation being "Pasteurised". During the year, 58 applications were received and licence were granted authorising the use of special designations in relation to milk sold at or from 34 premises within the Borough. 29 supplementary licences were granted in respect of milk sold by retail within the Borough from 12 premises not in the area of this authority. No special designated milk is pasteurised, sterilised or bottled in the Borough, such milk being received by the licensed dealers ready for retail sale. The following table gives details of licences granted before and after 1st October, 1949, when the 1949 Regulations came into operation. Dealers' licences granted authorising the use of special designations in relation to milk sold within the Borough of Chelsea. Special Designations Granted under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949.

Fifty-six bacteriological examinations of samples of Ice Cream were carried out during the year, with the following results Grade I 11 (19.7%) Grade II 13 (23.2%) Grade III 13 (23.2%) Grade IV 19 (33.9%) Having regard to the great difficulty experienced by manufacturers in securing the desired equipment, it will be readily appreciated that ideal production methods cannot yet be obtained. Nevertheless, the constant supervision of premises, both of manufacturers and retailers, and the ready acceptance of advice by those concerned, is stoadily bringing about a marked improvement in the purity standards of ice cream. Bight samples of ice cream were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis, all being reported as genuine. ICE LOLLIES. Two bacteriological examinations and two chemical examinations of ice lollies were made during the year, with satisfactay results. During the month of May information was received that three children had purchased ice lollies from a street vendor^ when, in each case, these were placed in the mouth, they had adhered to the palate. A police constable had assisted in tho removal of the lollies. and in so doing had unavoidably caused some injury to tho children's mouths, resulting in tho adherence of blood and mucous membrane to the lollies. Tho children were immediately removed to hospital, where it was ascertained they were suffering from ice burns. After treatment they were sent home. The matter was immediately investigated by officers of the Public Health Department, and the vendor, who was selling ice cream and ice lollies from a box-tricycle was interviewed. Samples of these commodities were secured and submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis. It was established that the cause of the accidents was the supercooling of 'the ice lollies by direct contact with solid carbon dioxide a freezing medium with a temperature of 112° below zero (Fahrenheit). The main factors giving rise to this incident were (i) the vendor being an inexperienced youth who had recently left school, and had apparently received no proper instructions in connection with the duties he was to performs (ii) solid carbon dioxide was permitted to come into direct contact with the unprotected ice lollies, being broken into small pieces and sprinkled over the lollies, whereas it should have been packed in an outer container surrounding the lollies, or, alternatively, the lollies should have been wrapped. It was interesting to note that other prepacked goods - ice cream tubs and wafers - were not affected; (iii) no printed instructions were supplied with the solid carbon dioxide detailing the precautions to be observed. A report was immediately made to the Fulham Borough Council, from whose area the vendor was trading with the tricycle, requesting them to make a thorough investigation, and warn the vendor of the dangers involved in the indiscriminate handling of solid carbon dioxide. A similar report was sent to the manufacturers of tho solid carbon dioxide, asking for their observations, together with details of the instructions they issued when packing this commodity. At the same time, a further copy of the report vas forwarded to the Ice Cream Alliance, asking for their co-operation in preventing a rocurronce of this incident, and finally, tho Ministry of Health were placed in full possession of the facts. Within a few days of the above incident a conference was held between representatives of the Ice Cream Alliance, tho manufacturers of tho refrigerant, and officers of both Chelsea and Fulham Borough Councils, when it was agreod that the solid carbon dioxide should not be utilised in an unwrapped condition. 14 Subsequently approach was made to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, who communicated with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Food. The latter Ministry indicated hat they were asking the trade to draw attention to the importance of keeping dry ice in a separate container or otherwise adequately protect it from coming into contact with ice lollies or ice cream. The sale of such goods contaminated by carbon dioxide would appear to be an offence which could be the subject of enforcement action by local authorities. WATER. In six instances samples of water were submitted for both chemical and bacteriological examinations, and in every case, a satisfactory report was received. SURRENDER OF UNSOUND FOOD.

The local authority is empowered, under the provisions of the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, the Infestation Order, 1943 to take necessary action to eradicate rats and mice. ill complaints received are thoroughly investigated. Where an infestation occurs in business premises, the cost of the work carried out by the Rodent Control staff is borne by occupiers, but in private premises no charge is made to the occupiers when dealing with rats, unless circumstances are such as render the imposition of charges reasonable; further, a charge of 7s. 6d is made in every instance where mice are found in private premises. Set out below are details of the work carried out during 1949. Treatment of Business and Private premises. Business premises Private premises Number of visits made 50 32 Number of infestations found 50 319 Number of treatments undertaken 47 310 Number of pre-baits laid 1,673 Number of poison baits laid 544 Number of complaints received 389 Sewer Maintenance Treatments. Two maintenance treatments of sewers were carried out during the year, in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, as follows:- 1. 30th May to 3rd June. No. of pre-baits laid. No. of poison baits laid. Egtina1ted kill. 1,552 379 4,530 2. 2nd to 5th December. No. of pre-baits laid. No. of poison baits laid. Estimated kill. 1,214 381 4,290 - 23 - BURIAL OR CREMATION OF THE DEAD. In accordance with the provisions or the National Assistance Act, 1948, a local authority is required to take arrangements for the burial or cremation of the body of any person in respect of whom no other suitable arrangements can be made. Early in the year the Minister of Health reconsidered the application cf Section 50 of the above Act, and it was decided that Hospital Committees and Boards should arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of patients dying in hospital under the following circumstances 3:- (a) Relatives not being traced; (b) Relatives being traced, but who were not, immediately before a patient's death, liable for his (or her) maintenance under Section 42(1) of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and are not willing to undertake the arrangement of burial or cremation; and (c) Relatives not being able to obtain a death grant under the National Insurance Act, 1946, and unable to accept financial responsibility for burial or cremation expenses. It will be obvious therefore that the great majority of patients dying in hospital will not be the responsibility of a local authority. The latter, however, will have to deal with such cases as may be referred to them by hospital authorities owing to the failure of a liable relative to assume his responsibility, and, in addition, make the necessary arrangements in respect of the bodies of persons dying in their own hemes if it has proved impossible to discover any liable relatives, Section 50(4) of the National. Assistance Act, 1948, provides that ''an authority may recover from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who for the purposes of this Act was liable to maintain the deceased percon immediately before his (or her) death expenses incurred". During the year, twenty-five cases received the attention of the Public Health Department, details of which are as follows Adults and children over ten years of age 21 Children under one year of age 1 Still births 3 24 PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, provision is made for the removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention, but occas??? did not arise which warranted action under the above Act. The Woman Sanitary Inspector has, however, been successful in persuading a number of infirm persons to avail themselves of such facilities, and has been most active in her endeavours to brighten the lives of many who are unable to lead a normal life. MORTUARY FACILITIES. Under an agreement existing between Hammersmith Borough Council and this authority, adequate arrangements are provided at the Mortuary maintained by the former body. Set out below are details of admissions, &c, from Chelsea. Number of bodies admitted to Mortuary 217 Number of Post-Mortem examinations 200 Number of Inquests held 44 PHARMACY & POISONS ACT, 1933. Forty-six applications for retention and three applications for inclusion in the Council's list of authorise sellers of poisons were received for the period 1st May, 1949 to 30th April, 1950. Fifty-three visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors to ensure that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. Only two contraventions of the Act occurred, warnings being given to the traders concerned.
