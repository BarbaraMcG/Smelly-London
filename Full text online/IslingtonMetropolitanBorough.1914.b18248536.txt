To The Worshipful The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. Dear Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Herewith, I have pleasure in submitting the Fifty-ninth annual report of the Medical Officer of Health, on the health and sanitary condition of Islington during 1914. Both were good, and, indeed, the records will compare satisfactorily with those of recent years. In submitting my report I desire specially to thank the Chairman (Councillor Thomas Luke Harwood) and the members of the Public Health Committee for the generous support they have invariably given me in carrying out my work; and at the same time I would call attention to the very willing assistance which the staff of the Public Health Department have at all times afforded me. I am, Your faithful servant, Medical Officer of Health. August, 1915. viii. SUMMARY of Vital Statistics, 1914.

THE POPULATIONS, AREAS AND DENSITIES OF THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS, THE WARDS AND THE BOROUGH. B - 3 1914 RE PORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1914. POPULATION OF THE BOROUGH, THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS, THEIR AREAS AND DENSITIES. Estimated Population, 325,496. — It is necessary to have a fairly accurate estimate of the size of the population if the statistics, especially the Death Rates and the Birth Rates, are to be reliable. Considerable doubt has been cast on the accuracy of the estimates of the Registrar-General as regards this borough, but, as this matter was fully discussed in the last Annual Report, it will not be further dwelt upon now. It must be stated, however, that the population of Islington has been lately revised by him as he evidently felt that his estimate of the population, not only of Islington, but of other places, was not correct, and in doing so he has taken into consideration the fall in its natural increase, that is, the excess of births over deaths, since 1911, and the increase in the loss by migration, and, therefore, his new estimate, made to the middle of 1914, has been based upon the returns of Births, Deaths and Migration. The population, as now estimated, is still too low, for it is almost certain that, instead of being below that of the census of 1911, when it was 327,403, it is in excess of it for the reasons given in the report referred to. The present estimate shows a decrease of 1,907 persons; so small a number does not, however, affect the accuracy of the rates to any great extent. Sexes of Population.—The number of males estimated to be living in Islington is 154,968, and of females, 170,528. The population was of course, slightly affected by the number of males of military age who enlisted B 2 4 1914 from August to December, but it is impossible to say what the number was. At the time of the Census, however, the number of men of the military age—19 to 40 years—was 55,950, but there is no return to show how many of these have joined the forces. Table I.

Water, such as the Regent's Canal, and the New River, cover 17.2 acres, railways 196.9 acres, markets 14.9 acres, and parks and open spaces 62.8 acres, so that altogether 291.8 acres are unavailable for housing the people. This is not a very great area, although distributed as it is throughout the borough it provides satisfactory lungs for it. Table IV. shows how this space is distributed:— Table IV. Sub-Districts.

MARRIAGES, BIRTHS AND DEATHS. 10 1914 MARRIAGES. Marriages, 3,188; Marriage Rate, 19.9.— The number of persons married was 6,376, as contrasted with 5,968 in the preceding year, which is an increase of 408. and the marriage rate per thousand inhabitants was 19.59, as compared with 17.98 in 1913. This rate is the highest experienced since 1865, when it was 19.77 per thousand inhabitants. In the first quarter of the year the rate was only 11.20 per thousand, which figure rose to 19.17 in the second quarter, and further increased to 23.72 in the third quarter; while in the fourth quarter it was as high as 24.26. This increase was most probably due to the large number of war marriages that undoubtedly occurred, not only in Islington, but throughout England; especially was this indicated in the fourth quarter which showed an increase of 6.58 in the rate per thousand of the inhabitants, while the actual number of persons married showed an increase of 424 (or 212 marriages), as contrasted with the corresponding quarter of 1913. Only twice since 1841 has the marriage rate been so high. (Vide Table VIII.) The following statement shows the figures for the decennial average 1902-1911, and for 1912, 1913 and 1914.

Births, 8,177 ; Birth Rate, 25.12.—This number includes 117 births which took place in districts outside the borough, and which were transferred by the Registrar-General to Islington, where the parents of the children resided. The actual number of births registered in the borough was 8,060, as contrasted with 8,220 in the preceding year. The Birth Rate, inclusive of the transferred births, was 25.12 per 1,000 inhabitants, which must be considered the actual birth rate of the borough. The birth rate resulting from the figures registered in the borough was 24.76 per thousand, which is almost identical with the return for 1913, when it was 24.77. These figures are, of course, considerably less than those recorded in past years, which may be seen by the fact Chat from 1841—1850 the birth rate averaged 28.65 „ 1851—1860 do. 34.54 „ 1861—1870 do. 37.20 „ 1871—1880 do. 36.60 „ 1881—1890 do. 32.49 „ 1891—1900 do. 29.31 „ 1901—1910 do. 26.36 Thus, of late years, there has been a serious fall in the birth rate of the borough. This fall is not, however, peculiar to Islington, although, perhaps, it is greater than in most places, but is common to the whole country. Illegitimate Births. Illegitimate Births, 304—The number of illegitimate births shows an increase of 7, as contrasted with 1913, but is 29 below that registered in 1912, and is equal to a rate of 3-72 per cent. of the total births. The illegitimate births in the borough since 1841 are shown in the following statement:— Periods. Illegitimate Births. Total Births. Illegitimate Births per 100 Registered Births. 1841.50 641* 20,850 3.07 1851.60 1,335 41,915 3.18 1861.70 2,651 67,520 3.92 1871.80 3,429 89,627 3.82 1881.90 3,475 97,420 3.57 1891.1900 2,719 97,278 2.79 1901.1910 2,413 87,361 2.76 * This is an estimated figure, as the returns for only seven years are available. Table G of the Appendix gives a return of the illegitimate births for each year since 1841. 13 [1914 The Notification of Births.— 7,121 Notifications were received, and represent 87.1 per cent. of the total number of births registered. This shows a decrease of 124 on the return for 1913. It is to be regretted that in 1,056 instances there was a failure to comply with the Notification of Births Act, 1907, which represent 12.9 per cent of the registered births; there is, however, a slight decrease in the percentage of failures when contrasted with the previous year, when it was equal to 13.3 per cent. In the preceding years the figures were as follows:— Births. Notifications. Failures to notify. Per cent. notified.

Of the 7,121 notifications, 1,038 were forwarded by medical practitioners. 3,433 were forwarded by midwives. 2,650 were forwarded by parents and others. 847 failures to notify to the Medical Officer of Health have been investigated, and it has been ascertained that: In 645 instances the mother was attended by a doctor. In 77 instances the mother was attended by a midwife. In 9 instances the mother was attended by persons other than a doctor or midwife. In 116 instances no information could be obtained for the reasons which follow:— Information refused. Wrong address on certificates. Futile calls. Removal from the house since birth of child. Death of child before registration. 14 1914] The following statement shows by whom the notifications were made since the Act came into operation:.— By Medical Practitioners. By Midwives.

Deaths, 4,398 ; Death Rate. 15.17.—The death-rate of the borough was practically the same as that of the preceding year when it was 1515, and it is identical with the mean rate that obtained in Islington from 1901—1910 inclusive. It is, however, slightly above the rate that prevailed in the 10 years immediately preoeding, when it was 14.89. The rate is above that of London, in which it was 14.4 per 1,000, and also of the Great Towns, wherein it was 14.7. The death-rate, however, may be considered satisfactory, for one must not forget that the life conditions of the inhabitants of Islington have not changed for the better during the last 15 years. These have, of course, tended to increase the mortality to the slight extent indicated by the above figures. The deaths from the various diseases did not show much variation from those of 1913. which indicates that the mortality of the borough is running on very even lines. It is satisfactory, too, to find that the death-rate was identical with the mean rate for the six boroughs encircling Islington, and considerably below the rates for Finsbury and Shoreditch, while it was slightly below that of St. Pancras; on the other hand, the rates in Stoke Newington and Hackney were respectively 13.1 and 13.9 per 1,000.

At each of the other age periods there was an increased return, which, in one case alone, namely, that between 45 and 55, was as much as 73. It is not satisfactory to note that at all ages over 35, except that of very old age, the numbers showed an increase. A statement has been prepared, and is given below, which indicates the number of deaths during the year from each of the classified causes of disease as well as the average number from those causes during the preceding 10 years, and also those for the year 1913.

First Quarter.—The deaths in the first quarter numbered 1,414, as contrasted with a corrected average of 1,409 in the preceding ten years, and were equal to an annual death rate of 17.41 per 1,000, which contrasted with a mean decennial rate of 17.36. Second Quarter.—1,100 deaths were registered, or four above the corrected average for the 10 years 1904-1913; these were equal to an annual death-rate of 13.35 per 1,000, as contrasted with the mean decennial rate of 13.50. Third Quarter.—The deaths numbered 1,143, which was 109 more than the average, after correction for increase of population, of the 10 years 1904-1913, while the death rate was equal to an annual death rate of 14 07 per 1,000, as compared with the mean decennial rate of 12.73 per 1,000. Fourth Quarter.—1,281 deaths were registered, as contrasted with a corrected average of 1,294 in the ten years preceding; they were equal to an annual death-rate of 15.78 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with the mean decennial rate of 15.94.

Infant Deaths, 849 ; Mortality Rate, 104.—Altogether 849 deaths of infants under one year old were registered during the year, which represented an infant mortality of 104 per 1,000 infants born. This rate is 7 per 1,000 below the annual record of the preceding 10 years, and is 3 per 1,000 below the rate which obtained in 1913. but is far above that of 1912, when it was only 86 per 1,000 births. The mortality in the several districts varied from 86 per 1,000 births in Upper Holloway to 134 in Lower Holloway, which is explained in part by the difference in the class of persons in residence. A series of Tables dealing with infant mortality follow at the end of this section of the Report, and each one is worthy of the closest study, particularly those showing the result of the enquiry into the feeding of the infants under twelve months who died from diarrhoeal diseases. There it will be found that an undue proportion of them had never been fed at their mother's breast; indeed, during the last six years out of 78 of these children under three months old, only 15, or 19.2 per cent., were properly fed, and out of 212 children under six months old, only 13.7 per cent. were so fed. These figures show that mothers are not alive to the necessity of feeding their children as nature intended, and it is for this reason, as well as others that have already been mentioned in previous reports, that Health Visitors are so much required. The appalling ignorance of mothers respecting the bringing up of their children has been fully recognised throughout the length and breadth of this land, and everywhere prodigious efforts have been, and are being, made to prevent the terrible waste of infant life that is occurring in our midst. The Borough Council of Islington has adopted a negative policy in this matter; but why, no one who understands the subject can explain. It is certain, however, that they are not doing the right thing in ignoring the preventable mortality occurring among the infants in our midst. There is no occasion to dwell further on this matter; several reports have been made on the subject, and every year special attention has been drawn to it, but nothing has been done; and Islington, it is much to be regretted, stands alone among the great communities, and, indeed, almost alone among the lesser, as doing nothing to prevent this wastage of life. Happily, however, during the last eighteen months a School for Mothers has been voluntarily instituted in North Islington at 9 Manor Gardens, which, it is most heartening to know, is doing really good solid work, and where the mothers of North Islington are availing themselves of the teaching and instruction which the institution affords. It is also pleasing to the Medical Officer of Health, who takes such an interest 33 [1914 in this subject, to learn that it is fast becoming a model for Schools for Mothers in London, and that it is extending its work in several directions ; its only need is funds to enable it to do more, and it is sincerely hoped that the Borough Council of Islington will give its support—moral and pecuniary—to enable it to continue its usefulness It is good tidings to learn that the success of the Northern School for Mothers, in connection with which the name of Mrs. Florence Keen will be always associated, has also induced a number of ladies, who have the welfare of the children at heart, to band themselves together to establish a similar School for South Islington. Even then Islington will not be properly supplied, for Schools are wanted both in the eastern and in the western parts of the borough. No doubt these will come in time, but not too soon, because there are constant enquiries made at the Public Health Department by women as to where such Schools are to be found. The day has passed when Schools for Mothers were looked upon with suspicion and as fads; they are now heartily welcomed by mothers who regard them as trusty friends in their times of doubt and difficulties which occur and recur during the trying periods of their carrying and rearing their infants. In the following statement is shown the ages at which infants died from all causes in Islington during the past ten years,, the number at each period, and the percentage which these numbers bear to the total infant deaths. Ages of Infants. No. of Deaths. Percentage of Deaths. Under a week old 1,793 died, or 19.6 per cent. of the infant deaths 1to 2 weeks „ 492 „ 5.4 „ „ 2 to 3 „ „ 399 „ 4.3 „ „ 3 to 4 „ „ 331 „ 3.6 „ „ Total under a month 3,015 „ 32.9 „ „ 1 to 3 months 1.776 „ 19.4 „ „ Total under 3 months 4.791 „ 523 „ „ 3 to 6 months 1,719 „ 18.8 ,, „ 6 to 9 „ 1,350 „ 14.7 „ „ 9 to 12 „ 1,302 „ 14.2 „ „ Total 3 to 12 months 4,371 „ 47.7 „ „ Total 9.162 „ 100.0 „ „ Such figures as these, especially those relating to the earlier weeks of existence, need no comment, for any one who seriously studies them must arrive at the conclusion that they indicate an enormous loss of infant life, which is p 34 1914] now so needed to replace the shocking wastage of war. It is appalling to think that practically 20 per cent. of the deaths are of infants under a week old, and that 33 per cent. had not attained their first month, and very sad to know that it is so largely due to that maternal want of that knowledge which is so requisite to enable mothers to rear their children.

Hornsey 57 „ Stoke Newington 78 „ Hackney 92 „ Shoreditch 141 „ Finsbury 123 „ St. Pancras 92 „ V The Encircling Boroughs 101 „ Islington 104 MORTALITY FROM THE PRINCIPAL EPIDEMIC DISEASES. Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fevers (Typhus, Enteric and Continued) and Diarrhceal Diseases. Four hundred and thirty-five deaths were registered, which were equal to an annual death-rate of 1.34 per 1,000, as contrasted with 449 and a death-rate of 1 38 in the ten years immediately preceding. The death-rate is therefore practically the same as that which obtained from 1904-1913 inclusive. There was, however, an increase as contrasted with the number of deaths which occurred in 1913, when the deaths numbered only 322, and the death-rate was only 0-97, which, with one exception, was the lowest hitherto recorded in the borough. The decrease, when compared with the preceding decennium, was entirely due to the much fewer deaths from Measles; otherwise, owing to an increase in the deaths from Diarrhosal Diseases, the death-rate would not have been quite so satisfactory. A return, showing the deaths from the principal epidemic diseases for the last 20 years is attached, where it will be seen that there has been a fall from 3.69 per 1,000 in 1885, to 1.34 in 1914. The record of the decline in infectious disease is gratifying, for a study of Table XXXI. reveals the pleasing fact that, of late years, there has undoubtedly been a diminution in the number of deaths from the principal Zymotic Diseases. 43 [1914 MORTALITY FROM THE PRINCIPAL EPIDEMIC DISEASES.

No death was registered from Small Pox during the year, nor was a case of the disease notified. MEASLES. Ninety-seven deaths were registered, or four less than in 1913, and 45 less than the average of the preceding ten years. The resulting death-rate was 0.29 per 1,000 of the inhabitants. Six deaths were registered in the first quarter, 20 in the second, 41 in the third, and 30 in the fourth. The disease was distributed over the Borough, although Tufnell, Upper Holloway, and Highbury, in each of which only 4 deaths occurred, suffered least.

Once more attention is drawn to the secondary causes of the deaths from this disease; no less than 73 were ascribed to pneumonia, and 6 to bronchitis, while altogether the total secondary causes amounted to 90, leaving only 7 deaths which were solely ascribed to Measles. Many of these complications are due to the parental want of knowledge as to the care necessary to protect the children. 49 [1914 Table XXXVII.

The deaths ascribed to Scarlet Fever numbered 23, which is only one below the average for the preceding ten years, and the resulting death-rate was equal to 0.07 per 1,000 of the population. Of these deaths, 7 were registered in the first quarter, 4 in the second, 3 in the third, and 9 in the fourth. It is remarkable that no death from this disease occurred in the Tufnell sub-district, which contains nearly 34,000 inhabitants. The decline in the deaths from Scarlet Fever has been one of the noticeable features in the sanitary history of the Borough, for, whereas from 1891 to 1895, and from 1896-1900, the average number of deaths was 66 and 40 respectively, from 1901-1905 it was only 33, and from 1906-1910 only 25 ; and since E 2 52 1914] then the numbers have been 20 in 1911, 9 in 1912, 19 in 1913, and 23 in 1914. These figures, it will be seen, contrast very favourably with those of former years, and the borough is o be congratulated on the fact, for undoubtedly this is a very serious disease of young life; how serious it was in previous years may be seen from the Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report for 1909, where an account is given of its malignant nature in former years.

The deaths from this disease numbered 44, and were equal to a death-rate of 013 per 1,000 of the inhabitants. They show an increase of 6 on the average which obtained in the decennial period 1904-1913, and were also 7 above the number registered in 1913. In the first six months of the year only 14 deaths were registered, as contrasted with 23 in 1913, but in the second six months there was an increase of 19 over the corresponding period of 1913. It is difficult to account for this considerable increase which was distributed over the whole of the Borough. 53 [1914 The previous history of the disease in Islington is indicated in the following statement:— Years.

W hooping Cough was responsible for 83 deaths, which is exactly equal to the corrected average for the preceding ten years, but is an increase of 21 on the return for 1913. The particulars for each of the sub-districts are given in the following Table Table XLIII. Showing the Deaths and Death rates from Whooping Cough in the Sub-Districts for each Quarter and the Year.

Fourteen deaths were known to be caused by Enteric Fever, which was exactly the corrected average of the preceding ten years. The return is, however, the highest since 1910, when 17 deaths were registered, which were followed in 1911 by 12, in 1912 by 8, and in 1913 by 4 deaths. The largest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter, when 8 were registered; this number declined to 3 in the second, to 2 in the third, and to one in the fourth quarter, so that the excess of deaths were practically confined to the first three months of the year. It is singular that no death was registered in either Tollington or Lower Holloway, which together contain more than 68,000 inhabitants, although 12 cases were notified from the former sub-district, and 4 from the latter. 55 [1914 Table XLIV.

These include Diarrhoea, Dysentery, Choleraic Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, Epidemic Enteritis, Infective Enteritis, Enteric Catarrh, Gastrointestinal Catarrh and Gastro-enteric Catarrh. Taken together, the deaths from these diseases numbered 291, an excess of only 23 when contrasted with the return for 1913, but very much more than the number recorded in 1912, when only 134 were registered. The increase in the return was principally due to two hundred deaths of infants under one year old, which contrasted unfavourably with 181 in 1913, and 80 in 1912, but is very much better than the record for 1911, when 309 occurred. The following Table gives the deaths from these diseases at three separate age periods of life, for each quarter, and for each year from 1905 to 1914. 56 1914] table XLV.

Influenza, a highly infectious disease, caused 30 deaths, which is a decrease of 28 on the return for the preceding year, and of 24 on the average of the ten years 1904-1913 (vide Table LI.). Since 1891 there has been a steady decrease in the number of deaths from it, which may be seen in the statement given below, which shows the number of deaths since 1900 in quinquennial periods. In the quinquennium, 1891-1895, they averaged something over 143 per annum, in the following five years they averaged 84; this number fell to 54 in the succeeding quinquennium, but rose again to nearly 66 in the five years, 1906-1910; in the next five years, 1911-1914, there was a decline of nearly 50 per cent., for the average amounted to only 38, which is satisfactory, and if continued for a few years would bring us to the happy days that obtained from 1871 to 1885, when they did not reach an average of 1 per annum.

There was a decrease in the number of deaths from this disease during the year, for, whereas they numbered 24 in 1913, and averaged 23 in the preceding decennium, it was now only responsible for 19 deaths. The return is not, however, the lowest, for in 1912 there were only 13 deaths registered, while ;n 1907 the number was the same as now recorded.

Erysipelas—From this disease 20 deaths occurred, which is 9 above the return of 1913, and 8 above the average of the preceding ten years, yet, strange to say, no death was registered in the large sub-districts of Tufnell and Upper Holloway.

Under this heading are included Cancer and Tuberculosis, as well as Rheumatism, Rickets, Diabetes, Gout, Anaemia, Gangrene and Purpura. These diseases, as a group, caused 1,056 deaths, and were equal to a deathrate of 3.24 per 1,000 of the population; they also formed 21.4 per cent, of the entire deaths registered in the Borough during the year. It will thus be seen that they are a very important group of diseases. The statement which immediately follows shows that the deaths from them have averaged 1,038 during the preceding 23 years, and represents a death-rate of 3.19 per 1,000 inhabitants. The death-rate from them as a class has varied very little each year, amounting at most to one or two decimal points, either above or below the average. This will be noticed in the following Table : Deaths Death-rates. Deaths.

Perhaps one of the most important groups of the Constitutional Diseases is Cancer, which caused 384 deaths, which represented a death-rate of 118 per 1,000 inhabitants; of these deaths 164 were males and 220 females, 1914] 70 Although the death-rate resulting from them was 0.04 below that of the preceding year, yet it was the highest, with that exception, hitherto recorded in Islington. The disease continues its ravages apparently without check, increasing year by year, as shown in the following statement:— Year. Males. Females. Persons.

But it is some little consolation to know that in all civilised countries scientists of high eminence are endeavouring to discover and to devise a cure.

Pulmonary Phthisis, Tabes Mesenterica, Tubercular Meningitis, Tuberculosis of the Larynx, General Tuberculosis, and other forms of Tuberculosis, such as Lupus, Tubercular Caries, and Pott's Disease. The return is an unsatisfactory one in so far as the 508 deaths which it caused are in excess of those registered in the preceding 4 years. They are, however, 49 below the average of the preceding 23 years. The deaths represent 1.75 per 1,000 of the inhabitants and 11.5 per cent, of the deaths from all causes during the year, which is practically one per cent, more than the proportion in 1913. It may be mentioned that although there was an increase in the number of deaths yet the actual notified cases of the disease fell to 1,150 from 1,683 in the preceding year. The actual number of deaths from tuberculosis in each year since 1891 has been as follows: — Year. Deaths, Death Rates. Year. Deaths. Teaih Rates. 1891 717 2.24 1904 682 2.05 1892 677 2.09 I905 580 1.75 1893 758 2.32 1906 578 1.74 1894 673 2.04 1907 608 1.84 1895 763 2.28 1908 604 1.83 1896 730 2.l6 1909 582 1.77 1897 689 2.04 1910 539 1.64 1898 686 2.04 1911 512 1.56 1899 729 2.17 1912 553 1.69 1900 710 2.11 1913 535 1.61 1901 677 2.02 Average 617 1 .90 1902 672 2.01 1903 632 1.90 1914 568 1 75 Pulmonary Phthisis—Phthisis, which is the chief of the Tuberculosis Group, caused 461 deaths, or 41 more than the return for 1913. It is, however, 22 below the corrected average of the preceding 22 years, and only so far is it satisfactory. The deaths were equal to a death-rate of 1.42 per 1,000, and formed 9.33 per cent, of the deaths from ail causes registered during the year. It will thus be seen that very nearly one-tenth of the total deaths were ascribed to this one disease, which shows better than any words what an important matter it is to battle with its germs: it is a slow process, but, happily, one hopeful of good results. Indeed, the history of Tuberculosis during the last few years in England shows that there is a general falling off in the number of deaths from it, CHART.

Tubercular Meningitis.—Sixty deaths were reported from it, representing a death-rate of 0.18 per 1,000 These deaths are 6 less than the average of the preceding ten years. Of the 60 deaths, 37 were males and 23 females; while 37 were children under five years, and 23 over that age; indeed, all with six exceptions were under fifteen. General Tuberculosis.—The deaths of 7 persons were ascribed to it, of whom 4 had not reached their fifth year. The deaths were nine less than in 1913, and produced a death-rate of 0.02 per 1,000. Other forms of Tuberculosis caused 15 deaths, 10 males and 5 females, and with three exceptions they were those of persons above five years of age.

These diseases, which include Chronic and Acute Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and Asthma, caused 896 deaths, or 103 less than in 1913. They represented 181 per cent, of the total deaths registered in the borough. Acute Bronohitis.— One hundred and thirty-four deaths were ascribed lo it, of which 54 occurred among males, and 80 among females This is a decrease of 15 below the return for 1913. It is to be noted that no less than 42 deaths of infants under 12 months' old took place, and that 24 deaths occurred in the Public Institutions of the borough.

[1914 83 Chronic Bronchitis. —As compared with the previous year, the 303 deaths which were registered show a decrease of 40. One hundred and fiftyeight deaths were those of males, and 145 were females. Pneumonia.—Four hundred deaths were registered, 205 being males, and 195 females. The return was 19 below that of 1913, and was, as usual, very fatal to infants under a year old, among whom it caused 85 deaths, while the same number of young children, between 1 and 5 years old, died from it; among children between 5 and 10 years of age it was fatal to 12 As many as 99 persons died in the Pubiic Institutions, as contrasted with 92 in the preceding year, the majority of whom died in the Workhouse Infirmaries. Pleurisy.—Twenty-two deaths were registered from it, 4 of which were those of children under 5 years of age; six deaths were registered in Public Institutions. Asthma and Emphysema. —These diseases caused 16 deaths, all of which were of adults. Other Diseases of the Respiratory System -—Twenty-one deaths were registered from them, as contrasted with 16 in 1913. Deaths among Infants—As it is interesting to note the deaths among infants, they are given herewith : — Acute Bronchitis. Pneumonia.

This, with one exception, is the lowest return since 1901, as it was only less in 1911, when 4 deaths were attributed to this cause. It is therefore a very gratifying record, and shows, to some extent, that the cause of temperate drinking is gaining ground. From the point of infant mortality it is also pleasing for undoubtedly alcohol plays an important part in sending into the world infants improperly prepared to meet its everyday stresses, G 2 1914] 84 The statement given below shows the number of deaths during each year since 1901:— Acute.

The 21 deaths registered from Venereal Diseases is an unsatisfactory return, for it is two above that of 1913, four above that of 1912, and eight above that of 1911. It is also four in excess of the average of the preceding 12 years. In actual figures the increase may not seem large, but when one recollects that these are only deaths, and not cases, and that among these deaths were 17 infants under a year old, and also that the deaths represented only a small proportion of the number of cases of the disease, it will be seen that a small increase is a matter of concern. Syphilis in children is to be reached only if the mothers can be prevailed upon to come to a hospital, to a School for Mothers, or to similar places, for treatment while carrying their children, for treatment of the mother has its effect on the infant, and consequently both may be cured at the same time. An examination recently made on behalf of the Local Government Board in the East End of London showed that practically a half per cent, (actually 0.45 per cent.) of 660 infants tested for syphilis showed a reaction to the test. This subject is at present engaging very serious attention, and it is a good omen to find that the Local Government Board has caused a well-known bacteriologist to report on the matter [1914 85 The following figures record the number of deaths for each year since 1902: — Under 1 year. 1—5 years.

The return for the year was not a satisfactory one for it showed that 2,947 cases were notified, as contrasted with a decennial average of 1,957— an increase of 990 cases. They were equal to an annual attack rate of 9.08 per 1,000 inhabitants, as contrasted with 6.54 in 1913, and with 7.63 during the preceding 22 years.

[1914 99 Sub-Registration Districts. —The largest number of cases in proporto population occurred in Barnsbury, where 596 attacks were equal to an attack rate of 11.35 per 1,000. Next in order came Tollington, where 310 cases represented an attack rate of 10.52 per thousand inhabitants. The lowest attack rate was in Tufnell, where there occurred 219 cases, equivalent to an attack rate of 6.43.

H 2 100 1914] First Quarter. — The 674 cases notified were equal to an attack-rate of 8.30 per 1,000, and contrasted with a decennial average of 401 cases, so that the return showed an increase of 273. Second Quarter.—There were 555 cases notified, or 155 more than the average for the decennial period. They represent an attack-rate of 6.83 per 1,000 inhabitants. Third Quarter.—768 cases were known, which is 255 above the average that obtained in the corresponding quarters of the 10 years, 1904-1913. They were equal to an annual attack-rate of 9.46 per 1,000 of the population. Fourth Quarter.—950 cases were notified, as contrasted with a decennial average of 645. There has, therefore, been an increase of 305 attacks. These cases represent an attack-rate of 11.70 per 1,000 o'f the population. The following statement gives the particulars for each quarter : — Quarters. Cases. Attack-rates. Decennial average. Increase or decrease.

''Fatality" means the percentage proportion of deaths to attacks, that is to say, if there were 100 attacks and five deaths, the fatality would be 5 per cent. It was noted in the last Annual Report that the fatality from all the infectious diseases grouped together for the year was the lowest on record, and it is satisfactory to find that it is only 0.3 per cent, higher in the year under discussion, for the 112 deaths that occurred among the 2,947 cases were equal to a rate of 3.8 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, which contrasts with an average rate of 7.6 in the preceding 23 years, 1891-1913. The subsequent statement, which was given last year, is now reprinted because it contains important figures which show what a difference there is between the fatality from these diseases when notification became compulsory nnd in recent years. 101 [1914 Years Cases.

This represents the high figure of 86.3 per cent, of all the cases notified, and is the largest proportion hitherto recorded. More and more do people desire the removal of their children, and, for the matter of that, of adults, to the Metropolitan Asylum Boards Hospitals, when they are attacked, and, indeed, at times this demand for isolation is unreasonable as in many instances the parents might easily arrange for the proper 1914] 102 isolation of the cases at home. It is, however, a very difficult matter to say when a case should not be removed, in view of the strong feeling of the public generally about infectious diseases. Consequently only 13.7 per cent, of the patients remained at home. The following tabular statement has been prepared to show the growth of the percentage number of cases treated in the various public institutions connected with the Borough :— Year.

No case was notified during the year, and only three cases occurred in London. SCARLET FEVER. To Scarlet Fever was attributed 1,853 attacks, which is the highest return for 10 years. The disease began to be prevalent towards the end of September, 1913, when the weekly curve gradually rose until it reached its highest point in the second week of November: it then fell gradually to the end of the year, and continued to fall until ttfe beginning of May, 1914, when, as will be seen by the chart, it rose slightly, but almost immediately began again to fall, so that in mid-July the attacks were below the average of the preceding 10 years. They then began to become much more numerous, so that the number was far above the decennial average. The chart shows this very clearly, and it will be seen that in the first week in November the peak rose very abruptly, indicating as many as 91 cases in that week. Thence, onwards to the end of the year there was a gradual fall in the curve, although the number of cases continued to be very much above the average. Showing the cases of SCARLET FEVER notified in each week in 1914, and the averages for the corresponding weeks in the ten years 1904-1913. 103 [1914 It is difficult to account for this epidemic. No cause has been found for it, but it may be said that it was not peculiar to Islington, for there was a very noticeable increase in the number of cases of the disease throughout the Metropolis. The cases notified during the year contrasted with an average of 1,130 in the preceding 10 years, and the return was therefore 723 in excess. The attack rate was as high as 5.71 per thousand of the population, which is 2.28 in excess of the mean rate of the preceding 10 years, and is higher than any rate in those years. The return is, moreover, with one exception, the highest recorded since the notification of the disease was made compulsory, namely, that for 1896, when 2,031 cases were known. The great majority of the cases were confined to individual houses, thus, there was only 1 case in each of 1,253 houses out of the 1,481 houses infected, and there were 2 cases in each of 150 houses, 3 cases in each of 53 houses, 4 cases in each of 14 houses, 5 cases in each of 8 houses, 6 cases in each of 2 houses, and 8 cases in 1 house. These facts are tabulated in the following statement, where a comparison is also made with the four preceding years:— Number of cases of Scarlet Fever occurring in one house.

Thus, the attack-rate, resulting from 135 cases, was only 3.96 per 1,000 inhabitants in Tufnell, whereas it was as high as 7.71 (405 cases) in Barnsbury. In the sub-districts of Upper Holloway there were 183 cases, and the attack-rate was 4.36; in Tollington there were 221 cases, and the attack-rate was 7.50; in Lower Holloway there were 231 cases, and the attack-rate was 5.98; in Highbury there were 283 cases, and the attack-rate was 4.96; while in Islington South-east there were 395 cases, and the attackrate was 5.28. In the Quarterly Periods.—The following statement contrasts the years 1913 and 1914, and shows the behaviour of the disease in the several months and quarters of the year. 105 [1914 1914. 1913. Difference January 150 55 + 95 February 114 41 + 73 March 125 52 + 73 1st Quarter 389 148 + 241 April 94 46 + 48 May 115 49 + 56 June 120 68 + 52 2nd Quarter 329 163 +166 July 91 85 + 6 August 111 71 +40 September 291 173 + 118 3rd Quarter 493 329 + 164 October 272 197 +75 November 196 234 -38 December 174 246 -72 4th Quarter 642 677 -35 Fatality.—Twenty-three deaths were recorded out of the 1,853 known cases of the disease, so that the fatality was only 1.2 per cent. of the cases, which is 1.4 less than the mean of the preceding twenty years. The difference is exactly the fatality that occurred in 1913, which shows that the disease was of an eminently mild type. Indeed, since the notification of Scarlet Fever became compulsory its fatality has only been so low on one occasion, namely, in 1912, when it was 11. It looks as if the very mildness of the disease was to a considerable extent the cause of the numerous cases, for the children ailed so slightly that the disease practically passed unnoticed in many instances until their skin began to desquamate, and therefore, mixed freely with each other. It was mentioned in the report for last year that the fatality has gradually decreased. Thus, From 1891 to 1900 it was 3.3 „ 1901 to 1910 „ 2.4 „ 1911 to 1914 „ 1.5 This is in marked contrast to its serious nature forty years ago, when an attack from Scarlet Fever was much dreaded. Hospital Isolation. —The number of cases of the disease removed to Hospital was 1,768, which represent a percentage of 95 4. This is the highest percentage of cases of this disease hitherto isolated. 106 19141 Table LXX.

Six hundred and fifty-one cases were notified, an increase of 184 on the decennial average, and were equal to an attack rate of 2.01 per 1,000 inhabitants, as contrasted with the decennial rate of 1.42. The return is the highest since 1902, when 871 cases were notified. The attack rate, for the second year in succession, was exactly the same as that for the County of London, and was slightly lower than the rate experienced in St. Pancras and Hackney, but was identical with that of Shoreditch. The figures for the neighbouring boroughs, and for London, are seen in the following statement:— Cases. Attack-rate London 9,118 2.02 St. Pancras 451 2.11 Stoke Newington 98 1.94 Hackney 495 2.22 Hornsey 102 1.16 Finsbury 145 1.72 Shoreditch 221 2.02 The Encircling Boroughs 1,512 1.96 Islington 651 2.01 Hospital Isolation.— 612 cases were removed to hospital for isolation and treatment, and represented 92.9 per cent. of the known cases. This rate is very slightly below that experienced in the preceding year. It is well that it should be so, for this disease, especially when it assumes a serious form, is essentially one for institutional treatment; indeed, the fatality figures show this. Fatality.—Among the 6l2 cases treated in hospital 37 deaths occurred, representing a fatality rate of 6 0 per cent., while in the 47 cases that were isolated at home, 7 or 14 9 per cent. died. Houses Infected. - The 651 cases infected 570 houses, but in each of 516 houses only one case occurred. The number of cases in the houses are set out in the following statement:— Number of cases of Diphtheria occurring in one house. 1 case in house. 2 cases in house. 3 cases in house. 4 cases in house. 5 cases in house. 6 cases in house.

Seventy-six cases of Enteric Fever were notified, which is a decrease of 16 on the average of the 10 years 1904-1913, and is equal to an attack-rate of 0 23 per 1,000 inhabitants. This is a very different return from that of the earlier periods of notification, as the following statement, showing the records for quinquennial periods, indicates:— From 1891 -1895 there were 1,088 cases notified. „ 1896—1900 „ 1,334 „ 1901—1905 „ 894 „ 1906—1910 „ 522 „ 1911—1914 „ 248 (4 year-). The behaviour of the disease in the neighbouring boroughs is shown in the following statement:— Cases Attack-rates St. Pancras 44 0.21 Stoke Newington 4 0.08 Hackney 28 0.12 Hornsey 8 0.09 Finsbury 19 0.22 Shoreditch 19 0.17 122 0.16 Islington 76 023 Hospital Isolation—Sixty-eight (or 89.5 per cent.) cut of the 76 cases notified were removed to Hospital for isolation, so that only eight remained at home. Fatality—As 14 deaths occurred from the disease, the fatality was 18.4, which is an increase of 10 per cent. on the return for 1913. The fatality of the cases treated in Hospital was 17.6, and of those treated at home, 25 per cent. The full particulars of the fatality from this disease are set forth in the next Table.

The return is the highest since 1902, when 357 cases were notified. 114 1914] The disease was most prevalent in Barns bury and South-East Islington sub-districts, in which there occurred 70 and 101 cases respectively. Particulars for each of the sub-districts are set out in Table L.XXVII. Hospital Isolation.—Eighty cases, or 23.9 per cent. of the 334 cases notified, were removed to or occurred in Hospitals, while 254 remained at home. Fatality.—The 20 deaths represented a fatality rate of 6 per cent., which is 2 per cent. higher than that of the preceding year. Table LXXVII.

Twenty-five cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, as contrasted with 28 in the preceding year, and with 16 in 1912. The average for the 10 years, 1904-1913, was 20. It is difficult to account for the increase during the last two years. Hospital Isolation.—Fifteen cases, or 60 per cent., were removed to or treated in Hospital, leaving 10 to be attended to at home. Fatality.—As the deaths numbered 12, the fatality was 48 per cent. The deaths occurring in Hospital numbered 10, which equalled a fatality rate of 66.6 per cent., and those at home were 2, equal to 20 per cent. Table LXXVIII.

Acute Poliomyelitis, Cerebrospinal Meningitis, 0 phthalmia Neonatorun Tuberculosis, Plague and Cholera. Acute Poliomyelitis. Considerable space was devoted to the consideration of this disease in the Annual Report for 1913, and, therefore, it is not necessary to discuss it now. Only 8 cases were notified during the year, as contrasted with 19 in 1913, from which 3 deaths occurred. One case was reported in the first quarter, one in the second, two in the third, and four in the fourth. This decrease is very satisfactory, but it is much to be feared that such a low record will not continue. There is one hope, however, and that is that the medical profession seem much more watchful of the disease now than in former years. Quarters.

Seven cases were notified, or one more than in 1913, and 6 less than in 1912. This makes the total number of cases 82 since the disease became notifiable. It has been very satisfactory to. find that the medical profession availed themselves very largely during the year of the facilities afforded by the London County Council for its identification. In some of the cases it has been noted that the patients have been in direct contact with soldiers returned from military camps. Whether this had anything to do with the conveyance of the disease to their homes it is impossible to say, for the number of men who have returned has been very considerable, while the disease has only increased by one case on the return for 1913. On the other hand, since the beginning of January of the current year, the number of cases has increased and the contacts with soldiers have been much larger than at any previous time. k 130 1914] Total Cases Total Deaths 1907. 1908. 19 9. 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914. 1907-14. 1907-14. 1st quarter — 2 2 3 4 1 1 2 15 1O 2nd „ 3 2 3 7 4 6 3 3 31 16 3rd „ 5 _ 2 1 3 3 1 2 17 13 4th 3 3 3 4 2 3 1 — 19 12 11 7 10 15 13 13 6 7 82 51 Ophthalmia Neonatorum (Purulent Disease of the Eyes of Newly-born children.} This inflammatory disease of the eyes of infants was notified in 56 instances, of which 52 were forwarded by members of the medical profession, and 4 by midwives, and as a result 28 cases were referred to hospitals for treatment, while 28 were attended to in their homes, of which 26 were eared for by nurses. It is satisfactory to find that this early notification has been of great benefit to the children. Tufnell. Upper Holloway, Tollington. r Lower Holloway. Highbury. | Barnsbury. Islington, South-East.

Tuberculosis. As many as 1,150 cases of Tuberculosis in its various forms were notified. These represented an attack rate of 3-54 per 1,000 of the population. The number contrasts with 1,683 in 1913, and an attack rate of 5 07. This decrease of 533 cases is very remarkable, so much so that it caused the Medical Officer 131 [1914 of Health to make certain enquiries of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, who informd him that it was common to London. It would be unsafe to attribute any reason for this decrease. Pulmonary Phthisis—960 cases were ascribed to Pulmonary Phthisis, of which 567 were males and 393 females, while the attack rate was equal to 2.96 per 1,000 of the population. The incidence of the disease was greatest in South East Islington, where it was 3.84 per 1,000 of the population, and was nearly one per 1,000 higher than the next highest attack rate, that of Tollington, where it was 2.99.

Five thousand six hundred and eighty-four cases of those Infectious Diseases which are not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were reported by the school teachers to the Medical Officer of Health, and of these 1,375 were Measles, 949 Chicken Pox, 753 Whooping Cough, and 2,607 various other diseases. The return contrasts with an average of 4,698 in the preceding 10 years, of which 1,466 were Measles, 680 Chicken Pox, and 714 Whooping Cough, while 1,838 related to various other infections. The record for Measles was 91 less than the decennial average, while, on the other hand, Chicken Pox showed an increase of 269 cases, Whooping Cough of 39 cases, and other infections 769 cases.

During the year 1,565 examinations were made of sputum and blood of patients for the medical profession for the detection of Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Phthisis. This is by far the largest number hitherto examined, and shows an increase of 203 on the return for 1913, which in turn was 417 above that for 1912. The increase of the number of these examinations since they were first made in 1898 is indicated in Table CV. Diphtheria.—696 swabs were submitted, of which 178 gave positive results, and 518 negative. The results of the cases were immediately forwarded to the medical practitioners, some being sent by telephone or telegraphed direct to the doctors from the Lister Institute where the examinations were made. Enteric Fever.—59 examinations of blood taken from enteric patients were made, as contrasted with 52 in 1913, of which 15 proved positive, and 44 negative. Phthisis.—810 specimens of sputum were examined, of which 243 gave positive results, and 567 negative. This return is 81 above that for 1913, and nearly twice as great as that for 1912. It may be remarked that examinations for Phthisis have of late years largely increased, for whereas in 1899 they numbered only 79, and in 1909 222, in 1914 they numbered 810. This large increase is due, of course, to the notification of Tuberculosis. The following Tables give the results of the examinations that have been made during the last 16^ years:— Diseases.

Although 7,844 births were registered in 1913, the return shows that only 3,687 infants were successfully vaccinated, while 13 were declared insusceptible to vaccination, 624 died unvaccinated, 1,942 certificates of exemption were produced by the parents, and 52 cases were postponed under medical authority, thus leaving 1,526 unaccounted for. An examination of Table CVI. gives full particulars of the state of vaccination in Islington since 1880. The record is not a satisfactory one, for it shows that this protection against Small Pox has been very much neglected of late years, which also may be said, not only of London, but of England as a whole.

The figures have increased year by year, but particularly since 1908; it is, therefore, apparent that very considerable use is made of the plant. The disinfections included 66,454 articles removed from infected homes, as well as 21,310 articles, mostly second-hand garments, forwarded for disinfection by a large firm of dealers in such apparel. The description of the former are set out in the statement given below. It may be mentioned, however, that the return does not include the garments of verminous school children, which were disinfected while they receive their baths. 1914] 174 TABLE CXI.

The arrangement between the London County Council and the Borough Council came into force in the early part of 1913, by which it was agreed that the latter body should receive 2s. for each set of baths given to a child during a calendar month. The total amount thus received was £104 6s., being the sum payable for the 1,043 sets of baths which were given. These baths were as under :— 318 sets of 1 bath to each child. 123 do. do. 2 baths each do. 508 do. do. 3 do. do. 66 do. do. 4 do. do. 25 do. do. 5 do. do. 2 do. do. 6 do. do. 1 do. do. 7 do. do. *1,043 do. do. 2,496 baths * Note.—14 of these sets were commenced in 1914, and completed in the current year. N 1914] 178 In addition to this number of baths, 26 were given at the beginning of the year to children who had commenced their sets in the previous year, thus making a total of 2,522 baths for the year. Ninety-two baths were given to children residing in other boroughs, but attending schools in Islington, as under.— St. Pancras 78 Stoke Newington 14 92 The average daily attendance of children at the baths throughout the year was 12, raging from 2 to 30 per day. In many instances children were found in such a verminous condition as to require at least two, sometimes four, and even five sets of baths, which ranged from two to as many as 16 separate baths. Indeed, 463 sets of baths were given to 192 children. Deducting these 463 sets of baths from the total number of sets given (1,043), it is seen that 580 children were given one set of baths only, and if to these are added the 192 children mentioned above, we get the actual total of 772 children dealt with. At the outset of this work it was estimated, on information supplied by the London County Council, that there were 3,600 school children who were to be found in a more or less verminous condition during the year, but only 50 per cent, of this number, viz., 1,800, was taken as a basis for undertaking the work of cleansing. This number was, however, never reached or nearly so. Below is given a Table comparing the estimated figures with the actual figures:— Comparison of the Receipts and Expenditure from January 27th, 1913, to December, 1914, with the Estimated Receipts and Expenditure.

Of these requests 780 were forwarded through the Islington Cleansing Station, and 552 through Cleansing Stations outside the Borough. In 97 cases notices were served on the parents of children, and in 132 cases on owners of the houses; in 13 cases bedding and clothing were removed for disinfection; in two cases for destruction; and in 6 instances the rooms were fumigated. Copies of these 1,332 reports were duly forwarded to the London County Council Education Department.

No prosecutions have been carried through since the outbreak of war; indeed, a number of cases in process were withdrawn. N 2 PART IV. SANITATION.

In compliance with the requirements of the Factory and Workshops Act, it is the duty of the Medical Officer of Health to submit an annual report on the manner in which its provisions are carried out in his district, and accordingly he herewith submits it for 1914. Inspectors.— As in former years, three inspectors, one man and two women, were engaged in this work, the man and one woman inspect factories and workshops where men and women are employed, while the second woman inspector visits the homes of outworkers and also inspects the kitchens of restaurants and places where food is cooked. Inspections and Visits.—The number of inspections and visits coming under the purview of the inspectors was 8,080, the particulars of which are as follows:— Factories, including Factory Laundries 337 Workshops, including Workshop Laundries 1,002 Workplaces, other than outworkers' homes 405 Bakehouses 481 Restaurant kitchens 303 Outworkers' premises 1,261 Miscellaneous re-inspections and calls 4,291 8,080 Notices served.—As a result of these inspections, 789 sanitary defects were discovered, which necessitated the service of 168 intimations and seven statutory notices, of which 6 were referred to the owners of factories, 49 to the owners of workshops, 21 to the owners of workplaces other than outworkers' premises, and 58 to the owners of restaurant kitchens. In addition to these, 135 nuisances on outworkers' premises were discovered, causing 35 notices to be served Registers.- There were 5,246 workshops on the Register, as contrasted with 5,040 in 1913, while the total number of workrooms was 6,293, as contrasted with 6,114. There were 1,051 workshops added to the Register, while 776 were removed from it, so that there was a net increase of 275. The workshops included 512 where men were employed, 814 workplaces where women were employed, 87 laundries, 236 bakehouses, 660 kitchens of restaurants and eating places, or places where food is prepared, and 2,937 outworkers' premises. 183 [1914 The various workshops and workplaces are tabulated as below:— Workshops and Workplaces. 1913. 1914.

There was an absence of dustbins, or a defect in them, in 27 instances. In 27 places the W.C. accommodation was insufficient; in 202 cases they were foul, and in 92 they were unsuitable or defective. In 13 instances separate accommodation had to be provided for the sexes. In 26 a water supply was required and supplied. Altogether 758 of the sanitary defects had been remedied at the close of the year. One hundred and four nuisances were discovered in the homes of outworkers, whence 31 cases of infectious diseases had been notified. The following Table shows some of the work dealt with since 1896: — 1896 1897 1898 1899 I900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 I910. 1911. 1912 1913. 1914 Total Overcrowding 26 12 15 14 22 14 4 13 4 13 30 9 8 9 24 14 14 17 7 269 Ventilation 14 13 2 5 4 3 5 8 11 4 8 31 12 29 20 23 33 30 9 264 Dirty Premises 3" 195 109 99 217 218 231 423 630 412 448 970 719 425 505 449 476 256 266 7.359 Drains 554 458 375 313 216 177 90 50 19 15 4 19 261 61 * .. * .. * .. * .. * .. 2,612 W.C.'s 420 325 341 355 411 375 154 161 165 151 190 620 573 677 522 471 517 463 334 7,225 Water supplies 79 41 35 20 19 13 83 54 18 38 17 23 45 40 46 53 16 20 26 686 Surface drains 79 109 87 51 78 81 2 53 40 34 39 45 72 99 1l6 47 28 34 * .. 1,094 * Now included in District Inspector's summary. 184 1914] Cleanliness.— The reports of the Inspectors show that 266 premises were found in an uncleanly state, and that 252, which included some nuisances remaining over from 1913, were remedied. In the five preceding years the numbers have been as follows:—1907, 505; 1908, 425; 1909, 719; 1910, 970; 1911, 449; 1912, 476; 1913, 256. These figures are conclusive as to the greater cleanliness now to be found in the workshops and workplaces of the borough. Effluvium Nuisances.—None were known. Ventilation.—Nine cases of insufficient ventilation were discovered, of which 8 had been remedied before the end of the year. Overcrowding.—In 7 instances overcrowding was discovered, and was remedied in each case. Want of Drainage of Floors.—23 cases, invariably in laundries, were discovered wherein the floors were not so drained as to prevent the water standing on them. Notices were duly served, and in 23 instances had been complied with before the year had cloesd. Sanitary Accommodation.—In only 13 workshops was separate accommodation for the sexes required, and with one exception it had been provided before the end of the year. In 27 cases the number of w.c.'s was not sufficient, but before the year closed 25 had been provided. Uncleanliness of the closet pans was discovered in 202 cases, and these were duly cleansed, while 92 that were unsuitable or defective were removed. Bakehouses.—The registered bakehouses now number 236, but only 173 are in actual use, underground bakehouses being no longer in demand, as journeyman bakers strongly object to them. The Chief Inspector, Mr. J. R. Leggatt, as usual made an annual inspection of the bakehouses, and his report is as follows :— Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, n. To the Medical Officer of Health. 3th August, 1914. Dear Sir, I beg to report that I have just completed my annual inspection of the whole of the bakehouses in the borough, numbering 236, of which 88 were above ground and 85 below ground, whilst 63 were not in use. I am pleased to say that I have never found them in a more satisfactory condition. This is evidently due to the care and attention which has been paid to them by Inspector West and the ready co-operation, of the proprietors, who fully realise the importance of their premises being kept in a cleanly condition. I am, Yours faithfully, JAMES R. LEGGATT, Superintendent of the Public Health Department, and Chief Sanitary Inspector. 185 [1914 LIST OF BAKEHOUSES. Upper Holloway District. Bakehouses above ground.

The lists received from the employers in Islington contained the names and addresses of 1,860 outworkers, while there were also received from the Medical Officers of Health of other Boroughs, within and without the County, the names of 1,967 outworkers who resided here. It is once more to be noted that the lists are tardily forwarded by local employers, who, for the most part, do not send them until several applications have been made for them. From these lists the names of 1,285 persons living outside Islington were abstracted and forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of other Boroughs. The importance of the work of inspecting the homes of outworkers may be judged from the fact that during the year it was found that in 58 instances these people were engaged in making wearing apparel in unwholesome houses; in making umbrellas and artificial flowers in 20 and paper boxes or bags in 16, while brush-making was carried out in 9. It was discovered also that 25 outworkers were making wearing apparel in infected houses, artificial flowers in 4, and paper boxes in 2. 190 1914] Restaurants and kitchens where food is prepared.—There were 660 on the register, containing 689 separate rooms. 303 inspections were made, in the course of which it was found that out of 13 hotel and restaurant Kitchens 2 were in an unsatisfactory state, and that 36 out of 138 coffee and dining rooms were in a similar condition. Out of 39 refreshment rooms examined 10 were unsatisfactory, while of the 36 fried fish shops visited 15 were in a like state. Provision dealers premises, too, were in 8 instances found to be uncleanly. A full statement of the work of the inspector, Miss Daniell, of these places is given in her report. Workshops notified to H.M. Inspector.—Under the provisions of Section 133 of the Factory and Workshop Act, it is required that the Medical Officer of Health, when he becomes aware that any woman, young child, or person is employed in a workshop, shall forthwith send notice to H.M. Inspector of Factories, and consequently ST workshops were reported during the year. Workshops notified to Home Office, 1914. Trade. Number of Workshops. Protected Persons Employed. Women.

Bandoliers. Cannon Cleanser. Coats. Dressing Gowns. Flannel belts. Gloves. Haversacks. Hair brushes. Horse rugs. Kit bags. Mess tin covers. Motor fur rugs Needlecases. Overcoats. Ration bags. Shirts. Sleeping bags. Shaving brushes. Trousers. There has been a net increase of 14 in the number of factories on the register, and a net increase of 734 in the number of women employed in them. The workshops show a net decrease of 44, and there were 190 women less employed in them. Thus the number of premises under my observation has decreased by 30, and the number of women increased by 544, the additional labour being employed in factories. STATE OF LABOUR MARKET. On the outbreak of war there was grave anxiety in all branches of industry, for tLe effect of the war could in no way be foreseen. Happily fears of wholesale paralysis have not been justified by events; but certain industries, in especial those which exist on the supply of luxuries, such as expensive furs, have been totally crippled, while others have suffered grevious diminution. Certain manufacturers, whose plant enabled them to do so, having lost their normal trade, have succeeded in keeping their factories open and their workers employed through the medium of Government contracts. But there are others—and here again I especially indicate the furriers—who have been ruined, and whose workers, those of them who have not proved sufficiently adaptable to take up other occupations, are now unemployed. Fur-workers rely almost entirely on labour during the winter months to support them throughout the year The past winter saw this class idle, and distress at the end of the year was rife. Those trades which had machinery suitable for the various purposes gradually revived when abnormal Government contracts—for soldier's clothing and equipment, for example—were given out; but the furriers, who are mostly all manual labourers, and whose supply of raw material was practically extinguished, were, naturally, unaffected by the unexpected flow of 200 1914] orders. The makers of artificial flowers, to mention one trade, have done well since the end of November. Their raw material used to come from Germany—especially the cheaper sorts— and, in a smaller degree, from France. Now France is beginning to renew her supplies, and England, too has started to capture a portion of the German trade in these commodities. Among trades which suffered from the war and which have proved to employ workers adaptable to altered conditions, I may instance box and trunk-making. Workers in this line are now employed making haversacks and other military equipment. CONDITION OF WORKSHOPS. There is little or no change to report in the conditions of factories and workshops, which continue to require unceasing supervision on the part of inspecting officers. In many, many cases repeated warnings have failed of effect, and formal notices to abate certain breaches of regulations have had to be resorted to. Employers of labour seem to delight in allowing the Borough inspectors to take them to the door of the Court before complying with official requirements. All employers are not, of course, tarred with the same brush, and in fairness to some it must be said that the class of worker who fills their workshops is not taught cleanliness at home, and consequently does not practice it when out at work. My observations lead me to the conclusion that there is not so much overcrowding in the workshops of Islington as there is in other boroughs. I take leave to think that constant attention and instruction by Borough officials have largely contributed to this state of affairs. Employers, too, are acquiring a better sense of what may be gained by the observance of hygiene. In many trades, notably ladies' bag-making, men and women are employed in the same workroom. This is a condition which is greatly to be deprecated. I have no complaint to make against the British workman when thus thrown into close contact with workgirls and workwomen ; but the foreign workman, from my experience, has little sense of decency in any direction. The latter's habits of loose speech and personal uncleanliness are deplorable. He spits on the floor and indulges in obscene language. Strong as this accusation may be, it is not too strong. Unfortunately, where foreign workmen are employed and where they are not, the men's and women's conveniences are not kept distinct. I need not labour the objections to this system, save to remark that it is regrettable. Nuisances.—The following table shows the number of defects found and remedied during the year: — Nature of nulsance. Found. Remedied. Want of cleanliness 55 46 Want of ventilation 9 8 Overcrowding 7 7 Want of drainage of floors — — Dustbins wanting or defective 9 11 Sanitary accommodation insufficient 5 3 Sanitary accommodation foul 61 52 Sanitary accommodation unsuitable or defective 25 24 Sanitary accommodation not separate for sexes Other nuisances 2 24 1 26 Total 197 178 201 [1914 Notices.—In respect to the above nuisances, 45 Intimation Notices were served, 9 in connecticn with factories, nd 36 in connection with workrooms. In 2 cases it was necessary to serve a Statutory Notice. Workshop Cards.—The number of Workroom Cards distributed was 154. These cards specifying the cubic capacity of each room, and the number of persons to be allowed in it during ordinary working hours and during overtime. Workshops notified to the Home Office.—In accordance with the requirements of the Public Health (London) Act (Sec. 27), the addresses of 86 workshops employing women were notified to the Home Office. These were premises whose occupiers had failed to send in any notice of occupation to H.M. Inspector, or in which the abstracts of the Factory and Workshops Acts was not affixed. Notices of 3 new factories were also forwarded to the Home Office. 88 Notifications were received from the Home Office Inspector, 6 of these being for nuisances in workshops or factories; 4 of which were found to have been remedied.

Outworkers.—I have made 418 inspections of Outworkers' premises, and in 38 instances the domestic conditions were found to be unsatisfactory. As a result of the war very many have been unable to obtain work in their own trades, those usually engaged in the making of wearing apparel being particularly affected. The large quantity of work given out in connection with Government contracts, has, to some extent, helped many through a very difficult time, although the rate of wages paid for this work by some employers leaves much to be desired. I have had great difficulty in obtaining from employers a list of the Outworkers employed by them. In 230 instances written applications had to be made for lists which should have been sent in on August lsf. The failure on the part of employers to forward these lists entails much unnecessary work. Restaurant Kitchens.—Out of 88 Kitchens inspected by me 17 were found to be unsatisfactory. Many of the proprietors of the smaller restaurants have suffered considerable loss through the enlistment of numbers of their regular customers, and also through the increased price of food. In several instances they have been compelled to close the premises. I am, Sir, Your cbedient Servant, ELEANOR DANIELL, Sanitary Inspector of Workshops. 204 19l4] INSPECTION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. 1,760 houses were inspected during the year, to which 11,230 visits were subsequently made, so that the total visits amounted to 12,990. These inspections resulted in 1,350 intimations being forwarded to the responsible persons, which were followed by 217 Statutory Notices to insist on the abatement of the defects that had not been remedied. Altogether 5,278 sanitary defects or nuisances were discovered.

These houses are controlled by the London County Council under bylaws which give that body powers of inspection both by day and night. They are licensed annually, and therefore their keepers or owners are more amenable to control, and obey the by-laws more carefully than do the owners of any other class of lodgings. They number 46 in Islington, of which 36 are licensed for men, 8 for women, and 2 for married couples. Table CXIX.

The inspection is of two kinds: inspection to detect unsound meat, fruit or vegetables, and inspection to discover adulteration. The former work is undertaken by Inspector Wilkinson, and the latter by Inspector Burrell. Both have been carried out for many years with very considerable success, and it is not too much to say that there are few boroughs in the country where food inspection has been and is so adequately performed.

There were 27 slaughterhouses on the register which were found to be usually well-kept, but the licensed one of them, towards the end of the year, was not renewed because the premises had not been used for a period of over nine months. Year by year the slaughtering of animals has become les. and less, consequently the slaughterhouses have not been fully used. Butchers now deal largely in meat which has been slaughtered in public abattoirs elsewhere, as well as in foreign chilled and frozen meat, 227 [1914 The following is a list of the slaughterhouses in the borough:— LICENSED SLAUGHTER-HOUSES.

Public Health Department, Town Hall, Upper Street, N. June 16th, 1915. To the Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir,— I have pleasure in submitting the following report on my duties for the year 1914:— Slaughterhouses.—There were 27 slaughterhouses on the register during the greater part of the year, but at the Annual Licensing Session of the L.C.C. in October last the renewal of the licence of premises at the rear of 576, Holloway Road, was refused because the premises had not been used for that purpose for a period of nine months. 229 [1914 A total of 1,5'29 visits were paid to these during the year, and, generally speaking, they have been well conducted, although in some three instances the whitewashing required by the law was not strictly observed, in each case there being a temporary disuse of the premises. In a further instance a licencee was cautioned for allowing a pony to be accommodated temporarily in the sheep pound. It was ascertained that the following number of animals were slaughtered, viz.:— Oxen. Calves. Sheep and Lambs. Pigs. Total. 965 10 25,401 Nil. 26,376 These were found to be of good quality generally and remarkably free from disease. The few exceptions where localised affections were dealt with are particularised in Table "A" of this report. TABLE A. No. of Cases Similar. Description Animal Affected.

It was found that the right submaxillary gland contained tubercular deposits, but no further traces of that disease could be found ; but it was also noted that the light costal pleura had been stripped from the carcase, presumably owing to the presence of tubercular lesions thereon, and also that the internal organs of the animal were absent, which gave grounds for presuming that either the consignor or his servant or agent knew that the carcase was tuberculous, and that it should have been wholly confiscated. The whole matter was duly reported to you, with the result that the person on whose premises the carcase was found, who could not, under the circumstances, be held in any sense blameworthy, agreed to surrender it for destruction, and you then wrote a letter of caution to the consignor. Cowsheds.—The four cowsheds on the register have been satisfactorily conducted. 56 visits were paid to them. Offensive Tiades.—Comprising 3 tripe boilers, 2 gut scrapers and the knacker's yard, received 95 visits during the year, and no grounds for complaint have arisen. The following is a summary of the foodstuffs destroyed during the year, viz,:— Tons. cwts. qrs. lbs. From Slaughterhouses, as per Table "A" — 13 0 26 From Shops, etc., as per Table "B" 11 7 I 26 Total 12 0 2 24 I am, Sir, Yours obediently, H. WILKINSON, Inspector of Meat and other Foods Milkshops and Dairies.—At the end of the year there were 585 milkshops and dairies on the register, and these received frequent supervision during the year. In the report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1913 he dwelt on the unsatisfactory state of the law in respect to these, and he only wishes now to emphasise what he then stated, in the hope that the London County Council may see their way to introduce a clause into one of their annual General Powers Bills putting this matter on a proper basis, for, as the Borough Council are advised, a Sanitary Authority can only remove from the register the names of persons who occupy premises which are themselves in such a state as to be likely to contaminate the milk, and consequently there is nothing to prevent foods which might contaminate the milk being sold in these milkshops. THE ADULTERATION OF FOODS AND DRUGS During the year 1,189 samples of various foods were obtained by Inspector Burrell and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination; of these 1,072 were genuine, and 117, or 9.8 per cent., were adulterated. This is 0.5 per cent. higher than the adulteration rate of the preceding year, but 11 below the average rate which obtained during the last 23 years. 235 [1914 Table CXX.

Milk Adulteration.—595 samples of milk were submitted to the Public Analyst, who reported that 539 were genuine and 56, or 9.4 per cent., adulterated. This percentage is higher than those which obtained in 1912 and 1913, and is 0.4 per cent. above the mean adulteration rate since 1892. Milk adulteration is not pursued to the same extent as in former years, for whereas in 1892 18 7 per cent. of the samples were adulterated, and in 1901 12 per cent. were sophisticated, in 1914, as stated, it was only 9 4 per cent. This, of course, does not represent the actual amount of milk adulteration in the borough, for there is no doubt that it is less than that mentioned because a considerable number of the samples of milk which are taken to the Public Analyst have been purchased from persons who have been strongly suspected 237 [1914 of fraud, or whose milks had been privately sampled. It has been stated in these Reports on more than one occasion that milk vendors, as a body, are as honest as other traders, but it happens that the food in which they deal lends itself particularly to sophistication by the men who convey it to the purchasers. It is such an easy thing to replace a quart of milk by a similar amount of water that frequently the temptation is too much for the roundsman. There are, however, some milk sellers in a large way who buy considerable quantities of separated milk and mix it with the genuine article, thus depreciating the latter, and then sell it as new miik. There is a man at the present time selling milk in the borough who receives new milk at a railway station in Islington, and some six churns of separated milk at King's Cross Station, and yet, although he mixes these milks, and although the mixtures have been sampled on many occasions, they have always been above the so-called Government standard. The Council can do nothing, because the milk contains not less than 3 per cent. of fat, and above 8.5 per cent. of "Solids not Fat." The Adulteration Law is thus made a mockery of. Surely the Local Government Board might find some way of dealing with such a man. The number of milks returned as adulterated by the Public Analyst is given in the following tabular statement:— MILK ADULTERATION. Samples Analysed Genuine. Adulterated Per cent.

In view of the difficulty experienced in purchasing quantities of cream sufficient for analysis after the division of the sample as required by the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, the Medical Officer of Health gave instructions to Inspector Burrell to follow the course adopted in 1913 and to submit a number of samples to the Public Analyst without previous division, the samples so treated being dealt with as informal samples. Altogether, 12 samples of cream were submitted, six of which were purchased as preserved creams containing boric acid not exceeding 0.5 per cent., and six as creams free from preservatives. The Public Analyst reported against five of the latter as containing boric acid in amounts varying from 0.03 to 0.5 per cent. Official samples from the vendors thus infringing the Act were then purchased, one of which was, however, sold as preserved cream containing boric acid not exceeding 0.5 per cent., while five were purchased without any declaration being made, and the Public Analyst subsequently reported that two of them contained boric acid in quantities varying from 0.33 to 0.35 per cent. and that three were genuine, while the sample sold as containing boric acid not exceeding 0.5 per cent. showed boric acid present to the extent of 0.18 per cent. These results, when taken together with those of 1913, seem to show that there is a tendency on the part of vendors to infringe the Regulations when selling small quantities of cream—the more usual amounts purchased—but to avoid doing so when the larger amounts required for the division of the sample are demanded. In addition to the above samples of cream, seven samples of condensed separated milk were also submitted to the Public Analyst under the Regulations, all of which were certihed by him as complying with them. One sample, however, was sold contrary to the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and as a result of the proceedings which followed the vendor was fined £1, with £1 5s. costs. The general results obtained are set forth in the following Table in the manner prescribed by the Local Government Board in their circular letter of October 27th, 1913:— 1914] 254 1.

Public Health Department, Town Hall, Islington. 4th February, 1915. To the Medical Officer of Health Dear Sir, As instructed by you, and for the information of the Public Health Committee, I have pleasure in submitting for your consideration the following report on the testing of informal samples for the year ending 31st December, 1914. 1914] 256 A cursory examination of the results obtained during the past few years by the informal testing work discloses the excellent weapon it has proved against that class of vendor who habitually engages in fraudulent practices, and who, but for this means of detection, would be reaping a rich harvest, as he undoubtedly has done in the past. What he himself thinks of the method may perhaps be gathered from the fact that during the past year six vendors, having a total of 27 convictions against them, have thought it desirable to dispose of their several businesses and transfer their operations to new spheres of labour outside the borough. It has been said that the informal sampling of milk is of very little value as a means of securing a conviction in the case of adulteration. To arrive at such a conclusion seems to me a clear indication of faulty methods, as an analysis of the milk prosecutions for Islington during the past year alone reveals that 41 9 per cent. were due to the informal test sampling; the fines and costs awarded to the Council being ,£51 5s. In the defence of warranty the work has often been instrumental in breaking down the defence. A successful defence of warranty took place during the early part of the year, although analysis of the milk consigned by the farmer mentioned in the contract showed 4 per cent. of fat and 91 non-fatty solids. As the defendant had on several occasions pleaded the warranty defence successfully, arrangements were made for the daily testing of samples procured through the medium of one of his private customers. The tests were carried out from April 29th to June 5th, during which time 29 samples were examined, of which 20, or 68.9 per cent., were found to contain varying amounts of added water up to 30 per cent The particulars relating to the successful prosecution of this defendant were the subject of a report by you to the Health Committee. A similar course of testing provided information which also led to the breaking down of a warranty and the conviction of a defendant during the fourth quarter. During the year I tested and exammed 685 samples, of which 556 were found to be genuine; 34 were sold either with a declaration given verbally or imprinted upon the wrapper; while 95, or 13.8 per cent. were adulterated; the latter including samples purchased at the same premises over varying periods and samples purchased by child agents. In 41 instances the informal sampling was concluded with the purchase of an official sample, the latter being submitted to the Public Analyst in the usual manner, who reported against 38 for prosecution, and one milk, one coffee, and one sample of butter as genuine. 257 [1914 In the three latter cases the official samples were served from stocks other than those from which the informal samples had been supplied, but in the instance of the milk and butter the change was noted and official samples were demanded from the original stocks, but refused. In both instances the vendors were successfully prosecuted for "refusal to serve." In four instances the sellers were cautioned, and in the other 34 cases summonses were issued, while of the proceedings which followed 31 were successful, and three summonses were withdrawn. There was also an additional prosecution against a milk vendor for "refusing to sell," it having been previously ascertained by informal sampling that he was selling milk containing a considerable quantity of added water. The number of prosecutions, therefore, was 37, which is equivalent to 42.5 per cent. of the total prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts for the year. Similarly, the total amount of fines and costs was £'207 11s. 6d., while the sum accruing from the informal testing work was £158 12s., which includes £74 5s. 6d., the amount awarded on the summonses outstanding at the time of my last report. On various occasions during the year defendants to prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts have absconded, and in order to bring the prosecutions to a successful issue considerable time has had to be spent on enquiries as to their whereabouts; in addition to which there must be taken into consideration the time spent in the regular collection and analysis of the series of milk samples referred to in the two cases cited above. I mention these facts, as the samples tested are not quite so varied as during 1913. The results obtained are, however, the best I have hitherto had the pleasure of reporting. The several foods tested were as follows:— Milk.-—The milk samples were procured for the most part from milkshops and dairies, but samples were also obtained from customers of suspected dairymen, after delivery on the round, and a number of samples were taken from churns in course of delivery to the retailer. During the year 118 samples were tested, of which number 82 were genuine, while 36, or 30.5 per cent., were found to be adulterated. Fortunately this high rate of adulteration is in no way indicative of the general rate for the borough, but is due to the selective methods of purchase, and the inclusion of the series of samples purchased in the two cases I have already mentioned. The majority of the prosecutions under this section were against persons previously convicted for similar offences. In the case of an itinerant vendor conducting an extensive business in a poor part of the Borough, and who had a long list of previous convictions against him, the magistrate passed a sentence of three months hard labour. 1914] 258 Butter—The salutary effect of a number of successful prosecutions during the last quarter of 1914 against persons selling margarine as butter, coupled with the fact that several of the worst offenders have transferred their efforts to new pastures, has had a marked effect in reducing the rate of adulteration of this commodity. During the year 188 samples of butter were tested, 163 being genuine and 25, or 13.3 per cent., adulterated, a percentage which is less than half that for 1913. Margarine.—Of the 227 samples examined, 206 were found to be sold in conformity with the Acts, while 21, or 9.2 per cent., were delivered to the purchaser in an unstamped wrapper, and were accordingly classed as adulterated. Coffee.–145 samples of coffee were tested, 103 of which were genuine, 34 were sold either with a verbal declaration or enclosed in a package bearing an inscription to the effect that the contents were sold as a mixture of coffee and chicory, or chicory and coffee, and 8, or 5.5 per cent., were adulterated. Olive Oil.—Of the 7 samples of olive oil tested, 4, or 57 per cent., were found to be adulterated, It is a significant fact as showing that while some shopkeepers are ready to take advantage of a purchaser of a small quantity of an article, they will not take the risk where the quantity is greater, i.e., the agent when purchasing the test samples was instructed to buy pennyworths, this quantity being sufficient for my purpose. With the official sample, however, the case is different, as the article has to be divided into three parts. As stated above, four of the test samples were found to be adulterated, but when the agent returned to purchase an official sample, and necessarily a larger quantity, three of the vendors stated that they did not sell olive oil, but nut oil. For purposes of comparison I insert the following Table, showing the results of the test work since its conception in 1908:— 259 [1914 ALL SAMPLES. Year. No. of Samples Declared. Adulterated.

Notes.—This Table is arranged to show the gross births and deaths in the district, and the births and deaths properly belonging to it with the corresponding rates. The rates are calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. † In Column 6 are included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under i, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9 ‡ " Transferable Deaths '' are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, e.g., casuals, are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. In Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of "non-residents" are deducted, and in Column 9 the number of deaths of " residents " registered outside the district are added in calculating the nett death-rate of the district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitalsL lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such Institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) it this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.
