Report of the Medical Officer of health. According to the Annual Summary of the Registrar- General the births registered in the year 1905 numbered 929,457, and the birth rate was calculated to be 27·22 per 1,000 being .7 below the corresponding proportion for 1904, which was the lowest on record at that time. The deaths numbered 519,939, being at the rate of 15·2 per 1,000. This, like the birth rate, was the lowest as yet recorded and shows a decrease of 2 per 1,000 on the average for the 10 years 1895-1904. For the County of London the birth rate was 27·l and the death rate 15·6, the figures consequently being a little below and a little above those which ruled in England and Wales. Owing to the varying distribution and increase of population in a Borough like Camberwell the calculation of the birth rate and death rate, based as they are on the population existing within the boundaries at the middle of the year, is a matter of difficulty. If we adopt the method of the Registrar- General and base our calculations on the hypothesis that the population has increased in the same ratio that it did in the inter-censal years 1896-1901, we shall probably find ourselves considerably at variance with the figures when they come to be enumerated in 1911, for I find that in 1900 the population calculated on the increase in the previous inter-censal periods was 269,276, while on the assessments it was 262,513. When the census was taken in 1901 the enumerated population of the Borough was 259,339, which more nearly approximated to the figures obtained by the assessment method than by the other. I have therefore adopted the same procedure as last year, namely, to assume that the number of persons per assessment is the same as that existing at the last census in 1901, and to form an estimate by the multiplication of the number of assessments in the Borough by this factor. Indeed, so far as St. George's Registration District is concerned this is the only possible plan, for calculation based on the other method would imply that the population is still actually diminishing, as it undoubtedly did in the old district previous to 1901, owing, to the large clearances of houses that took place at that time. Not only this, but the method would be impossible of application, for the old Registration districts have been altered by sub division and re-arrangement of boundaries, so that no accurate figures are available for purposes of comparison. At the same time, judging from the excess of births over deaths recorded week by week for St. George's, one is led to believe that the population there must be increasing to a greater extent than is shown, there being no evidence that an appreciable amount of emigration is going on from this district. The population for the whole Borough has been calculated by adding up the estimated population for each of the twenty wards. Table A—Population of Camberwell and Sub-Districts.

The subject was referred to in my report for last year, and I have seen no reason to alter the opinion therein expressed, namely, that it is the quality of the infants that are born that is of far more consequence than the number.

The deaths registered in the Borough amounted to 4067 but this includes those who died in one or other of the public institutions of this Borough to which they had been taken from outside districts in which they had previously been residents, and it does not include persons who had been inhabitants of Camberwell at the onset of their last illness, and who were removed to hospitals, etc., outside the boundaries of the Borough where they died. Those in the first category have been subtracted from and those in the second added to the total of deaths.

There will, however, remain a certain number who are supposed to have been residents but whose last address is unknown, and such deaths have been re-distributed in proportion to those actually occurring among the inhabitants of the various sub-districts.

That this result is satisfactory in the highest degree can hardly be questioned. The Registrar-General in his annual summary makes the rate .1 less, possibly through his estimate of the population of Camberwell being somewhat higher than ours. A reference to the accompanying diagram, for the use of which I am indebted to the Registrar-General, shows the exceedingly favourable position occupied by Camberwell, while when we consider its condition as regards density of population, poverty, etc., its high estate is still more worthy of remark.

At present this condition no longer exists, and the fall must not be taken as a great diminution of the death-rate of the district. Dulwich is almost the same as it was ten years ago when this part was almost rural, when the birth-rate was much lower, with the consequently smaller number of persons likely to die, and when it was occupied by the class of persons usually found to reside where the death-rate is low. The difficult question of how to reduce the infantile mortality has been prominently before the public for the last year, and many have been the remedies suggested and tried. I can only repeat what I said last year with regard to this matter, that a reduction in the number of those who survive is not so much of importance as the improving of their quality as regards health; and it is to measures calculated to improve the health of both mother and child that we shall have to look for a greater amount of success. Among these come all those designed to improve the well-being of the former, especially before and during pregnancy, so as to increase the number of those who are able to provide their infants with proper milk. The absence of such a diet is, perhaps, a more powerful agent in the destruction of infants than all the others combined. Without any special measures being directed against the reduction of such mortality, beyond that mentioned below, there were over two hundred fewer deaths in Camberwell of such infants during the past year, a result which will compare not unfavourably with those boroughs who have adopted special measures in the way either of health, visitors or municipal milk depots, etc. In those boroughs, however, who have adopted any special plan, allowance must be made for the short period during which they can have been in force, for even if they should be producing an especially good effect, such is not likely to be seen for two or even more years. Having regard to the number of deaths during the early weeks of life the Committee advised the purchase of some thousands of copies of a pamphlet on infant feeding by Dr. Helen Sergeant, and, failing the co-operation of the Registrars, their distribution through the agency of various teachers who had volunteered to help in such work. Considering the ignorance that exists on the subject among all concerned, together with the practical certainty of a great number of deaths being due to improper feeding, the distribution of the booklets should have a good effect, provided that parents will read and carry into effect its maxims. The deaths from the diseases classed as zymotic compare very favourably with those of 1904, there being a decrease in nearly all, which is in some instances very marked. There are three exceptions, one being influenza, in which there were eight more deaths than in the preceding year, these being almost entirely those of adults and they were fairly evenly distributed over the whole of the Borough, St. George's district being the least affected. A disappointing increase is shown in the case of puerperal fever, which, in spite of well considered and organised attempts to prevent its occurrence by means of attention to cleanliness in the widest sense of the word, has shown just double as many deaths as in 1904. It is in diphtheria that the most marked changes have taken place from the early days of notification. In 1893, for instance, the number of deaths amounted to 118, the population being considerably smaller than it is now. In the last year, according to our returns, we have but 18 fatal cases reported. After making all allowances for changes in type of this disease, and also in its fatality, there can be no doubt that some other factor, or factors have been at work in causing this great improvement, and the principal change in the method of treatment, that has been coincident with the decreased mortality, has been the general employment of anti-toxin at a point in the disease which has gradually become earlier and earlier in time. Added to this we have the more systematic bacteriological examination of throats which, although still leaving much to bo desired, is certainly more and more carried out in the Borough. This course, by the opportunities it gives for precautionary measures being taken in the early stages, has formed a valuable agent in the prevention of the disease. No schools have been closed on account of this disease, and it is to be hoped and expected that the more extended practice of bacteriological examination will render such a step more and more unnecessary. The notification of this disease numbered (inclusive of membranous croup) 243 ; they were most numerous in the age period 5-15, and it was in Peckham that the greater number of cases and deaths were recorded; the mortality rate was not, however, so high here as in some of the other districts. Scarlet fever is represented by 1,223 notifications, Peckham again leading the way in these and in the deaths. The age incidence is similar to that of diphtheria, namely, heaviest on the children between 5 to 15. This disease is one of the few in which an increase is shown over 1904, there being 29 deaths as compared with 16. It must be remembered that the case mortality for some time has been greatly on the decline, and even this year's considerable increase is far behind the rate ruling, say, ten years ago. The deaths in Peckham exceeded those in all the remaining districts combined. A comparatively rare event was a fatal case in an adult of 20 years. There were 2 deaths among infants of less than one year. To enteric fever were credited 66 notifications, the greater number of which were in early adult life. One occurred in Dulwich, 7 in South Camberwell, 17 in North Camberwell, 29 in Peckham and 12 in St. George's. Although inquiries were made in each case there was no reason to suspect any common cause for the attacks. There were but 9 deaths from the disease, 2 in North Camberwell, 4 in Peckham and 3 in St. George's. In all the above it will be seen that Peckham is in a somewhat unenviable position, but it must be remembered that I am speaking of a division which is now sub-divided into two registration districts and which, previously to December, 1905, contained a population nearly double that of either North or South Camberwell. There was a small and localised outbreak of smallpox in Hampton's Avenue in May, the first notification being that of a boy of 10 with no vaccination marks; the next attacked being two other unvaccinated children, aged 4 years and 3 months respectively. The most noteworthy feature of the case is that all the other children in this family and tenement of school age had been at school for three days while there was a case of smallpox in the building, yet nothing occurred among other children of the school or house. Early in the year a smaller attack occurred in Domville Grove. No reason could be assigned for the outbreak and the disease was strictly limited to the one house. Our other dealings with smallpox were only those of visiting persons who resided in it, but who had been in contact with the disease elsewhere than in the Borough. No notification was received in respect to any of these. The above cases are worthy of special record for two reasons: first of all they were strictly limited in area, none of the adjoining inhabitants suffering, and also that no source of infection could be found. It is needless to ask how they would have been regarded as strong arguments in favour of the aerial convection theory had a smallpox hospital in working condition existed within a mile or so of the houses in question. There were two notifications of small-pox which turned out afterwards not to be cases of this disease. During the time of the notification of chicken-pox the County Council made arrangements wish Dr. Wanklyn, the former Medical Officer at the South Wharf, to act as Referee in case of doubt, but with the removal of this disease from the list of those notifiable, this engagement has unfortunately come to an end. That there is an abiding necessity for such an arrangement has been proved over and over again, and in default of the Metropolitan Asylums Board undertaking this duty, it is to the London County Council that we should look for assistance in appointing a permanent referee. We will assume that a doubtful case breaks out in a large business establishment where means of isolation are difficult. For the medical attendant to have the patient removed on suspicion will do great harm to the proprietor, and will certainly lead to unpleasant relations between the parties concerned, to say the least, if it should not at the Wharf be considered a case of small-pox. If, on the other hand, the patient be kept at home, and other employes contract smallpox, the public health necessarily suffers. The total number of deaths from measles was 79; of these 29 occurred in the two divisions of Camberwell and 26 in Peckham. Last year there were 100 fatal cases of this disease, of which 41 came from Peckham. At first there was but little improvement in the delay in notification of this disease that we have experienced in previous years. On receiving information from a school as to the existence of this disease in a given house, the inspector learns at his visit that the child has recovered or in other cases there is a denial on the part of the parent that any illness whatever exists in the house. Towards the end of the year there was an improvement in both these conditions, i.e., earlier and more accurate information. As I have previously pointed out, the punitive clauses of the public health are practically inoperative owing to the lack of provision for notification, and all parents have to do to avoid any interference on the part of the authority is to assert that the children have not suffered from the disease. In the early part of the year I reported an instance to your Committee where the people refused either to allow us to disinfect and on the other hand equally to send us a certificate stating that they had disinfected to our satisfaction. As we had no evidence beyond that of the hearsay description that there had been measles in the house, the Committee decided that no action could be taken. At the same time the fact of our insisting on disinfection and yet at the same time being unable to enforce it is an anomalous state of things which can only be properly dealt with by the term applied in altogether different circumstances, namely, " ending or mending." Up to the present year the Public Health Committee have been in the habit of destroying the books which had been borrowed from the public libraries by persons living in houses, which had during the period of such borrowing become infected by a notifiable disease. It was found that this led to a useless expenditure, and it was accordingly decided that a vacuum pump be fitted to one of the existing disinfecting machines and that disinfection be carried out by the admission of formalin vapour to the chamber where a negative pressure had previously been obtained so as to ensure the penetration of the disinfecting agent to the interior of the books. The result appears to be satisfactory and comparatively inexpensive The Borough Council of Stepney addressed a circular letter to the other Councils asking them to join in an attempt to obviate certain difficulties in the conviction of sellers of unsound meat, where the meat, though obviously intended for human food, is not exposed for sale. The point was raised in the Council on the reception of the Committee's report, in which they recommended support to the proposals of Stepney as to whether proof of guilty knowledge should not be required to be proved. The recommendation was referred back and the following report was made:— To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, —The desirability of altering the law in the direction of the resolution suggested at the last meeting of the Committee, would, to my mind, be very objectionable. The law does require amendment so far as regards the proceedings before a magistrate in cases where meat is taken before him to be condemned. Such enactments should be inserted as to make it impossible for meat to be condemned by a magistrate without giving its owner an opportunity of being heard, for if this condemnation has taken place, the defendant hardly has a fair start in the proceedings which may arise. The contention that guilty knowledge should be proved would practically render a conviction impossible. Take, for instance, a shop where a manager is in charge. In this case by throwing it on the manager the owner would be easily able to shirk his responsibility, and on the manager being summoned he may as easily disappear from the scene; and a dishonest principal might easily evade the law every week. If the proof of guilty knowledge be required to rest with the prosecution, there is no reason why the same principle should not be extended to other Acts, and the milkman who sells watered milk may be able to put the blame on his man, who will certainly disappear when the question of attempting to enforce the penalty comes up. In the case of a large employer of labour, he is held responsible for the acts of his servants, even though he has no guilty knowledge ; and if the principle enunciated in the amendment of Councillor Briginshaw be accepted so far as meat is concerned it will soon be claimed under other circumstances and entirely against the interests of the community at large. It must be remembered that a defendant has the opportunity of going into the witness-box and submitting to cross-examination, and if he should have a good defence, it is, according to my experience, always considered by the magistrate. (Signed) FRANCIS STEVENS. In view of the lack of any special means, such as notification, whether voluntary or compulsory, together with the other measures for dealing with phthisis on the same lines to the eruptive fevers, beyond the offer of disinfection, it is interesting to note that there are 33 less deaths from this disease during the past year than in 1904, which showed an increase of 20 on 1903. The question of supporting voluntary notification has been referred to the Council, and in view of their deciding that they would support this, I make no further comment beyond re-affirming the opinions expressed in the following report as to its practical uselessness :- March 7th, 1906. In the letter from the London County Council, the opinion of this Council is asked for on two recommendations made by their Medical Officer of Health (Sir Shirley F. Murphy) ; first, that voluntary notification should be extended to the whole of London ; and, secondly, that the Medical Officers of Hospitals, &c., should forward the names of patients attending to the London County Council for subsequent transmission to the Boroughs. Voluntary notification, according to the report, is at present carried out in all the London Boroughs except Paddington, Hackney, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Stepney, Poplar, Battersea, Camberwell, Deptford, Lewisham and St. Pancras, and its objects are (a) to enable sanitary authorities to take early and suitable precautions against the spread of a disease to other susceptible members of a community, and (b) for the selection of such persons for the open-air treatment as would derive benefit. Its advantages, therefore, depend on the degree of infectivity of the disease, and whether it is recognised at a sufficiently early stage to ensure the treatment and precautions being taken from the beginning. We know from experience that the notification of a disease like small-pox, which can usually be made early in the disease, has been far more successful than the notification of scarlet fever and diphtheria, when notification is more often delayed. Much depends on the high or low infectivity of phthisis. We know that in the case of an unvaccinated person who is exposed to smallpox, or of a susceptible child to scarlet fever, that the chances are greatly in favour of a contracting of the disease. Hence we can truly say that such diseases are highly infectious, and other things being equal, should be notified. In the case of phthisis this does not appear to exist, in spite of the harrowing pictures drawn by Koch and others of the great danger to the remaining members of contracting a recognisable form of phthisis from a person dying of this disease, which are used as arguments for isolation of the advanced cases. It is not a common thing for second cases to occur in the same house, but it is a common thing for other cases to have occurred in members of the same family in other houses; and, lest it should be thought that such immunity to other co-residents has come about by precautionary measures being taken, I would point out to the Council that it existed previous to 1898, when emphasis first began to be laid on the theory of the extreme direct infectivity of this disease. Since 1901 when we first began to ascertain the previous addresses of those who had died in the various public institutions in the Parish, I have been able to find out that a second death, in houses where a previous death had occurred from the same disease, happened in 59 instances. Of these three were in common lodging-houses; in five cases the second patient was ill on arrival; in 20 instances it was impossible to obtain any information ; while in the remainder the deceased persons had probably contracted the disease during their residence in the house. In some of these instances there was a previous family history of consumption ; and the following may be selected as fairly typical of other cases : — death occurred in one instance after one year's illness, and two and a half years after the first death ; another with a similar duration of illness, but three and a half years after the first death. For purposes of comparison I give the death rates for the Boroughs of South London, distinguishing between those where voluntary notification is in force and where it is not.

It may be urged that the period is too short for any comparison. This is quite a matter of opinion ; but as I feel convinced that had the results been in favour of notification they would have been quoted in support of such action, I feel quite justified in mentioning them. The death rates certainly do not, up to the present, show that voluntary notification or its absence have had any effect on the mortality from the disease. Several observers in London have drawn attention to the widespread prevalence of the tubercle bacillus; it has been found in the sawdust swept up in public-houses, in railway carriages, eating houses, etc. Hence, supposing we isolate and assuming that by this means we render innocuous all cases of phthisis, there will still remain the unrecognised sufferers; and even if these disappear, it would almost seem Utopian to expect that all other sources of tubercle bacilli would also be removed. Having mentioned the seed it now brings me to the second factor in the spread of tuberculosis, namely, the soil, and as to the importance of this there can be no question. I have in previous reports called attention to the fact that a very large number of persons are attacked by the bacillus and escape, either completely or with very slight lesions. When from any cause, however, whether hereditary predisposition—which has been unduly minimised of recent years —exposure, and especially the combination of alcoholic excess and insufficient food, the system becomes so altered in resistive power as to form a suitable culture-medium for the bacillus, then phthisis declares itself. Under suitable conditions it may be cured, but under unsuitable conditions it will progress more or less rapidly, according to the resisting power of the individual, to a fatal termination. I therefore strongly incline to the opinion that it is to the side of the soil that preventive measures must be directed, and this to the great disparagement of notification and all its consequences, although Sir William Broadbent, in the letter which is before the Committee this evening, alludes to the present impracticability of dealing with this, and states that we must direct attention to the distribution of the seed. There can be little doubt that tuberculosis is much more prevalent than the mere number of fatal cases or those voluntarily notified would lead us to believe. Evidences of healed tuberculous lesions are frequently found in the lungs of those who have died from other causes, and it is a common thing for medical officers of the large insurance societies to find unsuspected cases of this during life. Hence it does not appear to be sound policy to deal with a cause which eludes us at all points, but our aim should be to get all persons into the case of those just mentioned, that is, who are attacked by the bacillus, as we doubtless all are, but who are in such a condition of body as to resist it. But even now, I think that the zeal of those who have been strongest in supporting the highly and directlyinfective nature of the disease is subsiding, and especially among those, apart from the enthusiasts, who have clinical opportunities of watching the progress of the disease. It is only necessary in this report to quote from a statement (Lancet, January 6th, 1906) by the President of the Royal College of Physicians, who says there is an exaggerated belief in the person to person infectiousness of phthisis, which is growing under the advocacy of sanitarian and anti-tuberculosis societies. The second object of voluntary notification is stated by Sir Shirley F. Murphy to be that treatment can be applied to those suffering from the disease, namely, the medical supervision of the sufferers, the selection of cases which it is desirable to remove to public institutions, and the examination of the remaining persons in the family. In the case of those actually suffering, there can be no doubt that if they are removed sufficiently early many would be more or less permanently cured ; but unfortunately it is usually the case, that when such sufferers seek medical advice the disease has progressed too far to allow sanatorium treatment to be of any great avail. Under any circumstances this work could be far better done by those who are experienced in the selection of such cases for hospital than by medical officers of health, who frequently have had little experience in deciding at what stage of the disease such removal is advantageous or not. With regard to the examination of the remaining persons in the family with a view of detecting cases of the disease, this would, of course, have to be done by a medical man, and could not be entrusted to a sanitary inspector. So far as I am concerned, it is work that would be pleasant and interesting, but it would practically mean taking up one man's whole time. In conclusion, in spite of the quarter from which the recommendation comes, and realising to the full the responsibility of disagreement, I can only reiterate my previous opinion, and recommend the Council to take no action. (Signed) FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. There were 220 deaths from cancer, as compared with 229 in the previous year. As usual, all these occurred in advanced life, and there was proportionately a greater number of fatalities in North Camberwell. In view of no great change having been made in the treatment, it is difficult to suppose that the decrease is anything more than accidental, but there is no doubt that the death-rate from this disease might be decreased if people after middle life would, on the appearance of any sore which is found to be obstinate to treatment, or any tumours which grow rapidly, at once seek medical advice ; for at present the only chance of cure seems to be surgical interference at the onset of the disease. The deaths under the combined heading of alcoholic disease and cirrhosis of the liver, together with that of granular kidney, show a decrease; and it is to be hoped that the decrease in the last two, which are not infrequently due to the use of ardent spirits, is due to a more moderate use of such stimulants. The question of the Verminous Persons Act arose on a report of Dr. Wanklyn and its administration in London, and it was decided to let the public know that there were facilities provided by this authority. The Act, being a voluntary one, largely militates against its utility, and for the well-being of the public it is unfortunate that its powers have not been made more drastic. So long as a person is only a nuisance to himself it does not so much matter, but when he becomes a source of annoyance to others it is surely time to ask whether, in defiance of the Englishman's idea of liberty, some compulsion should not be applied. A good deal of trouble has been found to arise from the urinals attached to public-houses and the Committee made an attempt to force the provision of extra accommodation or to raise the standard of that already existing. The matter is in the hands, unless it can be dealt with under the ordinary nuisance section, of the Licensing Justices, who do not always see eye to eye with the local authorities. The requisitions were, however, attended to by many of the publicans, with a result that the urinals in question are certainly in a more satisfactory condition than they were, but the standard is still very low. In justice, however, to the publicans, the defects often lie as much with the users as with the providers. Complaint was made from the headmaster of a County Council school with regard to the sandpit in Leyton Square and the opportunities it provided for the spread of infectious disease. Amusements which cause an assembling together of children will also afford greater opportunities for the spread of diseases, but there is no special danger in a sandpit. All that will lead people to be amused in the open air is for good in spite of the possibility, which has not been proved, of the pits being a medium for the propagation of skin diseases. Under these circumstances I advised that the Council would not do well in closing their sandpits. On the contrary, there is every reason that the number should be increased. An application was received from the Guild of Hairdressers in respect of a certificate to be incorporated with various regulations which they propose to draw up for the conduct of the business on more sanitary lines than heretofore. They asked the Council that the Medical Officer of Health should make an inspection and that, on its result, issue certificates as to the sanitary state. The Council did not agree to take any action ; had they done so the conditions I should have imposed would have been those common to certificates for exemption from inhabited house duty, and which it is usually not to the interest of owners of old property to apply for. The Holborn Borough Council addressed a circular letter to the Borough Councils of London inviting them to a Conference to be held to consider the large number of admissions to the Board's Hospitals of persons who were supposed to be suffering from notifiable diseases but who were afterwards considered by the authorities to be not so affected. The matter was referred to me for a report, of which the following is a copy : — Gentlemen, —In my opinion the calling of a Conference between the Metropolitan Boroughs and the Metropolitan Asylums Board would be absolutely useless. Only those in actual practice can realise the difficulties of an immediate diagnosis in the various infectious diseases, especially enteric fever, and the mere fact of the detention of the patients for an average of three weeks in the Board's Hospitals, during which time they have been under the care of those specially experienced in such maladies, should be sufficient to point out the difficulties in ordinary practice which must prevent an immediate recognition of the disease. The suggestion that the Medical Officer of Health should confirm the diagnosis is, to my mind, inadvisable. Most of us are willing to help practitioners, but friction between the local authority and the doctors within its borough would be certain to arise, and in the case of doubt I, like the medical staff of the hospitals, should possibly take an average of three weeks per case before coming to a decision, during which time a possibly infecting person must perforce be kept at home. Looking at the subject from the point of view of the harm which is frequently done by doubtful cases, in my opinion the money spent on the ten thousand patients has not been wasted, because it has no doubt led to removal in other instances where the nature of the disease, uncertain at first, afterwards turned out to be notifiable. I should, therefore, advise that the Council do not appoint representatives. (Signed) FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. Early in 1905 a letter was received from the Borough Council of Lewisham dealing with the ventilation of the sewers by the house drains and the abolition of the requirements as to interceptors. The question was referred to the Borough Engineer and myself for a report, which was duly presented to the Council:— January 5th, 1905. Gentlemen,—There can be no question but that the ventilation of sewers is a serious difficulty at the present time. That they are bound to be ventilated seems to be agreed, in spite of the experience of Bristol and several other places, for the sake of the health of those who are obliged to work in them. The only means of ventilation, now that house drains can no longer act as such, are either columns discharging at a good level above the road, or open gratings in the centre of the road. We receive complaints in respect of both of these; in fact, closing the one at the road level and erecting columns is usually followed by complaints of sewer gas blowing in at the upper windows of the adjoining houses. As Lewisham justly points out, the difficulty has been greatly increased by the gradual interception of all house drains from the sewer, and with the concomitant abolition of the former means of ventilation which were formed by the direct rain water and soil-pipes. The remedies proposed by the Lewisham Borough Council are that interceptors should ho longer be enforced under the By-laws, and that sewer ventilators should be put nearer together. As the Council is not asked to express any opinion on this latter point, comment is unnecessary. But as regards the non-insistence on the provision of interceptors we are both agreed that it is a wise step to take, not only on account of the better ventilation of the sewers, but also, as we have before often insisted, on other grounds. Indeed, we have previously advised that rain-water pipes going direct to the drain and not opening near a window should be left connected direct with the sewer, even in houses where no interceptor is provided, and the step proposed by Lewisham is only a little in advance of this. It will, no doubt, be contended that the danger of allowing sewer gas to escape from ventilating pipes attached to houses will be extreme ; but we do not think for one moment that the danger is equal to that of allowing the smells from the sewer at the road level, and especially from those owned by the London County Council—for instances, the Albany Road sewer, the Victoria Road sewer, and the one in Denmark Hill. These are good object lessons, so far as evil-smelling sewer ventilators are concerned. By the By-laws of the County Council it is required that an untrapped opening to the drain should be placed as near the interceptor as possible. This is usually closed by a mica flap, more often out of order than in, and it not infrequently communicates with a drain, or rather a miniature sewer, which may take the sewage of ten or a dozen houses. That such a condition of things can and does give rise to nuisance we have experienced, and, in defiance of theoretical sanitation, have ordered that such inlets be closed. Such inlets, however, are prescribed by the By-laws, although we are convinced that the forbidden practice of allowing each house to act as a sewer ventilator in comparison with the so-called air inlets will cause less nuisance. It is not necessary to enter into the desirability of interceptors, for, when there has been any possible means of getting out of the By-law, we are not ashamed to say we have aided and abetted any plan by which the rule for their enforcement can be evaded. (Signed) WILLIAM OXTOBY, Borough ngineer. FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. To this I have now little to add, except to quote from a report made to the Vestry of Camberwell: — The question of sewer ventilation has been prominently before you,, and the connection of the interceptor with the necessity for this ventilation must be apparent, for we are gradually sealing off all the old outlets of the sewers, while the ventilators at the surface of the roads must now act as outlets and inlets, except in the few cases where upcast shafts are provided. It seems extraordinary that the idea has never been systematically carried out of rendering the drains under the houses watertight, doing away with the interceptor and carrying up a soil-pipe ventilator, which would also be a sewer ventilator in accordance with the present regulations governing the provision of soil-pipes, to a sufficient height to allow the outlet of any foul air that may escape. The necessity for an interceptor now seems to be such an article of faith that it is rank heresy to suggest its abolition, we find consequently that a conference of experienced Surveyors recommend that a ventilating pipe direct from the sewer shall be carried from the sewer side of the interceptor up,the side, or back or front of the house, thus avoiding any interference with the interceptor, while theoretically securing sewer ventilation. There would be just as little nuisance if the plan were tried of putting the soil-pipe in direct communication with the sewer by a water-tight drain, the soil-pipe to be carried upwards in the manner as prescribed in the London County Council By-laws." A letter was received from the London County Council calling attention to the fact that children in an infectious state are allowed to run in the parks, and more especially does this apply to children in the house other than sufferers. The following report was adopted by the Public Health Committee : — Gentlemen, —I cannot agree with the statement that it is common in Camberwell for children suffering from some form of notifiable disease to visit the parks, &c., and the reason for such disagreement is that 82 per cent of cases of scarlet fever and 75 per cent of diphtheria are removed to hospital. The greater number of those that remain at home are in the bigger houses, where isolation and supervision can be properly carried out, and there is no reason to suppose that the patients are allowed, even for the sake of the remaining persons in the house, to go out and mix freely with others before they are entirely free from infection. The penalties for exposing persons in an infectious state are printed on the form which is left at each house from which a notification of infectious illness is received. There is, to my mind, a very great distinction to be drawn between children attending school and playing in the parks. For although transmission of disease by third parties, who are, themselves, free from the disease, is not common, it would, of necessity, be less likely to occur in the open air. I am of opinion that if such children are prohibited the parks they will play in the streets, and if prohibited the streets they will play in the houses, where the net result—so far as the spread of disease and ill-health generally are concerned —will be far greater. The whole question is comprised within the proper isolation of the patient. If t5his be satisfactorily maintained there can hardly be even theoretical infection of the remaining inmates, while if people are careless in this respect they will be in others. I can, therefore, only advise the Committee to instruct the officers that if isolation be insufficiently carried out to put in force some of the penal clauses of the Act. If the isolation be maintained the danger of infection through the other persons in the house will be reduced to a minimum. ( Signed) FRANCIS STEVENS, Medical Officer of Health. It is again a pleasant task to have to call the attention of the Council to a decrease in the number of complaints, there being nearly 200 less than in 1904, which was itself much freer than 1903. As it has been previously indicated this diminution, which takes place in spite of the hygienic standard going up, is a satisfactory index of the way the sanitary inspection of the Borough is carried out, the causes of nuisance being removed before the public are aware. The ice cream shops and places of manufacture have been regularly inspected during the year, 10 of them at one time or another were found to be unsatisfactory, and these were owned by English and Italian in about equal proportions. There can be no doubt but that the regular inspection has very much raised the standard of cleanliness in such premises. In one of the unsatisfactory places of manufacture a child was found suffering from diarrhœa in the room where the preparation of the ice cream was going on, and proceedings were taken against the person responsible on account of this, the analysis giving evidence of the grossest contamination. The restaurants, coffee shops and dining-rooms were duly inspected during the past year. The total number on the register amount to 138, and of these 30 were found to be in an unsatisfactory condition, chiefly as regards conduct of the business, all the greater sanitary defects having been remedied in consequence of previous inspections. The tables will show the enormous amount of work that has been carried out at the disinfecting station, and, as usual, the complaints have been surprisingly few. The destruction of unsound food forms no inconsiderable part of the duties of this department; some of it is that which has been surrendered and part that which has been seized. In this category comes the preserved fruit which had been seized at a factory by Mr. Kerslake and where a fine of £60 was inflicted. The tables which deal with the amount and description of the Inspectors' work, while bearing witness to the large number of inspections that have been made, do not call for any special comment. The department was short-handed in consequence of the absence of Inspector Perry for many weeks in the early part of the year. The Committee granted him leave of absence in hopes that his condition might be improved by a temporary residence outside London, hopes which unfortunately were not realised. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In accordance with the provisions of this Act I have to submit a report of the work done under this Act during the year 1905. There has been a considerable increase in the number of inspections of factories, workshops, and also of premises where home work is carried on, with an accompanying decrease in the number of defects found. There is an increase, however, in the number of premises which are reported by the Inspector as having unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation. This matter is often difficult to deal with on account of the temporary employment of extra hands at times of seasonal pressure. It has not been necessary to prosecute under these sections, the work either having been done by the proprietors on receipt of our requisitions or else they appealed to the Committee and were allowed a further respite.

In conclusion, I have to thank the Council for the consideration they have never spared, and the staff, both inspectional and clerical, for much ready help.
