The Vestry, in presenting their Annual Report for the year ending the 25th March, 1884, again have to premise it by stating that the works and things done by the Vestry have been of a numerous and useful class rather than of the large and imposing kind. The number of meetings of the Vestry and Committees has been— MEETINGS. YEARS. REMARK. Meetings 1850-81. 1881-82. 1882-83. 1883-84.

At the Election in May, 1883, Mr. J. Newton, whose term of Resigna- tions and Deaths office expired by effluxion of time, did not seek re-election on account of his advancing years. The Vestry are sorry to have to chronicle this event, as Mr. Newton had been a most able representative of the Parish even before the Metropolis Management Act 5l, 1855, came into operation, and continuously continued his useful career afterwards. The Vestry are also sorry to record the loss by death of two other members, viz.: Messrs. Ashby and Russell. Mr. R. Jones' term of office as representative of the Vestry Represen- tative at M.B.W. at the Metropolitan Board of Works, expired in 1883, and he was unanimously re-elected to that important office. Messrs. Alfred Furness and John Dewson Kemp were elected Church- wardens and Over seers Churchwardens, and Messrs. Alfred Prevost, Henry Glass, Isaac James Booth, and Charles Hart Bardouleau, Overseers for the year 1883-84. The Clerk to the Vestry, during the year reported to the Parlia- mentary Parliamentary Committee of the Vestry on no fewer than 123 Bills and Parliamentary proceedings. The Committee carefully considered every one which in any way affected the interests 6 of the Hamlet, and upon their recommendation the Vestry took the active steps referred to in the appended list, with reference to the Bills there referred to. Session Title of Bill. Nature of Steps Taken. 1883 Steam Boilers (persons in charge) Petition against. Parochial Charities „ in favor of part Infectious Diseases (Notification) „ forAmendmnt. Free Libraries „ „ Administration of Income Tax „ in favor. East London Railway Bill Memorial to Metropolitan Board of Works to oppose. 1884 Public Health (Dairies, &c.) Bill Petition against. Income Tax Amendment „ forAmendmnt. Free Libraries „ in favor. Elections (Hours of Polling) „ „ Lower Thames Steam Ferries „ „ Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings) „ against.

Metropolis Water „ „ Steam Engines and Boilers „ against. London (City) and Southwark Subway Memorial to Metropolitan Board of Works to oppose. As will be seen, some of the measures were of paramount interest to the ratepayers and inhabitants of this Hamlet, notably the Metropolitan and London Tilbury and Southend Railway Bill, and the Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings) Bill. Metropoli-tan and London, Tilbury & Southend Railway The Bill promoted by the Metropolitan and London Tilbury and Southend Railways was to empower those Companies to commencing by a junction with the existing undergound railway in Whitechapel Road, and terminating by a junction with the London Tilbury and Southend Railway near Bromley Station. It was proposed to pass under the Mile End Road for its entire length. Having in view the ruinous consequences which have resulted to the Frontagers in Whitechapel through the construction of the line there, the Vestry felt it was their bounden duty to use every effort to resist the Bill, and so avert the like consequences to their fellow-ratepayers in the Mile End Road. The Vestry accordingly petitioned parliament against the Bill and determined to fight the case before the Committee of the House. The Vestry are not authorised to fight the battles of the Frontagers, but resolved to give them every help that they lawfully could. The Frontagers having held a public meeting and appointed a Committee to look after their interests, the Vestry placed one 7 of the Committee Rooms at the Vestry Hall at their disposal for holding their meetings. The united and determined opposition of the district will, no doubt, have a great effect, and probably cause the abandonment of the measure. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings) Bill Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings) deserves more than mere passing remark. The Vestry have on many former occasions, drawn attention to the wants of the East end of London with regard to means of communication across the river East of London Bridge, and have chronicled the efforts made to bring about a relief thereto. In 1882 Sir Joseph Bazalgette presented a report to the Metropolitan Board of Works fully discussing the wants of the district, and recommending three projects which, in his opinion, were requisite to meet those wants. The projects were— 1. A low level bridge immediately to the west of the Tower. 2. A tunnel from the east end of London Docks at Shadwell to the west side of the Surrey Commercial Docks at Rotherhithe. 3. A tunnel from Poplar to Greenwich. The report also dealt with various other sites, such as one from Nightingale Lane to Bermondsey, but discarded them as bad for reasons clearly set forth. The Vestry carefully considered the report and approved of it. The cost of the three schemes would of course be very heavy (exceeding £5,000,000), and the question of the method of raising the necessary funds to meet the expenses was one of paramount importance. Communications passed between the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Treasury on the subject of the continuance of the coal and wine dues for a further period, with the result, that the Metropolitan Board of Works received from the Treasury a reply which gave no hopes of the dues being continued. This altered the aspect of affairs considerably, and the Vestry as well as other bodies in the east of the metropolis on the north side of the river, reconsidered the subject and came to unanimous decisions, that if one means of communication only was to be established, the central scheme, geographically, of Sir J. Bazalgette, was the proper one to be first proceeded with. The various resolutions were in due course presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and were supported, in many instances, by large and influential deputations. The Vestry also invited a conference of the various Vestries and District Boards of districts situate east of London Bridge on both sides of the river, and similar resolutions were arrived at, which were communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works by a deputation. At the meeting of the Vestry on the 7th of November, 1883, information was given to the Vestry that the Metropolitan Board of Works had resolved to proceed to parliament to construct a subway from Nightingale Lane, Whitechapel, to Dockhead, Bermondsey, at an estimated cost of 8 £1,390,000, which was to be taken as the sole permanent means of communication to be provided for East London. The Vestry at once resolved themselves into a Committee of the whole Board to consider the question; and the Committee, after careful consideration, came unanimously to the opinion, that the site was too far west, the gradients too steep, and the cost likely to prove excessive in proportion to the benefits to be derived; and moreover, that the proposed site had been already condemned by Sir J. Bazalgette. The Vestry adopted the report. Every other Vestry and District Board of the metropolis cast of London Bridge 011 the north side of the river, separately, and in conference, came to a similar resolution. The Vestries and District Boards on the south side (except Bermondsey) took no active steps in the matter, but Bermondsey presented a memorial in favor,—the fact that the entrance to the subway on the south side was in the centre of that district being an obvious reason lor such a step. The unanimous decision of the Vestries, District Boards and other public meetings on the north side were in due course communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and they were urged not to proceed with the Bill, but the representations were 111 some instances received with but scant courtesy. The estimate of the cost of the work, which by the rules of parliament has to be deposited, puts the amount at £1,900,000, so that in about five weeks the original estimate had been increased by no less a sum than £510,000. There is little doubt but that the estimate will be further increased when the matter is fully gone into. It is stated that the Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works only received instructions on the 8th October, 1883, to report on the best site for a means of communication to be placed, if only one were to be made. The report was presented to the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Board on the 22nd October, and at once adopted, notwithstanding the efforts of several members, but especially of Mr. E. R. Cook (Poplar), Mr. Abbott (Limehouse), and Mr. R. Jones, the representative of this Vestry. On the 26th of October the report of the Committee was presented to the Board and adopted, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the gentlemen named. Thus, it will be seen, that in the short space of eighteen days the Metropolitan Board of Works directed their officer to report upon, and received and adopted his report, involving the expenditure of (as was then thought), in round numbers, £1,400,000. The Vestry considered that the scheme was in every point of view a bad one, and had not received the attention which a subject of such magnitude deserved. Mr. C. I. Ritchie, M.P. for the Tower Hamlets, has taken a most active interest in the matter, and will, on the second reading of the bill, propose that it should be referred to a hybrid Committee of the House of Commons, so as to enable the Vestries and District Boards to be heard in opposition to it, and the Vestry have resolved unanimously that if it be so 9 referred, the Vestry will appear before the Committee and oppose it. The Vestry feel, that if the subway were constructed at the site proposed, it would be of such little value (especially owing to the steep gradients) that it would be little used, and would ever hereafter be held up as a reason why no further means of communication should be granted. Another bill dealing with the means of communication across Tower (Duplex) Bridge Bill the Thames is the Tower (Duplex) Bridge Bill, which proposes to authorise a company to construct a bridge from the west side of the Tower to Horsleydown. The bridge is of peculiar design, and will, it is alleged, get over the great difficulty of dealing with the river traffic. It is proposed to allow foot passengers to go over it free of toll, but vehicles would have to pay. The Vestry fully considered the project so far as they could with the materials supplied to them, and came to the resolution neither to support nor oppose it. The Corporation of London also seek powers to deal with the Lower Thames Steam Ferries question of communications, and have introduced a bill which seeks to enable them to establish a ferry between Irongate Stairs and Horseleydown Old Stairs, on almost the identical spot chosen by the Duplex Bridge Company. To pay for the undertaking they propose to take power to expend the rents arising from the Bridge House Estates, and also to mortgage the same Estates. The Vestry have deemed it right to petition in favor of this scheme, as it shows that the Corporation are moving, and the Vestry have little doubt but that in the course of a few years the Corporation will see its way to erect a bridge on the spot. Another bill, of which the Vestry approve, is the bill introduced Metropolis Water Bill duced by the Coroporation of London to deal with the question of the Water Companies' charges. It is proposed to compel the Companies to supply water by meter. The Vestry have petitioned in favor of the bill as being a step towards obtaining from the Companies some definite standard of charge. In April, 1883, the Board of Trade issued a form of provisional Electric Lighting order, of which they approved, with regard to Electric Lighting, and invited the consideration of the Vestry thereon. The Vestry did so, and made numerous objections, and afterwards appeared before the Board of Trade in support thereof, and in the result the Company withdrew their application. The Brush Electric Lighting Company also gave the requisite parliamentary notice of their intention to apply for a provisional order this session, but failed to do so. Under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, the supervision Bake-houses of bakehouses has again been entrusted to the local authorities. 1 he Vestry at once directed the proper officers to make a survey of every such place in the Hamlet, and to report thereon. This was done, and in every case where anything was discovered which was deemed improper, an order was made for amendment. The Vestry are pleased to be able to record that the Com- Gas mercial Gas Company reduced their charges for gas supplied Supply to the public lamps from £3 : xg : 6 to £3:16:0 per lamp as from the 1st of January, 1884. B 10 During the year overtures were made by the Gas Light and Coke Company to the Commercial Gas Company (which supplies this district), and the South London Gas Company, for an amalgamation. The Commercial Gas Company declined, but the South London came to such terms that application was made to the Board of Trade to sanction the scheme. The Board of Trade invited the opinion of the local authorities, and this Vestry unanimously resolved, that the Board of Trade should be asked not to sanction the scheme. One reason was, that in the opinion of the Vestry it is not desirable to have one great Company as it would entirely destroy the chance of comparison of prices, and would be an injustice to the consumers, as the South London Company are not empowered to charge such a high price as the Gas Light and Coke Company. Dusting & Cleansing The Vestry are sorry to have to report that, owing to depression in trade, they have not been able to dispose of the dust and ashes on such advantageous terms as they had anticipated, but, at the same time, the expenses of sifting, &c., have proved to be but slightly over the receipts. The Vestry are still hopeful that, with a revival of trade, they will be able to show a profit, but even if they cannot do so, they feel that the undoubted improvement in the way of efficiency in removal of the refuse is ample recompense. One of the greatest difficulties with which the Vestry have had to contend, has been the question of shoots. The Vestry obtained, for a small consideration, the right to shoot material on a piece of land at Carpenter's Road, Stratford, and used the place for some time, when proceedings were taken against the Surveyor to the Vestry, as representing the Vestry, by the Inspector of Nuisances of the West Ham Local Board for causing a nuisance. The instructions of the Committee were, that no material of an offensive nature were to be shot, but it appeared that some six loads had, in error, been shot during the first day or two. The Vestry instructed several medical men to inspect the spot, and they all reported that no nuisance existed, and the Vestry therefore appeared and fought the case, but, after a personal examination of the place, and having the ground turned up, the Stipendiary Magistrate of the West Ham Police Court decided against the Vestry. The matter was a serious one, and having regard to the evidence given, the Vestry felt that they would be fully justified in appealing to Quarter Sessions, and accordingly gave the requisite notices, but negociations were subsequently opened, and arrangements come to, which rendered it unnecessary to proceed with the appeal. Shoot at Carpenter's Rd. It was arranged that no objections would be raised to street sweepings not containing offensive matter, and the Vestry thereupon negociated with the Carpenters' Company, and have taken on lease a large piece of ground at a rent of £70 per annum, which will provide a shoot for a considerable time. Shoeing Horses. Questions having arisen whether it was the more economical for the Vestry to shoe their own horses or to have them done by contract, the Committee went fully into the matter, and reported 11 against the Vestry continuing to do the work, and the Vestry therefore entered into an arrangement with Mr. Lawrence to do the work at the rate of £3 : 5 : 0 per horse per annum. The following is a statement showing the prices paid for corn and fodder for horses. Date. Tenders accepted. Clover. 1st. cut. Meadow Hay, Wheat Straw. Oat Straw. Oats per qr. Beans. 1883.

Harford Street not being of the required width of 40 feet, it was necessary for the owners to set back the houses, so as to give 20 feet from the front of the house or garden to the centre of the existing road. It appeared that it was not the intention to build-up to the extreme edge of the land, but to keep in a line with the existing houses, and this would have left a small space of about 10 feet wide at the south-end, tapering off to 2 feet wide at the north-end in front of the houses. This space would be of but little value to the owners, whilst from experience the Vestry have found that it is often a source of great annoyance to the public, and the Vestry accordingly made overtures to owners to sell, and ultimately agreed to give £70 for the land. This will give the Vestry absolute control over the space right to the front of the houses and so prevent nuisances occuring. The Great Eastern Railway Company having given notice Morpeth Street Bridge. to the Vestry of their intention to proceed with the widening of their line at Morpeth Street, the Vestry under the provisions of the Act of the Company of 1881, resolved to contribute the sum of £1000 towards the cost of altering the existing bridge by giving a clear span of at least 34 feet and a headway of 15 feet over the entire width, and served a copy of such resolution on the Company; and the Company will now be compelled to make the alteration. The Vestry applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works to contribute to the cost and the Board have agreed to make a grant not exceeding £500. The Vestry feel that they have but done their duty in obtaining what was undoubtedly a much needed improvement. The Owners of Trafalgar Square during the year made over- Open Spaces. tures to the Vestry for the sale to the Vestry of all their interest in that square in order that all disputes might end and the place be retained as an open space. 12 A sum of £1200 was asked and the Vestry were advised that it was not an exorbitant amount, but the Vestry declined to give it for the reason that they had been put to great expense in consequence of the owners illegally seeking to build on the square. The Clerk to the Vestry was instructed to negociate for the purchase and ultimately arranged the price at £650. This sum together with the costs incurred by the Vestry will make the total purchase money as nearly £1000 as possible, and the Metropolitan Board of Works having agreed to contribute the sum of £325 will render the net cost about £675 which the Vestry consider is a very moderate sum. Bye-laws will be framed for the government of the place so as to render it a boon to the neighbourhood by being kept in an orderly manner. Renaming and re been numbering of The following list gives the names of the streets which have been re-named or re-numbered during the past year:— Renumbered only. Renamed and Renumbered. New Names. Rowsell Street Lawton Road Carlton Square Robert Street, St. Paul's Road Robeson Street Washington Street Single Street New York Street Varden Street Thomas Street,Commercial Rd. Parfett Street Longfellow Road, E Whitman Road Robert's Place, Commercial Rd. Firmin Place Portman Terrace, Alias Road Alias Road Carlton Road Carlton Road Carlton Road South Queen Street, Cambridge Road Doveton Street Albert Street, Cambridge Road Entick Street Ely Place Lansdell Place Overhead Wires. Vestry have for some time viewed with apprehension the Wires. ever increasing number of wires which are being carried over the streets for telegraphic and telephonic purposes. The Vestry have no doubt but that these wires will soon prove a source of great danger to passengers, but they are advised by their Clerk that grave doubts exist if they have any power to deal with the question. Other parishes have taken steps to test the question, and the Vestry consider that their best course is to wait the result. StopCocks by Water Companies. Another source of danger to the public has arisen by the Company seeking to compel persons to put stop cocks to the water pipes leading to their houses. These stop cocks are placed under the public footway, and a hole is made in the pavement which in some cases is covered, and in other cases is not covered at all, and there is no doubt but that accidents will occur. The Vestry in all cases in which application is made to them for authority to put in these stop cocks refuse their consent. The Vestry are advised and believe that the proceedings of the Water Company are illegal, but as the matter is likely to be tried by a neighbouring parish the Vestry think they may rest and see what decision is given. 13 The subject of the Water supply and rates has much exer- Water, cised the public mind during the year, and the Vestry appointed delegates to attend a conference at St. Luke's on the subject. Reference has already been made to the proposed legislation on the subject and no doubt something will shortly be done to put the rating on a more satisfactory footing. As a consumer the Vestry have raised an objection to the price charged for water for the public roads and the subject is now receiving the consideration of the Directors of the Company, and it is hoped that an amicable arrangement will be come to. If not the Vestry are firmly resolved to test the question of the right of the Company to charge so much as 9d. per 1000 gallons for water supplied for road watering purposes. During the works of the Great Eastern Railway Company at Sanitary Work Devonshire Street the old Portman Place burial ground was disturbed. As soon as the Vestry found out that the works were being Portman Place Burial Ground proceeded with they took all necessary precautions to have the work done in a proper manner. The Jobbing Sewers contract having expired tenders were in- Jobbing Sewers Work. vited and after careful comparison of the prices the tender of Mr. W. Finch was found to be the lowest and was accepted. The Vestry were compelled to take further steps under the Artizans' & Labourers' Dwel-lings Act, 1868. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, in respect of the houses in Sidney Street referred to in their report of last year, and made a peremptory order for the works to be done and they were then done accordingly by the owners. The Vestry have also taken proceedings under the same Act with respect to houses in Eagle Place and Frimley Street, and the owners have agreed to do the necessary works. The depression in trade has had the effect of greatly in- Overcrowding creasing the bad system of overcrowding and the Vestry officers have had to be very active in finding out the cases and causing the abatement of what is a most dangerous state of things in a sanitary point of view. There were 19 applications for licenses for slaughter houses Slaughter Houses & Cow Houses. and 50 for cow houses and all the places were duly inspected, and where necessary orders for works to be executed served. In pursuance of their determination to pave Devonshire street Paving. Street and other streets mentioned in the last report, the Vestry invited tenders for the work and the tender of Messrs. Mowlem and Co., was accepted. The Vestry to pay for the works have borrowed £2250 from the Metropolitan Board of Works at 3½ per cent. The Vestry deducted a sum of £34 3s. 7d. from Mr. Gabriel's Gabriel's Contract. account, being the damage which they had sustained by his default in delivering flints referred to in the last report. Parliament has during these two last years made a grant in Grant in aid of Deiturnpiked roads aid of roads which were disturnpiked subsequent to the year 1870, and the Vestry have received as their proportion in respect of the Commercial Road two sums of £128 15s. 6d. each. The subject of a Municipality for all London was again men- Munici-pality of London Bill tioned in Her Majesty's speech from the Throne, on the opening of Parliament, and there is every probability that a Bill will be introduced dealing with the matter. 14 In order that every consideration may he given to the subject the Vestry have (in addition to granting the use of the Vestry Hall to the churchwardens to hold a public meeting), also granted the use of the hall for a like purpose to two associations which have been formed to carefully consider the question and aid the formation of opinion upon it in the metropolis. The Vestry again pledge themselves to give the matter impartial consideration. Financial Expenses The expense of the annual elections of Vestrymen and Auditors in May, 1883, was £25 us. of annual The poor rate shows a very large increase having been no less than 2s. 11d. in the pound this year as against 2s. 7d. in the last and 2s. 6d. in the previous year. Poor Rate Over the poor rate the Vestry have not any control, and they think it right to draw direct attention to that fact as they know that many of the public are of the opinion that the matter rests with the Vestry. The increase in the poor rate has had material bearing on the increased taxation of the past year. The Vestry have kept their own expenditure considerably under the requirements, and everything which could without danger he allowed to remain undone has been so left. This state of things, however, cannot longer he allowed to continue, and unless the poor rate can be reduced the Vestry see no possibility of avoiding a still higher rate of taxation next year. General, Lighting and Sewer Rates. The Vestry's calls in respect of the General, Lighting and Sewers rates, have been For General Rate equal to 2s. o½d. „ Lighting „ „ os. 2½d. „ Sewers „ „ os. 2d. 2s. 5d. The School Board precept of £11281 9s. 4d. represents a rate of 9d. in the which being deducted from the 2s. 5d. in the £ leaves is. 8d. in the £ for the Vestry to carry out their own works and pay off their loans. This is an increase upon last year's amount, but is as nearly as possible equal to average of former years as the following table shows:— The amount required for the Vestry's own purposes since 1875 has demanded the Rates following:— 1875 is. 8d. in the £. 1876 is. 8d. ,, 1877 is. 8d. 1878 is. 8½d. ,, 1879 is. 8½d. ,, 1880 is. 9d. ,, 1881 is. 8d. ,, 1882 is. 7½d. ,, 1883 is. 5¼d. „ 1884 is. 8d. „ 15 The precept of the School Board again exhibited the enormous school Board Precept. increase of £1627 : 17 : 5 over that of the previous year, and, as already stated, required a rate of gd. in the £ to pay it. The Vestry view with the gravest apprehension the annually increasing expenditure of the School Board, but the Vestry have no power to check it. The Vestry have passed many resolutions that in their opinion the expenditure of the School Board is excessive, but there their power ends, and it is for the ratepayers themselves to deal with the matter at the elections for the School Board. The statement of the various School Board precepts since the formation of that Board is appended. The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for Con- Consolisolidated rate shows only a slight increase of £377 : 18 : 8 over dated that of last year, but requires a rate of 7d in the £ to pay it. Rate The record of the Metropolitan Board precepts is also appended. As before stated the Vestry have borrowed a further sum of Loans. £2,250 from the Metropolitan Board of Works, but during the year the balances due to the Star Life Office on two loans have been paid off. The loans thus paid off were those raised for the purposes of the White Horse Lane Improvement, and the providing plant, &c., for doing the Vestry's own dusting and cleansing. The annual repayment of the latter loan was £1000, so that a decided relief to the rates will be afforded by its payment off. The Clerk to the Vestry, the Surveyor, and the Medical Payments Officer of Health made application to the Vestry for the grant to Clerk, of some remuneration for extra services performed for the Sirvevpr. and Vestry in connection with the preparation of the history of the medical Officer works accomplished by the Vestry, and several other matters. The Vestry referred the matter to a Committee of the whole Board, which carefully considered it and reported to the Vestry recommending a grant of £100 to the Clerk, £50 to the Surveyor and £25 to the Medical Officer, which report was adopted. The Annual Accounts were duly audited, found correct and Annual allowed, and are printed and published with the report. Accounts. The reports of the various officers at the heads of depart- Officers' ments will be found appended hereto, and the Vesry direct Reports, attention to them as containing fuller information on several points before but cursorily referred to.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 25TH, 1884. LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY & HULL, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E 1884. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, The detail work of your Board being principally transacted by the various Committees, it necessarily follows it is seldom I have the opportunity of addressing you upon the various subjects undertaken by my department. I am, therefore, glad of the opportunity once a year of being able to call attention to the work already done and that requiring attention in the future. The heavy calls which have been made upon the Hamlet by the School Board and Metropolitan Board of Works have prevented you from raising the sum required to adequately keep pace with the wear and tear of your footways which increases annually. I think it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that, either your rate must be raised, or else a systematic method of borrowing the money and spreading the payment over a series of years must be accepted. In cases where streets have not previously been paved, or money not borrowed for paving, there is no difficulty ; but in cases in which the money has already been borrowed, and the streets already paved, although the amount has been repaid, it is the custom of the Metropolitan Board of Works not to again sanction a loan. No money was ever expended which paid the Vestry a better rate of interest than the paving of the Mile End and Commercial Roads. With the exception of a few pieces of work (which were not done out of the loan), these roads have not required any repair since the day they were paved, notwithstanding the enormous increase of traffic in the District. In a tabular form I give the quantities of paving work executed during the year and the cost. The paving of Devonshire Street, from Globe Road to Bancroft Road, was a most necessary work, and one which had long required to be undertaken. The streets, which at the present time require repaving, are White Horse Lane, Harford Street, and part of Globe Road. These were originally paved with old stone, which has now so much worn that it is unfit for streets of the traffic and importance of those named, although it would re-dress into smaller stone and be useful in paving streets less frequented. Devonshire Street, from Globe Road to the western boundary, is now a main thoroughfare to the Great Eastern Goods Station, and should be paved. The Vestry have paved the Eastern portion and the Parish of Bethnal Green the western. In the present days of steam rolling macadamised roads, all channels should be paved, and I regret that the paucity of funds has prevented you from proceeding with this useful work during the year. h 58 ROADWAY PAVING. The eastern portion of Devonshire Street has been repaved with new 4-in. by 7-in. Kincardineshire pitching, and the old stone re-dressed and used in paving Wades Place, Union Street, Mulberry Street, Holloway Street, and Ely Terrace. The footways and curbs of the various streets were repaired. The quantities of the various works were as follows :— Devonshire Street—2866½ yds. of new 4 by 7-in. pitching; 5645 feet new 3-in. York paving ; 9931 feet York paving re-faced and re-laid. Total cost £2211 19 4 Ely Terrace—3162/9 yards old pitching re-dressed and re-laid ; 102/9 old pitching re-laid. Total cost 56 12 1 Wades Place—174 yards granite pitching re laid and grouted. Total cost 30 9 5 Commercial Road—926 feet curb dressed; 1386 feet curb re-set; 13,294 feet super new 3-in. York paving supplied and laid; 4570 feet footway re-laid Total cost 649 10 8 Bedford Street—894 feet curb re-set; 5019 feet new 3-in. York paving provided and laid. Total cost Redmans Road—797 feet curb dressed ; 836 feet curb re-set; 3363 feet 3-in. new paving provided and laid ; 1409 feet old paving re-laid. Total cost 266 196 9 8 11 10 Union Street—261 yards granite pitching dressed and re-laid ; 89 yards pitching re-laid Total cost 56 16 0 Mulberry Street—901 yards pitching dressed and relaid Total cost 158 0 3 Holloway Street—260 feet run curb re-set; 694 feet super old York paving re-laid ; 340 yards super pitching dressed and re-laid Total cost 66 6 8 Dep6t—230 yards carted-away granite dressed. Total cost 23 0 0 £3715 13 3 PAVED FOOTWAYS. The following is a list of works executed by the paviors employed by the Vestry:- New paving squared and laid 11,206 feet. Old paving taken up and re-laid 151, 139 Ditto re-squared and re-laid 7,659 New pitching laid 709 yards. Old pitching re-laid 3,518 „ Old channels re-laid 9,251 ft. lineal. New Tees Scoriae paving in channels 715 yds. 1 ft. sup. New curb laid 517 feet. Old curb re-laid 4,498 ” The cost of these works for labour was £599 18s. 3d., and for material £269 5s. 8d. 59 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT. In spite of all the failures and opposition on the part of the friends of Gas, this will be undoubtedly the light of the future, but so long as the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, remains in its present form it is not likely to make much progress. In my opinion, the terms imposed by that Act are unreasonable, and calculated to stop all enterprise with regard to this particular matter, and I have no doubt but that some amendment will be made in it before long. In districts in which the flow of the sewers will permit, I see no reason why it should not be utilised to the production of Electricity by means of water wheels. In the case of our St. Paul's Road sewer, we have a clear drop of 20-feet to the main, which would be sufficient to give motive power enough to light a considerable area. Electricity would be stored in accumulators by day and utilised for light at night. I think the Vestry should give every facility for blocks of shops being lighted by Electricity, as it is only by such private enterprise that improvements and progress in Electrical apparatus are likely to be made. In a report I made to -the Special Committee, I dealt at some length upon the measurement of Electric currents, and the terms of the Provisional Order which was proposed to be made under the Act. METROPOLITAN AND SOUTHEND RAILWAY (EXTENSION.) The projected Metropolitan and Southend Extension Railway along the Mile End Road rightly called the inhabitants to arms against the measure, and should the application to Parliament be renewed in the next Session, the same opposition should be again organised. Could the railway be constructed without causing damage to the inhabitants on either side but, few would probably object to it, but after the experience obtained in Whitechapel 1 am sure there would be but few votes in its favour.

The total cost of keeping horses for the year was £2632 14s. 5d. The Vestry's horses worked equal to 8749 days for one horse; the cost was therefore 6s. o1/4d. per day per horse. This rate will be found to be in excess of that of former years, but the Vestry will remember that 15 per cent. is now allowed for depreciation instead of 8, and the number of days worked is considerably less than former years.

During the whole of the year the Vestry have sifted and disposed of dust, and the total amount receivable from this source is £811 16s. od. The quantity of dust collected was 12,662 loads, and the sum expended in sifting and loading was £791 3s. 8d. The cost of disposing of hard core and that of the necessary tools was £9 7s. 10d. Although these figures do not show the favourable result of the Vestry's trading as some members of your Board at one time anticipated, yet the work has conduced to largely reduce the cost of removing the house refuse of the District. It must not be forgotten that, while the Vestry have disposed of their refuse at a very small cost indeed, other districts have paid large sums for a similar purpose. It is not too much to say that, had not this work have been undertaken by the Vestry, the cost of disposal of refuse for the current year by a contractor would have been £1050, in addition to the cost of collection : and it would not have been an unreasonable sum either, when it is considered that 12,662 loads of material have to be manipulated and disposed of. There is always a portion of the material collected from houses which cannot be got rid of for any useful purpose, and with it there is always great difficulty of disposal. The quantity of dust increases annually, and the question of destroying the useless portion is one which should be undertaken by your Committee without delay. That a large portion of the house refuse of London will have to be destroyed by burning before long is, to my mind, a positive certainty; and the districts who have such a means at their disposal in time of need will be more likely to sell ashes and breeze at a profit than those who are compelled by circumstances to give it away, or pay for its reception by contractors, nothing could be better than the facilities afforded the Vestry by the Great Eastern Railway Company at Devonshire Street Station, and no difficulty of any description has arisen during the year. Brickmaking has not been a profitable business since last season, the stocks of bricks in all the Essex yards being large ; and as so little building is taking place this year, I much fear that the make for next year will be much less than it has been this. The prices of ashes and breeze must therefore come down with that of bricks, and I fear that I shall not be able to report so favourably on the result of next year's work. LIGHTING. The public lamps, 902 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted, and cleaned by the Commercial Gas Company, at a cost of £3583 15s. 10d SEWERS. Fifteen new gullies have been constructed and 53 houses have been connected with the sewers belonging to the Vestry during the year. The cost of cleansing the principal sewers and gullies in the Hamlet was £551 13s. 10d. Four-hundred and fifteen cubic yards of soil have been removed from the gullies, and 312 yards from the sewers of the Vestry. 64 SEWER VENTILATION. The question of how to ventilate the sewers has been one of considerable trouble ever since the present system of sewage was inaugurated. If a sufficient number of openings be not made in the roads to permit the sewer gases to escape, the larger sewers cannot be entered by the men whose duty it is to cleanse them without fear of suffocation ; or, in the case of smaller sewers, such gases escape into the houses connected with them. Where openings are made in the roads they are a constant cause of annoyance to the inhabitants, and the complaints having always been both loud and numerous. Attempts have been made to carry these shafts to the tops of houses, but this is found to be impracticable, as so many inhabitants are impressed with the idea that their houses are rendered unhealthy thereby, and in one out of the only two instances in which permission was given the shaft had to be removed, as two deaths from typhoid fever occurred in the house, which of course were attributed to the shaft. Charcoal boxes have been tried, but these destroy the current of air, and on entering the Hannibal Road sewer (the ventilators of which had been fitted with them), I found that the lamps would not burn, and had to retreat in the dark. I have therefore arranged a simple contrivance by means of which the air passes over a series of wicks saturated with Burnett's disinfecting fluid, which deprives sewer gas of all its smell. The disinfecting boxes (for such they are) were placed in the ventilator at the junction of Copley Street and Tillotson Street, Stepney Green, of which constant complaints were made. It has entirely removed the nuisance, and I find the cost of working will not exceed one shilling per annum. STEAM ROLLER.

ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1883-84, BY MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY & HULL, 53, LEMAN STREET, E. 1884. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Twenty-eighth Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of the Hamlet, and in looking back upon the years which have elapsed, constituting a generation, I cannot help contrasting the condition of matters now with what it was before the public attention was directed to questions of sanitation. Then the water supply was furnished to a great extent by surface wells, and cesspools did the work of the vast sewers, which make the London of to-day one of the best drained and healthiest of habitations. Then, epidemics of every description found a congenial nidus; and, as was shown in the Summary which I had printed at your request two winters ago, the amount of sickness and consequent mortality were much in excess of what legislation and science combined have happily enabled them to be now reduced to. Whether we may look forward to such a state of exemption from disease as some sanguine persons hope to see is more than any one would like to affirm. A remarkable attention to sanitary matters and an abundant supply food, which even those out of work have a larger share of than used to fall to the lot of the well-paid labourer in former times, have contributed to keep down the rate of mortality. At the same time, as our population is always increasing, and as there are great fluctuations in trade and in the labour market, it is well to bear in mind that any relaxation in the warfare waged against sickness and mortality might knock away from under our feet much of the confidence upon which we at present repose. "To be forewarned is to be forearmed" in this as in every other danger. As regards the sanitary condition of the Hamlet since my last Report, nothing of very serious moment has occurred to alter the state of things then existing. Nor does it seem necessary to go over again ground upon which I have often touched in previous Reports; such as "Population and Acreage," "Water Supply" and "Labourers' Dwellings." I must still express regret that the Water Companies possess the power of cutting off the water supply from houses where the rates are not paid, for this involves serious risk to the public health, and it seems clear that the proper way to prevent this is by summary proceedings against defaulters. It is curious to observe that the Marriages in the Hamlet were only one less last year than they were the year before. The number of births is nearly the same as it was two years ago (4147 against 4141), while the deaths have been, however, considerably in excess of what they were in the two previous years, viz.: 2932 against 2296 and 2371 respectively. Of these the largest proportion has been among young children, whooping-cough and scarlet-fever being the most prolific causes. It must not be forgotten either that the mortality bills are largely increased by the deaths of persons occurring in the Workhouses, &c., who belong to country or other parishes, 4 It is perhaps as good an indication of the healthiness of the Hamlet as may be found, if account be taken of the great age attained by many. One case, indeed, occurred in which the person had attained the patriarchal age of 101 years. Subjoined are the Tables in the form which I have usually adopted in previous reports, and which speak for themselves. In conclusion, I desire to thank the Committee for the assistance they have rendered, and for the consideration they have shown me personally, Although I have unfortunately suffered in health for some months, I have had the willing and energetic assistance of my son, who has published a valuable little pamphlet setting forth the best means of combating the infant mortality to which allusion has been already made. After all that legislation and science can effect, it remains that the people themselves should take an interest in questions of hygiene, otherwise the best laws and the most useful knowledge are of little or no avail.
