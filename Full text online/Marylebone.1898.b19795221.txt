October was moderate in temperature, the minimum being 38°.0, the maximum, 68°, and the mean, 54°.7. On nine days 1.7 inch of rain fell. The third week was sunless; during the rest of the month the sunshine varied from 7 to 33 per cent. The winds were for the most part W.S.W. November was wet, with strong westerly winds. The minimum temperature was 36°.5; maximum, 60°.0; mean, 45°.7. On nine days 1.99 inch of rain fell. There was but little fog. Two out of the four weeks were sunless; during the other two the sunshine in Regent's Park varied from 7 to 28.5 per cent. December was mild and snowless. Minimum temperature, 31°.0; maximum, 56°.5; mean, 46°.4. On 13 days more or less rain fell (2.18 inches). There was little fog. The winds were westerly. Frost was practically absent. Sunshine was above the average. BIRTHS AND DEATHS. The number of births registered dining the 52 weeks ending December 24th, 1898, when all essential corrections have been made, was 3,199. The number of deaths (corrected) of parishioners was 2,603. This gives a birth-rate of 22.6, a death-rate of 18.4 per thousand. The birth and death rates for 1898 of the sub-districts were as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 18.0; death-rate 15.2. Rectory, birth-rate 22.0; death-rate 22.8. St. Mary, birth-rate 24.3; death-rate 19.4. Christ Church, birth-rate 24.5; death-rate 19.6. St. John, birth-rate 25.2; death-rate 17.5. The following is a statement of the average birth and death rates of St. Marylebone, and its subdivisions, for five years, viz., from 1892 to 1897:— 10 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. All Souls, birth-rate 20.3 ; death-rate 16 9. Rectory, birth-rate 28.0; death-rate 22.3. St. Mary, birth-rate 24.3; death-rate 20.6. Christ Church, birth-rate 27.6; death-rate 24.1. St. John, birth-rate 22.9; death-rate 17.7. St. Marylebone, birth-rate 24.8; death-rate 20.7. The following table gives the distribution of the deaths of parishioners dying in various extra-parochial institutions, all of which are included in the mortality statistics:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 477 North-Western Fever Hospital 41 Western Fever Hospital 8 South-Western Fever Hospital 2 Eastern Fever Hospital 1 St. Marylebone Workhouse, Gray's Inn Road 5 St. Mary's Hospital 53 Evelina Hospital 1 Children's Hospital, Paddington 15 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 7 Children's Hospital, Shadwell 1 St. George's Hospital 4 St. Thomas's Hospital 2 King's College Hospital 3 University College Hospital 21 London Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 2 Charing Cross Hospital 6 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 2 Great Northern Hospital 1 Brompton Hospital 5 French Hospital 4 German Hospital 3 Grosvenor Hospital 1 Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street 1 North-West London Hospital 1 West London Hospital 1 Royal Chest Hospital 1 670 SCARLET FEVEK. 11 Brought forward 670 Friedenheim 5 Royal Free Hospital 2 Cancer Hospital 2 London Temperance Hospital 2 North London Consumption Hospital 3 West London Consumption Hospital 1 Ilford Asylum 8 Hanwell Asylum 21 Cane Hill Asylum 5 Colney Hatch Asylum 11 Leavesden Asylum 18 Banstead Asylum 5 Darenth Asylum 3 Central London Sick Asylum 3 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 Kensington Infirmary 1 St. Giles's Workhouse 1 St. George's Workhouse 1 Paddington Workhouse 2 Fulham Infirmary 2 Chelsea Infirmary 1 Lambeth Infirmary 1 St. Joseph's Home 3 St. Peter's Home 2 St. Pelagia's Creche 3 St. Luke's House, Osnaburgh Street 1 Aged Blind Home, Holloway 1 Butchers' Alms Houses, Fulham 1 Otherwise 23 Hostel of God 1 804 SCARLET FEVER. The red continuous curve in the chart opposite page 12 shows the general course of scarlet fever week by week during 1898. The dotted red curve is a five years' average, hence this latter affords a basis of comparison. 12 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. The curve generally shows that scarlet fever was well below the average during 1898. The fatality of the cases notified was 5.5 per cent. DIPHTHERIA. On the other hand, diphtheria was somewhat above the average. The blue continuous curve in the chart shows a well marked exacerbation in the second week of May rapidly subsiding, and a more continuous rise in September. Of the 217 cases notified, 31 died, showing a fatality of a little over 14 per cent. TYPHOID FEVER. Typhoid fever was slightly above the average during the year, as shown by the continuous black line on the chart (opposite page). In November there was a decided rise. The majority of the cases were, however, imported into the parish, and to very few could a definite cause be assigned. TUBERCULOSIS. Tubercle in its various forms, popularly classed under the term "consumption," is a fair index of the sanitary condition of a locality; it has a special relation to cubic space and pure air. The district of St. Marylebone, when compared with other districts of the Metropolis, is one in which tubercle is about the average of the whole of London. The districts of the Strand, St. Saviour, Southwark, St. Luke, Westminster, St. James, St. Pancras, St. Giles, St. Martin's, Holborn, Clerkenwell, Shoreditch, Whitechapel, St. George-in the-East, Limehouse, St. George, Southwark, Newington, St. 01 ve, and Bermondsey, all show death-rates from phthisis over 2 per thousand and some even over 3 per thousand. Marylebone has had a phthisical death-rate during the past year of less than 2 per thousand, and taking an average of five years, slightly over 2 per thousand. On the other hand, less crowded districts, and those in which there is less poverty, show much lower rates. The rate is unequalled distributed, as the following table shows:— CURVE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CASES NOTIFIED WEEK BY WEEK OF SCARLET FEVER, DIPHTHERIA, AND TYPHOID FEVER DURING 1898. (JANUARY TO DECEMBER). DISINFECTION. 13 Death-rate per thousand from Phthisis during 1898, and for the five years, 1893-1897. Five years' average. 1893-1897. 1898.

The steam disinfector has been continually at work during 1898, and has disinfected the very large number of 20,702 separate articles, as compared with 8,000 during the previous year. The increase is not due to infectious disease but to the extra work in connection with the Cleansing of Persons Act. This year, 1899, the second disinfector, ready to be delivered, will be in use, and relieve to some considerable extent the larger machine. The list of articles is as follows:— Beds 327 Mattresses 452 Bolsters 433 Pillows 1,019 Sheets 849 Blankets 1,499 Sundries, such as counterpanes, quilts, wearing apparel, rugs, mats, cushions, carpets, covers, curtains, &c., &c. 22,123 Total 26,702 The Disinfecting Van has been used 554 times. VACCINATIONS DURING 1898. The number of vaccinations during the year possess some special interest as an index of the success or otherwise of recent legislation. A large number of vaccinations take place in St. Mary's Lying-in Hospital, most of the infants being then taken away to other districts. 14 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. It is therefore better to consider the number of vaccinations in relation to the births exclusive of the district of St. Mary, in which district Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital is situate. In 1897 the births, with the exclusion mentioned, were 2,814, the vaccinations 2,256, a relation of about 80 per cent. In 1898 the births were 2,676, the vaccinations 1,970, that is about 73.5 per cent. In other words, if the Act has had any influence at all, it has diminished the number of vaccinations. The following table gives the number of vaccinations in each sub-district during the year 1898 : Vaccinations during the Year 1898. Public Vaccinator. Private Practitioners. Total. All Souls' 247 180 427 Rectory 245 129 374 St. Mary 1041 204 1245 Christ Church 352 205 557 St. John 297 315 612 2192 1033 3215 PROSECUTIONS UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. There were more cases than usual in which it was necessary to enforce the notices of the Vestry by proceedings before a magistrate. In the early part of the year a batch of summonses was taken out with regard to the occupation of underground rooms or kitchens in Hereford Street. The magistrate adjourned the summonses a sufficient time for the kitchens to be vacated, and in due course they were vacated. At the present time it is to be hoped but few kitchens in St. Marylebone are occupied illegally. A series of summonses was also taken out with regard to certain premises in Nightingale Street. One house was closed, and orders made with regard to other houses, and the owner fined. A firm of builders was summoned for a number of offences against the L.C.C. bye-laws with respect to the construction of closets in an important place of business, THE ST. MARYLEBONE SHELTER. 15 and fines inflicted for the breaches. An important prosecution was undertaken by the Vestry against the Metropolitan Electric Supply Co. for not consuming the smoke from their premises. The case was proved, and the defence that the Company were unable to get smokeless coal owing to the South Wales strike was not accepted by the magistrate, who inflicted the full penalty of £10, with costs. In December a summons against the owner of a house in Cochrane Street was heard for not carrying out a drainage order, and a magistrate's order obtained. THE ST. MARYLEBONE SHELTER. The St. Marylebone Shelter was fitted up in 1896, and first occupied as a shelter in February of that year. In 1896, a year in which there was a considerable amount of infectious disease, the shelter was used 27 times. In 1897, a non-epidemic year, it was only used 9 times. In 1898, also a year remarkable for the relatively speaking small amount of notifiable disease, the shelter was used 10 times. Fourteen males and nineteen females were sheltered while their rooms were disinfected. Most of the cases were relating to scarlet fever and diphtheria. The following; is the complete list:— 1898. Date and length of time. Disease for which Disinfection operations were necessary. Number of Persons using Shelter. 29th Jan. to 1st Feb., 50 hours Scarlet Fever 3 adults and 5 children 16th February, 2 hours Puerperal Fever 1 adult 12th, 13th, and 14th March, 42 hours Diphtheria 2 adults and 1 child 28th March, 4 hours Puerperal Fever 1 adult 25th and 26th April, 24 hrs. Scarlet Fever 2 adults and 2 children 2nd and 3rd June, 24 hrs. Scarlet Fever 2 adults and 1 child 8th June, 8 hours Scarlet Fever 2 adults and 1 child 21st and 22nd June, 17 hrs. Puerperal Fever 1 adult 15th and 16th September, 16 hours Diphtheria 2 adults and 2 children 28th to 30th December, 48 hours Scarlatina 1 adult and 4 children 16 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT. The temporary baths established under the Act in the neighbourhood of the Stoneyard have been, during nine months, that is from March to December, in full activity. When it is considered that the arrangements at present are confessedly primitive, it is somewhat astonishing to find that no less than 3,306 persons have availed themselves of the privilege. Without doubt, the numbers do not represent 3,306 separate individuals; those whoever are known to have taken a second or third bath bear no very large proportion to the whole, and it is well within the mark to assert that 3,000 extremely dirty males have cleansed themselves in the St. Marylebone Cleansing Bath during 1898. Plans are being prepared for a better structure, which will also give facilities for the cleansing of females. There have been under a dozen applications from women. The few who have applied have had to wait until the males had finished their baths. The present arrangement has been practically confined to males. SANITARY WORK, 1898. At page 31 will be found a summary of the details of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors. Complaints of insanitary conditions in 1895 amounted to 1,633, in 1896 to 1,658, in 1897 to 1,129, and in 1898 to 1,198. The number of inspections during the year of all kinds amounted to 16,242—about the same as in the previous year. The number of Vestry notices was only 278, most of the insanitary conditions being attended to after a simple written communication; 1,231 of these written communications have been sent relative to various nuisances. The Sanitary Inspectors have attended to their duties regularly and efficiently. There have been no changes of staff during the year. CLERICAL WORK OF THE SANITARY DEPARTMENT. 17 Clerical Work of the Sanitary Department. The clerical work of the Sanitary Department continues to be somewhat heavy, and fully occupies the time of Mr. James Curtis, the Senior Clerk of the Department, and Mr. L. J. Carr. Mr. Carr was appointed in June, 1898, succeeding Mr. H. E. Curtis, who obtained a post in the Vestry Clerk's department at a higher salary. A great deal of the work performed by the Clerical staff scarcely admits of tabulation; that which it is possible to state numerically is appended below. The Clerical staff has worked with great assiduity, fidelity, and ability, during the year. REGISTER OF CLERICAL WORK, 1898. Number of Notifications of Infectious Diseases entered in Register, copied, and sent to Metropolitan Asylums Board and Schools, receipt acknowledged and filed 934 Number of Complaints of Nuisances received, entered in Nuisance Register and filed 1,286 Number of letters dispatched from Department 1,328 Number of Vestry Orders issued 317 Number of Meetings of Sanitary and Sewers Committee prepared for, attended, and Minutes drafted and written 20 Number of Reports from Committee to Vestry prepared 20 Number of Meetings of Sub-Committees prepared for, attended, and Minutes drafted and written 15 Number of Workrooms registered under Factory and Workshops Acts, with particulars as to cubic capacity, ventilation, etc. 181 18 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. SANITARY LEGISLATION, 1898. During 1898 sixty-two public general Acts were added to the Statute Book, but none, with the exception of a particularly unfortunate Act amending the Law with respect to Vaccination, have any bearing on sanitation in the Metropolitan area. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. The condition of Nightingale Street has been specially brought under the consideration of the Vestry as a street in which notoriously insanitary conditions more or less constantly prevail. Repeated notices, repeated summonses, and frequent inspection have effected but temporary improvement. The writer accordingly suggested that a more drastic remedy be employed, and in November presented a report under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, recommending that the area (excluding the School) comprised by Nightingale Street, Samford Street, and certain houses in Salisbury Street be dealt with. The report was referred to the Sanitary Committee. The Committee, after viewing the property, brought up a report, recommending the Vestry to deal with it under Part II, as, in their opinion, the area in question was too small to be dealt with under Part I. by the London County Council. The Vestry, however, after discussion, resolved that a representation be made to the London County Council to take up the area under Part I. The matter is, therefore, at present under the consideration of the London County Council. The area is about 7,500 square yards; the majority of the houses have only four rooms; the rateable value of the property is £800. The population displaced, should the scheme be carried out, and for which provision must be made for rehousing, is estimated at about 500. Considering that the present houses are, as a rule, but STRAW OR LITTER IN THE STREETS. 19 two stories high, there should be no difficulty in building on the site healthy dwellings capable of housing double the number. 17 and 19 Burne Street were also reported under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and closed by Magistrate's Order. STRAW OR LITTER IN THE STREETS. The district of St. Marylebone possesses streets in which a large proportion of the houses are fitted up as nursing establishments. Patients come from a distance, suffering from serious maladies, and are received in these nursing homes, within easy reach of the physician or specialist. In many of them surgical operations are performed. All, so far as the writer is aware, are conducted by skilled nurses, and are well managed establishments. Such places are a great advantage to the wealthier class of suffering humanity, and supply a distinct want. There is one disadvantage, that is, some of the sufferers require the muffling of the street noises as far as possible, hence these nursing streets are almost constantly littered with straw. The Public Health Act expressly exempts from penalty any person putting down straw or litter in cases of illness. There is no definition of the term " illness "; it is open for any malade imaginaire to litter the streets as often as he pleases. Until the litter gets rotten and stinks, the Local Authority cannot compel its removal. The Vestry agree with the writer that it is high time, so far as St. Marylebone is concerned, that there should be power to regulate the deposit of litter in the streets. No one wishes to prevent it altogether, but the Local Authority should certainly possess a veto in cases' where it is either unnecessary or where other means could be adopted of muffling sounds. The Vestry have therefore suggested to the London County Council the propriety of inserting a clause in one of their Bills, enabling Local Authorities to frame regulations as to the laying down of straw or other litter. 20 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACTS. The details in relation to these important Acts have been since 1895 under the special superintendence of Mr. Philips. No sanitary duty requires more tact and common-sense; trade being the very life of the country, any vexatious and oppressive action by a Local Authority is to be strongly deprecated. So far as this district is concerned, in no single case have the officers of the department been convicted of exceeding their duty or carrying out the delicate and often irritating inspection under the Factory Acts in an improper manner. At the present time, there are 580 distinct businesses on the register, representing over 1,000 work-rooms and 7,000 employes. Of these, 300 work-rooms are lit by electricity, 101 lit by lamps, the remainder by gas. The trades are mainly in connection with dressmaking and tailoring, and the female employees predominate over the males, the males representing about a seventh of the total number. Out-Workers. Under the Factory and Workshops Act of 1891, Sect. 27, it is enacted:—"The occupier of every factory or workshop (including any workshop conducted on the system of not employing any child, young person, or woman therein), and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop, shall, if so required by the Secretary of State, by an Order made in accordance with Section 65 of the principal Act, and subject to any exceptions mentioned in the Order, keep, in the prescribed form and with the prescribed particulars, lists showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workman or as contractor, in the business of the factory or workshop, outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed, and every such list shall be open to inspection by any inspector under the principal Act, or by any officer of a sanitary authority." Under this Section an Order has been made, dated October 31st, 1892, It applies to the manufacture of OUT-WORKERS. 21 articles of wearing apparel, of electro-plate, of files, and to cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work. The Local Government Board has also issued a circular requesting Sanitary Authorities generally to inspect workshops and houses where the outworkers are employed. The Section itself has been extended by a subsequent Act, the Factory and Workshops Act, 1895, Sect. 42:— (1) "Every occupier of a factory or workshop to whom Section 27 of the Act of 1891, for the time being applies, and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop, shall, on or before the first day of March and the first day of September in each year, send to the inspector for the district in which the factory or workshop is situate, a list showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workmen or as contractors, in the business of the factory or workshop outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed, and in default of so doing shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings." (2.) Section 27 of the Act of 1891 enacts :—"And this Section shall apply to any place from which any work of making wearing apparel for sale is given out, and to the occupier of that place, and to every contractor employed by any such occupier in connection with the said work as if that place were a workshop." The word "Inspector" in the Sections cited refer to inspectors appointed and under the control of the Home Office, and not to the sanitary inspectors. This portion of the Act has not been carried out in St. Marylebone hitherto in its entirety. During the latter part of 1898, however, an attempt has been made to put the Section into force. In the first place the Home Office was applied to, to know whether copies of the lists in that Office could be consulted, and a courteous 22 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. reply received giving every facility. On Mr. Phillips inspecting the materials at the Home Office they were found of but little use, mainly owing to the frequent changes of address of the workers. A list correct in March would be incorrect in three months afterwards. There was, therefore, no course left but to apply direct to the various employers of labour; this is being done. So far the greater mass of outworkers live outside the district, and there; seems to be a constant tendency for the classi of workers engaged in the tailoring and dressmaking trades to migrate from Marylebone into other districts where cheaper rents prevail. There is indeed little doubt but that unfurnished rooms, which could be formerly got for from 3s. to 4s. a room, are diminishing yearly. Persons who cannot afford to pay 10s. a week rent are obliged to go farther afield. The addresses of the outworkers who work in the parish but live outside have, been communicated to the sanitary authorities' of their respective districts. Similarly, the adjoining ,sanitary authorities reciprocate such information. Bakehouses. The bakehouses in the parish are diminishing in number. The number on the register at present is but 105. The following is a tabular statement of certain matters which admit of tabulation; much of the work relating to factories and workshops does not admit of this method of expression: —- 1895 1896 1897 1898 Visits to Outworkers 251 476 306 426 Measurement of cubic space, registering same, etc. 172 193 730 181 Investigating ventilation 40 263 730 181 Inspection of new established places of business, and ing same 26 10 81 64 Inspection of bakehouses 254 228 119 114 Smoke Inspections 23 26 18 391 THE LABORATORY. 23 THE LABORATORY. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The Adulteration Acts have received much attention. During the year 609 samples have been analysed. Of these, 12, viz., 11 samples of milk and 1 of coffee, were found to be adulterated. The milk adulteration works out at about 5 per cent, of the samples taken. In two of the cases borax had been added to the milk, the other cases were simply those of watering the milk or both watering and depriving the milk of cream. In seven of the cases the vendors were prosecuted and fined, the fines varying from 12s. 6d. up to £5, the total amount of fines for the year being £18 5s. In the remaining five cases no proceedings were instituted, either for technical reasons or because the adulteration was not large. The full list of the samples taken is detailed on page 30, table V. Examination of the Water Supply. The writer has had a bacteriological examination made of the water supply from the month of May onwards. This is a valuable addition to the methods of investigation. The special object of the inquiry was to establish a standard by means of which any deviation from normal could be detected. The various chemists who examine the Metropolitan water supplies have for some time, it is true, published the number of colonies per cubic centimetre, but so far as the writer is aware this is the first time in which an attempt has been made to regularly and systematically identify the class to which the organisms belong. So far the total result has been highly favourable. In no single month has there been any cause to suspect the entry of polluting matters either from the reservoirs or in transit. It must at the same time be pointed out that the samples for analysis were all taken from mains in which the water was running freely; none were taken from 24 SANITARY CHRONICLES, 1898. dead ends. It appears from a recent report of Dr. Orme Dudfield that a sample taken from a dead end in the Parish of Kensington showed signs of pollution, and Dr. Edward Frankland has also proved that the water in the sluggish part of a main may exhibit considerable difference of composition to the general supply. In 1899, therefore, the writer may have an opportunity of, from time to time, investigating this matter. 25 REPORT OP MORTUARY KEEPER FOR THE YEAR, 1898.

Mean barometer 30.0 inches. 2 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics, are as follows : — All Souls, birth-rate 15.7; death-rate 13.2. Rectory, birth-rate 20.5; death-rate 22.6. St. Mary, birth-rate 20.5; death-rate 17.3. Christ Church, birth-rate 23 4; death-rate 12.5. St. John, birth-rate 24.3; death-rate 16.5. The whole district, birth-rate 21.3; death-rate 16.0. The average death-rates for five years (1893 to 1898), for the corresponding fire weeks were as follows:—All Souls, 13.0; Rectory, 22.6; St. Mary, 20.6; Christ Church, 24 9; St. John, 20.5; the whole district, 20.7. The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes:— TABLE I. SHOWING THE COMPARATIVE MORTALITY DURING THE FIVE WEEKS ENDING JANUARY 24th, 1899, FROM CERTAIN CLASSES OF DISEASE AND PROPORTION TO 1,000 DEATHS FROM ALL CAUSES:— Total Deaths. 5 weeks ending Jan. 29th, 1899. Proportion of the deaths to 1,000 deaths from all causes. 5 weeks ending Jan. 29, 1899. Rate per 1,000 of the population. Mean rate per 1,000 population for corresponding period 1893-1898. I.

Convulsive Diseases of Infants 15 69 1.12 1.02 NOTES. 1, includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough, Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3, includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 4, includes Marasmus, Atrophy, Debility, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth. 5, includes Hydrocephalus, Infantile Meningitis, Convulsions, and Teething. 3 Births and Deaths. During the five weeks ending January 28th there have been registered 285 births and 215 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the five sub-districts as set forth in Table IV. 64 of the deaths were extraparochial, as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 37 North Western Fever Hospital 3 Western Fever Hospital 1 Northern Fever Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 2 St. George's Hospital 1 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 1 Charing Cross Hospital 1 University Hospital 1 Children's Hospital, Paddington 2 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 1 Colney Hatch Asylum 3 Ilford Asylum 1 Banstead Asylum 3 Leavesden Asylum 1 Central London Sick Asylum 1 St. Marylebone Workhouse, Gray's Inn Road 1 Heart Hospital, Soho 1 North Wharf 1 Edgware Road (near Praed Street) 1 Total 64 4 Effects of the exceptional Season. The absence of fog, the mildness of the temperature, the frequent washing of the dusty town air, and the flushing of drains and sewers by the heavy rainfall, are combined influences which may account for the unusual absence of notifiable infectious maladies and the feeble mortality from chest complaints as shown in Table I, The ordinary death rate for January for zymotic diseases is about 2.6 per 1,000; but January of 1899 gives a death rate of about l.8. A far greater reduction is shown in the figures for chest complaints; from an average January death-rate of 5.6, the rate has sunk to just under 2 per 1,000, or if the death-rate for all diseases be considered, then there is to be seen a reduction of nearly 5 per 1,000. A Sanitary Officer's Power of Entry. A very important decision has been given in the Queen's Bench Division, January 18th, 1899, before Lawrance and Channell, L.J.J., in a St. Pancras case (Mabel Mary Vines v. the North London Collegiate and Camden School for Girls), which renders clear the exact powers of entry of a Sanitary Officer under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The main facts of the case are as follows:—Miss Vines, a Sanitary Inspector of the St. Pancras Authority, applied for admission into the North London School, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any nuisance existed, or whether there was any infraction of the bye-laws. This admission was refused. An application was made under the Act (sect. 115, subs. 3) to a Stipendiary Magistrate (Mr. Plowden), to issue a warrant for entry, the Act stating that "if a Justice is satisfied, by information on oath, that there is reasonable ground for such entry, and that there has been a failure or refusal to admit to such premises, and that reasonable notice of the intention to apply to a Justice for a warrant has been given, the Justice may, by warrant under his hand, authorize the Sanitary Authority, or their Officers, or other person, as the case may require, to enter the premises." The Inspector, before the Magistrate, did not state that a nuisance was suspected, but 5 demanded the warrant as a right, relying:— on the wording of sections 1., which provides that it shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority to cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district, with a view to ascertain what nuisances exist calling for abatement: on section 2 the "nuisance clause" ; on section 40 giving power to Sanitary Authorities to enter and examine drains and sanitary fittings ; and on section 10 stating the right of the Sanitary Authority to enter premises to examine nuisances. The Magistrate refused the application on the ground, that in point of law there was no evidence before him of reasonable ground for such entry within the meaning of section 115, sub-section 3; he, however, stated a case, the result of which is that the magisterial decision has been upheld and the appeal dismissed with costs. The following is the material portions of the Judgment:— *Mr. JUSTICE LAWRANCE : " I think the Magistrate arrived at a perfectly proper conclusion in this case. The application was made under sections 10 and 40—either one or the other of them, or both—to enter into this particular house; under one section for the purpose of examining as to the existence of a nuisance requiring to be dealt with summarily, and under section 40, which says that ' the Sanitary Authority may examine any of the following works, that is to say, any water closet, earth closet, privy, ash-pit, cesspool,' and so forth. Now, the application was made by the Appellant in this case, who was the Sanitary Inspector for the Parish of St. Pancras ; and she gave notice to the lady who was the head of this school, that she desired to inspect, and was refused admission to the school for the purpose of inspecting. Then it became necessary for her to have recourse to section 115, and to go before a Magistrate ; and going before a Magistrate, it was her duty to satisfy him, by Information on oath, that there was reasonable ground for such entry; that is to say, the entry which she desired to make. The object was, I suppose, to see whether there was, under section 10, a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act, or to see whether all the taps and drains and so forth were in good *Minutes of Evidence, published by the Vestry of St. Pancras. 6 order under section 40. Whichever it was, she was bound to supply to the Justice, or to show to him, that there was reasonable ground for her application for such entry, and that was to be on Information on oath. I have read the Information. It seems to me that there is absolutely no ground whatever, whether reasonable or not, stated by her, upon which she could ask the Magistrate for leave to enter. No ground is stated by her. She says again ' I wanted to enter, and I then and there applied ' (this is to Mrs. Sophie Bryant, the Head Mistress of the School) 'for permission to enter the school premises for the purpose of examining as to the existence of any nuisance therein.' " Now that throws us back to the question: Is that a reasonable ground? The reasonable ground must be a ground with some reason for it. ' Why do you want to go in the Magistrate has a right to ask ; and the answer to that is, as far as it is given on this Information : ' I have no more right than that which was given to me by the Statute, and it is enough for me to swear that I wish to go in, because the Statute gives me power to go in.' That in my judgment is not a reasonable ground or such a reasonable ground, as was contemplated by section 115, sub-section 3, namely, a reasonable ground which she is to give to the Magistrate to satisfy him before he makes the Order which is asked for. " Under these circumstances, I think the Magistrate was perfectly justified in his conclusion, which was the only proper conclusion he could come to, that there was no evidence upon which he could act. No evidence of any reasonable ground was afforded to him, and therefore he did the only thing which in my judgment he ought to have done, namely, refused the right to enter." Mr. JUSTICE CHANNELL: " I am of the same opinion. I think the case entirely turns on the construction of section «/ 115, sub-section 3 of this Act of Parliament; and for the purposes of my judgment, I assume that a right of entry did in fact exist, both under section 10 and under section 40, I assume that it existed. Therefore a right is given, and the entry is in fact refused by the people at the school. Then we come to see what provision is made by the legislature as to enforcing that right which they have given, and the provision is that ' where a Sanitary Authority have, by 7 virtue of any enactment, a right to enter—it only applies where there is the right infact—'and entry is refused, then the following provisions shall apply, if a Justice is satisfied by Information on oath that there is reasonable ground for such entry.' Now it is not, if he is satisfied that the right exists, because it starts with the assumption that the right exists, but then it says that he must be satisfied that there is reasonable ground for the entry; that is to say he must be satisfied that there is reasonable ground for exercising that right which ex hypothesi exists, because otherwise the section would not apply at all he must be satisfied that there is reasonable ground for exercising that right in respect of the premises in question. It follows from that that the mere statement that the right does exist cannot be of itself a ground for saying ' I want to exercise it in this particular case.' You must say something; and this lady, for some reason, did not say anything at all. She says ' very well, in every case where the right exists, without giving any reason for saying why I want to go into these particular premises, the Magistrate is bound to give me the right to enter into these particular premises.' I venture to think the Legislature has said clearly: No. They have interposed a stipulation that the Magistrate is to be satisfied that there is a reasonable ground for exercising the right in the particular case. Something must be said. In this particular case they said nothing; and consequently, as Mr. Macmorran has said, if that is so, you can go to a Magistrate, and go into every house within the district. Possibly if she had said there were special circumstances existing with reference to the school, such as the various things which have been suggested, that might have been enough ; but she has not said anything at all, except that the right does in fact exist. It is quite clear that the existence of the right cannot be a reasonable ground for exercising the right, when it follows a section which begins by assuming that the right does exist. " It seems to me, therefore, quite clear that the Magistrate was right in this case, and that the appeal must be dismissed." So far as the writer is aware, no attempt has been made, or is likely to be made, by the Sanitary Officers of this 8 parish to forcibly enter premises, schools or otherwise, save on some definite ground. The decision establishes the right of inspection, but shows that the right can only be enforced on reasonable ground. What is reasonable ground is a question for the magistrate; in the present case it was expressly stated by Mr. Macmorran, Q.C., for the North London Collegiate School, that had there been a child with a sore throat, or " if anyone had smelt a smell even, or there was hearsay evidence of a bad state of things," the North London School Authorities would not have objected. It therefore comes to this: the Sanitary Officers have power to inspect any premises whatever by permission, tacit or actual; they have a right to inspect any premises (save certain premises such as those belonging to her Majesty's Government, or to Her Majesty's Navy and Army), but in case of any opposition to the exercise of that right, the Sanitary Officers must be prepared to show a clear case of some suspected nuisance or offence against the Act before a warrant for forcible entry will be granted. All this is most reasonable with regard to private dwellings, the Englishman's " castle " should not be lightly invaded ; but as to schools and institutions where young persons are collected together, the writer thinks it would be for the public interest that they should be liable to inspection, although no precise and definite reason for such inspection could be given.

BY WILLIAM ARTHUR BOND, M.A., M.D., B.C., D.P.H. (Camb.), M.R.C.P, (Lond.) Fellow and Member of the Council of the Royal Institute of Public Health ; Lecturer and Demonstrator to the Sanitary Institute ; Fellow of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; Member of the Epidemiological Society, etc. Medical Officer of Health to the Board of Works for the Holborn District; and Medical Officer of Health for the District. london: PRINTED BY C. TALBOT, TOOLEY STREET, S.E. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1898. To the Members of the Board of Works for the St. Olave District, Southwark. Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you my fifth Annual Report. This Report, in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, deals with the twelve months ended 31st December, 1898. The details of the Report show that much work has been done in improving the sanitary condition of the District. A large amount of house-to-house inspections have been effected during the year, and the sanitary defects found have been remedied. The systematic inspection of the sanitary arrangements of the Wharves, which was commenced last year, has been continued during the year, and is now completed. I am glad to be able to report that the mortality statistics continue to improve. There has been a successive reduction in the general death-rate the past three years, notwithstanding 4 the increase in the London rate for 1898; the mortality of infants per thousand births has shown also a successive reduction the past three years, and each of these years the rate has been less than the London rate. The zymotic deathrate has been diminished the past two years, and is this year below the London rate; and the phthisis rate is also diminished. Overcrowding, although often recurring, has been much reduced, and during the year only 25 instances were found, which are much below the numbers of previous years. Many rooms were again found to be in a filthy and disgraceful state on account of the neglect of the occupiers. In 106 such cases notices were served on the tenants, with very beneficial results. During the year the Metropolitan Asylums Board was able to receive all the cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhoid fever, that required to be removed to their hospitals. The treatment of diphtheria by anti-toxic serum still continues to give very satisfactory results, which have been confirmed by an enquiry by a committee of the Clinical Society. On account of the Welsh coal strike there has been a large increase of smoke nuisances which have required attention. Many observations were made, and ten notices were served, and one firm was fined £5 and costs. The South Eastern, and London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Companies were communicated with on account of nuisances caused bv smoke from their locomotives. */ 5 The regular removal of house refuse has for many years compared favourably with that of any London district. The streets and courts have, as usual, been regularly cleansed, and the walls of the public courts have been twice limewhited during the year. The provision of a bath at the Shelter for the use of persons during the disinfection of their rooms, and under the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, had much attention from the Committee, but for several reasons it was at present considered inexpedient. The Vaccination Act, 1898, was passed on the 12th August, from which date the '' Conscience Clause " came into operation, and the rest of the Act on the 1st January, 1899. By this Act the following changes are introduced:— Vaccination is to be within six months after birth, instead of three months. The Public Vaccinator of the District must, if required, vaccinate at the home of the child. If the child is not vaccinated within four months after birth, the Public Vaccinator must visit the home of the child and offer to vaccinate the child with glycerinated calf lymph. Vaccination may be postponed if it cannot safely be performed on account of the condition of the home or the prevalence of infectious disease in the district. Notice of the certificate of postponement must be forthwith given to the Medical Officer of Health for the district. 6 The method of procedure under the " Conscience Clause " is too well known to require any comment. For the first four months after the passing of the Act the certificate might be obtained for a child of any age, but now, only within four months of the birth of the child. Provision is made against repeated penalties. A person imprisoned for non-compliance with the Vaccination Act must be treated as a first-class misdemeanant. The Act is to continue in operation for five years, till the 1st January, 1904. In April, 1898, was issued the Report of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, appointed to enquire into the administrative procedures for controlling danger to man through the use as food of the meat and milk of tuberculous animals. On pages 26—28 I give an abstract of the recommendations of this Royal Commission. Although sanitary improvements have already done much, there are still about 60,000 deaths annually in England and Wales from consumption and other forms of tuberculosis, such as consumption of the bowels, or tabes mesenterica, diseases of the brain, glands, bones, and joints, the latter leading to hump-back, hip-joint disease, and other deformities. It is now known that '' this terrible waste of life, with all the protracted suffering attending it, and the distress, moral and material, which it involves, is in great measure preventable." I am, therefore, very glad that during the year much 7 has been done to educate the public and arouse their interest in this most important subject. The National Association for the Prevention of Consumption and other Forms of Tuberculosis has been formed. For a subscription of five shillings anyone can become a member, or a life -member for a donation of five guineas. A leaflet and pamphlet have already been issued, and the Board gave its consent for copies of these to be sent to Members of the Board and the medical practitioners of the district, and to the latter additional copies of the leaflet have been given for distribution to consumptive patients. In my Annual Report for the year 1895 I mentioned that for the prevention of consumption and allied diseases it is necessary that there should be:— Good ventilation of houses and workshops, and their sanitary construction and arrangement so as to secure fresh air, good light, and dry walls. No overcrowding. Proper drainage of the soil. Inspection of cowsheds, dairies, and cows, so as to insure good milk, free from the germs of tuberculosis. Inspection of animals intended for food, and adequate supervision of them at the time of slaughter. Disinfection of the sputum of phthisical patients, infected articles and rooms. To these I will now add:— The bacteriological examination of sputum, so that cases may be detected in their earliest stau:e, when cure can be most easily effected. %/ The provision of sanatoria for the open-air treatment of consumption. 8 The following are the other principal Public Health matters that I have reported upon, and have received the attention of the Committee and the Board. London Water Supply.—The Board expressed the opinion to the Royal Commission on London Water Supply that there should be one authority for the management and control of the water undertakings, which should consist of the London County Council with representatives from local bodies outside the County of London. The Board approved the action of the Battersea Vestry in opposing the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Bill. I may here mention that the Royal Commission issued its first report the latter part of December, recommending the inter connexion of the mains of the different Companies, and that, in order to be prepared for various accidents or exceptional drought, the Companies generally should provide additional storage reservoirs and filter beds. Measles.—The Board agreed that the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act relating to disinfection after infectious disease, and the exposure of infected persons and things, should also apply to measles. Typhoid Fever.— Permission for a bacteriological examination in doubtful cases was granted. Puerperal Fever.—The Board agreed that the names of the diseases included under this heading should be included in the notification section. 9 Drainage By-laws.—The Board approved of the London County Council making by-laws respecting drainage for the use of the London Sanitary Authorities. Outworkers in the Clothing Trades.—That the lists for each sanitary district should be prepared by the Home Office. Overcrowding and the Housing of the Working Classes.— The Board informed the Vestry of Bermondsey that while sympathising with all efforts for improving the housing of the working classes, they are not, in the absence of any practicable scheme respecting the same, able to take any action in the matter. Public Abattoirs jor London.—The Board expressed the opinion that it was strongly opposed to the provision of public abattoirs in London. I had the honour of opening a discussion on the subject at the Sanitary Institute, and shall be happy to let any Member of the Board have a printed copy of my paper and the discussion. I thank the Members and Officers of the Board for all the kindness, courtesy, and co-operation that I have received. I desire especially to acknowledge the excellent and cordial co-operation afforded by your Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Thomas Ashdown. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND. B 10 VITAL STATISTICS. Population, etc.—The populations of the several parishes of the District at the censuses of 1881, 1891 and 1896 were— 1881. 1891. 1896. Area in acres. St. Olave 2,247 2,159 j 2,314 48 St. Thomas 781 752 8 St. John, Horselydown 8,928 9,812 9,417 69 11,956 12,723 11,731 125 The density of population in 1896 was 94 persons per acre; for Registration London it was 59 to an acre. I have based the calculations in the following Reports upon the population of all ages as usually estimated to the middle of the year 1898. This is 11.310. I think this estimate is not less than the true population, because, notwithstanding the demolition of houses in connection with the Tower Bridge Approach and the South Eastern Railway Extensions, the natural increase of the population or excess of births over deaths during the past three years has been 507. Moreover, the number of persons belonging to the District who were in outlying public institutions, of whom 68 died during the year, is unknown, and therefore not allowed for in the estimate of population. Allowance is also made in the calculations for the fact that the Registrar's Returns include exactly 52 weeks. 11 BIRTHS. The number of births registered for the whole District (which includes the united Parish of St. Olave and St. Thomas and that of St. John), for the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1898, was 357. Of this total, 169 were male children and 188 female children. This gives a birth-rate of 31.7 per thousand of the population. The birth-rates for the five preceding years were 37.9, 35.9, 32.9, 33.2, 32, and the birthrate for Registration London for the year was 29.5, the lowest London birth-rate recorded. DEATH S. The deaths registered in the 52 weeks ending 31st December, 1898, as having occurred in the District were 828; 650 of these took place at Guy's Hospital, this number including only 25 deaths of parishioners, 625 belonging to other Districts. At the Parish Street Workhouse there were 39 deaths, only four of these belonging to the District. Twelve bodies were found in the Thames, all uon-parishioners. Two non-parishioners died in the District. The deaths of 68 parishioners were returned from outlying public institutions. Thus the number of deaths of persons belonging to the District was 222. The corrected annual death-rate was 19.7 per thousand. The corresponding death-rate for London for the year was 18.3. 12 The corrected death-rate of St. Olave's and of London for the past eight years are as under— Year. St. Olave's Death-Rate per 1,000 London Death-Rate per 1,000 1891 25.2 21.4 1892 23.7 20.4 1893 21.2 21.3 1894 19.4 17.4 1895 23.1 19.4 1896 21.7 18.2 1897 20.9 17.7 1898 19.7 18.3 The population for the years 1891—95 inclusive, estimated in the usual way was probably too high, as the census of 1896 showed that the population had diminished. The death-rates therefore as given for these years are probably lower than the true death-rates. The marked reduction in the death-rate each year during the past three years is very satisfactory, especially that for this year, notwithstanding the increase in the London death-rate. Table I. gives the causes of death in the form required by the Local Government Board. Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of young children always bear a high ratio to total deaths. There were 83 deaths of children under 5 years old, that is 37.4 per cent. of the total deaths; last year it was 41.0 per cent., and in 1896 it was 48.6 per cent. 13 13 46 children died under one year old; that is only 129 per 1,000 births registered. The corresponding rate for London was 167 per thousand. This proportion lias very much diminished in this District the past three years; for in 1895 it was as high as 205 per 1,000 births. This very satisfactory diminution, which is an index of the improved sanitary condition of the District, is well shown in the following Table:— Year. St. Olave. London. 1895 205 165 Deaths of children under one year old per 1,000 births registered. 1896 150 161 1897 145 158 1898 129 167 Phthisis and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. There were 25 deaths of persons belonging to this District caused by phthisis, or an annual rate of 2.22 per 1,000 inhabitants; the corresponding rate for London was 1.72 per 1,000. There were also 11 deaths due to other forms of tuberculosis. For the prevention of consumption, see introduction, pages 6 and 7. 38 deaths were caused by other diseases of the respiratory organs, namely, pneumonia, bronchitis and pleurisy. Influenza was the registered cause of 7 deaths. In London the number was 1,283. 14 Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic Diseases was one less than that of the preceding year, or a zymotic death-rate of 2.22 per 1,000. This is less than the corresponding rate for London, which was 2.77 per 1,000. The following Table gives a comparison of the past three vears:— %/ 1896. 1897. 1898.

The cases at the Workhouse did not belong to this District. The cases of Infectious Disease have been about the same as for London as a whole, per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the notifications were: — 1896. 1897. 1898.

Small-pox.—No case of small-pox was notified. In London there were 35 notifications, and 1 death. The statistics of all epidemics of small pox show the enormous value of vaccination and re-vaccination. Notwithstanding this the proportion of children that are not vaccinated has been increasing year by year since 1881, both in the Metropolis and the rest of England. In 1881 the proportion of children unaccounted for in regard to vaccination (including cases postponed) in the Metropolitan Unions was only 5.7 per cent. of the total births. In 1891 this proportion had risen to 16.4 per cent., and is still rising. In 1895, the last return available, the proportion was 24.9 per cent. See introduction, pages 5 and 6, re the Vaccination Act, 1898. Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina.—There were 67 cases notified, and only 1 death; 64 of the 67 cases were removed to hospital. In London the notifications were 16,917 in number, and the deaths from the complications of this disease were 583, the smallest number of deaths in London from this disease ever recorded, and much below the average of the preceding ten years. In February, 5 cases of scarlet fever occurred at the Workhouse, the first two cases were two young children, one 12 months and the other 18 months. 17 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—16 cases were notified, and all were removed to hospital except a doubtful case, which was afterwards considered not to be diphtheria. There were only two deaths, a case mortality of only 12.5 per cent., that of London being 14.9 per cent. In London there were 11,871 cases notified, and 1,772 deaths from this disease, the smallest number since 1891. Typhoid Fever.—There were only 5 cases notified, and one death. As two of these were doubtful cases, examinations were made for the Widal reaction, which was obtained in both cases. One was not contracted in this District, as the illness had begun when the person came to reside in this, District. Another case was probably caused by the consumption of infected oysters. In London there were 3,032 notifications and 585 deaths. Measles.—The mortality from measles in this District was again small, there being but 5 deaths assigned to this disease. In London the number of deaths was 3,069. In London there are generally four or five consecutive quarters of years with few deaths, followed by three or four consecutive quarters in which the number of deaths is very large. The last epidemic was during the last quarter of 1897 and the first two quarters of 1898. Whooping Cough was the assigned cause of 11 deaths, all of children under five years of age. It was very pre- c 18 valent in this District during the year, the mortality being rather more than double that of London. In London the number of deaths from whooping cough was 2,160. Diarrhœa was returned as the cause of 4,376 deaths in London. It was very prevalent during the third quarter of the year, the temperature during that quarter being above the average. In this District onlv 5 deaths, all of which O O ' took place in the third quarter, and were all of young children, were returned as caused by diarrhoea. Dr. Klein has found the bacillus enteriditis sporogenes associated with many cases of diarrhœa, also in many samples of milk. He states that "amongst the sources of this bacillus are the evacuations of cases of diarrhoea, sewage, water, soil, and dust polluted with sewage; as also horses7 dung."The spores are highly resistant and have a wide distribution in nature, so that there is ample opportunity for them to gain access to milk and other articles of food. DISINFECTION, &c. The measures taken in dealing with the cases arising in the District outside Guy's Hospital were as follows:— Number of rooms fumigated 84 Number of rooms stripped and cleansed byOwner or Occupier 87 Do. do. by the Board 1 Number of notices served, calling the attention of Occupiers of Houses to the provisions of Sections 62 and 65 P.H. (London) Act, 1891 76 Number of notices requiring disinfection 48 19 Number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected 2,543 Number of articles given up and destroyed (exclusive of books) 17 Number of persons using Shelter 52 Number of notices sent to Schools notifying where houses are infected 102 Number of notices sent to Schools notifying that houses have been disinfected 92 Number of copies of certificates made and forwarded to the M.A.B. or other Districts 103 The premises where infectious diseases occurred were all inspected and examined, and notices served when necessary. The Shelter provided for temporary occupation by families during the disinfection of their rooms has been used 14 times during the year, by 52 persons, 48 of whom were also provided with sleeping accommodation. The provision of a bath at the Shelter for the persons using it, and also under the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, was considered by the Committee, but for several reasons it was thought to be inexpedient. Anthrax, or Malignant Pustule. Through the courtesy of Dr. Perry I have received information of 4 cases of Anthrax admitted to Guy's Hospital last year. Only one was a worker in raw hides in this District. Three were contracted from infected hides, the other from hair. All recovered after operation. Last year there were 8 cases, and all but one recovered. In 1896 there were 14 cases, all of which recovered after operation. 20 Collection of House Refuse. This important service continues to be carried out regularly and efficiently, as for the fifth year in succession not a single complaint of neglect or inattention has been received. On the contrary, 293 visits have been made to houses where the dustmen have reported failure to obtain the refuse at the appointed times; and in 7 cases, where the occupiers have refused the dustmen's request to permit the removals, notices have been served, but no further proceedings were necessary. 23 new sanitary dust-pails have been provided in the place of old brick or wooden dust-bins. These must facilitate the work of the dustmen, and reduce to a minimum the nuisance caused by the storage and removal of house refuse. One ancient public dust-bin has been demolished during the year. Inquests. 155 inquests were held in this District; only 17, however, were on the bodies of parishioners. 135 of these inquests were held in the Coroner's Court at Guy's Hospital, and 20 in the St. Johns Vestry Hall. Mortuary. 26 bodies were removed to the Mortuarv in Weavers Lane, i and on 20 of these a Coroner's inquest was held in the St. John's Vestry Hall, Fair Street. 12 were bodies of nonparishioners that were found in the Thames. A satisfactory site for a new Mortuary has not yet been found. 21 Temperature. The mean temperature of the year was 51.3° F., being 2.6°F. above the average of the preceding 127 years. The rainfall was 18.85 inches, and was 6.07 inches below the average of the preceding 83 years. Rain fell on 142 days during the year. Further meteorological details are given in the Appendix. SANITARY WORK. During the year the following places have been closed, and for the reasons given:— Nos. 32, 33, 34 and 35 Queen Elizabeth Street. In the cases of Nos. 33, 34 and 35, the houses were closed by the owner in preference to complying with Sanitary Notices which required extensive repairs. The site, with that of the late No. 32, and some land which was used as a yard, sheds, &c., is now being built upon by Messrs. Silver, Edgington & Co., for the purpose of carrying on their business there. No. 44 Queen Elizabeth Street was closed as a workplace instead of complying with the requirements of a notice. It is now used as stables. Nos. 45 and 47 Lafone Street were closed in preference to carrying out extensive repairs, &c. The outside walls still exist and carry the roofs, but the places are now used for the storage of building materials. Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 19 Three Oak Lane closed, instead of complying with the requirements of Sanitary Notices. The houses are still standing. 22 Nos. 1 and 3 Magdalen Street. No. 1 was a small lock-up shop, and No. 3 a shed used for the storage, &c., of building materials; both were demolished, and Messrs. Roberts & Leete's printing works are now extended to cover the sites. In connection with the extension of the Tower Bridge Southern Approach, the following premises have been closed: 57 Artillery Street, Nos. 20 and 26 Church Street, and part of the house No. 24 Church Street; the Electrical Factory and Messrs. Sard's offices, workshops, and rope-walk in Sard's Rents. With the exception of part of the house No. 24 Church Street and part of the Electrical Factory, these properties have all been demolished, and at present no new buildings erected in the place thereof. The extension of the South Eastern Railway in the District has caused the undermentioned premises to be closed : Barnham Street, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 20, 21 and 22. Coxson Place, Nos. 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41,43, 45, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 46, 52, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84 and 86. Firbeck Cottages, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Heath's Rents, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. % Landrail Place, Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16. Great Yard, houses Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and the Schools connected with the Parish Street Chapel. Parish Street, No. 25 and the Chapel. Phoenix Place, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. Shand Street, Nos. 25, 27, 30, and 32. With regard to these, No. 30 has been repaired and re-let, Nos. 25 and 27 have been demolished, and upon the site is now erected a building consisting of a shoeing forge, offices, &c., on the ground floor, and a dwelling house above. 23 Nos. 29, 46, 52, 53 & 55 Coxson Place, and 4, 5 & 6 Landrail Place, are not yet demolished, and if not required later on for the railway extension may be repaired and re-let. House-to-House Inspections. The following house-to-house inspections have been made during the year, and all sanitary defects found have been remedied:— Bethel Place 44 houses. Boss Street 27 premises. Cottage Row 3 houses. Crucifix Lane 5 premises. English Ground 18 „ Great Maze Court 24 houses. Great Yard 3 „ Gibbons Rents 6 „ Lafone Street (part) 11 „ Landrail Place 16 „ Little Maze Court 6 „ Maze Pond (part) 11 „ Morris Court 13 „ New Cottage Row 4 „ Parish Street 17 „ Pickle Herring Street 5 premises. Powells Yard 3 houses. Sards Rents 22 premises. Sarnells Court 5 houses. Shand Street 32 „ Shad Thames 36 premises. Sparricks Row 13 houses Surrey Buildings 14 „ Three Oak Lane (part) 7 „ Tilbury Place 5 Vine Street 6 „ 24 Registered Houses. The following are the houses let in lodgings that have been registered:— Maze Pond, Nos. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 & 18; Lafone Street, Nos. 8, 29 & 31; Gainsford Street, No. 60; Curlew Street, Nos. 1 & 2 ; Morris Court, Nos, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12. The registration of 29 Lafone Street was afterwards withdrawn, as all the previous tenants had notices to quit, and the house is now occupied by members of only one family. Overcrowding, &c., was thus abated. Eight of these houses have been provided with additional water closet accommodation during the year. Bakehouses. The Bakehouses of the District have been twice inspected during the year. One notice was served on the occupier to comply with the Board's regulations. Five of the seven Bakehouses are situated below the ground level. A detailed account of the sanitary work done will be found in Table III. (of the Appendix), prepared by the Sanitary Inspector. Mr. Thomas Ashdown. All the work has been satisfactorily carried out. 25 Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. A summary of the samples that have been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst, and the proceedings taken, will be found in Table IV. Foods Unfit for Human Consumption. One lot of fruit, consisting of oranges, lemons, and cocoa nuts, and weighing together about 1 cwt., were seized while exposed for sale at the entrance to the large blocks of artizans' dwellings known as Vine Street Buildings: the o articles were totally unfit for the food of man, were coney demned and destroyed, and the vendor was afterwards proceeded against, and was fined £3 and ordered to pay 2s. costs. A large quantity of green bacon—namely, 22 tons 10 cwts. 2 qrs. and 3 lbs.—was seized while deposited at Cotton's wharf, and by the courtesy of the magistrate, Mr. Paul Taylor, was seen by him at the wharf, thus saving the Board the trouble and expense of conveying the whole to the police court for his examination. An order for the destruction of the whole was eventually given, and as a means of destruction the meat was sold to a well-known firm of fat boilers; the meat was removed by them to their places of business, and employees of the Board were sent to witness the due execution of the order. d 26 The under-mentioned articles, unfit for the food of man, were given up by the respective owners, and removed by the Board as trade refuse for destruction:— Tons. cwt. qrs. lbs. Eggs (5 lots) 10 10 3 8 Geese and Turkeys (2 lots) — 19 2 26 Grapes — — 2 14 Lobsters — 1 — — Ox Tongues — 2 — — Potatoes 7 6 1 — Tea 9 1 1 21 Tinned Salmon 1 18 3 7 „ Meat — — 3 — 30 1 1 20 Bacon (as mentioned above) 22 10 2 3 Fruit „ „ „ — 1 — — Total 52 12 3 23 Abstract of the Recommendations in the Report oe the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, appointed to enquire into the administrative procedures for controlling danger to man through the use as food of the meat and milk of tuberculous animals. I.—Meat.—It appears desirable that in London the provision of public in substitution for private slaughter-houses should be considered in respect to the needs of London as a whole, and in determining their positions regard must be had for the convenient conveyance of animals by railway 27 from the markets beyond the limits of London, as well as from the Islington market, to the public slaughter-houses which should be provided. At the present time no administrative authority has statutory power authorising it to provide public slaughter-houses other than for the slaughter of foreign cattle at the port of debarcation. Also the general recommendations for Great Britain and Ireland, which may be thus briefly summarized. When any local authority has provided a public slaughterhouse power should be conferred on it to prohibit slaughter in any other place, except that a period of three years be allowed to the owners of existing registered private slaughterhouses to apply their premises to other purposes; also to require all meat brought into the district to be inspected, and reasonable charges made for this inspection. Also that the joints of all carcases passed as sound shall be stamped; and that it shall not be lawful to offer for sale the meat of any animal which has not been killed in a duly licensed slaughter-house. No person is to be permitted to act as a meat inspector until he has passed a qualifying examination; and that the Local Government Board should issue instructions for the guidance of meat inspectors as to the seizure of a carcase or a part thereof. II.—Milk.—That notification of every disease in the udder of cows shall be made compulsory. That powers should be given to Local Authorities for the purpose of excluding from their Districts the milk of cows suffering from 28 tuberculosis of the udder, or exhibiting clinical symptoms of the disease, and to slaughter any such cow; and if it appears that the cow was not so suffering, the Local Authority should pay the full value of the cow immediately before slaughter. Also that Local Authorities should have powers for making analyses for tubercle bacilli in milk sold in their Districts, and in foreign milk at the port of entry. That the Local Government Board should be empowered to require Local Authorities to adopt regulations as to dairies, cow sheds, and milk shops, where it is not already done. III.—Elimination of bovine tuberculosis.—That funds should be placed at the disposal of the Board of Agriculture in England and Scotland, and of the Veterinary Department of the Privy Council in Ireland, for the preparation of tuberculin, and that the gratuitous services of a veterinary surgeon should be offered to stock-owners on condition that the reacting animals are isolated from the healthy ones, and are kept under satisfactory sanitary conditions. That Agricultural Societies should distribute leaflets giving information respecting the above. (A) TABLE I.—In accordance with the Requirements of the Local Government Board.

STMART 71 THE SANITARY CHRONICLES of the PARISH OF ST. MARYLEBONE DURING JANUARY, 1898. BY ALEXANDER WYNTER BLYTH, Medical Officer of Health, and Analyst of Food and Drugs, for the Parish of St. Marylebone. POINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Vol. XVI1I. Court House, St. Marylebone, Feb. 7th, 1898. No. 1. The week ending January 1st was foggy and sunless. The temperature was mild, minimum, 42o.0; maximum, 53°.5; minimum mean, 45°.4.

Winds N.W. and S.W, Mean barometer, 30.4 inches. 2 The five weeks, considered as a whole, were remarkable for their general dullness, the absence of frost, and the small quantity of rain. Births and Deaths. During the five weeks ending January 29th, there have been registered 330 births and 286 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the five sub-districts as set forth in Table IV., 63 of the deaths were extraparochial, as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 40 North-Western Fever Hospital 5 Western Fever Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 1 University Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 1 King's College Hospital 1 Charing Cross Hospital 1 Children's Hospital, Great Ormonde Street 1 Children's Hospital, Paddington 1 Workhouse, Gray's Inn Road 1 Chelsea Infirmary 1 St. Peter's Home, Kennington 1 St. Joseph's Home 1 Banstead Asylum 1 Hanwell Asylum 2 Colney Hatch Asylum 1 Daleham Gardens, South Hampstead 1 Otherwise 1 Total 63 The birth and death rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics, are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 18.8; death-rate 16.8. Rectory, birth-rate 21.0; death-rate 24.1. St. Mary, birth-rate 24.3; death-rate 22.8. Christ Church, birth-rate 26.1; death-rate 20.6. St. John, birth-rate 30.2; death-rate 22.9. The whole district, birth-rate 30.6; death-rate 21.1. The average death-rates for five years (1893 to 1897), for the corresponding five weeks were as follows:—All Souls, 13.7; Rectory, 23.3; St. Mary, 20.2; Christ Church, 27,1; St. John, 19.3; the whole district, 21.2. The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes:— CURVE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CASES NOTIFIED WEEK BY WEEK OF SCARLET FEVER, DIPHTHERIA, AND TYPHOID FEVER DURING 1897. 3 TABLE 1.

Convulsive Diseases of Infants 8 28 0.59 2.18 NOTES. 1, includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough, Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhœa. 3, includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 4, includes Marasmus, Atrophy, Debility, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth. 5, includes Hydrocephalus, Infantile Meningitis, Convulsions, and Teething. Influenza. Notwithstanding the general mildness of the winter, chest complaints generally have been unusually fatal. The average death-rate from bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy for January is about 6 per 1,000 of the population; but January, 1898, shows a death-rate of 7. The causes are partly the thick foggy atmosphere, and partly the presence of a severe type of influenza. 14 deaths are directly ascribed to this cause. How many cases are indicated by the 14 deaths, it is impossible to say in the absence of notification. The influenza appears to be of a somewhat peculiar type ; in its less severe forms it would seem to assume the guise of the familar "cold," but a "cold" of great severity and long persistence. In the more malignant types it assumes much of the character of typhoid 4 fever, and is liable to be confused with that affection. The important fact connected with influenza is that it is in a high degree infectious, and persons suffering should not receive unnecessary visitors, or go into places of public resort. Constant Water Supply. The West Middlesex Water Company by next May will give the whole District a constant service of water. At the present time the only portion without a constant service is situated north of the Marylebone Road—an irregularly shaped area, which may be said roughly to be bounded on the east by Park Road, High Street, St. John's Wood, and a part of Ordnance Road up to the northern boundary; on the west it is bounded by Grove Road, Grove End Road, and Abbey Road. A large number of householders in the area mentioned have been served with notices to provide certain fittings necessary for the constant supply. Underground Rooms. In the case of five underground rooms, situated in Hereford Street, the owners not having complied with the notice, the owners were summoned before the Magistrate, who adjourned the cases on the undertaking of the defendants to get the present tenants out, and to discontinue the illegal occupation. Correction. In the December Report it was stated, through inadvertence, that David Weir was fined under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, whereas it should have been John Spicer, the Agent or Manager of David Weir. 5 TABLE II.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.

Containing a Quarterly Summary of the Mortality Statistics for the Quarter ending June 25th, 1898, and the Quarterly Statement of Analytical Work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, &c. BY ALEXANDER WYNTER BLYTH, Medical Officer of Health, and Analyst of Food and Drugs, for the Parish of St. Marylebone. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Vol. XVIII.

A summons was taken out against the owner of Nos. 97 and 99, Princess Street, but the work having been completed before the hearing the summons was withdrawn. The owner of No. 9, Nightingale Street was summoned for disobedience to a Vestry notice, requiring new drainage and general repair of No. 9, Nightingale Street. The Magistrate gave an order for the notice to be carried out and the premises in the meantime to be closed. Cleansing of Persons Act. Owing to various circumstances, the Cornish boiler, the new baths, and the auxiliary disinfecting apparatus, have not yet been fixed up near the shelter. During June 337 males availed themselves of the purifying and disinfecting facilities at present existing. The total number of bathers from March 2nd to the 30th of June is 1,055. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The structures at the rear of Nos. 17 and 19, Rurne Street, referred to in the Report for May, have been ordered by the Stipendiary Magistrate to be closed. It has been suggested that a scheme might be made under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, to deal with some of the more insanitary parts of the Parish. The Sanitary Committee agree with the writer that such scheme may with advantage be for the present postponed, for the simple reason that such successive clearances and improvements have taken place in the Parish during the past ten years, that it may be confidently hoped this improvement year by year will continue, without putting into force the large powers of confiscation the Local Authority possess under the Act. It must be remembered that the Act only recognises an interest of 21 years or above, hence an owner possessing a term short of 21 years may be entirely disregarded, this in many cases is so unjust, that a scheme should not be lightly undertaken. Much good may on the other hand be effected in detail by closing individual houses as in the cases above enumerated. CURVE SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CASES NOTIFIED WEEK BY WEEK OF SCARLET FEVER, DIPHTHERIA, AND TYPHOID FEVER DURING 1898. (JANUARY JUNE.) 67 THE LABORATORY. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The usual analyses have been made under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts ; there has, however, been a difference in procedure. Owing to the fact that the Inspectors charged with the duty of taking samples have each been for some time working in their respective districts, and are therefore well known, it was considered advisable to change their area of operations. Each Inspector therefore collects samples in another Inspector's district. So far this proceeding has not resulted in the detection of any greater amount of adulteration than before. During the last quarter only two samples were found to be adulterated. In the one case a sample of milk was returned as diluted 7%. No prosecution was instituted, the solicitor having carefully considered all the facts of the case and not advising proceedings. In the second case, G. Bailey of Saville Street was fined 20s. and 12s. (3d. costs, for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 27%. The cool summer has resulted in a considerable diminution in the use of preservatives, such as boracic acid and others to milk and butter. Water. The analyses of water have been continued and are detailed, page 76. The water supply was better for J une than for May. 68 TABLE 11.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST.
