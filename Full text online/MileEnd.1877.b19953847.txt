REPORT The Vestry, in presenting their Annual Report for the year ending the 25th March, 1878, think that they cannot better shew how the members are endeavouring to efficiently carry out the ever-increasing duties which they consider are cast upon them, than by a comparison of the number of Meetings and attendances during the past year with those of former vears. In the following; Table, therefore, is shown the average number of members attending the Vestry Meetings, and the number of such Meetings and Committee Meetings during the past year and the three preceding years. Meetings. Year 1874-5. Year 1875-6. Year 1876-7. Year 1877-8. Vestry 20 21 23 22 Standing Committees 82 77 76 90 Special Committees 16 2 21 48 Totals 118 100 120 160 Largest attendance at any Vestry Meeting. 72 62 83 73 Smallest ditto 29 42 43 46 Average number at tending 50.1 50.5 59.2 58 8 It is unnecessary to comment further upon the figures given, as they speak for themselves. It might scorn, however, that, as the Vestry Meetings have not increased in proportion to the number of the Committee Meetings, the Vestry had delegated powers to the Committees to act, but, as a rule, such is not the case, for the Vestry meet the extra work by considerably increasing the length of each sitting, rather than by increasing the number of sittings. In consequence of the great number of Public Bills which affect the interest of local government, now annually introduced into Parliament, the Vestry considered it necessary to appoint another Standing Committee (called the Parliamentary Committee), expressly to investigate the scope of Bills presented to Parliament. During the Session of 1877 the Committee considered and reported upon many, and suggested amendments therein; and the Vestry having communicated with the Members for the Borough, in many cases obtained their support, and had the pleasure of seeing their suggestions adopted in the Bills. The present Session promises to bo a very important one, if questions on Foreign politics do not take up too much of the time of Parliament, for Bills have been, or will be, introduced on the following subjects, viz.:— Metropolitan Management and Building Acts Amendment Bill. Valuation of Property. Epping Forest. Highways. County Government. Constitution of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Metropolis Water Supply. Metropolis Waterworks Purchase. besides many others. 9 The Vestry feel that it is their duty to protect the principle of local self-government, and to oppose the centralizing tendencies which they are sorry to say are very prominent in most of the measures introduced. They accordingly petition Parliament against the Bill in every case where the principle is threatened. The Vestry are sorry to have to report that during the year there have been several very heavy storms which have caused the flooding of the basements of many of the houses in the Hamlet, but of those in the Centre Ward in particular. The remedy for the evil does not rest with the Vestry but with the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Vestry have accordingly made strong representations to that Board on the subject. Before that Board can proceed in the matter, it will be necessary to apply to Parliament for further powers, but the Vestry hope that this will be done ere long and the evil abated. The Vestry have considered it within the scope of their duties, as representatives of the ratepayers, to take some steps with regard to the Whitechapel Hay Market, which, in the opinion of the Vestry, is an obstruction to the traffic going westward from this Hamlet and other east-end parishes, and ought not to be allowed longer to remain. They, accordingly, after consulting the wishes of several of the adjoining parishes, memorialized the Metropolitan Board of Works for its removal, and supported the memorial by a deputation. The subject has been referred to the Solicitor to the Board for him to report upon, and matters are, 10 fore, at a standstill until he presents his Report, but the Vestry cannot but congratulate themselves on the fact that, since the presentation of the memorial, a very marked change has taken place in the market arrangements, whereby the facilities for traffic have been immensely increased. If the Metropolitan Board should deem the removal of the market desirable, Parliamentary powers to enable them to proceed, would, no doubt, be required. In August of last year the Vestry received from the Metropolitan Hoard of Works, in the usual way, notice of an application by Mr. Knight, to build upon Trafalgar Square, White Horse Lane. The Vestry, having regard to the facts (1) that large sums of public money are being expended to preserve open spaces in the Metropolis, and (2) that what is now within the enclosure, was, a few years since, part of the public highway, resolved to stop any building operations and to restore to the highway the part which they say has been wrongfully enclosed. They accordingly served notices on the owners and parties interested, requiring them to pull down the railings, and to restore the place to the state in which it was prior to the present railings being erected, and fixing a time at which the Vestry would them selves proceed with the demolition, in default of the other persons proceeding. The result of this has been that the parties claiming the Square have taken proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, to restrain the Vestry from carrying out their threat. It is, of course, impossible to forecast the result, but whatever it may 11 be, the Vestry deemed that they were bound to act as they did, and are confident that the parishioners will support them in their view. The Vestry have not yet taken into their own hands the work of dusting and slopping, but they anticipate doing so at Michaelmas. Mr. Gardner's contract for horse hire has been continued on the same terms as the last, but Mr. Rollinson contracted to remove the dust, &c., for six months, from the 25th March, 1877, for £800, and for the following six months for £1000, which effected the reduction on the previous year of £250. As part of the arrangements necessary for carrying out the work of slopping and dusting, the Vestry purchased the leasehold premises called Riga Wharf, Emmott Street, held by Mr. Williams, for a term of which forty-seven years remained unexpired, at a rental of £120 per annum, for the sum of £1000, and made the necessary arrangements for building stables, &c., thereon. Subsequent to their doing this, the Vestry received notice to quit, at Midsummer next, the Wharf at Bridge Street, which the Vestry have rented some years. This has made a considerable alteration of arrangements necessary, as it is very desirable for the Vestry to have a wharf for the purpose of unloading barges bringing the stone, &c., required by the Vestry, and for the stacking of such stone; and the Vestry accordingly determined to use Riga Wharf for that purpose, and to obtain other premises for the stables, &c.. required for the purposes of the dusting and slopping. 12 This they have succeeded in doing in Canal Road, where they have taken premises of Mr. Johnson, on lease for a term of seventy years, at a rental of £180 per annum. As the Vestry do not at present require the house and shop attached to the last-mentioned premises, they will let it, and anticipate obtaining a rental of at least £50 per annum. In order to purchase the necessary plant for dusting and slopping, and making the premises at Riga Wharf and Canal Road suited for the purposes for which they were purchased, the Vestry have borrowed the sum of £6000 from the Star Life Office, the amount to be repaid in six years. The Vestry have resolved to affect an improvement in Diamond Row, by purchasing No. 1, Claremont Place, and widening the road, and thereby an additional thoroughfare via Jamaica Street, from the Mile End Road to the Commercial Road, will be obtained. The Metropolitan Board, will, no doubt, contribute a moiety of the expenses. The various works on the roads, sewers, &c,, of the Hamlet, and the health of the inhabitants, will be found fully reported on by the officers, to whose departments the subjects respectively appertain in their Reports, appended hereto, and the Vestry invite a careful consideration of these Reports. A List of the Contracts entered into will be found in the Abstract of Accounts. The Metropolitan Board of Works have made orders 13 for abolishing the subsidiary names in and re-numbering Coborn Road, and for re numbering Antill Road. The Vestry have also paved and made up several streets at the expense of the owners or occupiers. The Vestry has had to put in motion the powers conferred upon them by the Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1868, in a few cases, but in all of them arrangements have been, or, doubtless, will be, come to, whereby the insanitary condition will be remedied without the necessity of putting in force the ultimate powers conferred by the Act. The Vestry now come to what, in many persons' opinion, is the most important part of the Report, namely, a statement of the cost of the things done. If rumour be true, the Vestry fear that many ratepayers have already made up their minds that the Vestry are largely increasing their expenditure, and these conclusions are based on the fact that the rates have increased rather than decreased of late. The Vestry, therefore, are very pleased indeed to have an opportunity of clearly shewing that these conclusions are altogether erroneous. In the first place, the poor rate has been 2s. 5d. in the £, as against 2s. 1d. in 1876, and 2s. 2d. in 1877. In the poor rate, as is no doubt generally known, is included the rate for the Asylums' Board, the Police Kate, and others, over which the Vestry have no control. In fact, beyond fixing the rate according to the actual requirements, the Vestry have really nothing to do with the poor rate. 14 The General Rate has been 1s. 9d. in the £ „ Lighting „ 0 3 „ £ „ Sewers' „ 0 2 „ £ Making a total of 2 2 „ £ As the Vestry has before pointed out, on more than one occasion, the School Board Rate has, under the Act of Parliament, to be collected in the general rate. Now the policy of the School Board, at all events, as regards expenditure, has not undergone any change, as the following statement shows:— The Precepts of the School Board, since its institution, received by this Vestry, have been as under. Year 1871 Amount <£536 17s. 3d. „ 1872 „ 1001 8 10 „ 1873 „ 827 17 2 „ 1874 „ 1989 3 10 „ 1875 „ 3496 6 11 „ 1876 „ 5335 17 3 „ 1877 „ 6468 17 10 „ 1878 „ 6486 12 2 Shewing (except in the year 1873) a continually increasing tendency. 15 The Precept of the School Board for the year 1878, represents, including the expenses of collection, a rate of 5½d, in the £, and if that be taken from the 2s. 2d. before mentioned, it will leave an amount of 1s. 8½d. in the £ wherewith the Vestry has carried out the works under its control, kept down the interest on its loans, and repaid the instalments thereof punctually as they became due. The actual amount expended by the Vestry in works, &c., over which it has absolute control, compares favorably with the preceding three years, when the amounts so expended were— 1875 1s. 8d. in the £ 1876 1 8 „ £ 1877 18 „ £ 1878 1 8½ „ £ The Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works have not, for the last three years, exhibited any great fluctuation, the Precepts having been— 1876 £6091 1s. 9d. 1877 5986 1 8 1878 6166 9 0 The Vestry are pleased to be able to report that the Accounts for the year ending the 25th March last were submitted to the Auditors and duly audited, vouched, and allowed, without objection being raised by any one to a single item. 16 The Abstract of the Accounts, as certified by the Auditors, pursuant to the Statute, is printed with this Report.

Dated this 14th day of May, 1878. WILLIAM S. GRATWICK, HENRY EMBLEM, THOMAS E. GARDINER, JOHN TAYLOR, AUDITORS. REPORT of THE SURVEYOR to THE VESTRY of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. 1878. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in again giving an account of the various works undertaken in my department during the year which has just terminated. roads. One of the most important duties which devolves upon me is the repairs of the various highways under your control, and I am able to refer to the work of the year with considerable satisfaction. Every road which has been coated with granite, and many which have been gravelled, have been rolled by steam power. This rolling not only renders the surface of a road fit for the passage of vehicles, immediately after the work is completed, thus saving considerable wear upon vehicles and horses, but it makes the surface so fair and even that it would be impossible to obtain the same result were the traffic permitted to grind the granite into its bed, as in the old method, thus saving the trituration of the stone and at once putting it with all the angles sharp into its proper bed. It likewise makes a road which will last longer than one formed by trituration. The Vestry had the opportunity of purchasing from the Beverley Iron Company a fifteen ton steam roller, made by Messrs. Aveling & Porter, for the sum of £400. This machine had been supplied to the Corporation of Buda, Pesth, in Hungary, and had only been at work nine times, as the surface of the roads at Pesth were insufficient 38 to carry its weight, the sub-soil being loose sand. This roller has been at work thirteen days and a hired roller 102 days. The total cost of working the two has been £241 4s. 2d. The vehicular traffic in the Hamlet increases from year to year, and your Roads Committee have now under their consideration the advisability of paving certain of the main thoroughfares, but I regret to know that you have recently declined to adopt their recommendation to complete the paving of Devonshire Street, a place of considerable heavy Traffic to and from the Devonshire Street Goods Station. The carriageway paving in the portion of the Commercial and Mile End Roads, kept in repair by you, remain in good condition, and have not required any repair from actual wear, except the piece lying between the western boundary in the Commercial Road, as arranged with St. Georgo's Vestry, and Bromhead Street, on the north side of the road. This piece of road was paved by the Tramways Company, and was work which they had to do for St. George's Vestry, under the Tramway Act. The pitching laid was fourinch by six-inch Rowley stone, and it has worn so badly that it will bo necessary shortly to replace it with better material. I called attention to this matter in my Report of last year, but since that time the part referred to has, notwithstanding occasional attention and repair, become very much worse. During the year a number of important crossings in carriageways have been paved, and much of the old tram stone removed from the Commercial Road has been re-dressed and laid in lines parallel to the foot traffic. A large number of other places are under consideration, and your Committee will present a Report 39 embracing all the crossings which they think it necessary to pave in the Hamlet. footways. In the course of the year a large number of footways (but of small extent), have been paved. The quantity of material laid has been 10,800 feet of Yorkshire paving and 7,779 feet of Victoria patent stone. This last-named material is found to answer exceedingly well. It has the advantages of looking very nice, the surface and joints being equal to rubbed paving; the colour is light grey, and the price is low, 9½d. per foot laid. In my humble opinion there should be no footway within four miles of St. Paul's which is not paved. The Vestry have paved and made up the following streets and footpaths, at the cost of the owners of property situate therein. Part of Emmott Street, west side of South Grove, St. Paul's Road, Mountford Street, Lincoln Street, Maplin Street, and Harford Street. These works have, in every case, been executed under contract. The other footways in the Hamlet are those laid with asphalte and those which are repaired with hoggin. The half-inch asphalte laid in Mile End Road by the Val de Travers Asphalte Company continues to wear badly, and during the year it has cost £112 17s. 6d. to replace it with new material. The one-inch powdered rock asphalte laid by the same Company wears well and has not cost anything for repairs since it was laid. The one-inch mastic asphalte laid by the Society Franacis des Asphalte wears well and has not cost anything for repairs yet. The unpaved footways in the 40 Mile End Road became, in the summer and autumn of last year, the scene of most disgraceful proceedings on the part of a number of squatters, who erected bowlingalleys. This was brought about by the fact becoming known that negotiations between the Lord of the Manor and the Vestry for acquiring the so-called waste, had broken through. Ultimately you gave me an indemnity against any proceedings which might bo taken against me in respect of any act. which I might do in removing these obstructions, and I have ever since summarily removed any nuisances of the sort which have been brought upon the footways. slopping. This work has been executed as heretofore by men in your own employ and hired horses. For some portion of the year the road sweepings and slop had to bo removed by barges from your wharf, and this cost 2s. 7d. per yard cube in addition to the cost of collection. A largo portion of the material was taken to the Groat Eastern Railway Station at Devonshire Street, where the Vestry load it into railway trucks, and the remaining portion was taken to a shoot at How, where 10d. per load is paid for being permitted to shoot. It will be readily seen that any arrangement for shooting or removing material is more advantageous to the Vestry than removing the slop by barge. The cost of the work for the year is set out in the following statement:— 41 THE COST OF DISPOSING OF STREET REFUSE HAS BEEN AS FOLLOWS:— 1876. 1877. 1878. £ s. d. £ S. d. £ s. d.

The large increase in the cost of railway carriage was not owing to any work of the year, but was owing to the accumulation of heavy stuff of former years, which had to be taken away, while the Vestry were not deriving any advantage from the railway system. The Vestry propose keeping a number of horses of their own for this work, and if they be prudently managed I anticipate a saving on this head during the coming year. Removal of dust. The dust, ashes, and house-refuse, has been removed from the houses and factories in the Hamlet by Mr. Rollinson, under contract, and the cost for the year has been £1800. A Committee is now sitting who are making arrangements for you to collect the dust by your own carts and men. I have no doubt that, by this means, the refuse will be more frequently removed from the poorer parts of the Hamlet, but I cannot see any possibility of saving money by adopting the plan, as you have no means of sifting and sorting the dust, and thus obtaining the proper price from brick makers for the breeze. You must sell it rough as collected, and in this form it is not likely to produce much, while the whole cost of collection will fall upon you. 44 Watering. Some hydrants were fixed in the autumn of last year upon the unpaved footways in Mile End Road, extending from Eagle Place to Cambridge Road. These were intended for watering the road and footway, and specially for washing away any snow which might fall during the winter months. I find that the traffic of the road is too great for them to be generally used for that purpose, but that they are admirably adapted for watering the wide unpaved footway, and their use must have been a great boon to the houses of business in this part of the road. During the year the water carts and waggons were employed eighty-one days at a cost of £798 2s. 6d. for horses and drivers, and of £334 8s. 6d. for 7,966,000 gallons of water supplied by the East London Water Company. Tramways. The condition of the tramway in the Mile End Road is anything but satisfactory. The Company having charge of it have re-laid a length equal to 400 yards of single line, with new steel rails, sleepers, and pitching during the year, but much remains still to be done, and while a single rail of the old pattern remains the road cannot be in a satisfactory state. The Commercial Road, Burdett and Grove Roads, now begin to show symptoms of wear, but in these cases it is only a matter of re-laying and re-dressing the paving to make the roads as good, or nearly so, as they were when first constructed. 45 Lighting. The public lamps, 857 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted and cleaned by the Commercial Gas Company, and the cost for the year has been £3685 17s. 7d. Eighteen of these lamps have been erected and fitted during the year sewers. The only important work executed under this head is the demolition of the old sewer lying in the rear of the houses in Cambridge Heath Road. The centre of this sewer is the boundary between this Hamlet and the Parish of Bethnal Green, and the work has been executed at the joint cost of the two districts. It was a tedious and expensive work, as in numerous cases the sewer, which was only a covered ditch, passed under out-buildings and factories, which had to be supported and the work done in such a manner as not to interfere with the businesses of the occupiers. I am pleased to say that this portion of the work is completed as far as Railway Place, and that not a single claim for damage or compensation has been made, and this, I think, reflects credit upon Mr. Finch, the contractor, to whose tact and forbearance this fact is mainly due. The following Table will shew the quantity of each description of sewer constructed during the year:— 15-inch pipe 76 feet. 12 „ 160 Cambridge Heath Road. 529 feet run of brick sewer. 46 Sixteen new gullies have been constructed during the year. Sixty-two houses have been connected with the sewers during the year. During the year 100 cubic yards of soil has been removed from the sewers, and 215 yards from gullies. The Vestry have erected an additional public convenience at Beaumont Street, and have replaced the old one at the end of Cleveland Street in Mile End Road, with one of modern construction, made ot slate and iron. These were supplied and erected by Messrs. Macfarlane, of Glasgow, and cost the sum of £114 19s. 3d. The Vestry have taken proceedings against the owners of property in Bridge Street, East, and Little Bridge Street, under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, and the duty of reporting upon the houses thus condemned as unfit for human habitation, of prescribing the remedies, of preparing plans, specifications, and estimates, and of seeing that the works are satisfactorily carried out, devolves upon me, and I desire to say a good word for this Act of Parliamant, which has, whenever put in force in this district, worked well. Its process is a little tedious, and while it gives the owners of property ample opportunity of appealing against what may thought to be an act of oppression on the part of the Vestry or its Officers, it compels the proper construction, alteration, and repair of the habitations of the poorer classes, who, for want of means, are too often compelled to live in places so constructed, that the very fact of their being occupied is enough to produce disease. 46A ROAD MATERIALS.
