Gentlemen, I beg to submit a summary of works, &c., carried out under the superintendence of the above Department during the year ending the 25th March, 1890. MAINTENANCE OF ROADS. The following quantities of materials were supplied by the Contractors and Guardians at the cost stated, and used on the Macadam and ballast roads in the parish during the year:— £ s. d. 949½ yards cube Broken Granite 674 15 3 28 ,, ,, Granite Siftings 4 12 0 232¾ ,, ,, Flints 70 16 9 162½ ,, ,, Ballast 46 0 10 425¾„ ,, Hoggin 120 12 7 During the year 588 cubic yards of old pebbles, York, etc., were broken up, costing £58 9s. 5d., and loaded and carted for repairing the roads at a further cost of about £73 10s. lOd. One foreman and seven laborers on an average were employed in the yard, and on the general repairs of the unpaved roads and over trenches opened by the Gas and Water Companies ; their wages 48 for the year amounted to £438 7s. 3d. The sum of £3 13s. 6d. was also paid for watchman's wages. The companies contributed £46 4s. 4½d. for labour (exclusive of foreman's time) and £138 17s. 3½d. for material required in the said repairs. In consequence of the use of the Steam Roller the unpaved roads are, generally speaking, in a satisfactory condition. Those requiring attention are enumerated hereafter. STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The Steam Road Roller having been at work nearly 10 years, and requiring considerable repairs, the Vestry decided to replace it by a new one of improved design by Messrs. Aveling & Porter, Rochester, at the cost of £400, less £145 14s. Od. allowed for the old Roller taken in exchange. The new Roller arrived at the yard on the 9th of April. The Roller was at work 255 days during the past year, and about 10 men on average, under the direction of the road foreman, were employed in scoring, rolling, sweeping and watching the highways under repair. The amount expended in labour was £559 l1s. 8½d. The following Table gives the roads that have been rolled, together with the cost of same, and other details:— 44 LOCALITY.

Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1890. 65 SAINT LEONARD, SHOKEDITCH. LIGHTING DEPARTMENT. Gentlemen, I beg to present the following report and tables showing the work done by this department, and the operation of the Average Meter System during the twelfth year. The price of gas supplied to the public lamps during the year was 2s. 2d. per 1000 cubic feet. The total amount paid for gas, lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, repairs, painting, and maintenance of meters and governors for the year, including 254 improved lamps of increased illuminating power, fixed at refuges and positions where more light was required is £5,534 4s. Od., being £269 17s. more than last year. This is due to additional lamps being fixed, and the increased consumption of gas in the lamps fixed the latter part of last year. The average cost per ordinary lamp for the year was £2 17s. l½d. 14 new ordinary lamps have been fixed and put in lighting, and 6 18inch lamps during the year, 10 discontinued, 22 removed to more favourable positions, and 2 increased from 4.6 feet per hour to 8 feet per hour. One new refuge and column has been erected in Haggerston road by Lee street and fitted with a hundred candle power lamp. The total number of lamps in use is 1648: 1394 of which are 14 inch ordinary lamps fitted with governors regulated to consume 4.6 feet per hour; 4 regulated to consume 6.9 feet per hour; 126 regulated to 66 consume 8 feet per hour; 23 regulated to consume 12 feet per hour; 64 18-inch Victoria lamps regulated to consume 15 feet per hour; 3 regulated to consume 16 feet per hour; 1 60-candle power lamp consuming 20 feet per hour; 4 80-candle power lamps consuming 24 feet per hour ; 3 consuming 30 feet per hour; 24 100-candle power consuming 33 feet per hour, 1 180-candle power consuming 50 feet per hour, and 1 200-candie power consuming 58 feet per hour. The annual cost of gas, lighting and maintenance of 12 lamps under railway arches, and 3 in Great Eastern Street amounting to £44 4s. has been paid by the North London Railway Company and the owners of three lamps in Great Eastern Street.

Gentlemen, During the past year 4,543 births—2,323 males and 2,220 females—and 2,882 deaths were registered in this Parish. Deducting 448 deaths of non-residents, which occurred in the Public Institutions situated in this Parish, and bodies found in the Canal, the death rate was 19.22 per 1,000 living—that is, 1.36 per 1,000 below the average of the last five years.

There were 418 deaths from bronchitis, 270 from phthisis, and 149 from pneumonia, making a total of 837 deaths registered under the above headings as against 701 in the previous year; 705 deaths occurred under one year of age, against 703 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age were 1,076 against 1,121 in the previous year. 400 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age and upwards, as against 363 in the previous year, viz.:—225 from 65 to 75, 151 from 75 to 85, 24 from 85 to 95. In the previous year 213 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age, 124 from 75 to 85, and 26 from 85 to 95. In childhood (from 1 to 5 years) the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease, comprising 163 from bronchitis, 70 from pneumonia, and 14 from congestion of the lungs, &c. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility 163 deaths, convulsions 77, whooping cough 73, premature birth 78, and diarrhœa 94. From the age of 55 and upwards, 181 deaths were caused by bronchitis, 76 by heart disease, and 20 by paralysis; 86 were registered under the term of old age. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 317 deaths, viz.:—21 by scarlet fever, 10 by enteric, 10 by diphtheria, 24 by measles, 76 by whooping cough, 105 by diarrhoea, and 71 by other zymotic diseases. 77 Of the 70 deaths from whooping cough, 25 occurred in infants under one year of age, and 19 in infants between one and two years of age. Of the 105 deaths from diarrhoea, 89 occurred in infants under two years of age. DISINFECTION.—This has been carefully attended to in all instances of infectious diseases. 672 houses were disinfected; the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently the windows kept open to expose the rooms freely to the oxydising influence of the open air. The walls of the rooms, where necessary, were stripped and otherwise cleansed. At the disinfecting oven 5298 articles were disinfected. The Sanitary Officer, Inspector Lear, reports that he has been able to secure the removal of 277 of the infected sick to the Asylums, and that he has generally experienced little difficulty in obtaining their removal. Inspector Alexander reports that in 1845 premises conditions dangerous to health were found, and notices served requiring their abatement. Much has been done to promote the health of the Parish, during this year, more than in any previous year; more nuisances dangerous to health have been abated; this is briefly indicated in Inspector Alexander's report of the various improvements which have been made. It is evidenced thereby, that a great deal has been done to render dwellings more suitable for health. Some of the alterations were of a structural character. For instance, to remove damp and other dangerous conditions, 140 roofs were repaired; 582 drains were repaired or replaced; 7 cesspools were discovered in the year, and abolished. It may here he mentioned that cesspools have mostly been eradicated, but they are now and then still found. A great deal of attention has again been given for several years past to securing the inhabitants improved closet accommodation—i.e., structures better fitted, more cleanly and with proper water supply. 1083 closets were thus cleansed and repaired, and water supply was restored or newly laid on in 1009 closets. 78 Much care in inspection has been given to prevent sewage gases entering basement rooms and bed-chambers, and thus in 432 premises the waste pipes of kitchen sinks were securely trapped, or their connection with the drain entirely cut oft'; and rain-water pipes have also been disconnected from the drains in 394 premises, to prevent tbe sewage gas entering bedrooms. Further evidence of the large amount of work done is shewn by the fact that the yards of 1,003 premises have been paved, to prevent dampness in houses; it is indispensable for health to keep the earth under and around the dwellings dry and sweet, for dryness promotes porousness and freshness, and by enabling air to circulate through the surface earth, and so disinfect it by oxidation, and destroy any organic products that might accumulate and become poisonous. Your Vestry is well aware that there is a very large number of small old houses in Shoreditch which require very much attention from year to year, to keep them moderately fit for human habitation; a great many such dwellings have been pulled down, and their number has been much diminished during this year; but it is usually found, when such premises are re-visited after a year or two, that action is again called for, to abate recurring nuisances, and in these and similar small dwellings a long list of conditions, more or less dangerous to health, might be made out, from time to time, as requiring immediate attention from the Sanitary Officer, and that was done by the Mansion House Council Inspector in the beginning of the year, in which 1,045 premises were thus reported to your Medical Officer. Subsequently most of the premises complained of were carefully examined by Inspector Alexander, and dealt with as their condition required. The notices from the Mansion House Council called your Medical Officer's attention to 1,916 nuisances alleged to be injurious to health. 997 of these nuisances were due to closets having no water supply, or a defective water supply; 376 to defective dust bins; in 123 premises there were no dust bins; in 220 premises the pavement of yards was defective. To shew that these complaints had been promptly as possible dealt with, it is enough to mention that in January, out of 1045, 009 had been attended to, and the nuisances abated. 79 I may here remark that every year, and for several years past, many notices have been served requiring the owners of such dwellings to provide a supply of water to the closets. In previous years these closets were hand flushed; but merely throwing water down from time to time resulted in much fœcal accumulation, and experience from year to year left no doubt in the mind of the Sanitary Committee that such a practice could not be relied on to keep the closets clean. It was therefore decided, wherever a closet was found to have no constant water supply, that the Sanitary Inspector should call upon the owners to provide such supply with as little delay as possible. But whilst that has been done for several years past, many closets are yet found to be without a constant water supply. Inspector Alexander further refers to the old dwellings, Nos. 13 to 21, Goldsmith Square (or more familiarly called Piges Island). It has been my duty on several occasions in past years to visit these premises, and recommend your Vestry to call upon the owners to cleanse and repair them. It was considered at that time the houses could be so made fit for habitation, but my attention was this year called to them, and I was obliged to report that they were unfit for human habitation, and that many of them could not be made fit, but should be pulled down. The Sanitary Committee subsequently visited these premises, and advised your Vestry to call the attention of the freeholders to the Medical Officer's Report, and to express to the owners that, in the opinion of the Sanitary Authority, these houses could not be made fit and kept fit for habitation, and therefore ought to be pulled down. On the receipt of this representation from your Vestry, the owners decided to demolish these houses, and that has been done. The dwellings, Nos. .52, 54, 56, 58, GO, 62, 64, 66, Dove Row, similar old structures, have also been closed by order of your Vestry. These dwellings will be familiar to the mind of the Sanitary Authority as having been, on various occasions, reported to be injurious to health; and I may here add, that there are many other houses in the neighbourhood which your Medical Officer finds that he will be obliged to bring under the notice of your Vestry, with a view of bringing about their demolition. 80 These old houses have been let out on leases, and it has been considered most serviceable for many years past to allow the leaseholders to make sanitary improvements from time to time, but it is now evident that such a course can no longer be followed, it would be detrimental to the health of the parish. ARTIZANS LABORERS DWELLINGS IMPROVEMENT ACTS. Some years ago your Medical Officer reported to the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the Artizans Laborers Dwellings Improvement Acts (spoken of as Cross' Act) that the dwellings of Ware Street, Louisa Street, Nancy Street and Watson's Place, were unfit for human habitation, and should be demolished under an improvement scheme; the same report included Reform Place, Jane Shore Court, Moira Place and Plumber's Place. The Metropolitan Board did not order the houses to be demolished, but when the London County Council took over the Municipal Government, a communication was sent to your Vestry referring to these reports, and the Medical Officer was directed to report on the existing condition of the dwellings. Consequently I re-visited them and reported their condition, and also what had been done since the report was primarily forwarded to the Metropolitan Board. The houses of Reform Place had been demolished by the Vestry's decision, the houses on the south side of Jane Shore Court were also demolished under Vestry's notices; and the houses of Watson's Place were closed and kept closed until, by sanitary alterations, they were rendered fit for habitation. The London County Council subsequently took into consideration the amended report, but ultimately decided that the area was not of sufficient Metropolitan importance to be dealt with under Cross' Act, but they held out a hope that the Council might see their way to deal with the houses of Ware Street, Watson's Place and Nancy Street, under the Metropolitan Building Acts, as dilapidated structures. Those dwellings have back yards, and a fair amount of ventilation back and front, but they have been constructed of such inferior, worthless materials, that no repairs or cleansing can make and keep them tit for human habitation. 81 Moira Place and Plumber's Place the Council decided should be dealt with under Torrens' Act; but as I have reported to your Vestry, to merely pull down these dwellings under Torrens' Act, would be to leave two vacant pieces of ground, both of which would be too small for proper houses or even cottages to be built upon. Recognising that the Medical Officer of Health was led to examine other houses in the immeliate neighbourhood of Plumber's Place and Provost Street, including some old houses in East Road, which bad no back yards, and no place for proper closet accommodation, nor for dust bins. These houses are old structures, and much decayed; therefore the Plumber's Place Area report was extended to make a more efficient improvement scheme; and Moira Place area was also extended; many old dccayed houses in Ebeuezer Street, Britannia Street and Provost Street, being also included in the report so amended, was forwarded to the London County Council under Cross' Act. Your Vestry is aware that the question as to the best manner of procedure to get these houses demolished was referred by the London County Council to the Home Secretary, and that he appointed an arbitrator under the 5th Sec. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, to visit these areas, and to hear evidences on the part of the Central and the Local Authority, with a view to reporting to the Home Secretary, what in his judgment should be done with these areas. It was agreed that the dwellings of Plumber's Place and Moira Place are unfit for habitation and should be demolished; but the Arbitrator has to report to the Home Secretary whether tbe proceedings should be taken under Cross' Act, and the Metropolis bear the cost, or whether the Metropolis shall contribute partly to the cost, or whether the improvement is to be effected by the Vestry under Torrens' Act. "INFECTIOUS DISEASE (NOTIFICATION) ACT." The Infectious Disease Registration Act came into operation in October of 1889, and up to the 25th March, 1890, 499 cases were reported by the Medical Attendants, under this Act, to the Sanitary Department. Of this number 311 were cases of scarlet fever, 83 of diphtheria, and 18 of typhoid fever. 225 of the infected persons were removed to the Asylums for isolation and medical treatment. In the previous year only 97 were 82 thus removed: the number has therefore increased, but the increase is not in proportion to the additional number of cases reported; but that is only what might be expected, considering that many of the infected persons do not belong to tbe pauper class, and that their house accommodation is large enough to permit of them being isolated ta home. Where there is such accommodation and isolation practicable, the Sanitary Officer has to see that the rooms (one or more according to their condition) are properly cleansed and disinfected, and to the disinfection of the infected bedding and other articles; and he has to inspect the premises to see if the drainage is defective, and if there be any accumulation of decomposing organic matters, which would tend to give rise to infectious diseases; to examine if the water supply and closet arrangements are suitable to health, and if there be sufficient lighting and ventilation in dwellings, or any overcrowding. It is obvious that in the working of this Act much judgment and tact is required to induce reasonable precautions being taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and to secure the premises and bedding being properly disinfected. The operation of this Act will afford the Medical Officer of Health much valuable information as to the prevalence of infectious diseases, and what localities and what unhealthy conditions promote the occurence and spread of such disease in the parish. I regret that I have to report that the returns issued weekly by the Asylums Board shew that in the Autumn of last year Scarlet Fever was more prevalent in Shoreditch than in many other of the Metropolitan Parishes ; and the returns of some weeks shewed that there were more cases in Shoreditch than in any other parish, with one or two exceptions. But when the number of cases reported from each parish was considered, with the respective population of the parishes, then Shoreditch contrasts more favourably : it manifests that in proportion to the population, Shoreditch did not on the whole compare unfavourably. Nevertheless, I cannot overlook that in this and in previous epidemics of Scarlet Fever this parish has suffered severely, and similarly with Small-pox epidemics. Undoubtedly there are unhealthy 83 conditions that promote in an exceptional degree the spread of infectious disease. One of these conditions, and it might be contended the most potent, is the densely crowded state of the parish, from returns supplied, with the exception of Westminster, there are more persons per acre in Shoreditch than in any parish of the Metropolis. The figures here given shew the relative position of each parish as regards the number of inhabitants. Parish. Enumerated Population 1881. Density of Persons per acre.

THE SCAVENGING OPERATIONS.—It was, therefore, with pleasure that your Medical Officer learned that the Vestry had resolved to make other arrangements for the removal of the dust and for the cleansing and watering of the streets ; arrangements that will enable the Officers of the Vestry to take more efficient measures, and be more responsible for the proper removal of the refuse. That much has to be done to improve the drainage cannot be disputed, both as regards the sewers and the house drains ; yet year by year more energy is being brought to deal with that difficulty. THE CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY continues to work well, and comparatively little attention is called for as regards the water supply for drinking purposes; but much more water is needed to keep the closets clean and to flush the sewers and cleanse the streets. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY GAWEN SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 85 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ended 25th March 1890, showing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement.

The following details are submitted, showing the character of the work that has engaged attention during the past year. "THE MANSION HOUSE COUNCIL." Between the 27th March and August 26th the following series of lists of complaints were received from the above Council, referring to 1045 premises:— March 27—Premises complained of in list 116 April 5 Ditto 156 „ 25 Ditto 177 May 16 Ditto 198 June 4 Ditto 104 July 19 Ditto 67 August 7 Ditto 126 „ 16 Ditto 62 „ 26 Ditto 89 Total number of premises 1045 An analysis of these complaints show as follows :— Dust bins none in 128 premises ,, no lids, or otherwise defective in 376 ,, Drains defective in 5 ,, W. C.'s no water, or otherwise defective in 997 ,, Yards none in 9 ,, ,, paving defective in 220 ,, Sinks defective in 14 ,, Roofs defective in 35 ,, Eaves gutters defective in 19 ,, Walls & ceilings defective in 68 ,, Floors defective in 50 ,, 1916 defects 88 In reference to these complaints, it was reported in the daily newspapers of January 9th, that at a meeting of the Mansion House Council held on the previous day, the Hon. Secretary, Mr. John Hamer, stated as follows, that "The analysis of cases of insanitary conditions in Shoreditch, notices of which had been sent to the Authority from March to August, 1889, showed that out of 2000 defects reported, about 1200 had been remedied, and the Vestry were actively at work upon the remainder." The exact number of premises referred to at that time as having been dealt with out of the total of 1015 was (509, including 30 houses in the Vinegar Ground, which were reported to the London County Council, under Cross' Act, as unfit for habitation, previous to the receipt of the Council's complaint. It would have been comparatively an easy matter to have followed on the footsteps of the Inspectors of "The Mansion House Council," and to have issued notices dealing with the surface conditions to which their complaints generally referred, but that would only have occasioned expense to the owners of property, without permanent benefit to anyone, and would have conveyed to the occupiers of the houses, in very many instances, quite a false assurance of the conditions under which they were living. Therefore, in investigating the complaints of " The Mansion House Council," as directed by the Sanitary Committee, I have been careful in accordance with long-established practice, upheld and approved by the Vestry, to thoroughly examine each premises in order not only to secure the rectification of surface conditions, but also the very much more dangerous conditions lying concealed under houses, water closets and adjacent yards. To deal with 1045 complaints lodged by one organization, in addition to the ordinary complaints of ratepayers received at the Town Hall from day to day, it became necessary to devolve upon Mr. Lear (the Assistant Inspector) the duty of dealing with a considerable enumber of the daily complaints, somewhat to the detriment of the work he was more especially appointed to attend to, and in that way it became possible, between March and December, to deal with the insanitary conditions of 609 of the premises complained of, and in the manner before indicated. Progress with the remainder of the premises was then 89 interrupted by the large additional amount of work thrown upon the department by "The Notification of Infectious Diseases Act," which came into operation on the 31st October ANN'S PLACE, BOUNDARY STREET. Ann's Place is a court 11ft. wide, approached by a passage from Boundary Street (under a house) 2ft. 7in. wide. The court is surrounded and enclosed by houses of three floors, rising to a height of 30ft. The houses were condemned under Torrens' Act in 1876, against which the owners appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions, On hearing the appeal, the Bench visited the premises, and it was shown to the Magistrates, in addition to general dilapidations and want of ventilation, that several of the houses were traversed with a large disused sewer, full of sewage, and that others of the houses were built on the edge of another section of the sewer, into which they were evidently settling. Nevertheless, with all the abominations fully displayed to their view, the Bench decided that the appellant should have an opportunity of effecting alterations so as to make the premises fit for habitation; and it was also decided that the Vestry should bear its own costs in the matter. Following upon that, the owner removed the disused sewer from under the houses, new piers were built into the walls to prevent them falling. The grosser sanitary defects were cured and the houses were again filled with poor people. The premises were shown to Sir Chas. Dilke, President of the Local Government Board, when he visited Shoreditch in 1883, and the facts were reported to the Sub-Committee of the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council, on visiting insanitary areas in Shoreditch in October of last year. Following upon that in November of last year, a summons was taken out at Worship Street Police Court, on behalf of one of the tenants, by a correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, when I reported the Vestry's action to the magistrate, an I showed in evidence that no expenditure of money could render the houses fit for habitation. The magistrate, on my request, having visited the place, made an order for the closure of No. 9: this was done, and the owners, to avoid further summonses, closed the remainder of the houses, and they remain closed at the present time. 90 EBENEZER BUILDINGS. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10—these cottages have been several times dealt with under Sanitary notices, but the work was done inefficiently by inferior workmen. The houses having therefore again come under notice, the owner recognised it would be better to employ capable workmen, in order that he might secure durable work, which has been done. The houses abut on a narrow public footpath, each house has a narrow forecourt railed in with a low fence. The front walls were all very damp, from the fact that the surface of the forecourt was unpaved and below the level of the footpath. This has been altered; the forecourts have been raised and paved with cement concrete, so that rain water flows off on to the footpath, and in addition, solid concrete sills, 18in. wide, have been provided in each doorway. The back yards have been paved, and gullies provided for the reception of household slops, water closets fitted up on "Shoreditch pattern," with open space under seat, and water supply; one good public dust bin provided in the front, which obviates the neglect of either dust contractor or tenant in the removal of refuse. These alterations, added to solid internal repairs, have removed damp from the walls, and greatly improved the houses generally. DOVE HOW. Nos. 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, are old 4-roomed cottages; they have been dealt with repeatedly under sanitary notices in recent years, but owing to original bad construction, the original inferior quality of all materials used in building, and the disinclination of leaseholders with a constantly diminishing interest in the property, to effect substantial repairs, it became evident that further efforts to improve their condition would be useless. The Vestry, therefore, ordered the houses should be closed as being unfit for human habitation ; that has been done, and they remain closed at the present time. GOLDSMITH SQUARE (Commonly called Piges Island). Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, were old 2-roomed cottages. The 91 central part of the square contained not a garden, but two rows of cottages. The cottages on the east side, Nos. 13 to 23, were exceedingly small, without thorough ventilation, and very dilapidated. Notices were therefore served by order of the Vestry, requiring these cottages to be closed as unfit for human habitation. On receipt of notices, the owner complied at once with the requirements, and anticipated the further action of the Vestry, by also closing those on the west and south sides, and the two rows in the centre of the square, subsequently demolishing and carting away the whole of the cottages, numbering 22. This demolition leaves an open piece of land in the midst of a densely crowded district, well adapted for the purposes of a recreation ground for children. CORONET STREET. Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. These were old 3-roomed houses, the condition of which had become dangerous, they were therefore closed under the Vestry's order, and subsequently taken down and carted away. RED LION STREET. Nos. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54. These were very small two-roomed cottages, several of which were in a dangerous condition; they were therefore closed under the Vestry's notice, and subsequently taken down and carted away. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACT. Since the above Act came into operation on the 31st October, 1889, 499 cases have been notified, making, with 173 previously dealt with, 672 cases. Each case has been enquired into and dealt with, either by simple fumigation of premises, or in addition by removal and disinfection in the Vestry's oven of bedding and 11a textile articles; and in many premises by the rectification of drains, and other insanitary conditions, as occasion required. 92 ARTICLES DISINFECTED AT VESTRY'S OVEN.
