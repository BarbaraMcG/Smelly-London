In the year under review in the following pages the Board were called upon to elect a new Clerk, and Mr. Edward Wright, who at the time filled the office of Secretary, was unanimously appointed to the vacant office, the post of Secretary being at the same time abolished. Mr. Wright has been connected with the Board since 18G7,—he was appointed Clerk's Assistant in August, 1868; Assistant Clerk of the Board, May, 1873; and Secretary to the Board, March, 1881. In all these positions Mr. Wright acquitted himself with credit, and manifested a complete mastery of the details of the Board's work and an intimate knowledge of its previous orders, and the powers under which the Board acted. It was therefore with much pleasure, when the opportunity presented itself, that the members were enabled to mark their confidence and approbation by promoting Mr. Wright to the responsible and dignified position of Clerk, in which capacity there is every reason to believe Mr. Wright will acquit himself in a manner that will reflect credit upon himself and the Board. T. W. WILLIAMS, CHAIRMAN. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. THE BOARD'S REPORT For the year ended 25th March, 1880, Prepared by Order of the Board, pursuant to the 198th sec. of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 120). The Board of Works for the Lewisham District present the following Report of their proceedings during the twelve months ended Lady-day, 1889. The District over which the Board exercise jurisdiction comprises the Parish of Lewisham (including Sydenham Chapelry), and the Hamlet of Penge. The extent of the District may, perhaps, be more readily understood by the mention of the various localities forming its principal centres, viz.:—Blackheath—Lewisham—Ladywell and Brockley— Catford—Forest Hill—Upper Sydenham—Lower Sydenham —Anerley and Penge. The area of the District is 6544 acres, and it holds a population, estimated at Midsummer 1888, at 88,845, occupying 14,188 houses. The Board submit herewith:— A statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1889, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1886-7, 1887-8, and 1888-9. A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1889. A statement of the contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1889. 10 The Board submit the Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the District for the year ended 31st December, 1888, on the sanitary condition of the District. On a perusal of that report it will be seen that the health of the District continued highly satisfactory, the annual rate of mortality was only 13.4 per 1000, comparing most favourably with the death rate of London and other great towns, including some of the sea-side resorts. The average death rate in the Lewisham District, in the past five years, was 13.6 per 1000. The Board also submit the Report of the Surveyor for the year ended 25th March, on the various works relating to the Highways, Lighting, Watering, Sewerage Works, Street Improvements, and other Works projected and carried out during the year, showing the extent of those works, and affording general information with reference to the same. Several of the most important matters that received the attention of the Board during the year are included in this Report under the following heads:— EXPENDITURE. The Local Expenditure of the Board in the year shows no increase upon that of the previous year, notwithstanding the increased mileage of the roads to be repaired, lighted., and watered, and the other increased and continually increasing responsibilities of the Board. The amount required for local purposes from the Parish of Lewisham was £35,500, being equivalent to a rate on the rateable value of Is. 6d. in the pound. From the Hamlet of Penge £8,830 was required, being equivalent to a rate of Is. 2d. in the pound. The sums required in the previous year were £35,500 and £8994 respectively. The sums raised under the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London, and paid over to those bodies, were:— For the Metropolitan Board of Works, £21,553 0 7 For the School Board for London, 20,756 2 6 11 The Precept of the School Board was for the year ended the 25th March, 1889. The Precept of the Metropolitan Board was for the year ended the 31st December, 1888. It was necessary for the Metropolitan Board to issue a further Precept to meet their expenses and liabilities to the 31st March, 1889, at which date it had been arranged that they should cease to hold office, according to the Local Government Act, 1888, and on the 7th February, 1889, this Board received a further Precept for £6,514 3s. lId., payable on or before the date named. This sum was subsequently paid over to the London County Council. It has been decided under the provisions of the Local Government Act that the expenses of the London County Council must be raised as a County Rate. These expenses will therefore, in future, be raised through the Guardians of the Lewisham Union, instead of through the District Board of Works as has hitherto been the custom with regard to the expenses of the Metropolitan Board of Works. LOANS. The total indebtedness of the Board on the Loan account at the 25th March, 1889, was £53,883. During the year the Board paid the sum of £5,349 in reduction of the mortgages owing by them. The Board raised the sum of £2,100 for new works and improvements, and the following sums for special works, viz.:—£600 for works at the Silk Mills Weir, at Lewisham; £1,600 for laying out and forming the Penge Recreation Ground; £575 for an Improvement in the Road under the bridge of the London and Brighton Railway, in Beckenham Road; and £1,950 for Surface Drainage Works in Penge, for the relief of the sewers in times of storm and flood. The following statement of the loan debt will show the reduction made in the five years ended 25th March, 1888, and the amount outstanding at the end of each financial year in that period. The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1883, was £65,841. 12 Year. Amount paid off during the year. New Loans raised. Net reduction. Amount outstanding at the end of the year. £ £ £ £ 1883—4 5,907 2,800 3,107 62,734 1884—5 5,434 2,150 3,284 59,450 1885—6 5,428 2,200 3,228 56,222 1886—7 5,685 3,200 2,485 53,737 1887—8 6,177 4,847 1,330 52,407 Net Reduction in the total Debt £13,434 Giving an Annual average Reduction of £2,687 in the five years stated. The total amount raised in 1888-9 exceeded the amount paid off, owing to the special works undertaken. The Estimates for the works to be carried out in the year 1889-90 have, however, been agreed to, and the Board are able to state that the average reduction of the previous five years will be maintained so far as such works are concerned ; it may, however, be necessary to make some provision for special undertakings. The following statement is given to show the amount borrowed in each period of ten years from 1856 to 1886, and the rate at which the different loans were obtained. From 1856 to 1866 the sum raised was £32,223, at £5 per centum per annum. In the next period, to the end of 1876, the sum raised was £87,844, and the interest was £5 per cent. at the early part of the decade, and 4¼ and 37/8 at the latter part. Following this, the sum of £68,268 was raised in the ten years ended December, 1886, and the interest was, in the first half of this period, 4½ and 4¾, but in the latter part it was This sum of £68,268 included £24,800 raised for 13 the consolidation of previous loans borrowed at rates of 4¾, 4½, and 4¼, and the new loan was obtained, as stated in previous reports, at 3½. The sum therefore raised for new works in the third period, from 1876 to the end of 1886, was £43,468. The sums raised in the second period (i.e., 1866 to 1876) included the loans for the New Offices and for special paving works. The amount borrowed by the Board up to the end of 1886 (exclusive of the sum raised for consolidation of loans) was £163,535 The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1886, was 56,222 Showing a total payment off the Loan Debt to that date of £107,313 The foregoing statements with regard to the previous Loan transactions of the Board were included in last year's report. The Board again submit the information, believing it to be of considerable interest to the ratepayers of the District. RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District, as given by the late Metropolitan Board of Works, in December, 1888, was— Lewisham £464,229 Penge 150,839 £615,068 THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. There have been but few patients admitted to the Board's Hospital during the year. The establishment has been maintained in a thorough state of readiness in case of any emergency. Residents in the District are invited to use this Hospital should any cases of infectious or contagious disease occur in 14 their families, the charge being only one guinea per week, covering medical attendance, board, lodging and nursing. Application for admission should be made at the Board's Offices at Catford. SANITARY. Table six in the Medical Officer's Report shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Board and the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. On reference to such table it will be seen that upwards of 8000 houses were inspected during the year, and that sanitary amendments were found to be required in a great many cases. In all such cases the proper notices were served and the required amendments were carried out. There are in so large a district many instances in which nuisances or sanitary defects can only be brought to the notice of the Board or its Officers by the occupiers or persons interested. On receipt of notice of any nuisance or defect the Board's officers will at once attend to the matter, and proceedings will be taken if the defect comes properly within the Board's jurisdiction under the Sanitary Acts. Notice of all cases of infectious disease should be at once given to the Board, when assistance and advice will be given in connection with the requisite disinfecting work, and in very poor cases the expense of that work will be defrayed by the Board. Bedding and other articles may be disinfected in the Board's disinfecting apparatus, the only charge being that for horse hire, the Board providing an iron cart for the conveyance of the articles. Work of this character was carried out in many cases during the year. The house inspection .above referred to included the inspections made under the regulations adopted by the Board as to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. Those regulations are referred to on the following page. During the year there were 274 complaints or requests as to the removal of dust. Personal enquiry is made into each such case. In the majority of cases it is found that the 15 men are not allowed to remove the dust on calling for the same in their regular rounds. These refusals frequently arise in consequence of some little inconvenience to occupiers or their servants at the time of the dustman's call, and as the men cannot call again until their next round, the ashpits remain unemptied for a longer period than desirable. The Board, by adhering to this regulation, are enabled to carry on this work at a cost of about £3,000 per annum. Any departure from the regulation would greatly increase the cost, to the disadvantage of the ratepayers generally. The efficiency of the system adopted by the Board is demonstrated by the fact that there were only 274 letters, complaints, or requests as to the removal of dust in the year in a District comprising 14,188 inhabited houses. The Board request all householders to observe the following suggestions:— To see that the men are not refused the dust on calling. To burn (in small quantities at a time) all animal or vegetable refuse. To place no animal or vegetable refuse in the dustbins, unless previously burnt. To cleanse and disinfect, limewash, or liraewhite periodically the dustbins. To see that the dustbins are properly constructed, and fitted with covers. To forward complaints of the non-removal of dust to the Board's Offices. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS AND OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. The Regulations adopted by the Board under the provisions of the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, arc printed in a separate form, and can be obtained at the Board's Offices. The same apply to all houses let in lodgings, with the following exceptions:— 16 (a) Where for the purposes of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 6s. per week: (b) Where for the purposes of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 7s. 6d. per week. BAKEHOUSES. These premises were periodically inspected by the Board's Officers, pursuant to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1883, under which authority for such inspection is given. COWHOUSES AND SLAUGHTERHOUSES. These premises were also regularly inspected by the Inspectors. In September the Medical Officer of Health made his inspection prior to the annual licensing by the Justices, when he reported that he found the various premises in a cleanly and satisfactory condition, and saw no reason to oppose the renewal of any of the licenses. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The proceedings taken by the Board under these Acts show that out of 01 samples of food analysed during the year 88 proved to be genuine. In the three cases in which the articles were found to be adulterated proceedings were taken by the Board, and the following convictions were obtained: W. Urquhardt, fined 20s. and 12s. 6d. costs. W. Turner, trading as the 17 Imperial Dairy Company, fined £3 and 12s. 6d. costs; and the Challow Dairy Farmers' Company, fined 40s. and 12s. 6d. costs. Ratepayers are again invited to avail themselves of the facilities offered by the Board in aid of the working of these Acts. Samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left at the Board's Offices during office hours, and no further trouble in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of the sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis. STREET NOMENCLATURE. The following Street has been re-named:— Old Name. New Name. Allenby Road (part of) . Houston Road. And the names Broxted Road and Lutwyche Road have been applied to proposed New Roads between Woolstone Grove and Fribourg Road, Perry Hill. The following Streets have been numbered or renumbered:— Charleville Circus Melvin Road David's Road Rockbourne Road Engleheart Road Rojack Road Honor Oak Road Stodart Road Houston Road LEWISHAM RECREATION GROUNDS. The Board in their last report (year 1887-8), gave a resume of their proceedings in relation to the acquisition of the Lewisham Recreation Grounds, and stated that the Metropolitan Board's (Various Powers) Act, empowering that Board to acquire the Grounds, had received the Royal Assent, and that the clauses relating to the Grounds had 18 been referred by the Metropolitan Board of Works to Committee, with a view to the proposals being carried into effect. The Metropolitan Board proceeded with the arrangements for the purchase of the land according to the preliminary negotiations made by this Board, and the matter thus rested with the Metropolitan Board until they ceased to hold office on the 21st March, 1889, when it was, with other matters, transferred to the London County Council. The representative of the District at the Metropolitan Board reported—as the result of enquiries made by him immediately before the transfer to the London County Council—that the contracts had been sealed, with the exception of one relating to a small portion of the Glebe land, as to which some delay had occurred, and it was agreed that this land might be omitted without detriment to the scheme, if it could not be obtained. The Board have reason to believe that this matter has since been satisfactorily adjusted, and that steps are being taken by the Council for completing the purchase of the lands required. The subject of the Recreation Grounds is further referred to below in relation to the Shortlands and Nunhead Railway Bill. PENGE RECREATION GROUND. The Penge Recreation Ground was formally opened on the 4th July, 1888, as stated in last year's Report, and the ground has throughout the year evidently been a source of great enjoyment and pleasure to the large number of the inhabitants who have availed themselves of its advantages. THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKSLONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. An important change was effected in the Government of London in the year under review. The Metropolitan Board of Works was constituted by the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and succeeded the then Commissioners of Sewers. By the Local Government Act of 1888, the Metropolitan Board is succeeded by the London County Council. This 19 authority has taken over the powers and duties of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and it has further and extended powers conferred upon it by the Act referred to. To the present time no alteration has been made in the constitution of the Vestries and District Boards. THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT AT THE METROPOLITAN BOARD. From the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works until the year 1885, this Board was not separately represented on that Board, as they jointly with the Plumstead District elected one representative. In the year mentioned a short Act, intituled "The Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885," was obtained, empowering this Board to elect a separate Representative at the Metropolitan Board, and on the 23rd September following, Mr. T. W. Williams was elected the first representative of the Board thereunder. In June 1888, Mr. Williams' first term of office expired, and he was unanimously re-elected by the Board. On the 20th March, 1889, in reply to a question as to the Lewisham Recreation Grounds, the Chairman referred to the Order of the Local Government Board issued that day, directing that the "appointed day" for the transfer to the London County Council of the powers and duties of the Metropolitan Board of Works should be Thursday, the 21st March, and that consequently the Board would that day cease to exist according to the terms of the Local Government Act, 1888, when Mr. Brabrook stated that the Board would not wish the occasion to pass without placing upon record their sincere thanks to Mr. Williams for the service he had rendered the District since his appointment as the representative of this Board at the Metropolitan Board of Works; and he moved—"That the best thanks of this Board be given to Mr. Williams for his eminent and valuable services to the District during the time he has been a Member of the Metropolitan Board of Works." 20 Mr. Luck seconded the motion, and the same was put and carried unanimously ; and it was resolved accordingly. Mr. Williams acknowledged the resolution, and thanked the Board for the patient and continuous support they had given him since his first appointment as the representative of this District at the Metropolitan Board. PARLIAMENTARY. The following Bills came under the notice of the Board during the year:— Advertising Stations (Rating) Bill. Bexley Heath Railway Bill. The Coal and Wine Dues Continuance Bill. Fire Brigade Expenses Bill. Metropolitan Board of Works (Local Management) Bill, Amendment. Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Bill. Metropolitan Theatres Bill. School Board for London Election Bill. School Board for London Pensions or Superannuation Bill. Shortlands and Nunhead Railway Bill. United Telephone Company's Bill. 0f these Bills the Shortlands and Nunhead Railway appears the only one needing any comment. THE SHORTLANDS AND NUNHEAD RAILWAY BILL. Notice of the intended introduction in Parliament of this Bill was given in the usual form on the 30th November, 1888, when the Parliamentary Notices, Plans, and Books of Reference were deposited with the Clerk of the Board, and the Bill was shortly afterwards referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration and report. The Committee reported, on the 6th February, 1889, submitting a report, by the Board's Surveyor, fully describing 21 the lino from the point where it would enter the Parish of Lewisham, at Beckenham Place to Brockley, where it entered the Parish of Deptford, joining the Greenwich (Blackheath Hill) branch of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway to Nunhead, and submitting, with such report, a statement of the provisions and works deemed necessary for the protection of the roads, footpaths, sewers, and other matters coming under the Board's jurisdiction. It was stated that the proposed line would cross the River Ravensbourne four times between Ladywell and Catford, and that three of those crossings would be made at a point where the line would pass through the ground to be acquired for the Public Recreation Grounds at the northern end and western side of the Adenmore Gardens Estate. The Committee stated that they were of opinion that the lino of railway should be altered, and that it should be laid down nearer to the line of deviation shown by the broken line on the plan, and thus only cross the river once at that point, and avoid interference to any extent with the Recreation Grounds. The Committee also stated their opinion that, for the public convenience, road bridges of the full width for vehicular and foot traffic should be provided at least every halfmile along the line of railway, and that, where practicable, provision should be made for the formation of roads in relation to the future laying-out of the lands over which the railway would be made; and also that all bridges should be of an ornamental description. The Board adopted the Committee's report, and decided to embody the amendments required in a Memorial to be presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works, with a request to that Board to withhold their consent to the scheme until the required provisions and alterations were made in the Bill, and a Memorial was accordingly submitted to that Board. It was, however, necessary that this Board should—in order to fully protect the interests of the District, and to 22 obtain the amendments required—present a petition against the Bill, and this was done. The petition was sealed on the 6th Mareh, and duly deposited. The Solicitors for the Bill then wrote to the Chairman of the Board and opened negotiations with him with a view to meeting the Board's wishes in the matter, both as regards the roads, footpaths, sewers, &c., and the Recreation Grounds. These negotiations resulted satisfactorily, and a draft clause was prepared by the Clerk of the Board, covering all their suggestions and requirements as to the matters under their jurisdiction. The clause was submitted to the Solicitors for the Bill, and on the 17th April, 1889, the Board were informed that the Solicitors had given an undertaking, subject to the approval of Parliament, to insert the clause in the Bill in Committee. And with regard to the Recreation Grounds, that they had agreed that the Company should divert the line in the manner suggested by the Board, so that it would cross the river but once near Adenmore-gardens, and avoid as far as practicable any interference with the Grounds. Upon this the Board withdrew their petition, and they decided to inform the London County Council that, as the promoters had in every particular met their wishes in the matter, and as they had agreed to alter the line as suggested, the Board hoped the Council might be able to support the Bill rather than oppose it, especially in view of the fact that, in the opinion of the Board, the new railway would be of considerable advantage to the District under their charge. The Council wrote in reply that they were unable to withdraw their opposition to the Bill. On the application of the Solicitors for the promoters, the Board requested the Chairman to give evidence in favour of the Bill. Mr. Carline, the Board's Surveyor, also gave evidence in favour. The Bill came before the Committee of the House of Commons on the 14th May, and the three following days. The Committee passed the preamble and the Bill, was read a third time in the House of Commons on the 27th May. The Board understand the Bill will be 23 further opposed, and they have consequently written to the Council for an interview with their Parliamentary Committee, in the hope of removing the misapprehension which would appear to exist in the matter and of inducing the Council to withhold any further opposition on their part. The Board regard the railway as of great importance to the ratepayers of this District; the part of the parish to be served by the line being urgently in need of increased railway accommodation, and they are of opinion that the Recreation Grounds will not be injured by the introduction of the line. MAIN ROADS. One important alteration consequent on the new government of London under the Local Government Act, 1888, relates to the repair and maintenance of Main Roads within the Metropolitan area. Hitherto this Board have not been entitled to any contribution from the County or other authority towards the cost of the maintenance of the main roads in this District; but it is now hoped that, under the new arrangement, some considerable benefit in this respect will accrue to them. The attention of the Board was called to the matter in October, 1888, and, on the invitation of the Vestry of Chelsea, the Board appointed three delegates to attend a Conference on the subject; and Mr. Beeton, Mr. Blake, and Mr. Forbes were so appointed. The Conference was held on the 14th February, 1889, and Mr. Forbes fully reported the result of the same to the Board at the meeting held on the 20th February. The matter was referred to the "Works and General Purposes Committee; and the Surveyor was directed to report the Roads in the District which might be deemed Main Roads. The matter was duly considered by the Committee, and after taking the opinion of the several Local Committees on the subject they submitted a complete list to the Board. This list was, by order of the Board, duly forwarded to the Council, with a request to that authority to 24 adopt the roads therein mentioned as Main Roads in this District, and to contribute towards the cost of the repair and maintenance of the same accordingly. The application is at present before the Council. There is not at the present time any official definition as to what may properly be deemed a "Main Road but the term is generally understood to apply to roads which are means of communication between different districts or thoroughfares to railway stations, or which are used largely for Metropolitan traffic as opposed to local traffic. BECKENHAM ROAD IMPROVEMENT. The attention of the Board had for some time been directed to the condition of the old bridge carrying the London Brighton and South Coast Railway over the Beckenham Road, at the Penge Railway Station, and to the necessity for widening and improving the road under the same, should opportunity occur. On the 2nd May, 1888, the Surveyor reported that the Railway Company were about to renew the girders of the bridge, and that the proposed alterations might afford an opportunity for widening it. The matter was referred to the Local Committee, and the Board wrote to the Company requesting them to defer action in the matter, and to receive a deputation from the Board in relation to the same. A reply was duly received from the Company, stating that the works would be deferred, and that the Directors would receive the deputation. In the meantime the Surveyor had prepared a plan of the proposed improvement; and the members of the Local Committee, with Mr. Williams, the Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Jerrard, the Chairman of the Works and General Purposes Committee, attended the Directors when the matter was referred to the Engineer of the Company to consult with the Board's Surveyor as to the plans, &c. 25 The plans and estimates having been agreed to, and approved by the Board, the matter was submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works by this Board's Representative, and on the 19th July he wrote that, acceding to his plea of urgency, the Metropolitan Board had resolved to waive their usual practice of viewing the proposed improvement before considering the application for a contribution, and had decided to comply with the Le wish am Board's request by contributing half the estimated cost of £1,150 for widening the bridge and roadway thereunder. The Board passed a resolution thanking the Metropolitan Board for their consideration of the matter, as one of urgency, and for their promised contribution. After some further negotiation, the Board concluded the agreement with the Railway Company for the execution of the works necessary in the alteration of the bridge, and the matter was thus far concluded. The estimated cost of this improvement was £1,150, including the sum of £700 agreed to be paid to the Railway Company in respect of the extra work to be carried out in the bridge consequent on the widening of the same. The Metropolitan Board of Works undertook to contribute onehalf, viz., £575, the other half has been raised by loan spread over a term of thirty years. MEETINGS OF THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES.

REPORT to The Road of Works for the Lewisham District TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1888, by TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1888, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, as estimated at the middle of the year 1888, amounted to 88,845, occupying 14,188 houses, as compared with 86,423 occupying 13,800 houses in the previous year. The population in 1881, at the time of the census, was ascertained to be 71,715. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1888 amounted to 2,287, of which 90, or 3.9 per cent., were illegitimate. Males 1,153. Females 1,134. The Birth Rate to population was 24.61 per 1,000. In London 131,080 births were registered, the Birth Rate being 30.7 per 1,000. The Birth rate in England and Wales was 30.6, and showed a further decline of 0.8 from the unprecedentedly low rate in 1887, and was 2.9 below the mean annual rate in the ten years 1878-87. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1888 was 1,226, being 35 more than the number registered during the previous year. 2 The annual rate of mortality was 13.4 per 1,000. The number of deaths in Public Institutions amounted to 113, being a decrease of 24 on the previous year. 95 occurred in the Lewisham Workhouse; 4 in St. John's Hospital, Blackheath; 5 at the Home for Sick Children, Sydenham; 5 at the North Surrey District Schools, Anerley; and 4 at the Waterman's Asylum, Penge. Inquests were held in 59 cases. The causes of death were returned as follows:— Natural Causes 32 Violent deaths- 27 Accidental 19 Suicidal 8 Seventeen deaths were registered as "Not Certified," no inquest being considered necessary by the Coroner after inquiry into the cases. The actual number of deaths from zymotic disease was 58 more than in the previous year; the deaths from measles decreased from 40 to 18; those from diarrhœa further decreased from 31 to 25; while scarlet fever accounted for 7 deaths as compared with 6 in the previous year. The deaths from whooping cough rose from 23 to 76; those from diphtheria from 10 to 37; and those from typhoid fever from 6 to 11. The deaths from phthisis show a decrease of 1, and there is a decrease of 27 in the number of deaths from other diseases of the respiratory organs. During the same period the death rate in England and Wales, which had ranged in the seven preceding years from 19.6 in 1882, to the then unexampled low rate of 18.8 in 1887, further declined to 17.8, a considerably lower rate than that recorded in any previous year of civil registration, which commenced in 1837. 3 The death rate of London was 18.5, the lowest on record, while the death rate in the "Outer Ring" of suburban districts, with a population of considerably over a million, did not exceed 15 0 per 1,000 against 15.9 the previous year. The death rate in the twenty-eight great towns, with an aggregate population of over nine millions, was 19.2, ranging between 16.1 in Brighton, and 26.1 in Manchester. Although in this district the mortality from diphtheria was not as great as in the year 1880, the increase of deaths from that complaint is a most important matter, more especially as during 1888 the disease was not confined to any particular suburb, but was more or less epidemic over the whole Metropolitan area. The following Table shows the increase between 1887 and 1888 in this locality as compared with other districts:- 1887. 1888. Lewisham 10 37 Paddington 29 76 Kensington 40 91 St. George's, Hanover Square 13 46 Westminster 25 37 Hackney 40 76 Bethnal Green 27 52 Whitechapel 6 24 Stepney 14 25 St. George, Southwark 12 23 Wandsworth and Battersea 51 92 On enquiry as to the cause of the disease, it was in many cases directly traceable to defective household sanitary arrangements. In others no solution was arrived at. I am strongly of opinion that milk is often the cause of this ailment, and that it is quite as likely to occur from milk supplied from first-rate dairies and where the cows receive every possible care and attention, as it is from a dairy 4 of a second class order, and for this reason:— Where the animals are stall-fed, their food often and chiefly consists, during the summer months, of rye grass, clover, &c., grown on some suburban sewerage farm. This alone, I think, points to an element of danger. On the other hand, if the animals are turned out to grass, the water they drink is often from some brook or stream flowing through the meadows, which may or may not be contaminated with sewerage, or with perhaps the effluent water from a neighbouring sewerage farm. This, though supposed to be pure and innocuous, is, as a matter of fact, very often not so. Again, what more likely in the case of dishonest milk sellers or their employes than that some of this stream water is mixed with the milk and the disease spread broadcast. All this points to the necessity of boiling the milk. It should be done immediately on being received from the milk purveyor and allowed to stand before using. This, in a great measure, does away with the peculiar taste of boiled milk. Whooping cough was epidemic during the first six months of the year ; and though there was such a marked increase in the number of deaths and the mortality greater than in any of the preceding ten years, it did not reach the decennial average of greater London. It was through this disease that the zymotic death rate was high. Marriages. During the year 1888 there were 394 Marriages in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 303 were solemnised in the various Churches, 35 in Dissenting Chapels, and 56 at the Registrar's Office. During the same period there were 116 in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 92 were solemnised in Churches, 11 in Dissenting Chapels, and 13 at the Registrar's Office. 5 Total 510, as compared with 566 in the previous year. The marriage rate was equal to 11.4 per 1,000. In London it was 16.1, the lowest yet recorded, though it has been on the decrease every year since 1883. For England and Wales it was 14.2. Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1887 and the 10 previous years.

Professor Frankland in his report on the analyses of waters supplied by the Metropolitan Companies during 1888, says, that although on the whole the year was unfavourable for purifying operations, the water maintained, except in March, November, and December, the high quality it has now exhibited for several years past. Even in the three months just mentioned the river waters were well filtered and delivered bright and clear, although the Companies were not able to contend quite successfully with the excessive quantity of organic impurities which were present in the raw water of the Thames and Lea. The actual amount of organic matter, though quite insignificant, may be of the most objectionable character on account of its origin. The Water of the Lambeth and other Thames Companies' receives, above the points where it is abstracted for the purpose of supply, various contributions of organic matter of animal origin, which may be accompanied by Zymotic poisons dangerous to health ; though the chance of such reaching the consumer is greatly reduced by filtration and the care which is taken to exclude storm water from the reservoirs. In fact the Thames water supplied during the past year was, in respect of comparative freedom from organic impurity, only surpassed in two out of twenty-one years. The deep well water supplied by the Kent Company again maintained its high degree of purity, the amount of organic matter which it contained being but little more than one third of that present in the Thames. 7 The following table shows the proportional amount of organic elements in each of the waters. The average amount of these elements contained in the Kent Company's water during nine years ending December, 1876, being taken as unity:. Sources. Maximum. Minimum. Average. Deep Wells Kent 0.8 0.3 0.6 Colne Valley 2.2 0.8 1.2 Tottenham 2.6 0.7 1.2 River Lea New River 3.7 0.6 1.4 East London 4.9 1.3 2.8 River Thames Chelsea 4.6 1.4 2.9 West Middlesex 6.0 1.6 3.2 Southwark 4.9 1.6 3.0 Grand Junction 4.9 1.3 2.8 Lambeth 4.8 1.6 2.9 I cannot too strongly advise householders to filter all water required for drinking purposes before using. Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich in 1888 was 47 7° Fahrenheit, which is considerably below the average of 40 years. The highest reading by day, 87.7°, was registered in August, and the lowest reading by night, 10.8°, in February. Rain fell on 167 days, the total amount of rainfall being 27.5 inches, or about two inches above the average. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, FEED.

SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of Work executed from Lady-day, 1888, to Lady-day, 1889. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting my Report on the work executed and the general business transacted in my department during the past financial year, this being my Twentieth Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. The following Table shows the various materials, with the quantity of each description used during the year for the maintenance of the public Roads :— Division. Broken Guernsey Granite. Port Philip Stone. Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish (cubic yds.) 4517 1645 ... 2810 1927 10,899 Hamlet of Penge (ditto) 761 ... 830 ... 846 2437 Total 5278 1645 830 2810 2773 13,336 The rainfall, as registered by the raingauge at the Forest Hill Stoneyard, from the 26th March, 1888, to the 25th March, 1889, both inclusive, was as follows :— Number of days on which snow or rain fell. inches. 5 1888 March 26th to 31st, inclusive 0.64 15 99 April 1.75 6 99 May 0.64 16 99 June 3.66 23 99 July 6.50 9 99 August 2.67 10 99 September 0.73 8 99 October 1.34 19 99 November 3.86 10 99 December 0.97 8 1889 January 0.97 15 99 February 2.38 11 99 March, to 25th inclusive 1.31 Total 155 Total 27.42 2 This shows a rainfall of 7.50 inches more than last year, and that rain or snow fell on 19 more days this year than last year. During the month of February there was a somewhat heavy snow storm, and from the 11th to the 14th, inclusive, 809 men were engaged in clearing the paths, &c. There were also 14 ploughs at work clearing away the snow, and 157 horses employed, together with several revolving street sweepers. During the winter 897 loads of burnt ballast, sand or grit were spread upon the roads throughout the District, when in a slippery condition by reason of frost. Notwithstanding the heavy rainfall, the roads are in a fairly good condition, and I do not hear of any complaints, except from cyclists. I understand they complain of the roads generally throughout the Kingdom. It appears to me that such slight machines as bicycles and tricycles with three-quarters of an inch tyres, are not suitable to travel upon an ordinary Macadam road. For some years I have been gradually introducing granite for maintaining the roads, as being more suitable to the increasing traffic upon them. It lasts longer than flint, there is less slopping in winter, and not so much watering in summer, consequently it is economical in every way. Granite makes a very hard and firm road, but unfortunately does not wear evenly. This, together with its hardness, causes a good deal of vibration and concussion, which is disagreeable to cyclists when riding over them. A good cinder or gravel path is quite sufficient, and much better than ordinary Macadam road for cycle travelling, and to keep the roads up with the present traffic to the standard of easy travelling with these machines would involve a large additional expense. ROAD WATERING. At Blackheath, the work in connection with road watering was carried out by Mr. J. C. Pickernell, under contract, at 8s. 6d. per horse, harness, and driver per day, and in Lewisham by our own horses and men, with additional horses when required from Messrs. W. and J. Woodham, at 7s. 6d. per horse, harness, and driver per day. Mr. W. Stimpson supplied the horses and drivers for watering in the Upper Sydenham and Forest Hill and Lower Sydenham Divisions, at 7s. Gd. and 7s. 3d., respectively, for each horse, harness, and driver per day. 3 The watering in the Hamlet of Penge was executed by Mr. R. Winnifrith, at 7s. per horse, harness, and driver per day. The mileage of roads watered is as follows:— Locality. Miles. Yards. Parish of Lewisham 49 92 Hamlet of Penge 12 190 Total Lewisham District 61 282 STREET LIGHTING. The South Metropolitan Gas Company supply gas to 734 lamps, and the Crystal Palace District Gas Company to 814 lamps in the Parish of Lewisham. The Crystal Palace District Gas Company also supply gas to 375 lamps in the Hamlet of Penge. The prices charged by the Companies for supplying gas, lighting, extinguishing, painting, and repairing are—The South Metropolitan Gas Company, £3 3s. 9d., and the Crystal Palace District Gas Company £3 6s. per lamp per annum, both prices being subject to 5 per cent, discount. The South Metropolitan Gas Company reduced the price at Christmas 3s. 7d., and the Crystal Palace District Gas Company at Michaelmas 1s. 7d. per lamp per annum. The new lamps erected during the year are as follows:— Parish of Lewisham. No of Lamps. Adamsrill Road 1 Albacore Crescent 1 Benson Road 2 Berryman's Lane 1 Blagdon Road 1 Brockley Road 1 Brockley View 1 Bromley Road 7 Burghill Road 1 Canonbie Road 1 Codrington Hill 1 Colfe Road 2 Como Road 2 4 Elverson Road 1 Ewelme Road 1 Gabriel Street 2 Hamburgh Place, High Street, Sydenham 1 Honor Oak Road 2 Howson Road 1 Hurstbourne Road 1 Kilmorie Road 2 Lessing Street 1 Medusa Road 1 Plane Street 1 Rathfern Road 2 Trewsbury Road (footpath) 1 Valley Road 3 Vancouver Road 2 Vicar's Hill 2 Whitbread Road 2 Wool stone Road 3 Wyleu Street 1 Total 52 Hamlet of Penge. No. of Lamps. Anerley Road 1 Kent House Lane 1 Limes Avenue 1 Waldegrave Road 1 Total 4 In the Parish of Lewisham 40 lamps were moved and four in the Hamlet of Penge. The Victoria lantern and burner was removed from the corner of Thurston Road to the corner of Albion and Clarendon Roads, to replace the ordinary lamp there, and a new column and lantern, fitted with a twelve feet per hour burner, was fixed at the corner of Thurston Road. Lambeth lanterns, to burn twenty feet per hour, were fixed at Tranquil Vale and Montpelier Vale, and a similar lantern, but fitted with a ten feet per hour burner, was fixed at Westwood Park. Messrs. Bray and Co. supplied lamps and 5 columns fixed at Kirkdale and Waldram Road, consuming eighteen feet per hour each. Large lanterns, with twenty feet per hour burners, were erected in Beckenham Road, at the Crystal Palace entrance, and also opposite the Recreation Ground; in the Croydon Road, opposite the National Schools, in Anerley Road, at the corner of Croydon Road, and at the corner of Versailles Road. Five ordinary lamps were discontinued at Beckenham Road and Anerley Road. COLLECTION OF DUST. Parish of Lewisham. The difficulty of obtaining shoots for the dust and ashes, which I have mentioned in my former Reports, has this year been greater than ever, and no dust has been sold. The Blackheath and Lewisham Division was divided into two sub-districts as heretofore, but nearly the whole of the dust collected in the Sydenham and Forest Hill Division was taken to Mr. Sykes's gravel pit, Perry Hill. The greater part of the work of collecting the dust in the Parish of Lewisham was done by the Board's own horses and men, with additional horses hired from the contractors when required. The following Table shows how the dust was disposed of:— Locality. To whom given. Blackheath, Loampit Yale, &c Mr. Wm. Jerrard. Lewisham up to llushey Green Mr. Umfreville. Mr. D. Phillips. r Sydenham and Forest Hill Division Mr. H. Fisher. Mr. R. Soper. Mr. A. Sykes. The Beckenham and Penge Brickworks. 10,788 loads of dust were collected. Hamlet of Penge. The same difficulty which occurs in Lewisham has been experienced in Penge, in consequence of the increasing scarcity of shoots, and the whole of the dust had to be given away. 6 During the first portion of the year Mr. It. Winnifrith supplied horses, carts, and harness at 5s. per day, and Mr. J. Craker for the remainder of the year, at 4s. per horse, cart, and harness per day, the drivers and boys being employed by the Board. No sub-divisions were made this year. The dust was given to Messrs. Wootten, Craker, Hopper, and the Beckenham and Penge Brickworks. 3,589 loads of dust were collected. NEW WORKS. Kerb, Channel, Crossings, &c. Parish of Lewisiiam. From the following may be seen the new works carried out during the year :— Locality. Description of Work. Blythe Yale Kerb and Channel.

No new streets were taken to under the 106th seetion of the Metropolis Local Management Act:— UNEMPLOYED LABOUR. Parish of Lewisham. The number of labourers out of work this year has, I am glad to say, considerably decreased. The Board, however, decided on paving and forming Porthcawe, Relingue, and Maddin Roads, Lower Sydenham. The work was carried out by local labour, as far as possible. Special contracts were made for the purchase of the necessary materials. Mount Pleasant Road, Ivy Lane, and Westwood Park, which were commenced prior to the 25th March, 1888, were completed this year. Hamlet of Penge. The Penge Recreation Ground was finished this year, and many of the labourers who would have possibly been out of work were by this means employed. SEWERS AND HOUSE DRAINAGE.

Sewer flashing by means of automatic flushing tanks has again this year received considerable attention; twelve new tanks have been constructed, varying in capacity from 650 to 1000 gallons, fitted with 8-in. or 12-in. flushing syphons, as required by the description of sewer to be flushed. During the year fifteen additional manholes, which also act as ventilators, have been constructed on existing sewers. These 11 holes are a valuable means of inspecting the sewers, and are largely used for cleansing the same; in fact, without them the sewers could not be kept in such a clean and sanitary state as they now are. In addition to the above, eight small manholes were constructed adjoining some of the new flushing tanks; these also act as ventilators to the sewers. I still continue the construction of the flushing tanks almost entirely of concrete. The flushing tanks constructed during the year are as follows:— Parish of Lewisham. Locality. Capacity of Tank in Gallons. Diameter of Syphon in Inches Algernon Road 780 8 Brockley Road 800 8 Kemble Road 780 8 Kilmorie Road 700 8 Lawrie Park Gardens 780 8 Shuckburgh Road 650 8 Slaithwaite Road 780 8 The Yale 780 8 Waldenshaw Road 780 8 Hamlet of Penge.

Ancrley Road* 1 Beckenham Road 1 Beekenham Road* 1 Cintra Park* 1 Crampton Road 1 Ridsdale Road 1 Thornsett Road 1 Wheathill Road 1 Total 8 It is proposed to construct twelve flushing tanks in Lewisham and five in Penge, and twelve manholes in Lewisham and five in Penge during the current year, and provision has been made for the same in the Estimates. The total number of automatic flushing tanks constructed up to Lady-day, is as follows :— Parish of Lewisham 43 IIamlet of Penge10 Total 53 From the foregoing it will be seen that twelve flushing tanks and 23 manholes, &c., were added during the year to those already constructed in the older sewers; and I hope to see this * The small manholes which were constructed adjoining the new flushing tanks are marked with an asterisk. 13 good work continued year by year, for I feel sure it is a step in the right direction. Prevention is said to be better than cure. By a system of automatic flushing no solid matter is allowed to remain long enough in a sewer to ferment and generate gas, and moreover, at every discharge of water from a tank, the air in the sewer is forced out and a fresh supply is drawn in consequently a complete system of flushing is a great aid to thorough ventilation. I should like to see the system adopted in house drains, and for every house to have its automatic flushing tank. I know there would be an outcry about the cost of the water used; but surely in a question concerning health, expense should be a secondary consideration. My experience leads me to believe that house drains generally are far more defective than the public sewers. During the year a good deal of flushing was done through the manholes and gullies, by means of water carts, and the following quantities of disinfectants used in doing this : Permanganate of Potash 12 cwts. Sanitas Powder 7 tons. Jeyes' Perfect Purifier 140 gallons. Carbolic Acid 30 ,, Carbolic Powder 1 ton. The cost of these disinfectants was about £189. I cannot report that the temperature of the water in the Perry Yale and Church Vale Sewers was any lower than last year. The thermometers in these sewers were read 1,326 times, and a good deal of correspondence took place with the Forest Hill Brewery Company upon the subject. The coke fires in the large ventilatiug shaft of Ivy Lane Sewer was continued throughout the year, and with the same satisfactory results. The whole of the sewers have been periodically cleansed and inspected, and I do not hesitate to say they are much improved. I cannot help thinking the favourable death rate of the District testifies as to this. The work of cleaning and flushing the Sewers is not seen by the public, and very few know what is really done. RECREATION GROUNDS. The Penge Ground was completed during the year; but as I went rather fully into the matter in my last year's report I do not think I need say anything further. 14 SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE.

The only Bill deposited affecting the roads and sewers of the District was the Shortlands and Nunhead Railway, a lino miles long, connecting Shortlands, on the main line of the London Chatham and Dover Railway, with Nunhead, upon the same Company's system. The Bill is now before Parliament, and is opposed. I made a report on the line (Min., 33-17-1), and the promoters having agreed to certain conditions as to roads, bridges, sewers, &c., the Board are now supporting the Bill. There can be no doubt if the line be made it will be very useful to the public. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, &c. I regret to say that during the months of July and August some serious flooding took place in several parts of the District, caused by the heavy rainfall. I made a general report upon the subject (Min., 319-18-3) to the Works and General Purjjoses Committee, and after a great deal of consideration my recommendations were approved. I have now the works relating to Penge in hand, which I hope to complete as early as possible. There were 15 communications received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, asking 15 for suggestions upon frontage lines of buildings, &c., under the 75th and other sections of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862, which I reported upon. The following Table will show the result of these applications. I have again to mention that nothing, so far as I can ascertain, has been done by the South Eastern Railway to widen their main line (Tonbridge section) where it passes through the District, nor do I hear anything about the promised station at Hither Green. There were 106 statutory notices served on builders for commencing to build without giving notice, and some summonses taken out, and convictions obtained for this and other offences. Several rows of trees were planted in the roads, &c. Many street name boards and plates were put up, and a large number of tablets fixed upon the lanterns of the street lamps. During the year there were 185 drawings and tracings made in my office, a great number of reports, specifications and estimates prepared, together with many letters written. I append to this Report a list of New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works during the year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. 16 NEW STREETS SANCTIONED. Name of Street. Locality. Date or Sanction by the Metropolitan Board.
