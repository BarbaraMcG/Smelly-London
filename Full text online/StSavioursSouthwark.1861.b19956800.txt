Metropolis Local Management Act. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. THE SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT. LONDON: ASH AND FLINT, PRINTERS, LONDON BRIDGE, S.E. MDCCCLXII. THE SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE St. Sabiour's District Board of Works. RESPECTFULLY PRESENTED TO THE INHABITANTS. The Board, in making their Sixth Annual Report, beg to refer to that of their Medical Officer, and to the tabular statement accompanying the same as evidence of the sanitary condition of the District during the past year, and trust that the facts contained in such Report will show a proper estimate on the part of this Board, of the responsibility and importance of this branch of their operations. The construction of the extensive railway works, and also the formation of the new street through the District, have been watched carefully during their respective progress, and the Board have afforded facilities to the contractors where it appeared calculated to benefit the District. The Board also, in the case of the new street, memorialised the Metropolitan Board of Works, praying that Paving might be substituted for Macadam as originally proposed, which was acceded to; and in the course of the progress of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Additional Powers Bill, 1862, through Parliament, this Board presented a Petition against the same, and on their appearing upon such Petition, secured the adoption of several clauses, protecting the interests of the District in respect of carriage and footways in Holland Street, which were proposed to be interfered with by that Railway. 4 By the decease of Mr. Wm. Goodings and Thomas Mordey, two of the Annuitants under the late Commissioners of Clink pavements, the sums of £37 10s. and £22 10s. respectively have dropt, and also by the death of the late Clerk of the Works, an annuity to him of £20 l1s. 4d. which was not paid from his holding office under the Board has ceased, and as the Board did not deem it expedient to appoint a successor to Mr. Sharp, the whole of the duties of Surveyor and Clerk of the Works devolved upon Mr. Howe, the Surveyor, as provided for at the first. The Board have entered into a fresh contract with the Phœnix Gas Company, for the term of three years, for lighting the whole District at £4 5s. per lamp per annum, being a reduction of 2s. 6d. per lamp in St. Saviour's Parish, and 5s. per lamp in Christchurch. An experimental tramway has been laid down in the Blackfriars Road, one half formed of iron, upon Mr. Carey's plan, and the remainder of cube granite, laid down by Messrs. Mowlem, the Contractors of the Board, both of which plans appear to assist the heavy traffic at the foot of the bridge materially. The Works performed during the year, by direction of the Surveyor, &c., will form the next portion of the Report, and are as follows. 5 SURVEYOR'S REPORT, 1861 & 1862. BOROUGH DIVISION.

The smaller streets in the District have been repaired as occasion required, partly with new broken Granite and partly with old material taken off Blackfriars Road and with old material from Gravel Lane Yard. A new Tramway has been laid in Blackfriars Road from the south side of Stamford Street to Upper Ground Street, consisting of 134 feet super, of Carey's Patent Cast Iron Trams, 7 inch deep, 7and 427 feet super. 5 inch deep, extending to the crossing at Holland Street; the other part northward with 552 feet super. of 18 by 12 Granite Blocks, about half of this is laid with Guernsey and the other half with Aberdeen Stone, and paved, and the carrie-way made good to the Trams, &c. The ordinary general repairs of the foot and carriage-ways have been executed throughout the District, as the preceding list will show. The foot and carriage-ways have been materially interfered with and broken up through the District by the Metropolitan Board of Works' progress with the new street,* and also by the works of the Charing Cross Railway, (Mr. G. Wythes, the contractor, has entered into an agreement to make good all foot and carriage-ways disturbed by him to the satisfaction of the Board.) The foot and carriage-way pavements have been re-laid and made good after removals and alterations of Gas and Water Pipes. For Southwark and Yauxhall Water Company 213 cases Lambeth Water Company 155 do. Phoenix Gas Company 156 do. Forty-one Licences to put up Scaffolds and Hoards have been issued, and the Paving re-laid and made good after. * At the Meeting of the Metropolitan Hoard of Works, on June 27th, they determined to call it Southwark Street. 8 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen. Assuming the number of deaths to be a correct indication of the Sanitary Condition of London, a review of the mortality of the year 1861, produces an unfavorable result when compared with the year preceding. The mortality of the Metropolis for the past year was higher by about three thousand deaths than in 1860. The mean temperature of the air in that year having been low, it was distinguished by the comparative absence of diarrhœa and fevers, and the prevalence of bronchitis and other diseases of the respiratory organs. The higher temperature of 1861, while it tended to diminish these diseases, increased the mortality from diarrhœa, scarlet and typhus fevers. In my last Report, it was my pleasing duty to direct the attention of this Board to the satisfactory sanitary state of the St. Saviour's District, contrasted with the whole of London, and that division which forms the South District. The tables which I have prepared for your information on this occasion, unhappily give results, viewed either in connection with the entire Metropolis or the Southern portion, unfavorable to the health of the St. Saviour's District during the past year. The mortality in London was 232 per cent. of the population; in the South District 2.28 per cent., and in the St. Saviour's District 2.65, which shews a death rate in this District higher than the whole of London by about one in every three hundred living persons. This increased mortality is principally due to diseases of an epidemic character, and especially to scarlet fever. There was a decrease of 12 deaths from Small Pox, 9 from Measles and 3 from Typhus Fever, but an increase of 10 from Hooping Cough, 27 from Diarrhoea and 54 from Scarlet Fever. The total number of deaths from epidemic diseases was at the rate of 4.11 per thousand in the whole of London, 4.04 in the South District, and in the St. Saviour's 5.89. This disproportion still maintains itself, in comparing the mortality from scarlet and typhus fevers, with the mortality from epidemic diseases of all kinds. In London, in every hundred deaths from epidemic diseases 6.3 were from fevers; in the South Districts 6.6, and in St. Saviour's 8.8. It should, however, be observed that in making these comparisons, the St. Saviour's District is compared with very large areas, portions of which enjoyed almost entire immunity from fever. Many of the sub-districts of London exhibit an equally high mortality. Somers Town, West Islington, Belgravia, St. George's Bloomsbury, Battersea, and many others suffered with nearly equal severity; while in the North-west London District, 9 St. Olave, and some portions of Lambeth, the death rate was considerably higher. In the Waterloo Road Districts the rate of mortality from fevers was nearly double that of St. Saviour. These facts, lamentable in themselves, are still calculated to encourage those who are interested in the preservation of the public health, as they tend to confirm and establish those sanitary laws by which alone health can be preserved. The causes of disease and death are only partially under human control, and therefore, notwithstanding the full operation of the most prudent regulations, results will be variable. Still it may be safely affirmed that if public bodies charged with the duty of cleansing, draining and purifying the streets and houses of the Metropolis, efficiently perform that duty, disease and death will be kept at their lowest point. In comparing the deaths of the past year with the five years preceding, it will be seen that the number is larger than it has hitherto been my duty to record. The deaths in the years 1856 to 1861, inclusive, were respectively as follow:—868, 920, 1,047, 996, 929, 1,066. The average for the six years being 971, the past year was 95 in excess of the average. During this period the population of the Parish of St. Saviour has diminished, and that of Christchurch increased, but in the whole District there has been a gain. It should be observed that the loss of population in St. Saviour has been chiefly from among that class against whom it is seldom necessary to enforce sanitary regulations; and that while the house accommodation of the western portion of the District has very considerably diminished, the population has increased. It is in this locality that death from epidemic diseases have been most numerous. In Christchurch alone, with a population smaller than that of St. Saviour, 48 of the total of 72 died from scarlet fever, being exactly double the number of deaths in the smaller parish. This result might have been predicted from a consideration of the laws regulating health. Disease and death inevitably follow as the effects of the foul atmosphere of overcrowded dwellings. If to this cause be added intemperance, insufficient food and clothing, and that want of cleanliness, which to some extent is unavoidable in such circumstances, any other result should excite surprise. A complete demonstration of this relation of cause and effect is supplied by a comparison of the mortality among children in the poor and overcrowded districts of London with those less thickly populated, and by the wealthier classes. In every hundred persons who die in England 39 are children under five years of age. In London the proportion is forty in a hundred. But if particular localities are selected, it is found that this per centage suffers considerable variation. In St. Saviour's District it is about 41 per cent.; in St. George in the East about 44 per cent., and in St. George, Hanover Square, about 31 per cent. The mortality of children under five years rose to 50 per cent. in your District during the past year. This waste of human life appears almost incredible, and does not permit a doubt that there must be 10 thing very unsatisfactory in a neighbourhood where one half of those who died were thus prematurely cut off. The wealthy will always be able to secure comforts and care which must be unattainable to the poor; but, still, where labor is adequately remunerated, and wages prudently spent, the difference in the death rate of the young will be small. This Board can do but little to prevent overcrowding, or in promoting habits of personal cleanliness. To the laboring classes of this locality the one is almost a necessity, and the other a neglect, which circumstances have partially favored. The evil is admitted, and can scarcely be exaggerated, whether it be regarded in a physical, mental, or moral aspect. Families and acquaintances of both sexes and various ages cannot herd together in large numbers, without blunting the moral sense, as well as injuring the bodily health; and almost every recorded death represents a large amount of mental as well as physical suffering. As your Medical Officcr of Health, it is not within my power to prevent these evils; nor am I able to suggest a remedy. Amelioration must come from various sources before any permanent and satisfactory effect will be produced. I venture, however, to indicate what appear to have been some of the causes in increasing and perpetuating the over-crowding of this District. Undoubtedly the principal of these are the arbitrary power exercised by Railway Companies in ejecting the laboring classes from their homes without any obligation to provide for their domestic convenience, and the law for the relief and removal of the poor, which furnishes a strong motive for their continuance in the same locality, however limited its house accommodation may be. A considerably larger proportion of deaths from fever on the south side of the Thames during the past year, occurred in the Waterloo Road District of Lambeth and in the Parish of Christchurch, which it joins, than in any other District These are the Districts through which the Charing Cross Railway is bring constructed. The poorer classes have been unceremoniously turned out of their houses with a few shillings compensation, and have, in consequence, been compelled to undergo inconvenience and privation. The laborers of the wharves and warehouses of the waterside and the City are compelled to find domestic accommodation in these Southern Districts, and when deprived of their homes are obliged either to accept inferior lodgings at an increased rent, or risk the loss of their work by seeking a more distant abode. Over-crowding is also promoted by the existing law of removal. Many Members of this Board are aware that more than a half of the poor receiving relief from the St. Saviour's Union are not Parishioners, but persons who are entitled to what they receive in consequence of their having resided continuously in the Union for three years; and that any break in that residence would render them liable to be removed away, in many cases, to distant parts of the country. This, in most instances, would be tantamount to a cessation of relief. I am informed by those who come into daily contact with the poor, that numerous and anxious enquiries have 11 been made during the progress of the new street and the railway, by persons so circumstanced, as to the effect of their removal from the District, and that there has not been a single instance, among the many who have thus lost their homes, of a recipient of relief seeking a residence in another Parish. This law was doubtless intended as a boon to the poor, and has in many cases been proved to be a desirable relaxation, but in Districts such as yours, it is obvious that the suffering it entails more than equals the benefit it confers. I have thought it advisable to give prominence to these facts, in order to satisfy this Board that a large amount of disease and misery is beyond the power of such bodies, or their Officers, to remedy. Your Inspector of Nuisances has exercised his usual activity and vigilance, as the return of his labors, fully testifies. The localities where fever has appeared have been visited, and measures adopted to arrest its progress; and all that could be legally done to preserve health has been attempted. The District is in a state of transition, and the future may be anticipated with hope. When the new street and the railways are completed, and the inhabitants become more settled in their homes, there is every reason to expect that this District will bear a favorable comparison with the rest of London. Much disease has, doubtless, been prevented by the active operation of this Board, and we are prepared for any emergency that may unhappily arise. When the obligations of property become as fully recognized as its rights; and the legislature, by wholesome law, releases from thickly populated districts those whose occupations do not necessitate to remain; and when the laboring classes generally, enlightened in their true interests, cultivate habits of sobriety, prudence, and cleanliness, Public Boards will be able to effect a larger amount of good, and be in a position to exhibit happier results. Such a consummation can be attained only by individual efforts and influence co-operating with public agencies. Such co-operation does to some extent exist, and is yearly becoming more general. As the facts which I have thus laid before you are likely to facilitate this object it may be hoped that even an unfavorable sanitary report will lead to beneficial results. I beg, in conclusion, to invite your perusal of the appended tables. You will observe that the mortality among the inmates of the workhouse has not been large. One case of fever terminated fatally, but from this disease it was peculiarly exempt. There were during the year 36 deaths from unnatural causes, which occurred chiefly in the Hospitals, and no less than 12 of this number were either burnt or scalded children. With my sincere and respectful thanks for the uniform courtesy and kindness which I have received from this Board and its Officers, I beg to remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH.-Population at Census, 1861, 17,030.
