Mr.Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of presenting to you the Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Battersea for the year 1962. Following the practice of previous years the report is mainly statistical with comments on some points of interest. The population of the Borough has been declining and in 1962 there was a further reduction of 960 to 104,020. More details have now become available from the 1961 Census and I have, therefore, included in the body of the report the Ward populations for that year. I have also extracted from the 1961 Census and the 1951 Census certain data which throws some light on the variation in the population age groups of the Borough. Of particular interest is the 26.7 per cent increase in the number of elderly people over 80 years of age, despite a 9.6 per cent. overall decrease in the population. Although the population of the Borough is declining the number of births are increasing and in 1962 the birth rate was 20.81 per thousand of the population as compared with 19.18 last year. The rate for England and wales was 18.0. The death rate showed an increase at 11.90 from 10.87.The corresponding figures for London, and England and Wales, were 12.0 and 11.9 respectively. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was practically the same as in 1961, namely 45 as against 44, but owing to the increased numbers of births the infant mortality rate has dropped from 21.41 to 20.59. The number of deaths of infants in the first month of life was three fewer than in 1961, giving a neonatal death rate of 13.73 as against 16.06. In 1960 and 1961 no deaths occurred as a result of childbrith; this was something of a "record" in that it was the first time that no maternal deaths had been reported in consecutive years. In 1962 there was one maternal death giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.45. Apart from smallpox, which I will deal with more fully below, 1962 was not a Particularly notable year as far as infectious diseases were concerned. It was a non-measles year and as a result the number of cases of measles was 165 as compared with 1,906 in 1961. The total number of notifications of infectious diseases was 424 as against 2,187, the reduction being mainly due, as mentioned above, to the smaller number of cases of measles. I am happy to report that no cases of Poliomyelitis come to our notice during the year. The ninety-four cases of dysentery notified were mainly sporadic in nature, except for an outbreak at a day nursery 16 of the children. This disease is not normally a serious illness except in the very young or debilitated people, but it can have a considerable nuisance value especially when it arises in institutions such as day nurseries. Towards the end of 1961, smallpox was once again imported into this contury, on this occasion as a result of infected immigrants flying in from Pakistan. Cases arose in parts of London, the Midlands, the North and south Wales, and although no clinical case of the disease arose in Battersea, like most other health departments we were involved in the almost nation-wide operation of discovering and watching any possible source of infection. When smallpox is known to be present in the country, particular vigilance is paid to the early diagnosis of the 6 disease, and we had an increased number of requests from local general practitioners to see patients who it was thought might have smallpox. In addition the increased number of vaccinations which were performed at this time were associated with a number of unusual skin eruptions In some of the more puzzling and difficult cases, we in turn called Dr. McEntee, the Infectious Disease Consultant of St. George's Hospital, Tooting, and I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks and appreciation to Dr. McEntee for the willing help he afforded us at this time. In addition to requests to see doubtful cases, it was necessary to keep under daily surveillance persons who had been in contact with one of the known cases of smallpox and we were also notified by the Ministry of Health of travellers arriving from Pakistan who were staying in Battersea. In all 37 contacts were followed up and kept under surveillance, the closest contact being a taxi-driver who took a passenger, who subsequently developed smallpox, from London to the Midlands. Another problem in connection with smallpox, although not one directly for the Council, was the large number of requests for vaccination which were received. There was never any reason to advise mass vaccination of the population of Battersea; in fact we did all we could to restrain the demand for vaccination except, of course, where it was necessary on public health grounds. A proportion of the population, however, was insistent in demanding vaccination either by their private doctors or by the Public Health Department and it was felt that this demand should be met. Accordingly, arrangements were made through the London County Council for extending public facilities for vaccination. During this period approximately 11,000 people were vaccinated. In the event it appears that we struck a happy medium in our vaccination policy. By discouraging vaccination, except when it was necessary on public health grounds, the situation never got out of hand, while at the same time public morale was sustained in that anyone who felt that he should be vaccinated was vaccinated. The General Practitioners in the area were particularly helpful in arranging vaccinations for those of their own patients who sought their advice. It is interesting, in passing, to note the increased number of requests for the authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination which we received from the public. These Certificates are necessary for the purpose of foreign travel to certain countries and during the smallpox scare, it was thought that these Certificates might be required for travel on the Continent, although this is normally not the case. Instead of our "normal" number of International Certificates, which average between 400 and 450, we did in fact authenticate 2,789. One wonders whether the demand for vaccination in the early months of 1962 was as much to cover entry to the Continent as the desire to be protected against the illness. Full details of the work of the Public Health Inspectors will be found in tables in the report. Unfortunately, I cannot report any improvement in the staffing situation which remains as difficult as in previous years. This remains a matter for concern, particularly with the prospect of new legislation coming within the province of the Health Department and the Public Health Inspectors. For instance, the Housing Act of 1961 gave new powers to the local authorities to deal with conditions in houses let in lodgings or in multiple occupation. Little could be done until the Regulations made under the Act were introduced. The 7 lations became effective in 1962 and a good deal of attention was then given to this problem, which is one of considerable magnitude particularly in large towns, and it is likely that in London it is proportionally as large if not larger than elsewhere. The extent of the problem in Battersea, although it was thought to be quite considerable, was not exactly known, and it was felt desirable, as a preliminary, to ascertain as far as possible what exactly was its extent. A limited survey was, therefore, undertaken. One area of the Borough was selected where it was thought that the problem might be most acute and each property in this area, in all about 130 houses, was carefully inspected and certain facts and data collected. The main points of interest are to be found in the body of the report and little further comment is needed here since full accounts were given to the Housing Committee. In general the conditions found were better than might have been expected ; for instance there was very little "squalor", although squalor is not defined in the legislation and is subject to some differences of interpretation. It was not thought that many Management Orders would be necessary and that the best way to deal with the properties in this particular area would be by the service of Notice to make good any defects of the property and to require the provision of sanitary accommodation and other necessary facilities where this is possible, without causing the displacement of any family. It is Proposed, too, to use that section of the Act which enables the Council to put a limit on the number of persons that are permitted to occupy the Premises, having in mind the facilities available in such premises. In other words, it was apparent from this survey that there is no short term answer to this problem and that it must be dealt with as a long term and deliberate Public Health measure. This is the procedure which is being followed although, as I have indicated earlier, it is likely to be handicapped by the shortage of Public Health Inspectors. The work in connection with smoke control continued in 1962 and the Council's No. 2 Smoke Control Order covering 237 acres and 2,000 premises became operative in May. The No. 3 Smoke Control Order was declared in june, 1962, and confirmed by the Minister in October, the operative date being from 1st July, 1963. The work of inspection is now Proceeding on the No. 4 Area. Again this year I have included a map of the Borough showing the extent of the Smoke Control Areas already in operation and those proposed. In December, 1962, a very severe smog was experienced in the London Area almost exactly 10 years after the notorious fog of 1952, and this provided an opportunity of comparing the smog of 1962 with that of a decade earlier. Although personal impressions are unreliable, a number of people confirmed my own opinion that although there was no difference as regards density of the two smogs, in 1962 the irritation caused to the eyes and throat after being out in the fog for any length of time appeared to be less. It is not possible to confirm these impressions statistically because the smoke recording station was not in operation in 1952.A recent report covering the Administrative County of London shows that the amount of smoke recorded in 1962 was considerably less than the amount recorded in 1952. Although there was some reduction in the concentration of sulphur dioxide, this was not as marked as the reduction of the amount of smoke. The song of 1952, it will be remembered, was associated with a heavy mortality particularly amongst elderly people and it was feared that the same pattern of mortality might follow in 1962. Happily this 8 was not entirely the case. We know from our records that in 1952 there were 29 deaths from bronchitis and 48 deaths from heart disease in the three-week period following the fog. During 1962 over the ponding three-week period there were 17 deaths from bronchitis and 23 deaths from heart disease. In 1962 the 17 deaths from bronchitis were still considerably higher than those in the three-week period before the fog, when there were 4 deaths from this cause. These figures must be interpreted with caution but they suggest that although the 1962 fog again caused some increase in mortality, it was considerably less than in 1952. This is in line with the experience of local general practitioners who noted a moderate increase in cases of bronchitis and upper tory infections. It is tempting to attribute the diminished mortality of 1962 as compared with 1952 to the progress in making smoke control areas. It is probably justifiable to attribute some benefit to this factor, although caution is necessary because Battersea is only a comparatively small part of the London conurbation and a good deal of the smoke experienced in Battersea comes from outside the area, particularly from areas to the south-west. What was probably of equal importance as a cause of the reduced mortality, was the fact that the dangers of smog are now more widely known and in 1962 considerable publicity was given, particularly on the radio and television, warning elderly people and those suffering from chest troubles to stay indoors. There is little doubt that this advice was followed. On the whole one can be justifiably hopeful that when the whole of London is one vast smoke control area although we shall still have fogs because we cannot yet control atmospheric conditions, smogs as we have experienced them will be unknown with material benefits to the health of the community. During the year Mr. J. E. Woodhead, who had been the Council's Public Analyst for ten years, resigned his appointment and Mr. Dennis Forbes was appointed in his place. I should like to express the Public Health Department's thanks and appreciation to Mr. Woodhead for the help and co-operation in all matters relating to food and drugs administration which we enjoyed during his ten years of office as Public Analyst, and to wish him a long and happy retirement. With the appointment by the Council of Mr. Forbes as Public Analyst, the opportunity was taken to review our existing practice in the sampling of foodstuffs for analysis. It was decided that our existing practice was satisfactory but a few comparatively minor amendments were made. In December, Mr. F. Daniels retired from the service of the Health Department. He joined the Council's service in 1923, and was appointed Rodent Officer in 1944. Mr. Daniels left with the best wishes of everybody for a long and happy retirement. I should like again to thank the many people who have assisted in the work of the Health Department during 1962, particularly Counciller Miss E. A. Coles, J.P., Chairman of the Public Health Committee. The staff of the Health Department have, as usual, been assiduous in their duties, and I would like to thank them for their work during the year, and also the Chief Officers and staff of other Departments for their help and co-operation. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, May, 1963. Medical Officer of Health. 9 Public Health in Retrospect 1862-1962 Continuing my reading of the Annual Reports written by Medical Officers of Health for the Parish of Battersea one hundred years ago, I think the following information and extracts from the Report by Dr.W. Connor the year 1862, together with comparative figures for 1962, will be of interest. The estimated population of the Parish of Battersea in 1862 was 20,300 (1962—104,020), an increase of 718 over the 1861 Census figure, The population at the time of the 1851 Census was 10,560, and in 1841 is was only 6,617- a threefold increase in twenty years. It would appear that about one-third of this increase was due to the natural increase of births over deaths, and at that time it was considered that the other two-thirds was due to immigration in connection with the rapidly expanding manufacturing businesses in Battersea. (Between 1952 and 1962 there was a decrease in population of approximately 12,000.) In 1862,of the 491 Battersea deaths (1962—1,345) 113 occurred from the following infectious diseases : Small Pox—2, Measles—16, Scarlatina—15, Diphtheria—8, Whooping Cough—25, Typhus and Infantile Fever—17, Erysipelas—7, Diarrhoea and Dysentery—22, Cholera- 1. (In 1962 there were no deaths from any of these causes.) Speaking of an excess of 293 births over deaths which occurred during the year 1862 (1962—841) Dr. Connor reports : — "This large natural increase also favours the view taken of the sanitation carried out in this sub-district having experienced a very great influence in promoting the health and comfort of the inhabitants." In 1862, Battersea was one of five parishes comprising the Wandsworth District of the Board of Works, the others being Clapham, Wandsworth, Putney and Roehampton, and Streatham including Tooting and Balham. It is interesting to note that Dr. Connor reports that during the year, out of a total of 679 water-closets constructed in the entire District, 477 were in Battersea ; of 686 houses supplied with water, 477 were in Battersea, and of 636 dustbins provided, 477 were in Battersea. As Dr. Connor reports—" It will be manifest . . . that there has been no abatement of the energy with which Sanitary improvements have been carried out in former years; indeed it must be conceded to this sub-district that, seeing the many drawbacks which every large manufacturing population always presents to the attainment of a high sanitary status, it has during the seven years of the operation of the Metropolis Local Management Act, made great advances towards that which legislation has sought to accomplish." 10 Principal Figures for 1962.

For the purpose of standardisation, the Registrar-General's area comparability factors, which make allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that or England and Wales as a whole, have been applied to the rates for births and deaths. The factor for births is 0.99, and for deaths 0.92. POPULATION. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 104,020, which shows a decrease of 960 on the previous estimated figure of 104,980 in 1961. This estimate has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. During the year, the Registrar-General published a report on the Census taken in April, 1961." The population of the Borough at the Census was 105,870 (50,620 males and 55,250 females, a proportion of 100 males to 109 females). This figure shows a decrease of 11,270 (or 9.6 per cent.) on the population at the previous Census taken in April, 1951,when it was 117,140 (54,852 males and 62,288 females). The following tables show a comparison between various groupings of the population figures published in that report and those obtained at the Census in 1951.

The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1962 was 529 (264 males, 265 females). Of this number 11 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough and 1,668 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 2,186 births (1,162 males, 1,024 females, an excess of 138 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 20.81 per 1,000 population. All the Battersea births (518 live and 9 still) which occurred Within the Borough were " domiciliary births." Illegitimate live births numbered 339 or 15.5 per cent, of the live births. The live birth rate for England and Wales was 18.0. Still-Births. The Registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926.

The death rate amongst illegitimate children during 1962 was 32.45 per 1,000 illegitimate live births, as compared with 12.93 in 1961. The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in 1962 was 18.41, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 176 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1961 was 70 to 100. Maternal Mortality. There was one death from "diseases or accidents of child-birth" during 1962, which is equivalent to a fatality rate of 0.45 per 1,000 births (live and still). This was due to gas-forming septicaemia following instrumental abortion. The rate for England and Wales in 1962 was 0.35.

During the year 424 notifications of cases of infectious disease were received, which when compared with 2,187 received in 1961 shows a decrease of 1,763. This decrease was mainly due to the number of measles cases reported—165 as compared with 1,906 in 1961. One case of salmonella para-typhoid B occurred during the year in a three-year-old boy. The source of infection was not discovered and all contacts were negative. There was an outbreak of sonnei dysentery in a day nursery situated within the Borough, affecting 16 of the children. The illness was mild in nature, although it was a month before the final child was re-admitted to the nursery. The total number of dysentery cases notified during the year was 94, an increase of 62 over 1961, when 32 cases were notified. This increase cannot be offset by the outbreak in the nursery, for a similar outbreak occurred in 1961 but in a different nursery. Although no case of smallpox occurred in the Borough, there were 37 contacts, who were examined daily by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. All were offered the protection of vaccination. Owing to the number of imported cases, the total number of International Certificates of vaccination against smallpox presented to the Department authentication was six times greater than in 1961—2,789 as compared with 459. There were no cases of poliomyelitis during the year. Analysis of Cases (after Correction of Diagnosis) of Infectious Disease Notified during the Year 1962.

During the year 1962 there were 75 cases of tuberculosis (all forms) notified in Battersea as compared with 63 in 1961, 79 in 1960, in 1959, 75 in 1958 and 100 in 1957. In addition 49 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 124 cases for the year. The case rate per 1,000 population (excluding inward transfers) was 0.72 or 72 per 100,000. At the end of the year there were 947 pulmonary cases and 53 non-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis on the Register. This is equal to a morbidity rate per 1,000 population of 9.10 in the case of pulmonary, and 0.51 in the case of non-pulmonary tuberculosis or 9.61 both types. The tables on page 20 give details of additions and deletions of cases on the Register during the year. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1962 deaths from tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 12. All were due to pulmonary tuberculosis. The death rates per 100,000 of the population during the 60 years ended 1960 in quinquennial averages, and for the years 1961 and 1962, given in the following table:— Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 19l6-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 1946-1950 53.1 6.1 59.2 1951-1955 22.1 2.8 24.9 1956-1960 9.7 1.1 10.8 Average (60 years) 86.9 20.2 107.1 1961 11.4 1.0 12.4 1962 11.5 - 11.5 The death rate per 100,000 population was 6.6. for England and Wales. 20 Tuberculosis, 1962.

Diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation and vaccination against smallpox and poliomyelitis were carried out during the year under the arrangements made by the London County Council. 22 INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION and INOCULATION. At the request of the Ministry of Health arrangements are made for the authentication, by the Medical Officer of Health, of certificates of vaccination and inoculation issued by medical practitioners in the Borough in respect of persons going abroad. During 1962, 2,789 certificates were authenticated. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, Section 26. This section is concerned with the prevention of the spread of notifiable infectious diseases, and the diseases to which section 23 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, applies. It authorises a Metropolitan Borough Council, if they think fit to compensate a person who is required by the Medical Officer of Health to cease his or her employment to prevent the spread of the disease. The Health Committee decided that compensation to be paid should be based on the merits of each case reported. One case was dealt with during the year. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The bacteriological examination of clinical material (with the exception of sputum which is dealt with at the Chest Clinic) was carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service, County Hall Westminster Bridge, S.E.I. No charge is made to the Council for these examinations. During the year 1,501 examinations were made as follows:— Description Disease Number of Specimens Positive Results Faeces Dysentery or Food Poisoning 1,452 297 Throat Swabs Diphtheria 49 - 23 Sanitary Circumstances.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 60 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, By-laws, Regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below:— Cases Public Health (London) Act, 1936 41 By-laws re drainage 6 Housing Act, 1957 1 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 8 Consumer Protection Act, 1961 1 National Assistance Act, 1948, and National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 2 Clean Air Act, 1956 1 60 Fines totalling £78 0s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £51 18s. 0d. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling-houses could be secured. During the year, Intimation Notices (relating to 686 premises) and Statutory (Nuisance) Notices (relating to 343 premises) were served. It was found necessary to refer 116 cases to the Council's Solicitor with instructions to take steps, by legal proceedings if necessary, to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices. In 75 of these cases a warning letter from the Solicitor had the desired effect. In the remaining 41 cases, however, summonses had to be issued. As a result, Nuisance Orders were made by the Court in 21 instances. The remaining 20 summonses were ultimately withdrawn, the Notices having been complied with subsequent to the issue of the summonses. Defective conditions in 801 houses were remedied—447 by owners following the service of Intimation Notices; 346 by owners following the service of Statutory Notices, and in 8 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken, and the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. Section 25 of the above Act relative to choked drains was used on 45 occasions. This Section enables a notice to be served upon as owner or occupier to clear a stopped-up drain, water-closet or soil pipe, within forty-eight hours. If the notice is not complied with the Council may carry out the work and recover the cost. It was necessary for the Council to do the work on 15 occasions. 25 Section 26 enables the Council to re-instate a water supply to a dwelling after the supply has been withdrawn by the Metropolitan Water Board following a defect in the supply pipe or fittings. Notices were served on seven occasions and in two cases the Council did the work in default. Authority has been given by the Council to the Medical Officer of health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and the Chief Public Wealth Inspector to serve Section 27 notices on behalf of the Council to remedy nuisances within a specific time where unreasonable delay Would be occasioned by following the normal procedure. It was necessary to serve seven such notices during the year, and the Council carried out the work in default of the owner on three occasions. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1925, Section 33. Because of recurring nuisances arising from the deposition of insanitary refuse, and the improper use of open sites, action was taken under the provisions of the above Section. Two Notices were served, and in one instance the Council carried out the clearance and the enclosure of the site in default of the owner, the cost being chargeable to the owner. In the other case, the owners asked for time to enable them to obtain permission to erect garages on the site. This was agreed. The refuse, however, was cleared from the site at the owners' expense. Dustbins. During the year, 23 notices were served under Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, concerning the provision of dustbins, and 46 dustbins were provided, 5 being supplied by the Council in default of the owners, from whom the cost was afterwards recovered. Drainage Work. Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing premises, and drainage in connection with conversion schemes, are carried out under the supervision of officers of the Department. Drains were constructed to 147 new dwellings, and 183 plans of proposed work were deposited in connection with drainage generally, During the year, 104 drains were tested with smoke—44 of these were found to be defective. The water test was applied on 1,162 occasions to drain in the course of construction. 22 frontage drains (the length of drain between the house property to its connection with the sewer) were constructed or reconstructed. This work is carried out by the Council's workmen under the supervision of the Inspectors. Drainage and Watercloset By-laws made by the London County Council are enforced by the Council. In 16 instances it was necessary to request the Council's Solicitor to take legal action for non-compliance with the by-laws in connection with the failure by persons concerned to notify the Council of the work to be carried out, or work carried out which did not comply with the requirements of the By-laws. In 10 instances the By-laws were complied with before summonses were heard, but the remaining 6 cases were dealt with by the Magistrate. Fines totalling £6 0s. 0d. were imposed. The Drainage By-laws made in 1936 by the London County Council were revised and new By-laws came into operation on the 1st May, 1962. They form a new basis upon which drainage work can be carried out, 26 having regard to the new materials now available. They provide for the use, in addition to traditional materials, of such materials as asbestos for soil and waste fittings, polythene tubing, and pitch-impregnated drain pipes. These materials must conform with the appropriate British Standard Specification and Code of Practice, which prescribe the quality of the material and the standard of workmanship. Sewerage and Sewers. The sewerage system, in common with other London Boroughs, discharges into the main London County Councils sewers, and disposal is carried out by the County Council. The Borough Council's brick and pipe sewers are regularly cleansed, and are adequate for their purposeOccasional back-flooding is experienced in the lower part of the Borough during heavy summer storms; these conditions are receiving attention and the London County Council are reconstructing and enlarging some of their existing main sewers with a view to overcoming this problem- Reconstruction of the pumping station at Creek Street is at hand, and a new pumping station is in the course of construction at Nine Elms. Water Supply. The major part of the water supply in Battersea, in common with other Metropolitan Boroughs, is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board, who are responsible for its purity, and with whom close liaison is maintained. One part of the Borough, however, namely the Council's Latchmere Estate, is supplied from deep wells situated at the Latchmere Baths adjoining the Estate. Bacteriological examination of the well-water before chlorination. and prior to its supply to the Estate, is carried out at fortnightly intervals. Chemical analysis shows no significant change in the character of the water. In the event of a breakdown of the pumping apparatus serving the Latchmere Estate, or any other contingency, the system can be adjusted to receive water from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. All the premises in the Borough have a mains water supply, and it is not thought that any stand-pipes still exist. During the year 17 certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 147 new or re-erected dwellings. Forty-five notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Caravans. All caravan sites in the Borough are licensed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959. The conditions attaching to licences granted relate to the number of moveable dwellings which may be kept on any particular area of land ; the amount of free space between the dwellings; the provision of a water supply, sanitary conveniences, adequate paving, dustbin accommodation, fire protection arrangements and the prevention of nuisance from noise. The five sites in the Borough are regularly inspected, and during the year 167 inspections were made. 27 Mobile Dwellings. In addition to the five permanent sites, licences have been granted on the application of the London County Council for the siting of "mobile" dwellings on areas of land cleared for development purposes, out not required for immediate use. The sites covered are as follows:— Vicarage Crescent 5 bungalows Roundell Street and Bramwell Street 5 bungalows Gonsalva Road Area 27 bungalows Site of Nos. 36-44 Sleaford Street 3 bungalows Site of Nos. 192-200 Thessaly Road 4 bungalows The intention is to move these dwellings on to other sites when the site so used is required for permanent building. It is on this basis that the dwellings are erected—the drainage being of pitch fibre, which can be readily moved from site to site, and in place of concrete over-site, pre-cast paving slabs are used and jointed. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestation of rats and mice and where possible to prevent infestations occurring. These duties are carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by two Rodent Operatives. All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Public Health Inspectors. In the case of private dwellings the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Rodent Control Staff free of cost, and on request at business premises, where the cost is charged in full. The baiting of sewers under the control of the Council is undertaken three times during the year. Similar work is carried out by all London Boroughs, and has the result of reducing the rat population not completely, but to an irreducible minimum. The following table shows the number of premises inspected which were found to be infested with rats or mice:— Property Infested by Rats Mice Major Minor Major Minor Council's properties — 3 — 7 Dwelling houses — 159 1 54 Business premises — 24 5 17 — 186 6 78 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 3,265. 28 Verminous Premises. During the year 140 premises which were found to be infested with vermin were disinfested. The insecticide used contains Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T. and gives a prolonged residual effect. This is a considerable reduction in verminous premises dealt with compared with last year, when the figure was 269. Dangerous Structures. During the course of inspection for any purpose carried out by the officers of the Department, should any dangerous structure or any dangerous condition appertaining to a building be noticed, the District Surveyor of the London County Council is notified for any action he may decide to take. 69 such cases were notified. Local Land Charges. Enquiries relating to Local Land Charges in connection with Notices served by the Department, information concerning the issue of Disrepair Certificates, and the way in which premises are drained, are regularly received. These enquiries require a careful search of records and drainage plans. During the year, 1,738 enquiries were dealt with. Shops Act, 1950. It is the duty of the Council to carry out the requirements of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950. Inspections are carried out with regard to the provision of ventilation to shops; the means for providing a reasonable temperature; adequate and suitable sanitary conveniences for the use of persons employed in or about a shop; adequate lighting: suitable washing facilities, and suitable facilities for the taking of meals in a shop where this is considered necessary. During the year 145 inspections were made, and 10 notices were served in connection with the provision of the required facilities. One application for an exemption certificate in respect of sanitary conveniences was received in connection with a shop where restricted space precluded the provision on the premises of such accommodation The applicant had made arrangements for persons employed in the shop to have the use of the necessary facilities in nearby premises, and the application was granted. Common Lodging Houses. There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The principal provisions of the Act relate to the registration of premises in which rag flock or other materials are used in upholstery, etc., and the licensing of premises used for the manufacture and storage of rag flock. An authorised officer of the Council has the right of entry, inspection and sampling of any filling materials. The Medical Officer of Health and Public Health Inspectors are deemed to be authorised officers. Regulations made by the Minister, based on the 1961 edition of the standard for cleanliness of filling materials used by British Standards Institution, prescribe the standard of cleanliness for each kind of filling material, the method of testing samples, and the nature of the tests to be applied. 29 There are three registered premises in the Borough at which filling Material other than rag flock are used, one having closed during the year. Samples of the fillings used are submitted to analysis. There are no premises at present dealing with rag flock. Six visits were made to registered premises during the year, but no contravention of the Act was discovered. Rag Dealers and Sorters. Premises occupied by rag sorters in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 101 inspections were made. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat melting is carried on. The firms concerned have been established for many years, and the trades are conducted satisfactorily. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act is chiefly concerned with the distribution by sale or otherwise of poisonous substances. The list of poisons is contained in an Order made under the Act. This Order is divided into Part I and Part II. With the poisons contained in Part I, the Council are not concerned, since an "authorised seller" is a pharmacist registered with the Pharmaceutical Society, and enforcement is entrusted to Inspectors appointed by that Society. Substances specified in Part II may be sold by "listed sellers", and these are persons who, on written application in a prescribed form, and on payment of stated fees, are recorded by the Council as "persons entitled to sell poisons in Part II of the Poisons List" at the premises recorded on the Register. The Council are required to enforce the Act and Orders so far as they relate to "listed sellers" and have appointed the Public Health Inspectors as Inspectors under the Act. At the end of the year there were 81 persons registered under the Act. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The object of the Act is to regulate the sale of pet animals, with particular reference to their welfare whilst kept for sale in pet shops. a pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Licences were issued in respect of 10 shops and 13 visits were made during the year. Barbers and Hairdressers. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954—Section 18. The Council, under the provisions of the above-named Section, registers all barbers and hairdressers and their premises. At the end of the year there were 91 registered premises in the Borough, and 153 inspections were carried out. Noise Abatement Act, 1960. Since the passing of this Act, the number of complaints concerning noise have grown considerably. 30 Prior to the passing of the Act, the law governing noise nuisance in London was contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937, which provided that any "excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary noise which was injurious to health" could be dealt with summarily as a nuisance. The proof necessary to satisfy these requirements before Court procedure could be instituted is often difficult to obtain. The new Act substitutes for these words "noise which is a nuisance", and the procedure is thereby simplified, the nuisance depending on opinion. It is not necessary to prove injury to health, or that the noise was excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary. With regard to industrial noise, however, it is still a good defence to prove that the best practicable means have been used to prevent or counteract its effect. As well as the Council having authority to take action, any three persons who are aggrieved by a noise nuisance can take action by complaining to a Magistrate. It has been the practice of the Health Department to take all the necessary action when complaints of noise have arisen in connection with a trade or business. Industrial noise clearly has got a health angle, in that it is often continuous and of considerable intensity. The service of Notices has not been necessary, because a letter calling attention to the complaint has invariably had the desired results. Complaints, however, received from persons who complain that rowdy parties take place at certain times in adjoining premises, or that the person in the flat above causes undue noise, are not considered the type of complaint that should be dealt with by the Inspectors. There would appear to be no specific hazard, but rather a personal problem arising from, in the majority of cases, behaviour difficulties between neighbours. This is the type of complaint that could well be dealt with by the persons aggrieved. Consumer Protection Act, 1961. This Act repealed the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. and the Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960, but Regulations made under the former Act concerning fireguards on certain heating appliances offered for sale are still in force, and new Regulations have been rnade concerning oil burners, specifying standards of safety, and prohibiting the sale of oil heaters or component parts which do not comply with the Regulations. During the year legal proceedings were taken against a firm for having in their possession, for the purpose of selling, a second-hand electric fire not complying with the Regulations relating to fireguards. The defendants pleaded guilty, and were fined £2. Licensing Act, 1961. Under Section 31 of the Licensing Act, 1961, it is provided that where a Club applies for a registration certificate for the sale of intoxicating liquor in respect of any premises, an Officer of the local Authority, authorised in writing, may inspect the premises. The Public Health Inspectors have been so authorised, and ten inspections were made. The inspection is primarily concerned to see that adequate sanitary facilities are available, but the Inspector is also required to report upon the suitability of the premises for the proposed use. 31 Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. During the year 1962 construction of the following 147 new dwellings was completed:— By the Battersea Borough Council:— Dwellings Henry Harrison Court, Spencer Road 8 Wheeler Court, Plough Road 24 32 By the London Countv Council:— Aegis House, Thessaly Road 54 Beacon House, Thessaly Road 3 142/176 Thessaly Road 18 Mobile dwellings:— Orville Road 5 Thessaly Road and Aegis Grove 4 84 By Private Owners:— 29 Atherton Street 3 18, 20 Brassey Square 2 12, 14, 177, 179, 181 Elsley Road 5 62, 64, 66, 183 Eversleigh Road 4 28b Granard Road 1 52, 54, 56 Holden Street 3 54, 56, 58 Sabine Road 3 1-10 "Rushleigh," 32 Thurleigh Road 10 31 Total 147 Slum Clearance. During the year, one area (Doddington Road South) which formed part of the Battersea Park Road Area was represented for slum clearance, Thirty-five houses were inspected and all were represented as unfit. Compulsory Purchase Orders in respect of twelve small areas, containing 53 dwellings in the Winstanley Road district, which had been made by the Council in 1961, were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government following a Public Inquiry. These Areas were as follows:— Creek Street Nos. 1 and 3 Areas. Grant Road Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Areas. Lavender Road Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 Areas. Meyrick Road, Nos. 2, 3 and 4 Areas. Inspections made during 1962 in connection with slum clearance totalled 174. Closing Orders. Under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957, one Closing Order in respect of a dwelling house was made during the year; 6 underground room and 2 rooms in other parts of dwellings were closed under Section 18 of the Act. 32 Overcrowding. Eight cases of overcrowding creating offences against the pro visions of Section 78 of the Housing Act, 1957, were investigated and appropriate action taken to secure the abatement of the overcrowding. In one case legal proceedings were taken against the landlord, who was fined £1, and £2 costs were awarded to the Council. Housing Act, 1961. Part II of this Act contains amendments to the Housing Act, 1957. One of its most important provisions relates to Houses in Multiple Occupation and to Regulations that have now been made by the Minister. New and greatly strengthened powers are given to Local Authorities, and these powers fall into four main groups:— (1) Power to apply a Code of Management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed. The requirements for this Code are prescribed in the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, which came into operation May, 1962. (2) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living standards, and provision of adequate means of escape from fire. (3) Power to carry out works in default and recover the cost. (4) Power to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house or part of a house in multiple occupation. These powers are strong enough to deal with the worst type multi-occupied houses where anything less would be unlikely to achieve results. It may, in many cases, however, be possible to effect improvements in the management of a house by informal approach, without the need to make a Management Order or the service of Notices. This in fact has been done in two cases. An area in the Borough, containing a large number of properties in multiple occupation, has been inspected to obtain some indication of the problems to be met in the application of the new powers. The survey showed that overcrowding was not as serious as was at first anticipated. A number of these cases were due to the natural increase of the size of the family since occupation. Certain houses were found to be let in single rooms to individual men, and the weekly rents from these premises were high. The houses, however, were in good structural and decorative repair, and well managed. They were occupied mostly by coloured students who took most of their meals out. Generally, there was a lack of watercloset accommodation, the waterclosets being shared by several families. Houses containing bathrooms lacked a hot water supply, and where the use of the bathroom was shared the facility was not valued by the occupiers. In none of the houses in the area were there conditions of squalor or gross neglect. It is the intention to deal with Houses in Multiple Occupation, and to complete a Register as suggested by the Minister, so that conditions in such houses are always under review. 33 The following is a summary of the information obtained in the area inspected. Number of Houses in Area 130 Number of Separate Lettings 418 FURNISHED LETTINGS UNFURNISHED LETTINGS No. of rooms No. of rooms 1 2 3 4 5 + Total 1 2 3 4 5+ Total 95 47 11 — I 154 5 62 73 41 83 264 Number of 1-room lettings occupied by 1 person 65 2 persons 24 3 or more persons 11 Cases of overcrowding or non-separation of the sexes 13 Number of these cases due to natural increase 9 Number of these cases let so as to be overcrowded 4 Number of 2-room lettings occupied by 1 person 23 2 persons 39 3 or more persons 47 Cases of overcrowding or non-separation of the sexes 24 Number of these cases due to natural increase 12 Number of these cases let so as to be overcrowded 12 Number of 3-room lettings occupied by 1 person 18 2 persons 36 3 or more persons 30 Cases of overcrowding or non-separation of the sexes 2 Number of these cases due to natural increase Nil.

Certificates of Disrepair. Rent Act, 1957. The following table shows the work carried out during the year m connection with Certificates of Disrepair:— Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) received 17 Decisions to issue Certificates of Disrepair (Form (J) 13 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) 5 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) accepted 4 Certificates of Disrepair (Form L) issued 9 Certificates of Disrepair refused Nil Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) received 9 Cancellations of Certificates of Disrepair issued 7 Application for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from landlords 4 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from tenants 5 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to landlords 3 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to tenants 5 Inspections carried out 47 The number of applications received for the issue, and for cancellation, of Certificates of Disrepair, and for Certificates re undertakings, showed a decrease when compared with the previous year, as did the number of Certificates of Disrepair cancelled during the year. At the end of 1962 there were still 155 Certificates of Disrepair in force. Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). During 1962 a total of 461 cases were dealt with on the grounds of ill-health or unsuitable accommodation. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 20 applications and 8 cases were referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration on these grounds. In 4 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis. In 25 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council notify cases in which the application to that Council alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. 35 Factories and Outworkers. Factories Act, 1961. Metropolitan Borough Councils are responsible for the enforcement °* the provisions of this Act in regard to:— (i) Sanitary conveniences—Section 7—In all factories. (ii) Cleanliness, Overcrowding, Temperature, Ventilation, and Drainage of Floors—Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6—In all factories where mechanical power is not used. (iii) Certificates of Suitability for Basement Bakehouses—Section 54—In all basement bakehouses. (iv) Water Supply (where derived from a source other than the public mains)—-Section 53—In all factories. A table giving the number of factories on the register at the end of the year, with the number of inspections, defects found, and action taken, is, at the request of the Minister of Health, given as an annexe to this Report. The following table shows the factories in the Borough, classified according to the trades carried on. Factories Classified according to Trades.

These were 12 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year, All these are classed as factories, and 10 of them use mechanical power. Fifty-six inspections were made and three notices served. Three of the bakehouses were "basement bakehouses" within the meaning of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937. 36 Outworkers. During the year, in February and August, lists of outworkers were received from Battersea employers and from other authorities as required by the Factories Act, 1961. Some of these lists included outworkers not residing in Battersea, and these were forwarded to the appropriate authorities. The total number of registered outworkers' premises in the Borough at the end of the year was 122 (including 1 contractor). The total number of inspections made was 265. The premises were found to be generally satisfactory, and it was not necessary to serve any notices or to take any other action. The following table gives details of the outworkers' premises:- Trade Premises Number on Register Workrooms Persons employed Wearing Apparel 86 90 95 Curtains 2 2 2 Boxes, etc 4 4 5 Button Carding 1 1 1 Lamp Shades 26 30 30 Other Trades 3 3 3 122 130 136 A further table, giving prescribed particulars under Part VIII of the Act, will be found as part of the annexe to this Report on page 56. 37 Atmospheric Pollution. Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke Control Areas. Following confirmation by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in 1961, the Council's No. 2 Smoke Control Order, covering 237 acres and 2,000 dwellings, became operative on the 1st May, 1962. The Battersea No. 3 Smoke Control Order was declared by the Council in June, 1962, and confirmed by the Minister in October, the only modification being the postponement of the operative date from the 1st May to 1st July, 1963. The No. 3 Area, covering 291 acres and 3,638 dwellings, extends the No. 1 and No. 2 Areas. That part of the Borough enclosed by the Borough boundary on the south, east and west, and Battersea Rise and Clapham Common North Side on the north is now covered by Smoke Control Orders. The No. 4 Order will extend this area northwards to Lavender Hill, and St. John's Hill as far as the railway lines. The survey of the No. 4 Area is in hand, and it is hoped to report on this area in 1963. The map on the next page indicates the extent of the Smoke Control Areas in the Borough. During the year 3,797 visits were made; 267 applications for approval of proposed works of adaptation and estimated costs, relating to 611 conversions of fireplaces, were received ; grants approved amounted to £4,307 18s. 0d. Smoke, etc., Nuisances and Observations. During the year, 13 complaints were made alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from the premises in various parts of the Borough. All these complaints received careful and sometimes prolonged investigation. In addition to dealing with specific complaints, observations are kept upon the chimneys of any industrial plant which merits observations, and the appropriate action taken. A total number of 268 observations were made. Four notices were served. A summons was issued under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, against a demolition contractor, whose workmen continually ignited large bonfires on cleared sites, causing a serious nuisance to people in the surrounding neighbourhood. The Court, however, was not satisfied that a nuisance had been caused, and the Summons was dismissed. The effluvia nuisance from one particular firm, to which reference was made in last year's Report, occurred fairly repeatedly, and was the subject of a number of reports to the Committee. This culminated in the attendance before the Committee, at their request, of officers of the firm, who explained to the Committee the complete reorganisation of the firm's manufacturing processes in an attempt to eliminate the nuisance. Although the position has improved considerably, complaints are still being received and the matter is being kept under continuous observation. 39 Smoke Measuring Station. The smoke measuring station installed in the Department in 1956 continues to give valuable information concerning smoke density and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The readings are taken by members of the staff of the Department, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research receive the results and collate the information with other results obtained from Authorities all over the Country. Notification of Installation of Furnaces. Notification is required under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, of the installation of any furnace with a heating capacity of 55,000 B.T.U's or more per hour. The Section does not generally apply to furnaces designed solely or mainly for use for domestic purposes. The Purpose of the Section is to see that any new furnaces installed shall be so far as is practicable, capable of being operated without emitting smoke. Ten such notifications were received during the year. Exemption of Premises engaged in Investigation and Research. Section 21 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, provides for firms engaged in research with regard to air pollution and the efficiency of furnaces generrally to apply for exemption in the event of emission of smoke above the prescribed density. One application for exemption under this Section was received, and this was granted for one year. No untoward emissions were observed. 40 Protection of Food Supply. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is sold or stored is carried out as a routine. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and regulations made thereunder, is the principal Act under which action is taken. FOOD PREMISES. As at 31st December, 1962.

Section 16 (a) of the Food and Drags Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the sale, or manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice cream, or the storage of ice cream intended for sale. The number of premises registered at the end of the year was 280. Prior to registration, the premises are inspected as to suitability before recommendation to the Health Committee. The majority of applications are for the sale of pre-packed ice cream from refrigerated containers, Particular attention is paid to the 12 premises where manufacture takes place, and samples of the product are taken for examination. (See page 45). Butchers' Shops. There are 64 butchers' shops in the Borough. All these shops are systematically inspected, 1,232 visits having been made during the year.

All grocers' shops are subject to routine inspections, and following a report concerning contraventions of the Food Hygiene (General) Ragulations, 1960, at a grocer's shop, three summonses were issued against the shop-keeper. The defendant was fined £3 on each summons and ordered to pay £3 costs. Catering Establishments. All restauants, cafes, canteens and kitchens are regularly inspected throughout the year. There are 213 of these premises on the Register, and 844 inspections were made, 6 notices under the Food Hygiene Regulation being served. Two summonses were issued against the proprietor of a cafe for failing to keep the premises in good order and repair, and for allowing refuse to accumulate in a food room, contrary to the Regulations. The defendant pleaded guilty, but was conditionally discharged, provided the necessary repairs were executed within two months. He was also ordered to pay £2 2s. 0d. costs. 42 Food Stalls.

The analysis of samples of food and drugs purchased formally and informally under the Food and Drugs Act is carried out by Public Analyst for the Borough, D. G. Forbes, Esq., b.sc., f.R. I. C at his premises, 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11 General bacteriological examination, and the examination samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream, is carried out by Public Health Laboratory Service. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1962 was 124. In addition, 300 informal samples were procured. Of the 424 formal and informal samples procured for analysis, three informal samples (0.1 per cent.) were reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated. The percentages of samples reported by the Public Analyst be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1960 are given in . following table.

One hundred formal samples of milk were taken during the year, Of the 100 samples, 21 were designated as "Channel Islands" or " South Devon" milk, for which a higher minimum Perecentage (viz., 4 per cent.) of milk fat content is provided for under arrangements made between the producers and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. All of these samples were reported to be in conformity with this standard, their average composition being : — Milk fat 4.51 per cent. Non-fatty solids 9.11 Total milk solids 13.62 45 The milk fat content of the 21 samples of "Channel Islands" of "South Devon " milk ranged as under:— between 4.8 and 4.9 per cent. 2 samples. 4.7 „ 4.8 „ 3 „ 4.6 „ 4.7 „ 2 „ 4.5 „ 4.6 „ 5 „ „ 4.4 „ 4.5 „ 4 „ 4.3 „ 4.4 „ 3 „ „ 4.2 „ 4.3 „ 2 „ 21 All the 79 samples of ordinary milk were reported as genuine and the average composition was as follows:— Milk fat 3.69 per cent.

Samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Health Laboratory Service for the Prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out:— Phosphatase Methylene Blue Satisfactory Failed Satisfactory Failed Pasteurised 41 — 41 — Turbidity Satisfactory Failed Sterilised 15 — Monthly returns of the samples taken, and of the results of the examinations, are sent to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and they are at once notified of adverse report. Ice-Cream. Fifty-six samples of ice-cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the methylene blue test. The samples were, as a result of the test, placed in the following Provisional Grade 1 15 „ 2 15 „ 3 14 „ 4 12 56 46 The Regulations relating to the manufacture of ice-cream are contained in the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959. Samples are taken regularly from premises in the Borough where ice-cream is manufactured and if unsatisfactory results are obtained, advice is given and the matter followed-up until a satisfactory quality results. "Soft" ice-cream, that is ice-cream sold directly from specially designed freezers, shortly after production, has been on sale for several years. The introduction of a smaller and more compact freezer has led to the development of " Soft" ice-cream on sales vehicles. The maintenance of hygiene on vehicles presents difficulties not met with in manufacturing premises. A number of shop premises are having these machines installed and are operated by people who have no previous experience of ice-cream manufacture or of the cleansing and sterilisation of the plant used. The manufacturers give full instructions for the cleansing sterilisation of the freezers, but it is quite often necessary for the whole process to be gone over in the presence of a Public Health Inspectorwho is able to give the necessary advice. It is essential for regular cleansing of the machine at the end each day's use and unless this is carried out correctly, it leads to bacteriological contamination. Adulterated Samples. When an informal sample of tinned cream was opened it was found that the lacquer of the lid had deteriorated and softened and in places had become detached from the metal. The manufacturers were duly informed of this deterioration, for the appropriate steps to be taken.| An informal sample of ground nutmeg was deficient in Volatile Oil to the extent of 33%. A formal sample was taken but this was satisfactory. No further action was considered necessary. An informal sample of shredded beef suet was deficient in suet to the extent of A formal sample was duly obtained which proved satisfactory, and no further action was taken. FOOD POISONING. Twenty cases of food poisoning were notified during the year and a further three cases were otherwise ascertained. In 10 cases the causative organism was found to be Salmonella of the following types : — Bredeney 4 Heidelberg 1 Typhi-Murium 5 10 The causative organisms of the remaining 13 cases were not identified. Foreign Matter in Food. There were five instances of foreign matter in food dealt during the year. The following three cases were, on the instruction the Health Committee, dealt with by cautionary letters : — Pie containing a fly. Eel pie containing a cockroach. Cement in a bottle of orange juice. 47 Two cases of contraventions of Section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act. 1955, were dealt with by legal proceedings, as follows : — Loaf of Bread containing a portion of metal screw—Fined £20 and £2 2s. 0d. costs. Bread roll containing a quantity of tobacco — Fined £20 and £2 2s. 0d. costs. Unsound Food. The following table gives particulars of the unsound food which, Under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council. Commodity Lbs.

Whitehead and the Medical Officer of Health. Care of Old People. The Public Health Department has continued as far as possible to meet the needs of old people during the year. Although it is not altogether easy to assess accurately the present position, it would appear that we are getting to know of necessitous cases earlier and are thus able to bring in statutory and voluntary services more rapidly and tthus more effectively. The Council appointed an attendant for bathing housebound old people in March, and her work has proved to be of inestimable value. Besides bathing duties the attendant is able to warn the Public He Department of any deterioration in old persons and their surroundings. She has proved to be a vital link in the work of the Department and has given loyal support to the Old People's Visitor. Housebound old persons have also been greatly assisted by the Old People's Visitor and she continues to work closely with her colleagues in the Public Health Department and also the staff of the Divisional Health Department In addition constant touch has to be maintained with the Women's Voluntary Service, the London County Council Welfare Officers, National Assistance Board and many other bodies. 49 We were all sorry to see Mr. Wilson, the Assistant Secretary of the Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee, go to the Willesden area in December. During his stay in Battersea he has been of the utmost distance to the Public Health Department and Willesden will gain by our loss. As in 1961, through the kindness of the Old People's Welfare Committee, we have been able to assist many old people in varying ways and my hope last year for even more fruitful relationship with the Committee has been amply proved during this past year. The young people of the Borough continue to be of great service to various old people by visiting, decorating and other useful activities and I wish to thank them again for their enthusiastic pioneering work. The young and the old are so often suspicious of each other and maybe this barrier will be broken down in the light of the Battersea Youth effort. Finally, the number of articles from incontinent old people for laundering by the Cleansing Station have increased to 4,377 this year. This has now become an essential service and may indeed require to be extended. Removal under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Emergency action had to be taken in the cases of two old ladies during the year, following the visit of a Justice of the Peace. Both, besides suffering from grave chronic disease, were lacking proper care and attention and living in deplorable conditions. Both were admitted to St. John's Hospital, where owing to the seriousness of their condition they died after admission. Home Safety Act, 1961 : Accidents in the Home. The Home Safety Act, 1961, repealed and replaced Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957. The Act empowers the Council to promote safety in the home, by publishing or making other arrangements for giving information or advice relating to the prevention of accidents in the home, and to contribute to non-profit making organisations concerned with the promotion of home safety. The following tables, compiled from reports made by the London Ambulance Service, indicate the number of accidents occurring in Battersea homes. Table I shows the number of accidents in 1962 in age groups: Table II gives the numbers from various causes each year since 1958. HOME ACCIDENTS IN BATTERSEA. Table I Year Age group (years) M. F.

The Council make available to old age pensioners free use of slipper baths at their Baths Establishments on production of their pension books. This facility has also been extended to blind oersons. During the year 1962 this arrangement was taken advantage of at the respective Baths Establishments as follows:— Males Females Latchmere 3,093 2,753 Nine Elms 743 415 Plough Road 1,563 1,640 Total 5,399 4,808 Burial of Deceased Persons. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying, or being found dead, in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the Insurance Act, 1946. 51 During the year, 16 cases were dealt with. The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 16 cases was £223 aproximately, and of this amount £171 was recovered. Public Swimming Baths. The Council maintain four public swimming pools—three at atchmere Baths and one at Nine Elms Baths. The source of water supply at the Latchmere Baths is from deep wells In the event of breakdown or any temporary cessation of supply from the wells, the water is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. The Nine Elms Baths are supplied from the Board's mains. The Bath water is effectively chlorinated, and there is a turnover or change of water in the Baths approximately every 3} hours. Samples of water from the swimming pools are taken at fortnightly intervals and submitted for bacteriological examination. The results have been consistently satisfactory. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. All the lavatory accommodation at each of the conveniences is provided free, and, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities are also available. One public urinal is maintained, and in addition the urinals attached to seven licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Methods of Disinfection: Following the notification of a case of infectious disease requiring disinfection, an inspection is made and the following methods used. The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Advice is also given to the occupier that a thorough " spring cleaning " of the room is a very effective "disinfection " process, and should be carried out in addition to the work of disinfection by the Council's staff. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam-treated at the Station, where the disinfection plant consists of two large steam disinfectors. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the adjoining laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected are treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. Disinfestation of Verminous Rooms : Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T., which gives a prolonged residual effect. In the case of a heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper penetration of the insecticide. 52 Control of Insect Pests: The construction by the Council of large blocks of flats containing covered ducts taking hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has raised a problem of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult to deal with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator has been purchased by the Council, and this fitting, having a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling out on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. Complaint has also arisen through infestation by the Clover Mite (Bryobia praetiosa) of Council premises, particularly new blocks of flats. The mite is brought in on turves in grassing the areas adjoining the blocks. It is red in colour and harmless, but a source of annoyance to the occupants. It has been controlled by the use of an acaricide applied in the form of a " wettable " powder based on " Malathion" as one of the active ingredients. Personal Cleansing Station. There are facilities for treatment of scabies and verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, Sheepcote Lane. During this year 287 treatments were given to persons suffering from or contacts of scabies—144 to adults, 111 to school children, and 32 to childre under school age. In addition to the above, 44 adults and 158 children found to be verminous were cleansed. Of the 158 children, 141 attended from local schools by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Council for the use of the Personal Cleansing Station.

Arrangements have been made with the Wandsworth Borough Council, and the Lambeth Borough Council, for certain of the residents jn those Boroughs, who require treatment or cleansing, to attend at the Battersea Personal Cleansing Station, the cost of this service being borne by the respective Boroughs in which the patients are resident. During the year 55 treatments were given to Wandsworth residents and 47 treatments to Lambeth residents. Methods of Treatment:— Scabies: Persons attending for treatment are given a hot bath for twenty to thirty minutes, thoroughly dried, and Benzyl Benzoate Pplied to the whole of the body. This is repeated on alternate days, there being three treatments in all. Verminous heads: The hair is treated with a preparation containing cotton-seed oil, tar oil, paraffin oil and oil of lemon grass, and then washed with a shampoo of soft soap and borax. It is then dried throughly, combed with a Sacker's comb to remove nits, washed, dried and combed again. The operation takes approximately half an hour for each child, and a final check is made by the Sister in attendance. The Council have two flats attached to the Personal Cleansing Station for the temporary use in emergency of people or a family displaced, usually following fumigating procedure. The Council have areed that these shelters may be used for Wandsworth residents at an annual fee of £25 for the right to use the shelters and a weekly change of £1 10s. 0d. per shelter for every case sent there. 54 Coroner's Court and Mortuary.
