The Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, in accordance with Section 189 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, beg to present the following Report of their proceedings, and other matters connected therewith, during the year ended on 25th March, 1895:— Area.- The Parish of Clerkenwell contains 380 acres, about 65 of which are situate in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill. Population.— According to the last census (1891) the population was 65,885. Number of Assessments.— The number of Assessments in the Parish is 8,785. The Rateable Value.— The rateable value for the year, according to the Valuation List in force on 5th April, 1894, was .£373,891. Description of Wards.— The Parish is divided into five wards, as follows:— Ward No. 1 (Pentonville) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies north of a line drawn from the west boundary of the Parish at Battle Bridge, along the centre of Pentonville Road, to the east boundary of the Parish at the top of the 20 City Road, thence up High Street and Liverpool Road to Sermon Lane, thence westward (according to the boundary of the Parish) to Caledonian Read, including Nos. 61 to 77 and 08 to 100 in that road, and 0 to 17, Caledonian Crescent, thence to the western boundary at Battle Bridge, and all that portion of the Parish which is situate at or about Muswell Hill.

This Ward contains 1,381 assessments, of a rateable value of £52,758, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's) comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn along Pentonville Road from the north-west corner of Claremont Square to the junction of City Road and Goswell Road, thence down Goswell Road to the corner of Spencer Street (including Nos. 290 to 320 on the north-east side of Goswell Road, and Nos. 1 and 30 in Sidney Street,) thence along Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Rosoman Street, and Amwell Street, to the north-west corner of Claremont Square. This Ward contains 1,188 assessments, of a rateable value of £57,689, and returns twelve members to the Vestry. 21 Ward No. 4 (St. James') comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn from Goswell Road, along the centre of Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Exmouth Street, Mount Pleasant, to the boundary of the Parish, thence along the line of the Old Fleet Ditch to the new street opposite Clerkenwell Green, and thence along Clerkenwell Green (north side of Sessions House) and Aylesbury Street to St. John Street, thence up the centre of St. John Street to Percival Street, along the centre of Percival Street, and up Goswell Road to Spencer Street.

Ward No. 5 (St. John's) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies south of the southern boundary of Ward 4, bounded on the east by a line drawn along the centre of Goswell Road from Percival Street to Clerken well Road, on the west by the Old Fleet Ditch, and on the south by a line drawn from Goswell Road down Clerkenwell Road, thence irregularly, according to the boundary of the Parish, to the Old Fleet Ditch. This Ward contains 1,584 assessments, of a rateable value of £88,646, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Clerkenwell Detached.—With regard to this outlying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from London, and on the north-western confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and D 22 having become famous through a legendary tale of a ' great cure performed upon a King of Scots, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell, a Chapel was erected on the spot, ' sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell.' Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River." "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially ; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initial affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 76 houses and pieces of land in assessment. Election of Vestrymen and Auditors. — The first election under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1894, to which allusion was made in the last report, took place in December, 1894, the whole of the existing members of the Vestry then going out of office. 23 On the 5th November the Local Government Board forwarded Rules, framed by them under the Act for the conduct of the Election, prescribing, inter alia, that the Election should be held on Saturday, the 15th December, and that the members elected should come into office on the 28th December. 97 Candidates were nominated for 72 seats as Vestrymen, polls taking place in each Ward, while for Auditors one only was nominated for each Ward, and the five nominated were duly declared elected. The following statement, taken from the Returning Officer's return, shows the number of votes recorded for each candidate, and will give some indication of the interest taken in the election by the parishioners:— WARD No. 1 (PENTONVILLE).

The only question arising out of the election for the Vestry to determine was the date of retirement of Mr. M. M. Hanly and Mr. H. P. Scheib, who received an equal number of votes in Ward No. 4, and it became necessary for the Vestry to determine by ballot which of the two should retire in 189G and which in 1897. The result of the ballot was that Mr. Hanly retires in 1897 and Mr. Scheib in 1896. Chairman of the Vestry.— Under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1894, it became the duty of the Vestry, at the first meeting after the Election, to appoint a Chairman for the year. Mr. William Robson and Mr. Joseph Walton were proposed for the office, the former obtaining 37 votes, and the latter 33. The choice of the Vestry, therefore, fell upon Mr. W, Robson, Churchwarden, who had most worthily presided over the meetings of the Vestry for some years previously. Mr. Robson became thereby a, Justice of the Peace for the County of London. Fines for Non-acceptance of Office or for Resignation.— The Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as applied to Vestries by the Local Government Act, 1894, provides a fine to be paid by persons elected NOT ELECTED. Richardson, John 123, Pentonville Road - 103 Owen, Richard - 25, Red Lion Street 159 Ball, John 2, Hardwick Street 154 27 as Vestrymen who do not accept office within one month of the notice of election or who resign. The Vestry have fixed the fine for non-acceptance of office at £5, and for resignation at 2s. 6d. Votes of Condolence.— The Vestry regret to have to record the deaths of Mr. R. Moffat, who was a member of the Vestry at the time of his decease, and of Mr. Alfred John Dixie, who had only ceased to be a member a few weeks, but who had devoted a large amount of time and energy to the service of the Parish both as Vestryman and Guardian of the Poor. They have also lost by death the services of an old and faithful officer in the person of Mr. Thomas Powell, one of the rate collectors for nearly twenty years. In each of the above cases a vote of condolence was passed and communicated to the widows. The Vestry have also passed votes of sympathy with Mr. John Pratt, a member of the Vestry, with Mr. Wm. Wootton, for many years a sidesman of the church, and with Mr. G. R. Brown, the First Assistant Clerk, on the death of their wives. Meetings.— Under the Bye-laws of the Vestry Standing Committees are appointed at the first Meeting of the Vestry after the Annual Elections, and Special Committees are appointed from time to time to deal with special questions, and it is at the Meetings of these Committees that a very large quantity of the detail work of the Vestry is carried out. The following statement shows the number of Meetings held by the Vestry and the various Committees during the year, and will also show the parishioners that the administration of their local affairs is no light task, but is one which entails considerable labour on those who come forward to take part in the municipal work of the Parish:— 28 Vestry45 Works Committee 51 Wharf Committee 3 Public Health Committee 24 Valuation Committee 15 Finance Committee 13 Law and Parliamentary Committee 7 Special Committee 1 Vestry Hall Committee 11 Vestry Hall Sub-Committee 3 Petty Sessions 8 Baths and Washhouses Committee 1 182 Rates.— During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows :— For the Half-year to Michaelmas, 1894. A Poor Rate of 1s. 8½d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £30,545 A Sewer Rate of 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,490 A Lighting Rate 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,490 A General Rate 1s. 0d. ,, ,, ,, 17,880 2s. 10½d. £51,405 For the Half-year to Lady-day, 1895. A Poor Rate of Is. 8d. including a Library Rate of 1d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £30,100 A Lighting Rate 2d. „ ,, ,, 3,010 A General Rate lid. ,, ,, ,, 16,555 2s. 9d. £49,665 The Rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £375,524, and those made in October, for the halfyear to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £370,382. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £31,781 in the first, and £27,768 in the second half-year, total £59,549. 29 The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £5,018 1s. l1d. and £2,883 3s. 8d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union, include the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor Rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £21,810 5s. l1d., divided into portions of £11,099 17s, 8d. in the first, and £10,710 8s 3d. in the second half-year. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, it receives from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with two-fifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants, formerly paid from the Imperial Exchequer, for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining, after payment of these grants, is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head, per day, for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the latter amount for the year ending Lady-day, 1895, is £7,886, the 30 amount being based, for the first five local financial years, on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The Library Commissioners precept at 1d. in the £ amounted to £1,500, and the; cost of Registration of Voters, Collection of the Poor Rate, and other matters under the control of the Guardians or Governors of the Poor amounted to £2,100, which, added to the sums above-mentioned, made the Poor Rate precepts as sent by that Board to the Vestry £61,530, to meet which the Poor Rate of £00,545 was levied. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,717 13s. 8d., collected as part of the Poor Rate. The precept of the School Board for the year 1891 amounted to the sum of £10,151 3s. 2d., which is collected as part of the General Rate. It will thus he seen that of the £101,070 raised during the year, the sum of £75,516 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 5s. 7½d. in the pound for the year, over 4s. 2d. was for other bodies, and about 1s. 5d. for the local administration, paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1,356 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only 31 five per cent, of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 14 committal warrants per quarter were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied, and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 14 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Valuation Lists.— One Supplemental and four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year, dealing with 186 Assessments and raising the rateable value by £2,511. Assessment of Government Property.— In October, 1894, a further addition of £2,874 was made to the rateable value on which the contributions of the Treasury to the Kates of the Parish in respect of the Parcels Post Depot are made, the values of this property now standing as follows:— GKOSS. EATEABLE. Telegraph Factory and Telegraph Office £3,125 and Stores of the Metropolitan District £2,500 Parcels Post Depot and other Post Office 3,600 buildings 3,000 £6,725 £5,500 These values are temporary and provisional only, and are subject to further alterations as the buildings proceed. In November, a letter Was received from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, on the subject of the valuation of Government 32 property for the purposes of the contributions to local rates, and suggesting concurrent action with a view to the basis on which the grant in lieu of rates is made being brought more nearly in conformity with what would be the true rateable value if the occupier were liable to be rated. The Vestry concurred with this view, and addressed a communication to the Government accordingly. School Board Precepts— The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870: £ s. d. £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1883 9,397 16 2 1872 943 11 2 1884 11,054 2 2 1873 780 0 2 1885 11,999 1 10 1874 1,869 9 3 1886 12,890 9 0 1875 3,267 12 11 1887 12,210 12 5 1876 4,897 4 9 1888 11,717 15 1 1877 6,046 10 1 1889 13,252 6 0 1878 6,013 14 10 1890 16,052 19 4 1879 6,871 8 11 1891 16,589 15 11 1880 7,436 9 8 1892 15,869 10 11 1881 7,900 4 4 1893 15,539 3 10 1882 8,067 10 5 1894 6,151 3 2 London County Council Precepts.— The following are the amounts raised from the Parish of Clerkenwell by the County Council:— For the year ending 31st March, 1890 (12.55d.) £18,096 l1s. 1d.

Holford Square Enclosure Rate.—The Vestry received a request from a Committee of Inhabitants of Holford Square that the Vestry would raise a rate for the maintenance and management of the enclosed garden of Holford Square, to be assessed on the occupiers of the houses in the square, under the provisions of Sec. 239 of the Metropolis Local 35 Management Act, which requires that the Vestry shall raise the sum by an addition to the General rate. An application for £26 was received, to be raised by a rate on the rateable value of the houses in Holford Square, the annual payment of 10s. hitherto made by each occupier ceasing, and the Vestry decided that a rate of 3d. in the pound be made for the purpose. As this was the first occasion such a rate had been made, notice of the proposed rate was given to each occupier, with an intimation that the Vestry would be prepared to hear any objector before the rate was agreed to, but no opposition was made to it. Rates of the Metropolis.—In August, 1894, the Vestry had before them a letter from the County Council, forwarding copy of Return of Rates raised in the County of London for the year ending 31st March, 1894, distinguishing the rates raised for county and parish purposes, and of rates raised in the principal boroughs and parishes in the immediate neighbourhood of London. The Return shows that the Rates in 1892-3 in the various London parishes were on an average 6s. 1¼d. in the pound, of which the central rates amounted to 3s. 3½d. (though 3s. 6½d. would more correctly represent the central rates, as it is found in practice that lossses from empties, allowances, &c., necessitate a rate of 13d. to raise a sum representing a rate of 1s. on the total rateable value). The rates for Clerkenwell were 5s. 10d., the parish standing 27th on a list comprising seventy-six parishes—a favourable position when the character of the parish is taken into consideration. London (Equalization of Rates) Act.—Reference was made in the last report to the introduction 36 into Parliament of the Bill to effect a better equalization of rates between the several parishes of the Metropolis. The Bill received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1894, and came into operation on the 30th September. The principle of the Act is that a rate of 6d. in the pound per annum forms the Equalization Fund; the parishes contributing according to their rateable value, and receiving according to their population; parishes of a high rateable value and a small population having therefore to contribute to the fund, while those of a low rateable value and a large population receive a grant from it. The net amount received from the fund by the Parish of Clerkenwell for the half-year ending 31st March, 1895, was £1,643 0s 9d.* Collection of the Rates.—Of the rates made in the Parish of Clerkenwell, a percentage of about 93½ is actually collected, 6½ per cent being irrecoverable from allowances to owners who compound, empty houses, runs, and excusals on the ground of poverty. It follows therefore that when the Parish is called upon to satisfy the precept of some central body, such as the County Council or the School Board, which is stated to be at the rate of say 1s. in the pound, an actual rate of nearly 13d. must be made to produce the amount required. Parliamentary Representation by the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885.—The Parish of Clerkenwell forms the Central Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Finsbury, and was represented in the Parliament of 1886, which was dissolved in 1892, by Captain Frederick Thomas *Afterwards increased to .',1,653 14s. 9d., owing to discovery of an error in the calculation referring to the parish of Camberwell. 37 Penton. At the ensuing General Election in July, 1892, the result of the poll was as follows :— Hon. Dadabhai Naoroji (L.) 2,959 Captain F. T. Penton (C.) 2,956 Majority 3 A recount of the votes took place on the 8th August, resulting in the totals being altered to Hon. Dadabhai Naoroji 2,961 Captain F. T. Penton 2,956 Majority 5 Subsequently a scrutiny took place before Mr. Justice Cave and Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams, and after an enquiry extending over three days, the petition was withdrawn.* The Parish also forms part of the Hornsoy Division of the County of Middlesex, represented in the last and the present Parliaments by H. C. Stephens, Esq. School Board for London.—Under the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Finsbury Division of the School Board for London. The following are the members elected in November, 1894, for the Division, with the number of votes recorded:— Miss Eve, 107, Lansdowne Boad, Notting Hill, W. - 29,121 Mr. G. B.

Rose 10,052 Mr. Watts 7,042 „ Hobart 4,005 „ Macer 387 London County Council.—Under the Local Government Act, 1888, the County Council superseded the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Electoral Areas of London are the same as for Parliamentary purposes. At the triennial election which took place on the 2nd March, 1895, the following gentlemen were the candidates lor the representation of the Division of Central Finsbury, and the number of votes were as stated:— Mr. William F. Blake, 29, Brunswick Gardens, S.W. 2,247 Hon. Ashley Ponsonby, 9, Princes Gate, S.W. 2,241 Lord Churchill 2,218 Mr. P. J. Rutland 2,148 The present representatives are therefore:— Mr. William F.

Transfer of Povirers.—The Local Government Act, 1894, provides by Section 33 that the Local Government Board may, on the application of the Yestry, make an order transferring to the Vestry all or any of the following matters, namely:—the appointment of overseers and assistant overseers; the revocation of appointment of assistant overseers; any powers, duties, or liabilities of overseers; and any powers, duties, or liabilities of a parish council; the lastmentioned comprising certain powers with respect *On the death of Mr. Sans, in June, 1895, Mr. J. Johnson was elected to fill the vacancy. 40 to parochial charities. The Vestry have, therefore, made application to the Local Government Board to transfer the duties of the Guardians or Governors of the Poor, and of the Overseers, to the Vestry; and have also referred it to the Finance Committee to examine into and to report upon the origin of the various Parish Charities of St. James and St. John, and the intention of the donors as far as can bo ascertained, with the view to the administration of the non-ecclesiastical Charities by the Vestry. Ex-Officio Members.—The Vestry have also written to the Local Government Board urging upon them the desirability of abolishing all ex-offlcio Members of the Vestry. Register of Voters.—The register of Parliamentary Voters, County Electors, and Parochial Electors for the Parish of Clerkenwell (which is the Central Division of the Borough of Finsbury) made out in 1894, and coming into force in 1895, shows the total number of Parliamentary Electors to be 8,911, of County Electors 8,794, and of Parochial Electors 10,313. Loans.—The debt in the shape of loans of the Parish of Clerkenwell compares very favourably with that of other Parishes in the Metropolis. It amounted at the 25th March, 1895, to the sum of £32.562. made up as follows:— £200 Balance of £4,000 incurred in August, 1875, for new paving works.

To re-name Guildford Street East as Attneave Street, and to re-name York Street as Lorenzo Street. The County Council suspended printed notices from the lamp-posts in the streets proposed to be renamed before making their order. Lighting.—The number of public lamps in the main Parish at the close of the year was 899, The gas is supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company, who also light, clean and glaze the lamps. The amount paid to the Company was £2,989 17s. 7d. The gas in the detached portion is supplied by the Hornsey Gas Company, the number of lamps being 10, and the amount paid being £32 9s. 7d. Further particulars as to lighting will be found in the Surveyor's report. 41 Price of Gas.—Considerable agitation has taken place during the year with reference to the price of gas. On the 4th April a Public Meeting was held at Arnwell Street Schools, of which the following is the Churchwardens' report:— To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, Gentlemen, Wo bog to report that in compliance with your resolution of the 8th March, a Public Meeting of the Inhabitants and Ratepayers of the Parish was convened to bo hold at Amwell Street Schools, on Wednesday, April 4th, to protest against consumers north of the Thames being chargcd 1d. per 1000 feet of gas, while those on the south side are charged 2s. 6d. Mr. Churchwarden Robson took tho Chair, and there was a large attendance, including Mr. Naoroji, M.P., Mr. James Rowlands, M.P., Mr. F. C. Frye, M P., Hon. W. F. B. MasseyMainwaring, Hon. Ashley Ponsonby, and Dr. W. F. Blake. A communication was received from the Clerkonwell Ratepayers' Protection Society, expressing their hearty approval of the object of tho Mooting, and pledging tl oinselvos to assist in making its inlluonco felt. Tho following resolutions were passed:— Proposed by Mr. F. C.

Ashley Tons only, seconded by Dr. Make— "That a Petition bo presented to Parliament, praying that an Enquiry may bo held into the cause of tho present inequalities of the price of gas north and south of tho Thames, and that Mr. Naoroji, M.P., bo requested to present same. WILLIAM ROBSON, ) EDWARD SANS, ARTHUR MILLWARD, H. W. FINCH AM, J Churchwardens. 45 In June notice was given that from September the price to private consumers would be lowered from 3s. 1d. to 3s. per 1000 cubic feet, but that the price for the public lamps would be raised from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 4d., and a further reduction of 1d. from December to private consumers if the state of the Company's finances admitted of it. The Vestry, in common with many others, expressed themselves as very disappointed with the small reduction to private consumers, and emphatically protested against the increase in the charge for street lighting. In July notice of a further reduction to private consumers from 3s. to 2s. 10d. was given. Premises belonging to the Vestry.—The following particulars are here given with reference to the various buildings and premises belonging to the Vestry:— The Vestry Hall, Bowman Street.—Until 1888, held on lease from the New River Company, at a ground rent of £10, which would have expired in 1903.

Wilmington and Northampton Squares and St. James Churchy at d are vested in the Vestry as open spaces, and the Vestry also contributes to the maintenance of St. John's burial ground in Benjamin Street as an open space. 47 New Town Hall.—The erection of this building, which was commenced on the 19th March, 1894, has proceeded satisfactorily throughout the year. The laying of the Foundation Stone took place on Thursday, the 14th June, the ceremony being performed by Wm. Robson, Esq., Churchwarden and Chairman of the Vestry Hall Committee. Streets partly situate in other Parishes.-The particulars below mentioned show the orders which have been made from time to time uuder sec. 140 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the agreements which are in force with other Local Authorities with regard to streets partly in this parish and partly in the adjoining parishes:— An Agreement, dated November, 1861, between the Vestries of Clerkenwell and St. Pancras, by which the entire width of Bagnigge Wells Road, now King's Cross Road, from the west side of Vernon Street to Baker Street is to be watered, cleansed and kept in repair by Clerkenwell; and the entire width from Vernon Street to Pentonville Road, and of Pentonville Road from the junction with King's Cross Road to the boundary between the Parishes of St. Pancras and Islington is to be watered, cleansed and kept in repair by St. Pancras. An agreement, dated August, 1864, by which Clerkenwell maintains and repairs the whole of Goswell Road, in the Parish of Islington, and that portion of the City Road lying between the Obelisk and the Angel Hotel to the line formed by the then granite paving, and also the roadway in Sermon Lane; Islington maintaining and repairing Liverpool Road from Sermon Lane to High Street, and High Street between Upper Street and the granite paving line above referred to. An Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works of 6th February, 1885, placing the carriageway of Goswell Road, to the north of Seward Street, entirely under the management of Clerkenwell, and to the south of Seward Street entirely under the management of St. Luke. An Order of the London County Council, dated 21st December, 1892, placing the portion of Clerkenwell Road, in the Parish of the Charterhouse, under the exclusive management of the Vestry of Clerkenwell. 48 Sale of Food and Drugs Act.—The Vestry have made arrangements for the analysis of private purchasers' samples of food and drugs, and have decided that any resident of the Parish (traders excepted) shall be allowed, upon payment of 2s. Gd. to bring to the Vestry any article of food or drugs purchased or delivered in the parish for the purpose of being tested by the public Analyst. Should the sample submitted prove to be adulterated, the report will be handed over to the Inspector of the district, with the name and address of the seller, for the purpose of his taking samples in conformity with the Act, and if in that case the sample is found to be adulterated, the 2s. Gd. deposited by the person bringing the sample will be returned to him. The rule has been printed on the back of the rate papers, but up to the present time practically no advantage has been taken of the arrangement by the parishioners. Broad Yard—It may be kept upon record that a portion of Broad Yard, Turnmill Street, at the rear of Messrs. Murray & Co.'s and Messrs. Condy and Mitchell's, and enclosed by gates, is public way. The circumstances of the enclosure are detailed in the report for the year ended March 25th, 1890. Plumber's Place—It is also to be noted that this public way runs through the court-yard of Northampton Buildings, the boundaries of such public way being defined by narrow iron rails fixed in the paving. Summary Proceedings.—During the year Summonses have been issued at the instance of the Vestry and heard by the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court in respect of the following offences:— 49 No. of Summonses issued. Offences charged. Convict ions. Dismissals. Penalties and Costs. £ s. d. 1 Neglecting to unstop and clease foul w.c 1 5 8 0 15 Ditto repair defective w.c. 14 1dismsd. 29 0 0 3 Ditto to reconstruct a drain 2 1 wtlidn. 0 9 0 12 Ditto to provide sufficient w.c. accommodation 11 1 wtlidn. 24 0 0 2 Constructing w.c. contrary to by-laws 2 1 14 0 1 Failing to provide soil pipe in accordance with by-laws 1 1 1 6 1 Repairing a drain so as to be a nuisance 1 5 4 6 4 Removing offensive matter contrary to by-laws 4 4 19 0 1 Negligently using a furnace so as not to effectually consume smoke 1 1 2 0 1 Neglecting to abate overcrowding 1 1 2 0 3 Ditto to make houses habitable 3 0 13 0 2 Illegally letting underground rooms 2 2 4 0 1 Neglecting to notify infectious disease ... 1 dismsd. 1 Giving false warranty in respect of a consignment of milk 1 10 0 0 4 Selling margarine in an unstamped wrapper 3 1 wthdn. 1 12 6 25 Adulterated articles 24 1 dismsd. 31 17 6 3 Articles unfit for food 2 1 do. 3 14 0 1 For having unsound fish in preparation for sale 1 3 0 0 81 74 7 127 1 0 Owen's Row.—The Vestry, when removing the posts from the eastern end of Owen's Row, ordered a bar to be fixed, so that the right of closing same to vehicular traffic might be preperved. The thoroughfare was closed during the hours of daylight on the 7th December, 1894. Water Companies' Charges.—The Vestry have considered a letter from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, in favour of a revision of the law so that at least one water-closet should 50 be included in the rateable charge for water supply for domestic purposes, and that where there is an upstairs water-closet the Companies should not be able to charge for the high service as well as for the closet. The Vestry concurred with the views contained in such letter, and further expressed the opinion that one bath should also be included in such charge. Public Abattoirs—The Vestry have considered a letter from the St. Giles District Board in favour of the abolition of private slaughter-houses in the Metropolis, and the provision of Public Abattoirs, together with a letter from the London Chamber of Commerce in opposition to the proposal. The latter communication urged that the present private slaughter-houses have been erected or adapted to plans approved by the local authorities and the County Council, and are subject to a dual supervision by the officers of these authorities; that the poor benefit by being enabled to buy the internal parts of animals, which are only good when freshly slaughtered; that the abolition of private slaughterhouses would result in the whole live cattle trade in London passing into the hands of a few wholesale firms, who would be able to control prices to the detriment alike of producer and consumer; that there is more humanity and consideration for animals in private than in public slaughter-houses, and that the establishment of public abattoirs would entail enormous expense upon the ratepayers without any corresponding advantage. Having considered the subject carefully, the Vestry were unable to see the necessity for the change suggested by the St. Giles' District Board at present, and they forwarded replies to that Board and to the Chamber of Commerce accordingly. 51 The St. Giles' Board subsequently forwarded the results of their enquiries of the various Vestries and District Boards in the County of Londou, eight being in favour of the proposal to abolish private slaughterhouses, the remainder being against the proposal, or neutral in the matter. Bakehouses.—The Vestry have considered a circular letter from the Local Government Board, calling attention to the powers and duties of the Sanitary Authorities with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation and other sanitary conditions of bakehouses. Careful attention has been paid to this subject by the Medical Officer and Inspectors ever since the duty of inspection has been in the hands of the Medical Officer, and the Local Government Board were so informed. A proposal was made in June by the Public Health Committee of the County Council that the Council should take over the powers of the Sanitary Authorities respecting bakehouses; but when the report of the Committee was considered by the Council on the 26th June, an amendment was carried, that in its opinion regulations should be made by the Council for the whole of London, but that the licensing and supervision of bakehouses, and the duty of enforcing the regulations, should remain with the local authorities. On the 17th July, the County Council rescinded its resolution of the 26th June so far as relates to the licensina of bakehouses, and expressed the opinion that the licensing or registration of bakehouses should rest upon the Council and not upon the local sanitary authorities. Upon this being brought to the notice of the Vestry, they expressed to the County Council their strong disagreement with the action of the Council in the matter. 52 In August, a Conference upon the subject was called by the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, to which the Vestry appointed Air. Dixie and Mr. Schieb as delegates. The Conference met on the loth October, and passed the following resolutions:— 1. That the present state of the law relating to Bakehouses requires amendment by the addition of the following clauses to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— (a) That uniform Metropolitan Bye-Laws regulatiug houses be made by the London County Council, and confirmed by the Local Government Board, and that the duty of enforcing these Bye-laws shall devolve upon the various Local Sanitary Authorities. (b) That the portions of the Bye-laws regulating the structure of Bakehouses do not apply to existing Bakeries. (c) That the London County Council be empowered to frame Bye-laws for the construction of underground Bakehouses, and that all Bakehouses erected after the passing of such Bye-laws shall conform thereto. Cab Radius.—In October, a letter was received from the Vestry of Stoke Newington, expressing the opinion that the present cab radius should be extended one mile; with which the Vestry expressed its agreement. Cabstands and Shelters.—In June, 1894, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Secretary of the Departmental Committee appointed to enquire into certain questions connected with the Metropolitan cab service, inviting any observations or suggestions in writing with reference to the provision of cab stands and shelters, which the Vestry may desire to lay before the Committee. They replied that, having regard to the fact that the Local Authorities are responsible for the roads 53 and the drainage, the Vestry are of opinion that no new cab stands should be decided upon without consultation with the road authorities. Diphtheria.—The Vestry, in July, 1894, had before them a letter from the County Council, forwarding copy of a preliminary memorandum by their Medical Officer of Health on the increase of Diphtheria in London. The memorandum contained statistics upon the subject, and concluded with the opinion that the first steps to be taken in investigating the present prevalence is to endeavour to determine the extent to which schools are contributing to diphtheria dissemination, especially those in which infants and younger children are taught. The Vestry did not deem it necessary to take any steps in the matter. Cholera, Notification of Diarrhœa.—In July also the Vestry had before them a letter from the Local Government Board, suggesting that diarrhoea should be added to the list of notifiable diseases until the termination of the current quarter, with the view to the checking of cholera, which wras then showing some signs of recrudescence on the Continent. The Vestry did not, however, deem it necessary to adopt the course suggested. Spread of Disease by Vagrants.—In June, 1894, the Vestry received from the County Council an invitation to join a conference on the subject of the spread of disease by vagrants, and to consider whether means can be adopted to prevent same by requiring such persons to notify their destination when leaving a casual ward, or common lodging house, &c., &c. Having regard to the practical impossibility of carrying out such a regulation, the Vestry took no action in the matter. 54 Influenza.—In March, 1805, a letter was received from the Local Government Board, forwarding copies of a Memorandum which they have caused to be prepared by their Medical Officer with reference to the recurrence of Epidemic Influenza. Disinfecting Apparatus.—The Vestry have considered a letter from the County Council, forwarding a report showing the arrangements now in force in the several sanitary districts of the Metropolis for the disinfection and destruction of infected articles, and calling special attention to the statement contained therein, that disinfection by dry heat is a much less satisfactory process than disinfection by steam, and expressing the hope that the Vestry will see its way to substitute a steam disinfector for the dry heat apparatus now in use. The present apparatus of the Vestry was improved some little time ago by the substitution of a gas heating apparatus for the coke fire, and as no fresh case of infection has ever occurred through insufficient disinfection performed by the apparatus, the Council has been informed that the Vestry is satisfied with its apparatus, and sees no sufficient reason for doing away with it at present. Certificates of Disinfection.—A letter has been received from the School Board, asking that a certificate may be given to the head teachers of schools attended by children who may be suffering from infectious disease, or by any child who is an inmate of the same house as the patient when the disinfection of the premises is completed. The Public Health (London) Act requires that the Medical Officer of Health shall send notices to the head teachers of the existence of disease, but difficulty has arisen by the teachers not knowing when they may safely re-admit the children 55 excluded in consequence. Some hundreds of communications are already made to the head teachers per annum, which would be of course doubled if the request was to be complied with; but the Vestry felt that it was desirable that the information should be given, and they dccided to do so. Removal of persons suffering from Infectious Disease.—The Vestry have considered a letter from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, on the want of facilities for removing patients suffering from infectious disease after the hour when telephonic communication ceases, and the local telegraph offices close; and inviting an expression of opinion whether the inconvenience is felt to such an extent as would justify a request that the Ambulance Service of the Metropolitan Asylums Board might be available throughout the night. The inconvenience lias been occasionally felt in this parish, and the Vestry felt that the matter was of sufficient importance to justify the request, and they so informed the Vestry of Westminster. Shelter, 47, Northampton Road.—The Holborn Board of Works have discontinued their joint tenancy of the Shelter provided by the Vestry for persons requiring accommodation while their homes are being disinfected. Sale of Ice Creams.—Tn December, the Vestry considered a letter from the Vestry cf Islington, enclosing copies of Reports of their Medical Officer of Health and of Dr. Klein upon the sale of ice creams and the washing of glasses in which they are served, and asking the co-operation of the 56 Vestry in urging upon the Local Government Board the necessity of instituting legislation for the purpose of providing for the registration of the vendors of these creams, and for empowering the Board to make bye-laws for tho regulation of the trade. The Vestry concurred, and communicated with the Local Government Board accordingly. The Local Government Hoard replied that the matter would be considered when an opportunity for amending the law occurred. The Vestry also thought it would be desirable to have a similar enquiry in this parish, and they directed that three samples of water used in the washing of ice cream glasses be taken and bacterioscopically examined at some lime in the season to be selected by the Medical Officer of Health and tho Analyst. Coffins in St. John's Crypt.—The removal of the bodies from the Crypt of St. John's Church, referred to in the la3t annual report, occupied a considerable part of the Vestry's discussions during the year. In the Poor Hate estimates in April, 1894, a sum of £700 was included in respect of the expenses of such removal, but the Vestry made a Poor rate of one half-penny less than the required amount, representing such sum of Jt700. Upon a payment of j£;j00 to the Churchwardens of St. John's on account by the Guardians or Governors of the Poor, the Vestry passed the following resolution :— "That this Vestry—tho popularly-elected representatives of tho ratepayers of this Parish—hereby express their strong disapprobation of the action by the Board of Guardians or Governors of the Poor in voting £300 on account for the purpose of removing human remains from the crypt of St. 57 John's Church, in spite of the refusal of this Vestry, by a large majority, to include the cost of such expenditure in the last rate, and do further express the opinion that such cost ought to be borne by the owners of the fabric and the possessor of the advowson." "That a copy of such resolution be forwarded to the Board of Guardians or Governors of the Poor, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, SirE. Lechmere, Bart., and the Home Secretary." "That upon any demand note being issued for any rate in which the sum of £700, or thereabouts, is included for the removal of human remains from the crypt of St. John's Church, the Clerk be instructed to have legibly printed thereon a notice that such sum is included in such demand." Letters were received in reply from the Guardians or Governors of the Poor stating that, in acting as they have done, they have only carried out their statutory obligations in removing a most serious sanitary defect : from Sir Edmund Lechmere, acknowledging the receipt : from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, stating that the matter is not one in which they have any authority to interfere; and from the Home Secretary, stating that under the Order and pursuant to the Act, the expenses of the removal were charged and paid out af the Poor Bate, and that the Guardians or Governors of the Poor had no alternative in the matter. The work was completed, and the total cost was £699 9s. 2d. County of London (North) Electric Lighting Order.—In November a letter was received from the Board of Trade, stating that the London County Council had expressed their objection to the 58 construction of transformer chambers in the public streets as proposed by the undertakers, and that they (the Board) had therefore thought it desirable to bold a meeting of representatives of the Council, of the Undertakers, and of the Local Authorities interested, to discuss the matter at issue, and inviting the appointment of representatives of the Vestry for the purpose. The Surveyor was directed to attend the meeting on behalf of the Vestry. A letter was received in January from the Board of Trade, forwarding copy letter they had addressed to the London County Council stating that, after a careful consideration of the representatives made at the recent hearing of all parties, they are prepared to hold that no sufficient reasons have been advanced, either on the ground of public safety or of want of Parliamentary sanction, to justify them in refusing to approve of a system of electric supply which involves the use of transforming chambers under the public streets; but that they at the same time consider that the user of the public streets for such a purpose should be as much as possible limited, and that the chambers should be placed where they do not unreasonably interfere with existing underground works of any kind. Bye-laws as to Houses Let in Lodgings, &c.— The Vestry have considered model bye-laws forwarded by the Local Government Board, with respect to houses let in lodgings, and have amended them in certain particulars, and have submitted to the Local Government Board for approval, but at the date to which this report is made up, the reply ol the Local Government Board had not been received. 59 St. James's Churchyard, Pentonville.—The Vestry have considered the subject of this churchyard being laid out as an open space. Many complaints of its present condition have been made from time to time, and the opinion of Counsel has been taken by the Trustees of the Church with reference to the right of the Vicar of St. James's, Pentonville to prohibit the laying-out of the churchyard as an open space, except upon conditions imposed by himself. This opinion is to the effect that the Vicar's rights are limited, and that the probability is that the Consistory Court would grant the necessary faculty. Captain Penton has signified his approval of the proposal, and a letter has been received from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association stating that this Association will be prepared, as soon as preliminary steps are completed, to at once lay it out at an approximate cost of £500. The expense to the Vestry for maintenance and caretaker may be taken at about <£1U0 per annum, and they have decided that the Solicitors be instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain a faculty for laying out the ground under the Open Spaces Acts ; that subject to same being obtained, the offer of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association be accepted, and that the Vestry take over the ground when laid out, and maintain it in future. Combined Drainage.—In April, 1894, an invitation was received from the Holborn District Board of Works to appoint two delegates and the Vestry Clerk to attend a Conference at their ToWn Hall, on the 17th May, to consider what action can be taken with regard to obtaining an alteration of the law on the question of combined drainage. Mr. Sans and Mr. Walton were appointed as the Vestry's representatives. The County Council was 60 approached by the Conference, as well as by numerous individual sanitary authorities, to initiate legislation for the purpose, and the Council has decided to apply to Parliament for an amendment of the definition of the words " sewer " and " drain " in the Metropolis Management Act by extending the meaning of the word " drain " so as to include any drain the plan of which has not been approved as a sewer under Section 69 of the Act of 18-55, and sections 45 and 48 of the Act of 1862. Farringdon Road Widening.—With reference to the decision of the Vestry some time ago, that they would be prepared to widen Farringdon Road between Calthorpe Street and Rosebery Avenue, upon the Post Office authorities setting back their line of frontage for the purpose, the Post Office work became sufficiently advanced to allow steps to bo taken to carry out the alteration. Having regard to the expression of opinion of the Improvements Committee of the County Council, when the matter was first being considered, the Vestry made an application to the Council for a contribution towards the expense, which was estimated at £700. The Council agreed to contribute one half of the net cost of the work. The Vestry then communicated with the Post Office authorities, stating that the arrangements for carrying out the widening were almost complete, and that they would be glad to know whether it is proposed at any time to continue the line of railing to Mount Pleasant, removing for the purpose the houses in Farringdon Road. The Secretary of tbe Post Office replied that in all probability the houses will eventually be removed, but that there was no immediate intention of interfering with them, and that the tenancies had recently been renewed, though for short terms. The Vestry replied that 61 they were glad to hear of the probability of the eventual removal of the houses, and they hoped that advantage might be taken of same to complete the public improvement caused by the widening of the road. The Vestry then proceeded to get tenders for the work. Messrs. Mowlem & Co.'s was accepted and the improvement has been made. At the suggestion of the Vestry the London Street Tramways Company took advantage of the opportunity to double their line, paying the Vestry a sum of £43 4s. Od. for the additional paving taken to. Hayward's Place.—Messrs. Nicholson and Co. have carried out extensive additions to their premises here, and in the course of same the archway at the eastern end was temporarily removed. The Vestry therefore communicated with Messrs. Crickmay & Son, the architects, suggesting that it was a favourable opportunity for giving a greater height to the archway, and so improving the lighting of same, and the current of air to the houses in Hayward's Place. They replied that their clients would do all they possibly could to meet the wishes of the Vestry, and would therefore make the new archway ten feet high at the crown, instead of about 8-ft. 6-ins., which they hoped would be satisfactory. The spring of the new arch is also considerably higher than heretofore, so that the new passage is a very desirable improvement. Lighting Common Staircases.—The last report referred to the General Powers Bill brought in by the London County Council, providing, inter alia, for the proper lighting of the staircases of Artizans Dwellings and such like places, and stated that Mr. Walton, the Chairman of the Works Committee, had been deputed to give evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons thereon. The Committee, after hearing evidence, decided 02 to pass tho preamble of the Bill, subject to certain modifications of the Clause, with the view to tho apportionment of the additional expense between the owner and tho Local Authority. The Vestry strongly objected to the decision arrived at by tho Select Committee, aud so informed the Council. The original clause provided that the dwellings were to he lighted upon requirement of tho Local Authority, tho cost being paid by tho Owner, but that was altered by throwing upon the Local Authority half tho cost of the lighting after 11-30 p.m., tho amount to bo repaid by the Local Authority to tho Owner, and the duty of extinguishing tho lights being placed upon the Local Authority. Other local authorities opposed the Clause in its altered form, and it was eventually altogether withdrawn. The Vestry expressed to the County Council their regret at the withdrawal of the Clause, and their hope that it might be reintroduced in its original form in the next Session, to which tho Council replied that, having regard to the proceedings of the present Session, it would, in their opinion, bo undesirable to introduce tho clause referred to until tho Local Authorities are agreed as to the manner in which the cost of lighting such staircases shall be borno. The Vestry rejoined that, in thoir opinion, it is the duty of tho Council itself to ascertain the opinion of the Local Authorities, having regard to the evidence adduced on its behalf before the House of Commons Committee. Tho Council, however, stated that, as at present advised, it did not propose to tako any steps with reference lo the lighting of common staircases in tho next session of Parliament. The Unemployed.—In February, a letter was reeoived from the Local Government Board drawing 63 attention to the means which may be adopted for providing, in times of exceptional distress, employment for the unemployed of a class who do not ordinarily have recourse to Boards of Guardians for relief. The classes of work suggested were such as cannot be undertaken in frosty weather, and it was therefore impossible for the Vestry to provide employment by this means. The removal of snow however gave employment to a large number, and a sum of £281 10s. 7d. was paid to men specially engaged for that purpose. Valuation Metropolis Bill.—During the Session of 1894 the Vestry considered the Valuation (Metropolis) Bill, introduced by Mr. Pickersgill, but which was really the Bill prepared by the County Council and amended by the Conference of Assessment Authorities, which had been sitting at Spring Gardens for the past twelve months. The principal provisions of the Bill were as follows:— (a) The County Council are to make by-laws for regulating the practice of the Assessment Committees and Overseers in the assessment of either the gross or rateable value of hereditaments, which by-laws are not to be operative until confirmed by the Local Government Board after considering any representations and objections by any Overseer or Assessment Committee to the same. (b) The Council in the third or fourth year of every nial period are to convene a Conference of representatives of Overseers or Assessment Committees to consider questions of practice, or alterations of the by-laws. (c) The Council may appoint representatives to attend any Meeting of Overseers or of an Assessment Committee, with power to take part in the discussion, but without being entitled to vote. (<1) The Council may make objections to the Assessment Committee if they deem fit. (fc) New and Supplemental Valuation Lists are to be prepared by Overseers in triplicate instead of duplicate, one copy being sent to the Council, who may insert in such copy 64 any altered amount as the gross and rateable value of any hereditament, but before making such alteration, notice is to be given to the Overseers, who may appear by a duly authorised representative before the Committee of the*Council on the subject. Alterations so made by the Council are to be deemed to be objections made by them, and notice is to be given to the parties affectcd. (f) Assessment Committees may appoint expert assistance at such remuneration as the Committee may from time to time decide, and the conditions of appointment of every such person shall provide that he shall give his assistance, not only to the Assessment Committee, but also to the Overseers of every parish within the Union. (g) The jurisdiction of the Quarter Sessions in assessment business is to cease, and a new Valuation Court is to be appointed, the ordinary members of the Court being a barrister or solicitor, a surveyor, and a person, not being a barrister, solicitor, or surveyor, who shall have some experience in the assessment of hereditaments. In times of pressure more Courts may be temporarily formed of similarly qualified persons. The Court will appoint its place of meeting, and may divide the Metropolis into districts for the purpose. It will have power to make consequential amendments in totals, when the valuations of particular hereditaments are altered. Parties to the appeal may appear in person or by their solicitor or counsel, and the Council, Assessment Committees, or Overseers may appear by their clerk or other duly appointed officer. (h) The Council are to value properties situate m several parishes, such as railways, tramways, canals, docks, waterworks, gas works, hydraulic power, telegraph, telephone and electric worl<s, and to apportion the assessments among the various parishes concerned. The Vestry approved of the alterations of the law referred to in paragraphs a, b, d, g and li; also in paragraph 0, subject to the Chairman and ViceChairman of the Overseers or of their Committee also being allowed to attend the Committee of the County Council; and lisapproved of the alterations proposed by paragraphs c and f. A petition was presented to Parliament in favour 65 of the Bill generally, but praying for alteration as regards paragraphs c, e and f. The Bill, however, failed to reach a second reading. The County Council then revised the Bill so as to repeal the existing Acts and recast the whole matter in one Bill, and introduced it in 1895 into the House of Commons as a private Bill, but upon objection being taken to this course by Sir Henry James, the Speaker expressed an opinion adverse to its being proceeded with in that form, and it was withdrawn and re-introduced as a Public Bill, but no progress was made with it. Opening of Museums on Sundays.—In May, 1894, the Vestry received a letter from the National Sunday League and Sunday Society, inviting them to join in a joint deputation to Lord Rosebery on the subject of opening the British Museum, the Natural History Museum, the National Gallery, the South Kensington Museum, the Bethnal Green Museum, and other National institutions of a like character on Sundays. The Vestry decided to take part in such deputation, and appointed fourteen of their number as their representatives. Clerkenwell Detached.-The last report recorded the fact that the proposal of the Local Government Board to transfer the detached portion of the parish at Muswell Hill to Hornsey had been unsuccessful. The Vestry not hearing of any further action being taken, decided to seek an interview with the Local Government Board, to urge them to put in force their power of determining which of the districts adjoining Clerkenwell detached, is to take the drainage of that portion of the parish, but the Local Government Board replied, forwarding copy letter from the County Council, stating that 66 tho negotiations between the Council and the Tottenham and Wood Green Local Authorities, with respect to the drainage of Clerkenwell detached, had not led to a settlement of the question, and that negotiations had therefore been entered upon with the Friern Barnet Local Board, which they had every reason to believe would lead to a successful issue. At the end of December, 1894, the Vestry received a letter from the County Council stating that the Friern Barnet Board had expressed its willingness to take the sewage on certain terms, and setting out the conditions asked for so far as they affected the Vestry. Some of them appeared to be unnecessarily stringent, and negotiations were proceeding at the end of the year for their modification. Sale of Food and Drugs Act.—In June, a letter was received from the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, inviting the Vestry to appoint two delegates, with the Public Analyst, to join in a Conference at that Vestry Hall, to consider the desirability of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act being amended so as to bring the manufacturers of, and wholesale dealers in, adulterated articles within the scope of their provisions; and also to empower Inspectors in one district to take samples at the railway stations in another district from consignments to vendors in their own district. The Vestry appointed Mr. Dixie and Mr. Kelly, with the Analyst, as delegates. The Conference met 011 the 22nd June, and passed a series of resolutions which the Vestry afterwards considered and approved, and signified their approval to the Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons to enquire into the working of the Acts, with the request that evidence might be called before the Committee in support of the views urged in such resolutions, 67 Unification of London.—The Report of the Commissioners upon the Unification of the City and County of London was issued during the year, and the Vestry received sundry letters from other Local Authorities expressing approval of the conclusions arrived at in the Report, but they took no action themselves in the matter. London Water Companies.—The London Country Council have introduced into Parliament (Session 1895) eight Bills for the transfer to them of the London Water Companies, and forwarded to the Vestry copies of same, and at same time asked whether any instances of deficient pressure in the height of water supplied, or of failure to supply, or any complaints either of any Water Company's charges or otherwise, have come under notice, or whether they can be referred to' any persons who would be likely to give the Council information which would be useful in supporting the Bills before Parliament. The Vestry decided to present a petition in favour of the Bills, and they informed the Council that they had personal knowledge of failure to supply water during the prolonged frost in the early part of 1895, and that the New River Company were making the usual demands for payment of the Water rates, without deduction. The Council proceeded only with the Bills affecting the Lambeth and Southwark and Vauxhall Companies in the first instance, and the dissolution of Parliament has prevented any substantial progress being made.

Dusting.—During the year 9125 loads of dust and 621 loads of trade refuse have been removed from the Parish. After sifting same, 139 freights of ashes and breeze, containing 9128 chaldrons have been removed from the Wharf, for which a sum of £600 10s. 2d. has been received, being an average of £4 7s. 8d. per freight, as compared with £3 16s. 5d., £3 13s. 8d. and £3 14s. 0d., for the three previous years. 17 freights of hardcore have been removed, for which barges have been hired at a cost of £78 6s. 6d. The following is statement of the cost of disposal of the dust for the year:— 87  £ s. d. 9476 Loads of Dust sifted 858 5 0 Less Rags, Bones, &c., sold 162 14 6 £695 10 6 17 Freights of Hardcore removed £78 6 6 Cost of Loading same 19 18 0 Tools 5 15 9 Removal of old Tins 13 6 0 117 6 3 812 16 9 9258 Chaldrons of Ashes and Breeze sold or in stock 611 15 10 Less Cost of Loading 114 2 0 497 13 10 Nett Cost £315 2 11 9746 Loads of Dust at £315 2s. l1d. is equal to 7dsxa per load against 8d. last year, and 7½d. the previous year. This year the wages have been increased, which has been counterbalanced by an advance in the price of ashes. Street Sweepings.—During the year 6966 loads of street sweepings and dung were removed from the parish, 489 of which were collected on Sunday mornings. 153 freights were barged away at a cost of £374 17s. 0d. There is an increase of 324 in the number of loads removed, to be largely accounted for by the prolonged dry season in the previous year. The contract with Messrs. Tuff & Miskin for barging this refuse was renewed for a second year at the same price of £2 9s. 0d. per freight. Watering.—The greater part of the watering was done by the Vestry staff, but on 35 days between May 26th and August 21st, 47 horses or an average of 1.34 per day were hired from Mr. Varney for the purpose at the cost of £24 16s. 1d, 88 The following represents the cost of the watering for the season of 1894, that for 1893 being added for the purpose of comparison:— Season 1893.

Had horses and carts been hired for the purpose a cost of £162 8s, 9d. would have been incurred. Horses and carts for this purpose have also been hired of Mr. Varney and Mr. Stubbs at a cost of £26 8s. 5d. Horses.—On the 31st January, 1895, the horse "Ross," purchased in 1880, was destroyed, having become unfit for further work. The total number of the stud at 25th March was 26. Vans and Carts.—The number of vehicles belonging to the Vestry is—20 vans, 8 carts, 13 water vans, 2 sweeping machines, and a sand or salt distributor. The Vestry have purchased a Willacy's patent water van and the sand distributor during the year. Fodder.—The Fodder account, allowing for the stocks in hand, amounts to £1,111 13s. 4d., a decrease of £346, being an a\erage of 15s. 11d. per horse per week, a decrease from last year of 6s. 1d. per horse per week. This decrease has been caused by the return to normal prices from the great advance due to the prolonged drought in the early part of 1893.

To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I do myself the honour of laying before you my Thirty-ninth Annual Report on the Mortality, &c., of the Parish during the year 1894. The number of deaths occurring from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1894 was 807. The annual average for the last ten years was 1,124, so that the deaths were 817 less than the average. The deaths in 1893 having been 1,183, those in 1894 were 376 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— DEATHS. BIRTHS. 1885 1,195 2,390 1886 1,170 2,279 1887 1,216 2,363 1888 1,168 2,311 1889 1,033 2,277 1890 1,184 2,204 1891 1,171 2,222 1892 1,125 2,175 1893 1,183 2,106 1894 807 2,180 K 118 The births were 74 more than in the preceding year, but 60 less than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 203 549 346 Amwell 198 532 334 Pentonville 202 572 370 Goswell 204 527 323 In each year a number of deaths of parishioners takes place in General and Special Hospitals, in the Workhouses, and in the Infirmary, all of which are extra-parochial. The number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals was 192; in the Workhouses, 111; and in the Infirmary, 90; 23 deaths occurring in Lunatic Asylums; and 4 from drowning, making a total of 420. The numbers, causes, and ages of the deaths are given in the tables appended to this Report. The population of the Parish has increased since the taking of the Census in 1891; but taking the numbers of that Census, the intra-parochial mortality amounts to 12 per 1,000; including the Workhouse and Infirmary and the Hospital deaths, to 18 per 1,000. The very small mortality of the year will be at once noticed. This cannot be attributed to a diminution of the population, which has decidedly increased; nor to the number of extraparochial deaths having increased, for these have considerably diminished. The deaths occurring in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill are enumerated with those of the Pentonville subdistrict. The mortality of all London during the year, was 17.8 per 1,000; that of the West districts being 17.1; of the North districts, 16.3; of the Central districts, 20.0; of the East districts, 20.8 ; and of the South districts, 16.2. 119 The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in the Parish in 1894 was 115; 88 less than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of deaths from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last ten years are exhibited in the following table:— SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. DIPHTHERIA. WHPING. COUGH. | TYPHOID FEVER. DIARRHOEA. TOTALS. 1885 6 87 14 7 52 5 58 229 1886 0 18 8 4 42 7 93 172 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 1889 0 47 10 6 23 4 54 144 1890 0 33 5 2 64 6 62 172 1891 0 107 4 7 51 4 50 223 1892 0 40 3 6 39 9 28 119 1893 0 70 11 25 41 6 50 203 1894 0 40 0 7 38 3 27 115 Forty-three deaths also occurred from zymotic diseases in extraparochial hospitals, viz.: 9 from scarlet fever; 22 from diphtheria; 1 from whooping cough; 5 from typhoid fever; and 6 from diarrhœa. The average number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 182 ; so that the number for 1891 was 67 less than the average. 120 It must be observed, however, that the deaths from these diseases occurring in the hospitals is 46 less than last your, showing that the cases removed to hospital are not so numerous as last year. The number of deaths arising in the parish from all causes in infants under one year was 229; extra-parochial were 81. 122 deaths occurred in the Parish at and above 60; 116 extraparochial. 41 deaths arose from violence. 87 inquests were held in the year, 10 less than in the preceding year. In 20 large English towns the mortality per 1,000 in 1894 was:—In London 17.8; Brighton, 10.4; Portsmouth, 15.8; Norwich, 18.7; Plymouth, 18.3; Bristol, 17.8; Wolverhampton, 20.7; Birmingham, 18-6; Leicester, 14.7; Nottingham, 17.2; Liverpool, 28.8; Manchester, 20.4; Salford, 21; Oldham, 18.6; Bradford, 17; Leeds, 17.9 Sheffield, 17.8; Hull, 17.4; Sunderland, 20.8; and in Newcastle-on-Tyne 18.8. In Edinburgh the mortality was 17.5; in Glasgow, 19.8; and in Dublin, 24.8. Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected in October, prior to licensing. They were 4 in the Upper Wards, and 5 in the Lower, and were kept by 9 butchers. They were found in good order, and no complaints were made of them during tho year by the neighbours. Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 4 in the Upper Wards, and 4 in the Lower, and were kept by the same number of cowkeepers. They were in very good order, and the animals were fine and healthy; the cows were 83 in the Upper Wards, and 8G in the Lower. Bake-houses.—These were inspected twice in the year, viz.:—in June and December, they were 58 in number, clean, and in good order. 121 Notification of Infectious Diseases.—565 Notices of infectious disease were made in the year, excluding those notified more than once: 5 of Small Pox; 225 of Scarlet Fever; 149 of Diphtheria; 66 of Typhoid Fever; 8 of Continued Fever; 103 of Erysipelas; 11 of Membranous Croup; and 3 of Puerperal Fever. Mortuary.—The excellent Mortuary still continues to fulfil its most useful purpose. 198 bodies were brought to it during the year; of these 47 were Holborn Guardian cases; and 151 were brought from the dwellings of parishioners, including 17 cases of zymotic diseases; 87 were inquest cases, upon which 45 post-mortems were made. The St. John's Crypt.—In August, the coffins and human remains from this vault were carefully removed by the Order of the Secretary of State, and conveyed to the consecrated portion of the Brookwood Cemetery, where they were decently interred There were about 200 coffins and remains, most of which were so decomposed and disintegrated as to be unrecognisable.

The amount of rainfall is also important, as this washes and purifies the streets and drains. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. W.
