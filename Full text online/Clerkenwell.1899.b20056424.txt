This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a ' great cure performed upon a King of Scots, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell,' a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell.' Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth ; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had ' a proper house occupying the site.' " "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they; are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River." "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line 'as is signified by the usual initial affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assort their long established boundary." 23 This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 174 houses and pieces of land in assessment.

The following statement shows the number of Meetings held by the Vestry and the various Committees during the year, and will also show the parishioners that the administration of their local affairs is no light task, but is one which entails con- 26 siderable labour on those who come forward to take part in the municipal work of the Parish:— Vestry 40 Works Committee 52 Wharf Committee 6 Open Spaces Committee 2 Electric Lighting Committee 1 Works Sub-Committee 2 Public Health Committee 28 Drainage Committee 2 Valuation Committee 13 Finance Committee 15 Parliamentary Committee 2 Town Hall Committee 15 Public Library 13 Public Library Sub-Committee 31 Petty Sessions 8 Special Committee re London Government Act 25 Various Special Committees 7 Deputations 1 Conferences 6 269 Rates.—During the year the Hates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the Half year to Michaelmas, 1899.

The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £36,738 in the first, and £31,986 in the second half-year, total £68,724. The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £3,420 2s. l0d. and £3,441 12s. 4d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union included the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £23,741 4s. 2d., divided into portions of £11,870 12s. 1d. in the first, and £11,870 12s. 1d. in the second half-year. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, it receives from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with two-fifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants formerly paid from the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law 28 Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payment of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day, for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the later amount for the year ending Lady-day, 1899, is £7,8S6, the amount being based on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £8,671 4s. 1d., collected as part of the Poor Rate. The Library Rate precept at 1d. in the £ amounted to £1,690, and the cost of Registration of Voters, Collection of the Poor Rate, and other matters under the control of the Overseers and the Guardians or Governors of the Poor amounted to £1,430, which added to the sums above-mentioned, made the Poor Rate precepts as sent by that Board to the Vestry £73,601, to meet which the Poor Rate of £72,020 was levied. The precept of the School Board for the year 1899, amounted to the sum of £23,202 13s. 10d., which is collected as part of the General Rate. It will thus be seen that of the £125,190 raised during the year, the sum of £92,102 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 6s. 1d. in the 29 pound for the year, 4s. 5¾d. was for other bodies, and 1s. 7¼d. for the local administration, paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1,107 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 20 committal warrants per quarter were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied; and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 9 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year dealing with 191 assessments, and increasing the rateable value by £8,257. 30 School Board Precepts.—The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870: £ s. d. £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1886 12,890 9 0 1872 943 11 2 1887 12,210 12 5 1873 780 0 2 1888 11,717 15 1 1874 1,869 9 3 1889 13,252 6 0 1875 3,267 12 11 1890 16,052 19 4 1876 4,897 4 9 1891 16,589 15 11 1877 6,046 10 1 1892 15,869 10 11 1878 6,013 14 10 1893 15,539 3 10 1879 6,371 8 11 1894 16,151 3 2 1880 7,436 9 8 1895 18,051 18 7 1881 7,900 4 4 1990 19,871 8 11 1882 8,067 10 5 1897 20,533 10 10 1883 9,397 16 2 1898 20,983 11 10 1884 11,054 2 2 1899 23,202 13 10 1885 11,999 1 10 London County Council Precepts.—The following are the amounts raised from the Parish of Clerkenwell by the County Council:— For the year ending 31st March. 1890 (12.55d.) £18,696 11s. 1d.

Some further particulars as to these Precepts will be found in page 27. 31 The following Analysis of the County Council's Rates is taken from the Council's Annual Report:— d. (1) Services of the County Council 15.57 (2) Services of the Local Authorities paid out of the County Fund. (i.) Payment to the Guardians of the Poor of charges formerly paid for out of Imperial Funds. This is a relief of local poor rates - 1.36 (ii.) Payment to the Guardians of the Poor of 4d. per head per day for indoor paupers. This is a relief of local poor rates - 2.12 (iii.) Payment to Overseers of the Poor of portion of Registration expenses and for drowned bodies. This is a relief of local poor rates .06 (iv.) Payment to Vestries and District Boards of one-half of the Salaries of Medical Officers and Sanitary Inspectors and of portion of cost of main roads. This is a relief of local general rates .23 (v.) Payment to the Common Council of the City of London for maintenance of pauper lunatics - .01 Net amount required for the year 19.35 Receipt from the Exchequer Contribution (license and probate duties and beer and spirit duties) 3.66 Licence fees, insurance, tax, &c. .73 Balances brought forward 1.46 5.85 Amount of rate levied 13.50 A penny rate over the whole county produced to the Council in 1899-1900 a sum of about £ 154,000. Metropolitan Board Precepts.—A list of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to the coming into force of the Local Government Act, 1888, in March, 1889, will be found in previous reports. 32 Garden Rates.—At the request of the Committees of Inhabitants the Vestry raised a rate of 3d. in the pound for the maintenance and management of the enclosed garden of Holford Square, and a rate of 5d. in the pound for Lloyd Square, to be assessed on the occupiers of the houses in the Square. London (Equalization of Rates) Act.—The principle of the Act is that a rate of 6d. in the pound per annum forms the Equalization Fund; the parishes contributing according to their rateable value, and receiving according to their population ; parishes of a high rateable value and a small population having therefore to contribute to the fund, while those of a low rateable value and a large population receive a grant from it. The net amount received from the fund by the Parish of Clerkenwell for the year ending 31st March, 1900, was £3,340 8s. l1d. Collection of the Rates.—Of the Rates made in the Parish of Clerkenwell, a percentage of about 94 is actually collected, 6 per cent. being irrecoverable from allowances to owners who compound, empty houses, runs, and excusals on the ground of poverty. It follows therefore that when the Parish is called upon to satisfy the precept of some central body, such as the County Council or the School Board, which is stated to be at the rate of say 1s. in the pound, an actual rate of nearly 13d. must be made to produce the amount required. Rates Raised in 1899-1900.—The Vestry have been furnished with a return by the London County Council, showing the amount in the pound of all rates raised in the County of London for the year 33 ending 31st March, 1900, distinguishing the rates raised for county and for parish purposes, and of rates raised in the principal boroughs and parishes in the immediate neighbourhood of London. The return shows the central rates at 4s. 2.375d. in the pound, and the total rates of the various parishes ranged from 5s. 4d. in St. James, Westminster, to 8s. l0d. in Bow, the average being 6s. 3.36d.; Clerkenwell with rates amounting to 6s. 1d. in the pound, standing very favourably on the list, 50 parishes having rates higher, and only 23 having rates lower. Parliamentary Representation.—The Parish of Clerkenwell forms the Central Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Finsbury, and is represented in Parliament by the Hon. W. F. B. MasseyMainwaring. The Vestry feel that it is desirable and necessary that the representative of Clerkenwell should become acquainted with the local requirements, and be in close communication with the local authority, and therefore the Member for the Division is invited to be present at the meetings of the Vestry whenever he can attend, and the minutes, agenda notices, and other papers issued to the Vestrymen are sent to him.

Owen's Row.—The Vestry, when removing the posts from the eastern end of Owen's Row, ordered a bar to be fixed, so that the right of closing same to vehicular traffic might be preserved. No complaint reached the Vestry of any nuisance arising from the street being opened, but it was found that the bar was sometimes unlocked and placed across the roadway. In consequence of this being done, 45 an accident happened to a bicyclist at night, and the Vestry decided to remove the bar altogether. Summary Proceedings.—During the year Summonses have been issued at the instance of the Vestry and heard by the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court in respect of the following offences :— No. of Summonses issued. Offences charged. Con victions. Dismissals. Penalties and Costs. £ s. d. 5 Smoke nuisances 5 13 14 0 2 Neglecting to repair defective w.c 2 1 order made. 1 2 0 2 Constructing w.c. without notice 2 2 4 0 I Constructing drain so as to be a nuisance 1 2 2 0 6 Neglecting to cleanse house 6 8 17 0 2 Neglecting to provide w.c. accommodation 2 0 13 0 5 Overcrowding tenement house 4 1 wthdn. 7 19 0 22 Adulterated articles 22 47 3 6 1 Refitting w.c. without notice 1 0 3 0 3 Constructing w.c. contrary to by-laws 3 4 7 0 3 Neglecting to limewhite workshop 3 3 16 0 3 Failing to provide drain to area 3 5 6 0 1 Refitting soil pipe contrary to by-laws 1 0 2 0 1 Refitting soil pipe without notice 1 1 2 0 1 Exposing for sale unsound condensed milk 1 6 months hard labour 1 Selling margarine in an unstamped wrapper 1 2 14 6 1 Defective drain 1 0 0 1 Neglecting to cleanse rooms and repair defective dustbin 1 1 2 0 1 Allowing kitchen to be occupied illegally 1 0 3 0 62 61 1 107 12 0 Sale of Food and Drugs Act.—The Vestry again draw attention to the fact that they have made arrangements for the analysis of private purchasers' 46 samples of food and drugs, and have decided that any resident of the Parish (traders accepted) shall be allowed, upon payment of 2s. 6d., to bring to the Vestry any article of food or drugs purchased or delivered in the Parish, for the purpose of being tested by the public Analyst. Should the sample submitted prove to be adulterated, the report will be handed over to the Inspector of the district, with the name and address of the seller, for the purpose of his taking samples in conformity with the Act, and if in that case the sample be found to be adulterated, the 2s. 6d. deposited by the person bringing the sample will be returned to him. The rule has been printed on the back of the ratepapers, but up to the present time little advantage has been taken of the arrangement by the parishioners. During the year the Vestry have considered the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, a synopsis of which was prepared by the Public Analyst, Mr. Jas. Kear Colwell, when a circular was directed to be sent to all the tradesmen, &c., in the parish calling their attention thereto. London Government, Westminster Conference.— The Vestry have received the following report, in continuation of their report of .February, 1898, from the delegates appointed on the Westminster Conferance in reference to London Government :— To Chairman and Members of the Clerkenwell Vestry. Gentlemen, In continuation of our Report of February, 1898, and of the various Reports issued by the Conference, we beg to announce the completion of the work of this Conference of certain Metropolitan Vestries. In response to the desire of the Duke of Devonshire, the Conference met and appointed an Executive Committee " to consider and report upon points in the suggestions by Mr. Wheeler, Q.C., and upon the Memorandum 47 relating to powers and duties which may be considered transferable." Mr. Millward was appointed on this Committee, upon the proposition of Mr. Johnson. The Draft Bill submitted by the Committee was carefully considered, and finally submitted to the Government, and there is no doubt that the work of the Conference and the continued representations made to the Government were instrumental in causing the introduction of the London Government Bill. But it must also be admitted that the times were ripe for a new measure of local self-government. Many of the members were really experts on the subject, especially Mr. Wheeler, Q.C., Kensington, and Mr. Smith, the Vestry Clerk of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, who acted as Secretary; on these two gentlemen the burden of the work fell heavily. The Act as passed is naturally a very different document to the Bill drawn up by the Conference, which was necessarily piecemeal and permissive, and was in fact called " A Bill to facilitate the creation of Municipal Boroughs in the County of London," &c. The provisions of the new Act are now generally known to members of the Vestry, and need not therefore be detailed; by extinguishing subsidiary bodies and by giving corporate dignity in the form of Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors, it will do much to raise the status of the new body. Our attendances both at the Conference and at the Committee were constant and numerous, and we desire to thank the Board for giving us the opportunity, as their representatives, to have some share in producing a result which we believe will be of very great benefit to all London. ARTHUR MILLWARD. J. JOHNSON. London Government. — In March, upon the recommendation of the Committee appointed by the Vestry to watch the interests of Clerkenwell as regards the changes proposed by the London Government Bill, the Vestry called a Conference, consisting of the Special Committee, the Chairman and Clerk of each of the following Boards, viz.: — St. Luke's Vestry, and Holborn and St. Giles District Board of Works, together with their Committee, to consider the position of the districts under the London Government Bill. Such 48 ference was held on the 29th March, St. Giles District Board not being represented, when the following resolutions were passed, the Holborn District Board of Works dissenting: — 1.—That in the opinion of this Conference, one of the new Borough Councils under the London Government Bill 1899, should include the parishes in the Holborn Poor Law Union and St. Giles' District Board of Works, all of which at present form the Parliamentary Borough of Finsbury. 2.—That the Special Committee represented at this Conference recommend their respective Vestries and the Holborn and St. Giles' District Boards to support the first Resolution as above. 3.—That copies of the Resolutions be sent to the Vestries concerned and the Holborn and St. Giles' Board of Works, and to the three members representing the Borough of Finsbury. The Vestry, however, did not acquiesce in the resolutions arrived at by the Conference, but passed a resolution to petition the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour in favour of joining Clerkenwell and St. Luke together as one municipality. Such petition is as follows: — LONDON GOVERNMENT BILL, 1899. The Humble Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, for the amalgamation of the Vestries of Clerkenwell and St. Luke as a Metropolitan Borough. To the Rt. Hon. A. J. BALFOUR, P.C., M.P., First Lord of the Treasury. Sheweth: That your Memorialists represent a Parish having a population of 66,216, and a rateable value of £430,851, equal to that of many large and important provincial towns. That your Memorialists deeply regret that Clerkenwell has not been included in the first schedule of the Bill as an area 49 which is to be a Borough, seeing that this Parish was recommended by the Royal Commission of 1894 amongst areas that were " ready for the immediate application of the proposal.''' That in order to comply with section 1 of the Bill as to population and rateable value, your Memorialists have very carefully considered the question as to the Parish which could best be joined to Clerkenwell for the purpose of making a suitable area for a Metropolitan Borough-. That they have resolved to petition in favour of being united with the Parish of Saint Luke as being a Parish which has much in common with Clerkenwell in the character of its inhabitants and in the trades carried on therein, and as one with which your petitioners have been closely associated for many years in parochial life, which has resulted in a very neighbourly and friendly spirit. That if the prayer of your Memorialists is acceded to, the conditions laid down in section 1 of the Bill will have been complied with in both particulars; the united population being 107,743, and the rateable value being £815,134. Your Memorialists therefore pray that you will include the Parishes of Clerkenwell and St. Luke's in the first schedule among the areas which are to be created Metropolitan Boroughs. And your Memorialists will ever pray. A. MILL WARD, Chairman of the Vestry. Signed with the Common Seal of the Vestry. By Order, G. RAY BROWN, Vestry Clerk pro tem. The Hon. W. F. B. Massey-Mainwaring, the Member of Parliament for the Division, moved an amendment to the Bill in the House of Commons, viz.:—That the Parliamentary Divisions of Central and East Finsbury be formed into a Metropolitan Borough—which amendment was accepted and incorporated in the First Schedule of the Bill. 50 A vote of thanks was passed by the Vestry to the Hon. Massey-Main waring for his valuable services in supporting the memorial of the Vestry, such resolution to be forwarded to him with the Seal of the Vestry attached thereto. On the 20th April the Vestry considered the London Government Bill, and passed the following resolution: — That this Vestry heartily approve the general principles of the London Government Bill, and that such resolution be forwarded to the Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour, and to the Metropolitan M.P.'s, and to the other Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. The London Government Commissioners appointed to carry out the various schemes under the Act, wrote to the Vestry asking whether they had any suggestions to offer in reference to the rectification of the boundary of the new Borough, and representations of the Vestry were forwarded to the Commissioners, who suggested that it was desirable that representatives of the Vestry should confer with representatives of the adjoining parishes with a view to joint representations being made, whereupon a sub-committee was appointed, consisting of Mr. A. Mill ward, Chairman of the Committee, Mr. E. H. Tripp, J.P., Chairman of the Board, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Walton, to act on the Vestry's behalf at the various conferences and inquiries to be held. The Sub-Committee met the representatives of Holborn, Islington and St. Pancras on various occasions, but they were unable to agree upon a joint recommendation to be made to the Commissioners. The Vestry thereupon forwarded their suggestions as to the alterations to be made, which were as follows: —Clerkenwell to give to Islington all that portion of the parish north-west 51 of a line drawn along the centre of the roadway of Pentonville Road, North Street, Collier Street, and Winchester Street, taking in exchange from Islington all that portion of their parish south of a line drawn along the centre of the roadway of Richard Street and Wynford Road. To give to St. Pancras the portion of Rowton House in the Parish, and to take the portion of the Parcels Post Office in their Parish. To give to Holborn all that portion of the parish situated west of a line drawn along the centre of the roadway of Warner Street, Back Hill, Clerkenwell Road, and Farringdon Road, and to take all that portion of their parish situate east of that line as far as and including the Metropolitan Railway Co. An inquiry was subsequently held on the 18th and 19th December by T. R. Colquhoun Dill, Esq., Assistant Commissioner, when the Chairman of the Board being deputed to conduct the case on behalf of the Vestry, the Vestry was represented by the Sub-Committee, and their proposals were eventually adopted by the Commissioners, with the exception that a portion of the boundary with Holborn was altered from Back Hill to Little Saffron Hill. On the 16th October a public inquiry was held at the Hornsey District Council's Offices in Southwood Lane, Highgate, with the view to the preparation of a draft order in Council in accordance with section 18 of the Act, which requires that any part of the County of London wholly surrounded by any other county shall be transferred thereto. A letter, dated 14th December, was received from the Commissioners, stating that after careful consideration they had arrived at the conclusion that the detached part of Clerkenwell at Muswell Hill should be annexed to the Parish of Hornsey. 52 On the 13th January the Vestry received a letter from the Commissioners stating that they proposed that 54 should be the number of Councillors for the new Borough, which would be divided pro rata amongst the parishes, according to their rateable value and population, such division being: Clerkenwell 30, St. Luke 21, other parishes 3; and asking to be informed of any observations the Vestry may have to offer thereon. The Vestry expressed its entire satisfaction with the proposals of the Commissioners, but the Vestry of St. Luke objected, and an inquiry was therefore ordered to be held at the Clerkenwell Town Hall on the 26th March, 1900, by the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. T. R. Colquhoun Dill. (As the result of such enquiry the Commissioners' proposals were adhered to.) Widening Goswell Road between Upper Ashby Street and Clerkenwell Road.—For some years past the Vestry has urged the County Council to undertake the widening of Goswell Road between Upper Ashby Street and Clerkenwell Road. In March a letter was received from the Clerk to the Council inquiring on behalf of the Improvements Committee whether, in the event of their agreeing to recommend the Council to undertake this improvement, together with the widening of St. John Street, the Vestry of Clerkenwell will give an undertaking that they will, as the road authority, place no obstacle in the way of the construction of tramways in St. John Street, or the doubling of the existing lines in Goswell Road, as the case may be, or in the way of the construction of junctions and extensions in connection with the Council's tramways in other parts of the parish; and also asking 58 whether the Vestry would make a contribution towards the cost, and if so, to what extent. After carefully considering the matter, the Works Committee informed the Council that they were prepared to recommend the Vestry to give its sanction to the construction of a double line of tramways through Goswell Road, and the construction of lines from the "Angel" Hotel through St. John Street Road and St. John Street to the boundary of the Parish near the Central Meat Market, also to a line through Rosebery Avenue to the Parish boundary, upon the Council undertaking to widen Goswell Road between Upper Ashby Street a,nd Clerkenwell Road at the cost of the County, as was done in the case of the Old Street Improvement, and to complete the line through St. John Street Road and St. John Street before the line through Rosebery Avenue is commenced. On the 4th May the Improvements Committee informed the Vestry that they would be prepared to recommend the Council to seek Parliamentary powers for the carrying out of the work, provided the local authorities concerned, the Vestry of Clerkenwell and the Vestry of St. Luke, will agree to contribute between them the sum of £20,000 towards the cost. After considerable discussion the Vestry eventually agreed to contribute the sum of £15,000 towards the cost of widening Goswell Road between Upper Ashby Street and Great Sutton Street, and gave its consent to the construction of a double line of tramways through Goswell Road, and the construction of double tram-lines from the "Angel" Hotel through St. John Street Road and St. John Street to the boundary of the Parish near the Central Meat Market; also to double tram lines through Rosebery Avenue to the 54 Parish boundary on the following conditions, viz.: That the Council carries out the Goswell Road widening, and lays double tram lines through St. John Street Road and St. John Street before commencing the laying of the tram lines in Rosebery Avenue. The Parliamentary Notice and Plans were subsequently considered by the Vestry, and no objections were offered thereto. Widening of St. John Street.—In connection with the widening of St. John Street, the County Council asked the Vestry to acquire No. 133, St. John Street, compulsorily under the powers conferred by the Act 57, George III., cap. 29 (Michael Angelo Taylor's Act), the whole cost of the acquisition to be paid by them. The Vestry agreed with the suggestion of the Council, and passed the necessary resolution for that purpose, and also appointed the Council's solicitor to act as the Vestry's solicitor in the matter. The Council subsequently arranged terms with the freeholder for the acquisition of the property, thereby rendering any further action by the Vestry unnecessary. Tramways.—The Vestry had before them the Parliamentary Notice and Plans deposited by the London County Council, showing their intention to apply for powers to lay tramways in Rosebery Avenue, St. John Street Road and St. John Street, and to double the lines in Goswell Road. They found that the condition of the Vestry's sanction to the laying of the tramways, which was approved by the Council, viz., "that the Council carries out the Goswell Road widening and lays double tram lines through St. John Street Road and St. John Street before commencing the laying of the tram lines in 55 Rosebery Avenue," was not included in the Bill, and they therefore asked the Council to insert a clause to this effect. The Council stated they were unable to insert such a clause, and asked whether the Vestry would be satisfied if the Council gave a reasonable undertaking to carry out the condition imposed. Upon the advice of the Solicitors, the Council were asked to embody the consent partly in an agreement and partly in clauses to be contained in the Bill referring to such agreement. The Chairman of the Board (Mr. E. H. Tripp, J.P.) and the Chairman of the Works Committee (Mr. T. A. Brunjes) afterwards interviewed the Highways and Parliamentary Committees of the Council on the subject, when they agreed to insert the clause. The Vestry also considered the general principles of the Bill, and found that the rights of the Local Road Authorities were not sufficiently protected. A Conference was therefore convened by the Vestry on Tuesday, the 30th January, of the Vestries and District Boards interested in the Bill to make arrangements for a joint representation being made to the Council on all matters affecting the Local Road Authorities as a whole. Several amendments and additions were suggested to the Bill, and a deputation was appointed by the Conference in support of such resolutions. The deputation waited upon the Highways Committee of the Council, when various amendments were finally agreed upon, and subsequently incorporated in the Bill. Improvement St. John Street Road by Pentonville Road.—The Vestry had under consideration the question of an improvement being effected at the junction of these roads, and they suggested to the London County Council the desirability of 56 ting back the footway opposite No. 1a, Pentonville Road, in connection with the proposed laying of tram lines in St. John Street Road. A letter was received from the Improvements Committee of the Council, asking whether, in the event of the Council agreeing to undertake the suggested improvement, the Vestry would be prepared to make a contribution towards the cost, and if so, to what extent, to which the Vestry replied that they were unable to make a contribution towards the costs, as the necessity for the improvement would be occasioned solely by the proposed laying of tram lines by the Council. . Land at junction of Goswell Road and City Road.—The attention of the Vestry was called to the piece of land at the junction of City and Goswell Roads, to the unsightly hoarding enclosing same, and to the nature of the objectionable business carried on inside, and a Sub-Committee was appointed to meet a Sub-Committee of the Islington Vestry, with the view of jointly approaching the County Council as to the purchase of the land as a small open space for the use of the public, and, if this were successful, of joining hands in the construction of an underground urinal in place of the present unsightly one. Negotiations were opened with Messrs. Farebrother, Ellis & Co. on behalf of t.he owners, but the price, viz., £5,000, being prohibitive, the matter was dropped. Price of Gas.—In January last the Vestry appointed Mr. E. H. Tripp, J.P., as their representative to a Conference convened by the Holborn Board of Works. Mr. Tripp reported to the Vestry that the Conference, finding that counsel's opinion (see pages 49 to 53 in last year's Annual Report) 57 was against the Local Authorities spending money in placing a case before the Parliamentary Committee, the Joint Committee appointed by the Conference went by deputation to the County Council, and urged them to exercise the right they possessed, and appear before the Committee of Inquiry of the House of Commons on behalf of the Local Authorities. The Council agreed to oppose the Gas Light and Coke Co.'s Bill for the consolidation of their stock with the result that the Bill was thrown out by the House of Lords Committee. The Council also adopted the following recommendations:— (1) That whenever any of the Metropolitan Gas Companies again come to Parliament for an extension or alteration of their capital powers a revision of the sliding scale should take place, and that the standard price should be reduced to 3s, 3d. to carry the standard dividend of 10 per cent., and that the existing scale of increase and decrease for dividend of ¼ per cent. for every penny of decrease or increase of price below or above 3s. 3d. be maintained, and that a secondary or additional scale be imposed which should permit of an increase or decrease of dividend over and above that regulated by the present scale of ¼ per cent. for every complete 3d. of decrease or increase below or above the standard price of 3s. 3d. (2) That the area south of the River Thames at present part of the district of the Gas Light and Coke Company, acquired by them from the absorption of the London Gas Company in 1883, should be transferred from the Gas Light and Coke Company to the South Metropolitan Gas Company, fair and reasonable price being paid by the latter to the former Company for their property in the southern area. (3) That the charge made by the Gas Light and Coke pany for the rents of automatic meters and stoves should 58 be the same to consumers north and south of the Thames for fittings of the same quality and capacity, and that the prices charged by all the companies for these slot meters and fittings require regulation, having regard to the fact that the business is a now one, and has extended with extraordinary rapidity throughout the Metropolis. (4) That capital powers should not be granted to any gas company for more than five years, if and when new capital is required, and that Parliament should revise the sliding scale, either by way of increase or decrease, when any application for new capital is made, if the circumstances of the times or the conditions of the company appear to require it. (5) That an effort should be made by any company having obsolete or unproductive capital to redeem such capital by sinking fund or otherwise. On the 12th October the Vestry passed the following resolution on the subject:— "That the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, P.C., M.P., First Lord of the Treasury, be asked to take such steps as may be necessary to put into operation the new sliding scale as recommended by the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Metropolitan Gas Companies, at once, instead of waiting until the Gas Light and Coke Co. apply to Parliament for powers to increase its capital"; and "That a copy of the foregoing resolution be sent to all the Vestries and District Boards north of the Thames, and that they be asked to support the action of this Vestry in the matter." Ropes Across Footways.—The attention of the Vestry was called by Mr. Beard to this matter, when a resolution was passed to ask the County Council to take such action as may be necessary to make it compulsory, in all cases of public-houses which are pulled down and rebuilt, that provision be made for lowering and lifting the barrels, &c., into the cellars by means of hydraulic power, or other means, with a view to abolishing the use of ropes across the footway, and also that a circular 59 be sent to all Vestries and District Boards, inviting them to co-operate with the Vestry in taking similar action. The Council stated that the matter of making provision for lowering barrels into cellars by means of hydraulic or other power, with the view to abolishing the use of ropes across footways, hardly falls within the purview of the Building Acts, but is rather one to be dealt with by an Amendment of Sec. 101 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and that they are not at the present moment prepared to recommend the Council to consider the question of promoting legislation as suggested by the Vestry. A letter was thereupon sent to the Council expressing the regret of the Vestry that they cannot see their way to make a by-law as suggested, seeing that 23 Vestries and District Boards have expressed themselves in favour of same and none against it. Northampton Institute.—The Vestry have again had under consideration the question of the Vestry having a representative on the Governing Body of the Northampton Institute, and they have passed the following resolution:-"That a representation by letter, or if necessary by deputation, be made to the Charity Commissioners, urging them to grant to the parochial authority of Clerkenwell the right of representative on the Governing Body of the Northampton Institute." The Charity Commissioners replied that to confer representation upon the Vestry would involve the establishment of a scheme modifying the existing scheme for the administration of the Charity, and that the necessary proceedings for such a purpose could only be initiated by the Charity Commissioners upon an application signed by at least a majority of the Governors of the Institute; whereupon the Vestry respectfully 60 laid before the Governors of the Northampton Institute the letter received from the Charity Commissioners, anent their application for a representation on the Governing Body of the Institute, and their hope that the Governors, after careful consideration, will see their way to support such a representation; but the Governing Body declined to take any action in the matter. War in South Africa.—The Vestry had under consideration the question of establishing a local branch of the Mansion House Fund for the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in South Africa, and passed the following resolution thereon :— "That this Vestry, recognizing the national importance of the Fund opened for the relief of the Widows and Orphans of our Soldiers fighting the battles of this country in the present war, hereby appoint a Committee of ten members of the Vestry, two from each Ward, with power to add to its number, to receive local subscriptions towards such Fund, subscriptions so received to be remitted to the Mansion House Fund; and requests its Chairman, Mr. E. H. Tripp, J.P., to act as local treasurer of such Fund; and also requests the local Press to make it known as widely as possible that such subscriptions will be received at the Town Hall." A report of the proceedings of the Committee will appear in next year's annual report. Three of the Vestry's employees in the Army Reserve were called up for active service, and the Vestry allowed their wives half their wages while they were absent, and kept their places open for them. The Vestry allowed the use of the Town Hall for a supper and entertainment to be given to Volunteers for South Africa; and also passed a resolution congratulating the officers and members of the 21st 61 Middlesex Volunteers upon the patriotic response made by the regiment (particularly associated with Clerkenwell) to the Lord Mayor's invitation for volunteers to proceed to South Africa, and wishing the gallant detachment God speed, and a safe, speedy and happy return. They also, on the occasion of the victory at at Kimberley, passed the following resolution of congratulation to Her Majesty the Queen:— "That the Vestry of Clerkenwell now assembled, representing 66,000 of your Majesty's subjects, offers its loyal and dutiful congratulations on the splendid victories which, under God, have been vouchsafed to your Arms in South Africa during the past ten days, trusts that your Majesty will be endued with health and strength daring this trying crisis, and heartily welcome your presence among your loyal citizens"; And such resolution was telegraphed to Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace, and a letter was duly received from the Private Secretary expressing the thanks of Her Majesty for the kind message of congratulation forwarded by the Vestry. Re-numbering Rosebery Avenue and Lorenzo Street.—An order and plan has been received from the London County Council for altering the name of The Facade, John Street, Garnault Place (northern section), St. John's Terrace, Myddelton Place, and for re-numbering the several houses and buildings therein; and also for renumbering the houses and premises in Lorenzo Street. Taxation of Land Values.—The Vestry appointed Mr. E. H. Tripp, J.P., and Mr. J. Walton as delegates to attend a Conference at the Battersea Town Hall on Thursday, the 1st March, with a view to united action being taken to promote a Bill in Parliament for the taxation of land values. 62 Hackney Carriage Standing, St. John Street Road.—The Commissioner of Police appointed a standing for three hackney carriages in St. John Street Road, opposite the "Angel" Hotel. Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897, &c.— The Vestry had under consideration the advisability of insuring against accidents which may happen to the Vestry's employees in the discharge of their various duties, and they accepted the offer of the Law Accident Insurance Society, Limited, to insure the Vestry against liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897, the Employers' Liability Act, 1880, Common Law without limitation, and Lord Campbell's Act, for the sum of £12,000 per annum, at the rate of 5s. per cent. Library Rate.—The Vestry requested the Solicitors to advise them whether they still have power to make a Library Rate of a lesser sum than 1d. in the pound, or whether there is anything in the Order transferring the powers from the Commissioners to the Vestry which makes it imperative at all times to make a rate of 1d. in the pound. Their advice was that the Vestry still have such power under section 18, sub-section 2 (1) of the Public Libraries Act, 1892, and that there is nothing in the order of the Local Government Board transferring the duties from the Commissioners to the Vestry, or in the Local Government Act of 1898, which, in their opinion, takes away or interferes with this power, and that one of the officials at the offices of the Local Government Board whom they saw upon the subject took the same view. Combined Drainage.— Sewers and Drains Bill.— Upon the receipt of a letter from the Holborn Board 63 of Works, the Vestry communicated with the County Council urging them to re-introduce the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill early in the next Session, and a letter was subsequently received from the Council, stating that they were taking steps to have the Bill again introduced into Parliament in the ensuing Session. Finance Act, 1899.—The Vestry received a letter from the Inland Revenue Department, stating that under the Finance Act, 1899, they will have to notify the Inland Revenue Department of any loan they may require, and that 2s. 6d. in the £100 will have to be paid as stamp duty. The duty is paid by the lending body, and charged in the costs. London Hydraulic Power Company's Bill.— The Vestry had before them the London Hydraulic Power Company's Bill, which provides that, in the event of any local authority withholding their consent or giving their consent conditional upon any terms, conditions or stipulations, the Company shall have the power of appealing to the Board of Trade; and as it tended to curtail the rights of local authorities, the Bill was opposed. Upon the suggestion of the St. Luke's Vestry, the Vestry asked the County Council to undertake the opposition generally to the Bill, with the result that it was rejected by the House of Commons. Local Authorities Officers' Superannuation Bill.—The Vestry approved the principles of this Bill, which provides for the superannuation of officers and servants based upon a contribution from salary, and presented a petition in favour of the Bill, sealed with the Common Seal of the Vestry. 64 Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1854 (Amendment of Section 133.—The Vestry agreed with a letter they received from the Vestry of Kensington as to the desirability of amending Section 133 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, whereby Local Authorities shall in future be entitled to be recouped the whole of the local rates instead of only the Poor Rate in respect of any property acquired by railway or other companies until the new works come into rating, and they asked the Hon. W. F. B. Massey-Mainwaring to direct the attention of the Government to the necessity of passing a measure to amend the section. Storm Flooding—In September the Vestry appointed Messrs. Brunjes and Beard to a Conference to be held at the Paddington Town Hall on the question of storm flooding, and the following is the resolution then passed, with which the Vestry agreed:— That this Conference, comprising representatives of the leading Parishes on the North side of the Thames, hereby places on record its surprise, that, notwithstanding the strong expression of opinion by the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council and its responsible officers, and the repeated representations of Vestries and District Boards to the effect that the existing sewer accommodation of the Metropolis was entirely inadequate to cany out the work required of it—that no attempt should have been made to abate the intolerable evil complained of; and, further, that this Conference urges upon the Council the absolute necessity of their at once carrying out such works as may be necessary to remedy the above-mentioned state of things. Expenses of Paving Streets.—The Vestry have had before them the following important judgment in reference to the above subject:— 65 SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE.—COURT OF APPEAL. February 28; March 2. Allen v. Fulham Vestry. Metropolis—" New Street"—Expenses of paving— Liability of frontagers—Metropolis Management Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vict. c. 120), s. 105 — Metropolis Management (Amendment) Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict. c. 102), s. 77. Under section 77 of the Metropolis Management (Amendment) Act, 1862, it is a question of fact for the magistrate whether a road has become at any given time a "new street" within the meaning of the Act, and the court will not interfere with his decision unless it is clearly wrong upon the evidence. A road constructed as a highway by Act of Parliament through agricultural land may become a new street as soon as houses have been constructed on both sides of it. Appeal from the decision of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice (Day and Ridley, J.J.), dated the 17th of June, 1898, in favour of the Fulham Vestry. Smith, L.J.—In this case the frontagers contend that in 1877 the road in question was a " new street " within the meaning of the Metropolis Management Acts 1885 and 1862. The Vestry, on the other hand, say that it was not at that time a street but that it became a street for the first time when houses were built along both sides of it. The facts are as follows. The road in question was originally made by the Wandsworth Bridge Company, which was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1864. After considerable dispute with the Fulham Board of Works a compromise was arrived at in 1876 by which the Board of Works agreed with the Bridge Company to make up the road on payment of £1,750 by the Company to them. In the year 1877 there were no houses at all along the road, and this continued down to the year 1895. The question at issue was, is this a "new street" within the meaning of the two Acts in the year 1877. In the year 1895 buildings were put up on the west side of the road, and in 1896 further buildings were put up on the east side. The learned magistrate has found as a fact that this was not a new street in 1876. The frontagers contend that there can be a "new street" without buildings. In my opinion section 105 of the Metropolis Management Act of 1855 contemplates houses being on both sides of the 66 road; this proposition has the authority of Lord Selborne in Robinson v. Local Board of Barton-Eccles (supra), where he defines the meaning of a "new street." In my opinion the object of section 77 of the Metropolis Management (Amendment) Act is to deal with cases where there are vacant spaces between the houses which are built on either side of a load, otherwise the owners of the houses alone would have to pay and the owners of the vacant spaces would get off free. In the case of Vestry of St. Mary (Battersea) v. Palmer (supra), Wright, J., defines the meaning of section 77, and I agree with his interpretation of the section. In my opinion therefore this appeal fails, and this road did not become a "new street" until houses were built on either side, and the Vestry were entitled to charge the paving expenses on the frontagers. Collins and Romer, L.JJ., concurred. Appeal dismissed. Adjourned. Memorial Portrait of the late Mr. R. E. Paget.— In January, 1899, the Vestry appointed a Committee to place a memorial of the late Vestry Clerk in the Town Hall. About £80 was collected from the Vestrymen, Officials and others, with which the Committee decided to have a portrait painted by his brother, Mr. Sidney Paget. The portrait was unveiled on the 18th May by Mr. A. Millward, and handed over to the Vestry by the subscribers as a memento of one who had served the parish faithfully for so many years. Office Staff.—In consequence of the death of the Vestry Clerk, Mr. R. E. Paget, the Vestry considered as to filling the vacancy, and Mr. Gr. R. Brown, the first Assistant Clerk, was appointed to act as Vestry Clerk pro tem, for six months from November 17th, 1898. In April, 1899, the whole 67 question of the General Office was considered, and the duties were re-arranged, and Mr. G R. Brown was appointed Vestry Clerk pro tern., Mr. C. A. Harrison first Assistant pro tem., Mr. E. J. Sans second Assistant pro tem., Mr. E. G. Hill third Assistant pro tem., such appointments to take effect from September, 1898, and Mr. R. C. Pedler Junior Clerk for one year. In June Mr. Brown's health broke down, and he was granted six weeks' leave of absence, which was extended from time to time, Mr. Harrison being appointed as acting Vestry Clerk. As Mr. Brown's health did not improve, a Special Committee was appointed to consider the matter, and upon their recommendation Mr. Brown was superannuated at £120 per annum, being thirty-sixtieths of his salary previous to his appointment as Vestry Clerk pro tem. The General Office was again considered by the Special Committee, and on the 23rd November Mr. C. A. Harrison was appointed Vestry Clerk, Mr. E. J. Sans, first Assistant, Mr. E. G. Hill, second Assistant, and Mr. R. C. Pedler, third Assistant, such appointments to date from 29th September, 1899. Mr. C. W. Durley was appointed temporary Junior Clerk on the 14th December. Approved by the Vestry September 13th, 1900. C. A. HARRISON, Vestry Clerk. STATEMENT & ACCOUNT of an moneys received & Expended From 26th March, 1899,to 20th March 1900.

Od. 94 REPORT of the WORKS COMMITTEE on Dusting, Slopping, &c., For the Year to March 25th, 1900. Collection and Disposal of House Refuse, &c.— During the past year 13 horses and vans were engaged daily in the house-to-house collection of refuse, and the removal of trade refuse. Each house was visited once a week, and the Model Dwellings and public dust bins twice a week. There were very few complaints received of the non-removal of the dust. There were 10,657 loads of dust and trade refuse removed (or about 39,963 cubic yards), being an increase of 325 loads. Upon the dust, &c., arriving at the wharf it was sorted and screened, the ashes and breeze and all saleable articles being sold. There were 155 freights of ashes and breeze sent away, containing 9,942 chaldrons, being 15 freights, or 953 chaldrons in excess of last year. 95 The broken crockeryware, clinkers, &c., were sent away with the street sweepings in barges as rubbish. Previous years these were stored upon the wharf, until there was a freight, and then sent away in barges as " hardcore." During the year the Committee accepted the tender of Mr. H. Chambers, of Faversham, for the purchase of the ashes and breeze at an increased price ; the amount received for same was £2,027 18s. 0d., being an increase of £536 3s. 8d. over the amount received last year. Sundry articles found in the dust were sold for £143 14s. 2d. The remainder of the refuse, consisting principally of rubbish, soft core, and vegetable refuse was burnt in the Destructor from May 12th, when the Contractors handed same over. The Destructor was closed on two or three occasions for improvements to be effected, &c., leaving practically 9 months in which the Destructor was at work. During this period, calculating that each load of dust brought to the Wharf contains 9 cwts. of rubbish to be consumed, it shows that upwards of 3,192 tons of rubbish were 'destroyed, instead of being sent away in barges at a cost of £532. The working expenses in connection with the Destructor amounted to £254 l1s. 2d.; but included in this item are the wages of two lads, amounting to £78, that would have been engaged in taking the rubbish to the barge if there were no Destructor. The quantity of coal used was 31 tons, the cost being £23 15s. 3d., and cost of oil, &c., for the engine was £8 7s. 3d. The coal is chiefly used in the winter months and wet weather The residue from the refuse amounted to about 269½ tons of ashes (which, being a saleable article, gave a return of something ike £00), and 245½ tons of clinkers, barged away at a cost of about £20 12s. Od. The nett cost of collecting and disposing of the dust, &c., was 3s. 9½d. per load, as against 4s. l0d. per load the previous year, as shown by the following return:— Cost of Collecting and Disposing of House Refuse, Trade Refuse, &c., for the year ending March 25th 1900.

Street Cleansing and Disposal of Refuse.—The cleansing of the Parish was carried on by night and day gangs, the main roads being swept at night by two machine brooms and two gangs of seven sweepers each, including ganger. The remainder of the streets and courts were swept during the day by one machine Droom, and two gangs of eight sweepers each, including ganger. An extra gang of men were also employed in wet weather as required, the cost of which amounted to £317 14s. lOd. The market streets and a number of adjoining streets were also swept on Sundays. Snow fell on iwo or three occasions during the winter, necessitating an increased expenditure of <£240 5s. Od. in clearing same. The number of loads of sweepings received were 8,279, an increase of 1,254 loads on the previous year ; and the number of freights (or barges hired) was 149, being 44 less than the previous year.

The cost of horse hire show an increase of £244 12s. 10d., but included in this item are horses that were engaged solely in horsing the water vans for the purpose of washing the main roads, which was done on several occasions. The washing of the main roads, and the more frequent cleansing of the streets, also accounts for the increase of £247 l6s. l0d. in the sweepers' wages. The average number of horses engaged in street cleansing were— 8 horses for the night gangs 5 „ „ „ day „ 1 horse clearing gully refuse.

STREET WATERING. The Street Watering was done by the Vestry's own vans, horses and men being hired except on Sundays. The vans were out on 136 days, including Sundays, the average number being 8.82. 6,480,000 gallons of water were used, being an increase of 783,000. The total cost was as follows:— £ s. d. Horse Hire, including driver - 600 1 6 Wages of own Carmen 15 10 0 Keep of Horses 6 10 0 Repairs to Water Vans - 80 0 0 Repairs to Standposts 74 7 3 Cost of Water, including Rent of Meters - 199 16 0 £976 4 9 The price of water for street watering was owered to 6d. per 1,000 gallons. The length of the streets to be watered is approximately 20 miles ; the cost per mile thus being £48 16s. 4d. ; the cost of distributing the 6,480,000 gallons was 1s. 11d. per 1,000 gallons. 129 Six water-vans were out on Sundays when required from 6 to 10 a.m., the Vestry's own horses and carmen being employed. Street Watering Posts.—One new street watering post was fixed in Pine Street in place of that removed from opposite the Fire Station in Rosebery Avenue, and one additional post in Upper Vernon Street. TREES. The total number of trees in the public streets is 239, planted as follows:— St. John Street Road - 18 Pentonville Road 9 Penton Street - 23 Clerkenwell Green - 32 Clerkenwell Close - 2 Upper Chadwell Street - 4 Rosebery Avenue, between Farringdon Road and Holborn boundary 47 Rosebery Avenue, between Farringdon Road and St. John Street Road - 104 Total 239 Eleven additional trees were planted: 4 in Rosebery Avenue, by Underground Convenience and 7 on Clerkenwell Green, by Underground Convenience. 130 The whole of the trees are now maintained by the Vestry. Ten trees required replacing with new. CLEANSING OF STREETS. The sweeping of the streets was carried out as follows :—Two gangs, each consisting of 6 men with ganger, and two machine brooms were employed to sweep each main road in the Parish every night and the remainder of the streets were swept not less than three times a week, and a considerable number every day, by 2 gangs of sweepers consisting of 8 men each including ganger, and one machine broom. The whole of the day sweepers were also employed on Sunday morning in generally clearing up the streets ; the market streets were also cleared at mid-day. Temporary Sweeping Gang.—A temporary gang of sweepers was employed as required, the wages of which, including those employed in the removal of snow, was £557 19s. 10d. The number of loads of street sweepings removed was 8,279, being an increase of 1,254 loads, or an average increase of 24 loads per week. The average number of horses employed was 13 per day, including those with the brooms. 131 The approximate cost was as follows:— £ s. d. Carmen's wages Rate 871 15 2 Scavengers' ,, 2,092 1 1 ,, ,, (tempy.gang) 557 19 10 Keep of horses Rate 347 19 4 Cost of barging slop away Rate 1,126 3 3 Brooms for sweeping machines, and scavengers' brooms Rate 138 5 9 Repairs to sweeping machines 8 17 3 Hire of horses and vans 415 0 1 £5,558 1 0 The question of the supervision of the Wharf, and night sweeping, was very carefully considered by the Works Committee, who were of opinion that more supervision was required at the Wharf during the day, and with a view to release the Wharf Superintendent from night duty, the whole of the cleansing of the streets was placed under the Surveyor, from 14th September last. The night gangers' wages at the same time being increased from 28s. to 29s. per week. DESTRUCTOR AT WHARF. The Destructor in course of construction by Messrs. Joseph Baker and Sons, Willesden Junction, at the close of previous report, was completed on May 1st, and started ourning regularly 132 on May 12th. The Destructor was closed on 2 or 3 occasions for improvements to be effected. The Destructor, therefore, was working practically nine months, and, although the number of loads of slop received at wharf was 1,254 more than the previous year, and the dust showed an increase of 325 loads, the cost of barge hire was only £45 l1s. 9d. more, notwithstanding an increase of 2d. per ton on the registered tonnage, and the fact that during 3 months the whole of the rubbish carted to wharf was barged away. It is estimated that upwards of 3,000 tons of rubbish were consumed that would previously have been barged away at a cost of about £350. The cost of the Destructor was as follows :— Amount of original contract £1,089 0 0 Extra depth of foundations, 5 feet Portland cement concrete over whole site 192 15 0 Repairing chimney shaft 27 0 0 Hipping roof 30 0 0 Whip crane 32 0 0 Repairing flue of horsekeeper's apartments 2 0 0 Stearn piping for heating purposes 3 0 0 Constructing drains 5 0 0 Lengthening chimney shaft 21 15 0 Enclosing end of shed 21 15 0 £1,424 5 0 133 MUSWELL HILL. The plans for several new roads at Muswell Hill were passed, and a very large amount of building operations have been carried on. It is satisfactory to state that the sewers laid by the Vestry are working admirably, nothing beyond the periodical flushing having been done to them throughout the year. Permission was given to the Post Office telegraph authorities to fix telegraph poles on the footway in Colney Hatch Lane for the purpose of connecting a fire alarm by Barnard Hill with the Fire Station. After negotiations extending over several months an agreement was entered into between the Vestry and the Wood Green Urban District Council with reference to the surface water of that portion of Clerkenwell detached that drains into the Wood Green surface water sewers. The costs of constructing sewers in Colney Hatch Lane, Muswell Avenue North, Barnard Hill, and Birkbeck Road were apportioned upon the various owners of the houses or land abutting on such roads. A very large amount of correspondence ensued, and a number of the owners decided to test the question as to their liability. These proceedings were pending at the date this report closes. 134 New Roads. —Upon the application of a large number of the owners and occupiers, the Vestry agreed to make up and pave the following streets, upon the condition that the estimated cost was deposited with the Vestry before the work was commenced, viz. :— Muswell Road, between Colney Hatch Lane and Middleton Road. Alexandra Park Road, between Colney Hatch Lane and east side of Muswell Avenue. Muswell Avenue, north and south portions. Clerkenwell Road Paving.—The Works Committee having decided to recommend the Vestry to re-pave the south side of this carriageway with Aberdeen granite, a deputation waited upon the Committee urging that wood paving be laid instead of granite, This, the Committee were unable to agree to unless the Tramway Company were willing to pave their portion of the carriageway with similar material. A large amount of correspondence took place between the Vestry, the Tramway Company and the London County Council, and every effort was made to induce the Tramway Company to lay down wood. The Company, however, refused to do so, stating that their paving was in good condition, and would last for several years. Under the circumstances it was therefore eventually decided to carry out the original proposal of the Committee. 135 REINSTATEMENT OF TRENCHES. The question of the cost of reinstating paving over trenches opened by the various Companies was considered. The St. Pancras Vestry wrote suggesting the desirability of a uniform charge being made, as far as possible, by adjoining Parishes, and a schedule of prices was eventually agreed to between several of the Vestries and the Companies. The new scale of charges came into force after Lady Day last, and will result in a considerable increase in the amount received by the Vestry for such work. DRINKING FOUNTAIN, NEW RIVER WALL. In consequence of the extension of the New River Company's Offices, the drinking fountain fixed in the wall was pulled down. Application was made to the Company to allow the fountain to be refixed in a new position, and the Directors of the Company immediately gave instructions for this to be done at the expense of the Company. CATTLE TROUGHS AND DRINKING FOUNTAINS. The Metropolitan Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain Association made an application for the Vestry to take over the entire charge of cleansing the water troughs and fountains within the Parish, 136 stating that the travelling expenses of the workmen in addition to wages was a very heavy item in the Association's expenditure. The Vestry had previously increased the annual subscription, but agreed to undertake the cleansing. (The Vestry has since taken over the entire control of the troughs and fountains.) ST. JAMBS' CHURCHYARD, PENTONVILLE. The boundary wall between the western garden and the main entrance to the Church was rebuilt at a cost of £35. OPEN SPACES. A Sub-Committee of the Works Committee was appointed to take charge of the Open Spaces under the control of the Vestry, and a very great improvement was effected in the general appearance of the squares and churchyards. The Vestry agreed to spend a larger sum for providing plants, &c., and the result has thoroughly justified the outlay. CLAREMONT SQUARE AND LLOYD SQUARE. A footway has been formed round the enclosures of these two squares, and a very decided improvement effected thereby in the appearance of the squares, the channels previously being made use of largely as a rubbish shoot. 187 JERUSALEM COURT. Application was made by the owner of several of the houses in this court for permission to block up the entrance from St. John's Square, this was refused. VESTRY'S WORKMEN. Masons and Paviors.—The Vestry decided that from May 1st, 1891, that the Masons, Paviors, Rammermen, and labourers should be employed by the hour instead of by the week. The wages paid are: Masons and Paviors, 9½d. per hour; Rammermen, 7d. per hour; and Labourers, 6½d. per hour. Mr. James Gloag was appointed Road Foreman to specially superintend all paving works. CAB RANK. The Commissioner of Police appointed a standing for three Hackney carriages in St. John Street Road by Pentonville Road. It was suggested that this would cause a congestion of traffic; it was however decided to take no action at the time, and no complaints have been received of any nuisance arising therefrom. SICK BENEFIT CLUB. In consequence of the alteration in terms of employment of a large number of the workmen and to the fact that a considerable amount of dissatisfaction existed amongst various section of the members, the 138 Works Committee considered it desirable that the Club should be more under the control of the Vestry, seeing that the Vestry contribute 6d. per week per member to the men's 2d. per week. I undertook the duties of Treasurer and the Street Inspector that of Secretary. During the year the expenditure was as follows:— Amount of sick pay 153 11 3 Death claims 2 members 20 0 0 „ ,, 2 „ wives 10 0 0 Surgeon's fees 20 16 0 Secretary's fees, printing, &c. 8 1 4 £212 8 7 The balance at the end of year was £34 2s. 8d. The Pluto lamp fixed in Exmouth Street was not a success, and the Vestry was asked to take same over, the owners undertaking to convert it into a drinking fountain. The Vestry however, declined the offer, and the lamp was removed, RE-NUMBERING OF STREETS. The London County Council have re-numbered the following streets :— Lorenzo Street. Rosebery Avenue. 139 The houses in Garnault Place, between Rosebery Avenue and Hardwick Street, have been re-numbered in Rosebery Avenue. I have now adverted generally to the principal works in my department, upon which I have been engaged during the past year, and the appended schedule will show the cost of such works. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. GORRINGE KILLICK, Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor. 140 Abstract of 'principal paving and other works executed during the year 18991900, and the cost thereof. WORKS EXECUTED BY CONTRACT. £ s. d.

SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875. REPORTS OF Mr. J. K. COLWELL, F.I.C., F.C.S., Public Analyst, AND INSPECTORS, 1899-1900. 152 Public Analyst's Report. Clerkenwell Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, E.C. 17th July, 1900. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, during the year ending 31st March, 1900. The total number of samples of food and drugs examined during that period was 303. The totals for the preceeding nine years are as follows:— Year. No. of Samples Examined. 1890-91 144 1891-92 149 1892-93 184 1893-94 185 1894-95 177 1895-96 228 1896-97 311 1897-98 304 1898-99 299 Of the 303 samples, 300 were submitted for analysis by the Vestry's Inspectors, Messrs. Green (130), Ensor (100), and the late Inspector Bartlett (70), and 3 by private purchasers. 153 In the following table will be found a statement of the articles examined during each quarter of the year:— Name of Article. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

The figures for the preceding nine years are as follows:— Year. Percentage of Adulterated samples. 1890-91 29.8 1891-92 22.1 1892-93 17.9 1893-94 23.7 1894-95 16.4 1895-96 23.2 1896-97 22.1 1897-98 13.8 1898-99 15.7 MILK. As usual, great attention has been paid to this important article of food. Of the 131 samples analysed 38 (29.0 per cent.) were found to be adulterated, while ten of those classed as "not adulterated" were of very poor quality. This is a slight improvement on last year when 32 per cent. of the samples were found to be adulterated, but the milk supply of the parish must still be regarded as distinctly unsatisfactory. The nature and amount of the adulteration in each case were as follows:— No.of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration. FIRST QUARTER (ending 30th June, 1899. C 2 21 At least 6'0 per cent. of fat removed. Pri. pur. „ 16.0 „ „ C 2 9 „ 16.6 „ „ C 3 6 At least 4.1 per cent. of water added.

Thirty-three samples of milk were taken on Sundays during September, and no less than 12 of these (36.3 per cent.) proved to be adulterated. In one case the fluid retailed as milk consisted of one-third milk and two-thirds water. Of the 21 genuine samples three were certified to be of very poor quality. BUTTER. Five (8.7 per cent.) of the samples of butter were found to contain foreign fat (fat other than the fat of butter), as follows:— No. of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration. C 3 11 At least 80 per cent. of foreign fat. C3 16 „ 70 „ „ 52 „ 80 „ „ 58 ,, 75 „ „ C 2 88 „ 75 „ „ WHISKY. Only one sample of whisky was unduly diluted with water so as to bring it in excess of the limit allowed by the Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act. In this case, No. C 3 82, the sample was 31.36 degrees under proof. COFFEE. One of the ten samples of coffee was found to contain at least 40 per cent. of chicory, and was certified accordingly. PEPPER Two (13.3 per cent.) of the samples of pepper were adulterated with foreign starch—maize in both instances. No. C 2 96 contained 20 per cent. of this ingredient, and a sample submitted by a private purchaser no less than 40 per cent. 157 MUSTARD. The adulteration of a sample of mustard with wheat-starch was apparently accidental as only some 3 per cent. of that starch could be found. SALAD OIL. The sample of adulterated salad oil, to which reference has been made in a previous report, consisted practically of mineral oil. It is necessary, however, to again call attention to the fact that such an article is being sold, as its use may be attended with considerable danger. MARGARINE. Since the beginning of the present year it has been unlawful to sell margarine containing more than 10 per cent. of butter fat. The four samples examined during the quarter affected by this new Act of Parliament were found to be well within the limit. COCOA, CHEESE, &c. The remaining samples were all certified to be "not adulterated." I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. KEAR COLWELL. 158 REPORT OF PUBLIC ANALYST For the Quarter ending 30th June, 1899.

KEAR COLWELL, Public Analyst. 5th May, 1900. 171 ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1899. London: vail and co., printers, 170, farringdon road. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report on the Public Health and Sanitary condition of the Parish of Clerkenwell for the year 1899. It contains the statistical tables required by the Local Government Board, and a more or less complete record of the work of this Department during the year. I need hardly remind you that during the whole of the period covered by the Report my predecessor, the late Dr. John Glaister, was Medical Officer of Health. His work for this Parish requires no praise of mine to commend it to the Vestry. Many of the results recorded in this Report reflect infinite credit upon his ability, efficiency, and wise foresight. His death is a loss, not only to the Vestry, but to the whole district. I regret the delay in the issue of the Report, but this has been unavoidable under the circumstances. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, GEORGE NEWMAN. Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Vestry of Clerkenwell, Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, E C June 12th, 1900. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health, Population.—From the constant and increasing changes which are taking place in the Clerkenwell district, as in most districts of Central London, it is impossible to determine with accuracy the real population of the district. For 1899. Since 1896 this total figure has been used for the purposes of vital statistics. The Registrar-General states it as follows:— St. James, Clerken well 15,777 Amwell, Clerkenwell 34,356 Goswell Road 16,069 Total 66,202 6 In Central London, generally speaking, we may say that owing to it becoming less residential the number of persons found sleeping in a given area does not represent the true population of such an area. It is thus a matter of some importance to centrally-situated districts that at the coming census (1901) the authorities should take the number of persons actually employed in various districts. But for statistical purposes the population of 66,202 has been used in Clerkenwell since 1896, and for the sake of comparison it will be taken as the basis for all the following figures. Births.—The total number of births registered in the district during 1899 was 2,050 a number slightly less than that recorded in 1898, which was 2,072. In 1897 there were 2,092 births. The general birth-rates throughout the country were similarly less for 1899 than for the previous year. The birth-rate for Clerkenwell in 1899 works out at 30.9 as compared with 31.2 per 1,000 in 1898. The birth-rate for the 33 large towns was as low as 30.2 per 1,000 of the population, and the London birth-rate of 29.4 is the lowest on record. The births in Clerken well were distributed as follows:— District. Total. Rate per 1,000 of the Population in 1899. St. James 468 29.6 Amwell 1,062 30.9 Goswell Road 520 32.3 Clerkenwell 2,050 30.9 Deaths.—The total number of deaths, after correction,* which were registered as properly belonging to this district was 1,478, * Correction consists in omitting deaths, occurring in hospitals and kindred institutions within a district, of persons not properly belonging to it; and of including deaths of such of its inhabitants as have occurred in hospitals, workhouses, infirmaries, asylums, &c., outside its boundary. 7 yielding a total death-rate of 22.3 per 1,000. This is our true death-rate. It is considerably higher than the rate for Registration London, which for 1899 was 19.8; but it compares favourably with that of our immediate neighbours in Central London, Holborn having a rate of 24.9 and St. Luke's 28.4. Last year (1898) the true death-rate of Clerkenwell was 21.5. The increase in the death-rate has been largely due to a considerable increase in the extra-parochial deaths. As many as 553 Clerkenwell persons died in various institutions outside the district, as compared with 493 in 1898. The number of intraparochial deaths occurring in Clerkenwell from all causes during 1899 was 925. Last year it was 933, and the annual average for the past 10 years is 1,025, so that the intra-parochial deaths are respectively 8 less than last year and 100 less than the average. The total is therefore composed as follows:— Intra-parochial deaths St. James 233 = 925 Amwell 433 Goswell ... 259) Extra-parochial deaths 553 Total 1,478 The 925 intra-parochial deaths, with a population of 66,202, gives a death-rate of 13.9 per 1,000 for 1899, as compared with 14.0 per 1,000 in 1898, and 14.5 per 1,000 in 1897. The following table from the Registrar-General compares the death-rates of London and Clerken well and neighbouring districts for 1899, after distribution of deaths in public institutions. I have also added the rates for one of the healthiest districts in London, namely, Hampstead, for purposes of comparison:—  ANNUAL RATE PER 1,000 PERSONS LIVING. DEATHS FROM All Causes.

These rates have been divided into two classes, those which include the intra-parochial and extra-parochial deaths, and those which only deal with the intraparochial. 11 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 Intra-Parochial and Extra-Parochial 24.3 24.0 23.0 26.0 18.0 22.0 20.5 21.9 21.5 22.3 Intra-Parochial only 17.9 17.0 18.0 17.0 12.0 14.0 13.9 14.5 14.0 13.9 INFANTILE MORTALITY. One of the most reliable tests of the public health of a community and of the sanitary condition of a district is the infantile mortality. In the first place, migration does not greatly affect the distribution of deaths at this early age. In the second place the deaths of infants afford a very delicate index as to disease and the external circumstances of life affecting it. Expressed in other words life is most susceptible to its surroundings, most liable to perish, in its earliest stages. With each week after birth the danger of death diminishes. The infantile mortality then is the annual number of deaths of children under one year of age to every thousand births during the same year. As we have seen the total births for 1899 were 2,050. The total deaths of infants under one year in 1899 were 395 out of the whole total of deaths of 1478. That is to say, that more than one fourth of all the deaths from all causes were due to the death of infants, and the infant mortality (in relation to 2,050 births) works out at 192.6. In the whole of London during 1899 there were 22,289 deaths of infants which is equal to 167 in each thousand births. So that Clerkenwell (with 192.6) is considerably above the London average. The Registrar-General points out that 167 is "higher by 10 per 1,000 than the average in the preceding ten years." It may be well to add for comparison the rates in other districts: 12 The lowest Infantile Mortalities occurred in Stoke Newington, 103; St. Giles, 112; Marylebone, 124; St. George's, Hanover Square, and Hampstead, 129. The highest occurred in St. Martin's and St. Saviour, 203 each; Shoreditch, 204; St. George the Martyr, Southwark, 205; Limehouse, 216; and Holborn, 226. From these figures it will be apparent that Clerkenwell (192.6) approximates to the higher rates rather than to the lower. The total of 395 infant deaths includes those occurring outside the parish (63) but belonging to it. The intra-parochial infant deaths during the year were 332. They were distributed as follows:— Infant Deaths. Infant Mortality Rates Goswell 92 176.9 St. James 93 198.7 Amwell 147 138.3 Clerkenwell— Intra-Parochial 332 161.9 Clerkenwell— Extra-Parochial and Intra-Parochial 395 192.6 London 22,289 167 During the last ten years the average infantile mortality in Clerkenwell has been about 180 per thousand births, and the average for London in the same period about 158. As regards time-distribution of infants' deaths, as we have remarked they diminish, generally speaking, from the first month onwards to the twelfth month. The following table gives their distribution for Clerkenwell during 1899. 13 Deaths of Infants in each Sub-District according to Age in Months. Months = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Totals.

The chief of such common causes may be named: 1. Prematurity of birth and physical defects at birth. The excessive mortality of the first month is almost entirely due to these causes, coupled with debility, feeble vitality and starvation. 2. Hereditary tendencies such as Syphilis. 3. Careless nursing, inexperience, and neglect of parents. 4. Industrial conditions, especially the industrial employment of mothers. 5. Insanitary conditions. 6. Improper Food. When improper feeding is a factor a large proportion of the deaths are due to Diarrhœa. 7. Violence, Suffocation in bed, etc. Turning now to the infantile mortality of Clerkenwell we find that taking all the infant deaths, including those at one year into consideration (intra-parochial and extra-parochial) the causes of death were as follows:— 14 Diarrhœa. Prematurity. Bronchitis. Pneumonia. Convulsions. Suffocated in Bed. Whooping Cough. Meningitis. Measles, Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Croup, Tonsilitis, Chicken Pox,&c. Accidents. Tuberculosis.

Owing to the high death-rate due to Diarrhœa which comes in the third quarter of the year that quarter contains most infant deaths. Old age, on the contrary, suffers mostly in the winter half of the year. The time of year at which the infants under one year died is shown in the following table:— January. February. March. April. May. June. July. August. September. October. November. December. Intra-Parochial 22 28 30 15 15 14 36 57 41 31 18 35 Extra-Parochial 4 8 13 8 7 5 12 11 9 3 8 8 105 64 166 103 Prematurity is a cause of infant mortality, which is nearly twice as high in towns as in rural districts. Convulsions is really more of a sympton than a disease, and is a condition brought about by the irritation of dentition, improper food, parasites, etc. Twentythree deaths were caused by suffocation in bed due to overlaying by parents. Eighteen of these 23 deaths occurred on Saturday, Sunday, or Monday nights. Dr. J. S. Tew has recently declared "that the better housing of the poorer classes will be the chief means in the future of checking 15 the present high mortality among young children, particularly from those diseases which are usually treated at home, namely, Measles, Whooping-Cough, and Diarrhœa. That the fatality of each of these diseases among children under 5 years of age named under these conditions is out of all proportion to the gravity of the disease is evident from the rarity of fatal issue in hospitals or among the upper classes. When, however, one considers the insanitary surroundings, the vitiated atmosphere, the damp, the smoke, the draughts, and the impossibility of anything like decent living, to say nothing of nursing, in such places, it is even surprising that the mortality is not higher." SENILE MORTALITY. Of these 260, 90 were between 65—70 years of age. 124 „ „ 70-80 „ 43 „ „ 80-90 „ 3 „ „ 90-100 „ As we have already remarked, death claims infants mostly in the summer and the aged mostly in the winter. For example, in the third quarter (i.e., July-September), there were 166 infant deaths, but only 46 deaths of persons above 65. The figures may be compared thus:— Jan.-March. April-June. July-Sept. Oct.-Dec. Total. Infants at and under 1 year 105 64 166 103 438 Persons over 65 years 80 59 46 75 260 The deaths of persons over 65 years of age were as follows:— Goswell 49 = Intra-Parochial = Males 63 = 149 St. James. 33 Females 86 Am well 67 Extra-Parochial= Males 44 = 111 Females 67 Total 260 16 The causes of death amongst aged persons will naturally be those attributable to strain and exhaustion. Senility, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Apoplexy are common causes. Bronchitis, however, claimed the largest number of the 260 deaths above recorded. To this disease is attributable a large number of deaths at both extremes of life, infancy and old age. From a public health point of view the deaths of persons over 65 years has not the same significance as the infantile mortality. CAUSES OF HIGH DEATH-RATE IN CLERKENWELL. As we have seen the death-rate in this district does not compare favourably with the average London death-rate. Out of the 43 Sanitary Areas of London reported by the Registrar-General there are only 12 Districts having a higher death-rate than that of Clerkenwell. Our general position in comparison with London is set forth in the following Table:— Year. Clerkenwell. London. Births. Deaths from all causes. Zymotic Deaths. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 Births.

At the outset there are two points calling for comment. First, there is no doubt that from the peculiar fact that Clerken well contains no public hospitals, asylums, and institutions of that nature, 17 there are large numbers of our population (and those at the most unfavourable age-periods) who are absent at the Census enumeration lodged in various workhouses, hospitals, etc., outside the Parish. From this it follows that the population of Clerkenwell is not credited with these numbers, while the deaths from that class which this year reach the number of 553 are of course recorded against us. It is clear that if we added on all persons in all such institutions to our population, our population would be considerably increased, though the number of deaths returned would be precisely the same as at present. The result would be that our total death-rate would be lower. The second point is this. If we take the total Clerkenwell death rate and the intra-parochial death-rate and compare each with similiar rates over a number of years we find that there has been a very decided, though gradual, decline. Thus:— Total Clerkenwe Death Rate. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 Intra Parochial and Extra Parochial. 24.3 24.0 28.0 26.0 18.0 22.0 20.5 21.9 21.5 22.3 Intra Parochial only. 17.9 17.0 18.0 17.0 12.0 14.0 13.9 14.5 14.0 13.9 But after taking these two circumstances fully into consideration it must still be admitted that our death-rate is considerably above the London average. About 200 more deaths occurred in Clerkenwell than would have taken place had our death-rate been the average for London. The cause for this high death-rate is probably a composite one, including many external circumstances and agencies. It is due, that is to say, rather to a set of conditions than to one condition. Therefore to reduce such a death-rate requires not one remedy but many. The Report on the Sanitary Condition of Clerkenwell issued by the London County Council in 1897, set forth a number of matters calling for attention or amendment. Briefly, these may be B 18 said to indicate in a general way the conditions of the district which bring about its high death-rate and infant mortality. (a) Houses in Defective Conditions; (b) Narrow and badly arranged Courts and Alleys; (c) Houses let in Lodgings and Tenement Houses; (d) Workshops; (e) Removal of Refuse; (f) Overcrowding. Now whilst it is true that these are problems to be found elsewhere in London, it is also true that they have become more acute in the central districts like Clerkenwell, Holborn, Strand, or St. Luke than elsewhere. The average death-rate in Central London is 23.0, as compared with 18.0 in West London or 17.8 in North London (which includes Hampstead). There can be no doubt that the bulk of this difference in deathrate is due to the very different circumstances affecting Central London districts and outside districts. For example, in Clerkenwell (excluding the Muswell Hill portion) there are 209 persons to the acre, as compared with 61 persons to the acre in London as a whole; and as Dr. Young pointed out we have as many as 11.2 persons to each inhabited house as compared with 7.7 in London; 17.6 per cent. of the population live in single rooms and 32.1 per cent. in two rooms. So that, speaking generally, half of our population live in tenements of two rooms at the most. Further, in addition to this dense population, there are structural conditions appertaining in the district which are far from satisfactory. Old self-contained houses have become tenement houses though they were not built to be such. Narrow streets and courts still exist, even though there have been many improvements within recent years. Lastly, the population consists most largely of the working classes, small workshops abound, and there are a large number of out-workers employed. Now in such a population it is a difficult task not only to maintain an average standard of health but to prevent the spread of disease when once it arises. For example, isolation to hospital and the many requirements of the sick are not readily secured. These are conditions which tend to favour disease and predispose to infection. They are in all probability the circumstances chiefly responsible for our comparatively high death-rate. 19 It is hardly necessary to add that the amelioration of such conditions is the work of time. Death-rates due to such circumstances cannot be reduced in twelve months, for their reduction depends upon many agencies and upon an all-round high standard of sanitation and public health. But to reduce the deathrate to the average of that of London, is, I think, a reasonable and obligatory task, though not an easy one, nor one which can be accomplished in a short period of time. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The principal Zymotic Diseases are seven in number, viz: Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fevers (including typhus, typhoid or enteric, and simple or continued) and Diarrhoea. In Clerkenwell during 1899 there were 692 notifications received under the Notification Clauses of the Public Health (London) Act 1891 (Metropolitan Asylums Board Returns), as follows:—* First Quarter.

They were as follows: Measles, 7; Scarlet Fever, 11; Diphtheria, 19; Whooping Cough, 1; Enteric Fever, 19; Diarrhoea, 14; Total, 71; making in all 251 deaths, and therefore giving a zymotic death-rate of 3.79. This number is somewhat higher than that credited to us by the RegistrarGeneral, viz.: 3.04. The difference is caused by the inclusion of deaths from gastro-enteritis under the head of Diarrhoea in our returns. These two conditions, though registered under a different name, are undoubtedly identical diseases. Hence they have been classified together. The amount paid to medical practitioners for furnishing Notification Certificates amounted to £72 16s. 0d., as compared with £73 5s. 0d. in 1898. The Vestry is recouped for this expenditure by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Smallpox.—It is satisfactory to report that there have been no cases of smallpox recorded in this district. The continuance of freedom from an outbreak of this disease depends mainly upon the following three factors:— 1. The amount of Smallpox in other districts of London. (Only three deaths occurred in London during 1899.) 21 2. The prompt recognition of any imported cases of Smallpox and their early isolation to hospital. 3. The state of vaccination of the community. Measles*—Including both intra parochial and extra parochial returns, there were 36 deaths due to Measles, giving a death rate of °.54 Per 1.000, compared with 0.47 per 1,000 in London as a whole. The Measles death rate last year in Clerkenwell was 0.93, which was due to several epidemics in the Parish. The London death rate for 1898 was o.68. The diminished mortality from this disease is accounted for by the fact that the usual biennial epidemic which reached its height in 1898 gradually died out after the end of March. Nevertheless, it is a serious fact that in London during 1899 there were 2,142 deaths due to measles, 36 of these belonging to Clerkenwell. Possibly the time is near to hand for making an effort to educate the public as to the comparatively grave nature of measles and the urgent necessity of taking precautions to prevent its spread. Measles and Whooping Cough—both of which are looked upon generally as slight ailments—caused more deaths in Clerkenwell during 1899 than Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever and Scarlet Fever all put together. Whooping-Cough.—Like measles, this is not a notifiable disease, and we can only gauge its prevalent severity by its death rate. Whooping Cough caused 28 deaths during the year, all of which occurred in the district. The death-rate was therefore 0.42 per 1,000 as compared with 0.51 per 1,000 in 1898. The rate for London in 1899 was 0.38 per 1,000. The average for London during the last ten years has been 0.54 per 1,000. Whooping Cough, like measles, is a disease that is apt to be spread by means of schools, especially infants' classes. Scarlet Fever.—There were no deaths caused in the district from Scarlet Fever, owing largely of course to isolation to hospital. Eleven deaths occurred amongst those going to hospital; 322 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year. Our Scarlet Fever death rate is therefore 0.16per 1,000, as compared with 0.19 in 1898 and as compared with o.o9 per 1,000 for London. 22 Scarlet Fever has become in recent years a much milder complaint. Like measles, it falls most heavily on children under five years of age, which points to the importance of protecting such children from exposure to infection. Dr. Newsholme states that "chief among such means of infection is the attendance of children in the infants' class at school long before the age at which compulsory school attendance begins." As far as could be traced no scarlet fever milk outbreak occurred in the District during 1899, and no school had to be closed on account of scarlet fever. Diarrhoea.—Under this term is included all forms of Diarrhcea, and also gastro-enteritis, for the reason that they are not separable and probably are due to the same cause.* In all 126 deaths were attributed to Diarrhoea during 1899, 108 of these were infants under one year of age. This gives a death-rate for Diarrhoea of 1.9 per 1,000, which is less than the year before, when it was 2.02 per 1,000. The rate for the whole of London was o.93 per 1,000. So that it will be seen that Clerkenwell is considerably above the average. The exact cause of Epidemic Diarrhoea is not at present known. In a report to the Local Government Board in 1888 Dr. Ballard attributed the disease to one or more of the following conditions:— 1. Soil and Climatic Conditions.—When the four-foot earth thermometer reaches 56° F., the summer rise of epidemic diarrhoea commences. Atmospheric temperature and rainfall exert an indirect influence as they affect the temperature of the soil. A loose permeable soil, habitually damp, and polluted with organic matter and other refuse, due to "made soils," town refuse or sewage leakage, is particularly favourable to epidemic diarrhoea. Possibly such soil contains the ferment or microbes causing the disease. *The Royal College of Physicians has recently (1900) laid down that "gastro enteritis," "muco enteritis," "gastric catarrah," and such synonyms of epidemic diarrhoea in medical certificates of death should be discarded. The College of Physicians authorize the use of the terms "Epidemic Enteritis" or "Zymotic Enteritis" or "Epidemic Diarrhoea," to represent the condition. There can be no doubt that some such standard will prove of great value in the future.

Density of Population and Buildings.—Aggregation favours, dispersion over a wide area disfavours, the disease. 3. Insanitary Conditions.—Darkness, dirt and defective tion of a dwelling favours the disease. Accumulation of domestic refuse in ash-pits, dust-bins, or on the street may also exert a like injurious influence. 4. Food.—The storage of food,, particularly milk, in improper places, exposed to emanations from filth acts prejudicially. Disease-producing organisms are thereby greatly increased in the milk which also undergoes organic changes, giving to the milk poisonous and irritating properties. 5. Maternal Neglect, etc.—Infants brought up by hand or bottle suffer most heavily from fatal diarrhcea. There is a concensus of opinion that of all these conditions, limate and food exert a very powerful effect on epidemic diarrhoea. The vast majority of deaths from this cause occur in the third quarter of the year. In this district 87 out of the 126 deaths occurred n August and September. Now it happens that the salient features pf the Meteorology of 1899 were two, namely, the excessively high temperature in the five months from July to November inclusive, and the deficient rainfall. These two conditions as we have seen are those usually associated with a high diarrhoeal mortality. The cfour-foot earth thermometer registered 56° F. in the middle of June, rising to 65° F. in August and sinking to 56° F. again early in October. As regards food, it is observable that the disease affects children at an age when milk is the principal food, and it is almost confined to children fed by hand. Such milk must become polluted at the farm, during transit, in the milk-shop, or in the house of the consumer. There is a good deal of evidence to show that the last place is the source of much pollution, both in the stored milk and in unclean vessels and feeding-bottles. One must not, however, lose sight of the sanitary improvements, such as removal of refuse and street cleansing, which undoubtedly assist in diminishing the disease. 24 Dr. Newsholme of Brighton, has recently (Dec., 1899) published an interesting paper on the causation of epidemic diarrhoea. Some of his chief conclusions may be added:— 1. Epidemic Diarrhoea is chiefly a disease of urban life. 2. Epidemic Diarrhoea as a fatal disease, is a disease cf the artisan and still more of the lower labouring classes to a preponderant extent. 3. Towns having the water-carriage-system of sewage have as a rule much less diarrhoea than those retaining other methods of removal of excrement. 4. Towns with the most perfect scavenging arrangements have the least epidemic diarrhoea. 5. The influence of the soil is a decided one. Where the dwelling houses of a place have as their foundation solid rock with little or no superincumbent loose material, the diarrhoeal mortality is, notwithstanding many other unfavourable conditions and surroundings, low. On the other hand a loose soil is a soil in which diarrhoeal mortality is apt to be high. 6. Given two towns equally placed, so far as social and sanitary conditions are concerned, their relative diarrhoeal mortality is proportional to the height of the temperature and the deficiency of rainfall of each town, particularly the temperature and rainfall of the third quarter of the year. Dr. Newsholme concludes that "the fundamental condition favouring epidemic diarrhoea is an unclean soil, the particulate poison from which infests the air and is swallowed, most commonly with food, especially milk." In other words epidemic diarrhoea is a so-called "filth-disease" preventable by improved sanitation in the broadest meaning of the term. Enteric Fever.—There were 92 cases of Typhoid or Enteric Fever notified in the district out of which there were four deaths Showing the Rise and Fall of TYPHOID FEVER each week during 1899. 24 the broadest meaning of the term. Enteric Fever.—There were 92 cases of Typhoid or Enteric Fever notified in the district out of which there were four deaths 25 in the district, and 19 deaths occurred among the cases removed for treatment, giving a total of 23 deaths and a death-rate of 0.34 per 1,000. For London as a whole the Typhoid death-rate was 0.18. The Clerkenwell rate of 0.34 was one of the highest in London.

A summary of the chief means by which the causal agent, the Bacillus of Typhoid Fever is disseminated may be of service, inasmuch as Enteric Fever is generally recognised as one of the best examples of preventable disease. 1. Inhalation of Infected Sewer Air.—As a matter of fact, although sewer air, by its weakening effect, may predispose to Enteric Fever, it cannot alone, in all probability, actually convey the disease itself. 2. Drinking Infected Water.—This is the commonest of all channels in Enteric Fever. Some 200 different outbreaks hs.ve been traced in this country to water-borne infection, including epidemics at Worthing, Maidstone, Lynn, etc. 3. Infected Food. -The chief foods carrying the infection of Enteric Fever are milk, shell-fish (infected oysters in 26 particular, fattened on contaminated oyster-beds), ice cream, watercresses, lemonade, etc. Special precautions are now being taken with regard to milk-borne diseases and oysters. 4. Direct Infection.—From person to person, or from soiled linen, etc., of a typhoid patient, or want of cleanliness in nursing a typhoid patient. 5. Pollution of Soil.—From a number of investigations it appears that the Bacillus of Typhoid Fever can live in the soil and possibly multiply there. In Clerkenwell for various reasons this agency can have very little scope It is difficult to say which of these five channels of infection is most largely responsible for our high notification rate and death rate for enteric fever. Inhalation of infected sewer air and pollution of soil may, for various good reasons, be set on one side as concerns Clerkenwell. Probably also infection through the water supply may be considered as extremely unlikely, if not impossible. It is well known that the London water supply is of a high degree of purity. The Thames water unfiltered contains about 1,5002,000 microbes per cubic centimetre (i.e., about 20 drops) whilst the New River water as delivered contains 8-10 microbes in 20 drops. The usual standard of purity accepted by bacteriologists and water analysts is anything under 100 microbes per twenty drops. So that the drinking water of the parish may be looked upon as of very pure quality as regards bacteria. -Probably not one of the 92 recorded cases of Typhoid Fever was derived from our water supply. There is of course the further argument that if the water supply was the cause of our high typhoid rate, we should expect the disease to be more wide-spread. For the water supply is common to the entire population. From the distribution of the cases we must look for a cause which is not common to the whole parish and which is not continually operating. It is not unlikely that the cause of most of the cases in Clerkenwell was either direct infection from a previous case or infective food. It is difficult in a crowded population to 27 prevent infection from person to person, and such contact may be responsible for many cases Again, food in such a district as Clerkenwell is supervised only with difficulty, and milk, ice-cream, cockles, oysters and other shell-fish (which have been fattened on sewage-contaminated beds, etc.) may act as the vehicle of typhoid fever. The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth (Dr. Priestley) says in his Annual Report for 1899:— "Personal contact, as a factor in the spread of Typhoid, is "not sufficiently admitted, and the three special outbreaks "investigated in connection with Lambeth—fortunately, "small outbreaks, on account of the severe and prompt "measures taken—will rank as important evidence in "shewing that the disease is apt to spread from person to "person oftener than is generally supposed—the faeces "and urine of patients being sources of infection, well"proved by bacteriological methods. The natural "corollary to the above statement is the importance of "strict isolation of all cases (preferably in hospital), "whilst the absolute necessity of diagnosing the disease "as early as possible must come to be more and more "realised. Bacteriological examination of the blood of "suspected persons is a ready means at hand for assisting "medical practitioners in their diagnosis of doubtful " Typhoid cases." Diphtheria,—Diphtheria caused during the year eight deaths in the district and 19 among the cases removed for treatment making a total of 27, which yields a death-rate of 0.40. The London death-rate for Diphtheria during 1899 was equal to 0.43, the average of the last ten years being 0.49. It will be remembered that in 1897 the Clerkenwell Diphtheria death-rate was 0.73 which was the second highest rate in all the metropolitan sanitary areas (Woolwich being o.8o). In 1898 our rate fell to 0.55 which brought us into a more respectable position. We were then ninth on the list of 43 districts. The rate 0.40 in 1899 is the lowest 28 Diphtheria rate in this district since 1890, and it places us eighteenth on the list of the London districts as regards Diphtheria. The following are the death rates from Diphtheria in Clerkenwell during the last ten years:— Years. 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. Death rates due to Diphtheria 0-28 0 42 0 42 115 0 51 0 51 0 62 0 73 054 0 40 This satisfactory result has probably been due in part to the general decline in Diphtheria throughout the London area, and in part to the arrangements which were made and carried out by the late Dr. Glaister:— 1. Doubtful and mild cases of Diphtheritic sore throat — which were quite as infectious as severe Diphtheria—were examined bacteriologically by the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine at Chelsea. By this means mild cases were detected and isolated. Thus, one of the most subtle means of spreading the disease was averted. 2. Steam disinfection of the bedding, clothing, etc., in every case of notifiable disease (except Erysipelas) was for the first time established in this district. Whilst our own steam disinfector was in course of construction, arrangements were made with the Parish of St. Luke to do the necessary work. 3. Recognizing that Clerkenwell was peculiar in having a large number of houses ill-adapted for home nursing of Diphtheria, special efforts were made to have cases removed for treatment. The number of cases treated at home in unsuitable houses was thus considerably diminished. In 1897 Dr. Glaister wrote: "It may be confidently anticipated that their [these arrangements] effect will be evident in future years." The effect is now apparent in the lowest Diphtheria deathrate since 1890. We can only trust it will continue. As is now generally recognised Diphtheria is spread most largely by personal contact particularly among children. It is one of the most difficult diseases to control, as it is caused by a germ, the life history of which we do not fully know. The germ exists of course Showing the Rise and Fall of DIPHTHERIA each week during 1899. 29 in large numbers in the throat and mouth of the patient. Thus diphtheritic children licking slates or exchanging sweets from mouth to mouth are far more likely to spread the disease than a defective drain. The difficulty of controlling such a disease is further enhanced by the fact that the germ may remain dormant but infective for many weeks in the throat of an apparently healthy person, or a person suffering from an ordinary sore-throat. Children may thus return to school, etc., apparently recovered from an attack of Diphtheria and yet be infectious to others. The age and sex incidence and seasonal occurrence of Diphtheria in 1899 is shown in the following figures:— Ages in Years. No. of Notified Cases. 0-1 ,2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-10 10-20 20-60 60- 6 10 11 •1 18 20 72 29 27 nil In two cases notified the age of the patient was not given. Oi the total of 195 cases of Diphtheria 87 occurred in males and 108 in females. The following table shows the seasonal occurrence of the cases of Diphtheria notified to us :— Months - Jan. Feb. Mar. Apl. May. J une. July. Aug. Sept. Oct. No\. Dec. No. of Cases - 11 12 10 17 21 19 23 21 18 17 15 11 Totals - 33 57 62 43 Phthisis.-The total deaths due to Consumption or Phthisis were 163 giving a death-rate of 2*46 per 1,000. 1 he London rate was 1*82. There are some ten metropolitan districts which had a Phthisis death-rate higher than that of Clerkenwell, among them being Holborn (3-08), and St. Luke's (3-53). Notwithstanding this fact there can be no doubt that a very large number of cases of this disease occurring in this parish ought to be prevented. Phthisis and other lung diseases allied to it cause a number of deaths out of all proportion to other diseases, which though more feared by the public really have a much less fatal effect. I hese differences of death-rate in Clerkenwell are set forth in the tollowing graphic form :— 30 Diagram to illustrate the Death-rates per Thousand in Clerkenwell during 1899 from the Chief Zymotic Diseases, as compared with (1) Pulmonary Diseases (not Phthisis) and (2) Phthisis. 31 The returns of the Registrar-General show that nearly 60,000 deaths are every year registered as due to Tuberculosis in England and Wales alone. Probably in a large number of other deaths tubercle played an unrecognised part. Of these 60,000 deaths 40,000 are due to Consumption or Phthisis (Tuberculosis of the lungs), and the other 20,000 are due to Tuberculosis of the intestines, brain, bones, etc. Recent knowledge and experience of Tuberculosis goes to show that the disease is an infectious one, and in a very large measure preventable. The late Medical Officer of Health evidently intended to attack this problem, and arrangements have now been made by the Public Health Committee for a special report at an early date on the whole subject, advising as to the means which can be taken to lessen the disease in this district. Hence it is not necessary to make any further comment here. COW HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There were during 1899 five cow houses and five slaughter houses in the parish of Clerkenwell, namely, at:— Cow Houses. Slaughter Houses. 4, Sermon Lane. 14, Penton Street. 27, Whiskin Street. 20, Amwell Street. 40, Rawstorne Street. i91, Goswell Road. 30, Great Sutton Street. 138, St. John Street. 230, St. John Street. 161, St. John Street. The above cowhouses and slaughter houses have been inspected during the year and found in a generally satisfactory condition. BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses have also been inspected during the year and the necessary annual white-washing and cleansing has been carried 82 out. The late Dr. Glaister made a considerable effort to establish throughout the district a higher standard of cleanliness. Decided improvement has taken place as a result. DISINFECTION. After cases of infectious disease disinfection has been invariably carried out by fumigation by means of burning sulphur. Where necessary the walls are stripped in order that the householder should repaper or limewash. No charge is made for disinfection unless the householder desires it to be done when the officers are not on duty. In such cases a small fee would be charged. Articles of clothing, bedding, etc., are disinfected in the steam disinfecting apparatus (Goddard, Massey and Warner) which has given satisfaction. The disinfector is situated in a building containing two rooms into each of which the apparatus has an opening, so that infected articles are put into it in one chamber and removed from the other. Disinfection by this means is absolutely efficient and occupies about one hour. The following is the record of work done for Clerkenwell (not including the work done for the Holborn Board of works) during 1899:— and occupies about one hour.

The actual cases of infectious 33 disease for which steam disinfection has been done during 1899 are set forth below:— Scarlet Fever. Enteric Fever. Puerperal Fever. Diphtheria. Croup. Disinfections at request of occupier for non-infectious diseases. Totals.

There seems now to be a good deal of substantial evidence in favour of fumigation by means of Formic Aldehyde (Formalin), and it may become desirable in this district to introduce this impr???cd method at an early date. Formalin appears to act more efficaciously than sulphur and takes less time. HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION. During 1897 arrangements were made for the establishment of a register of every house in the Parish, and house to house inspecions were carried out for this purpose by the inspectors. In this register records are kept concerning the owner, the mode of occupation, the cubic space in feet per room, the sanitary notices c 84 w cn have been served, the infectious diseases, and the condition of the drains. During 1899, 845 houses have thus been inspected. Out of the total number of houses in the Parish (approximately 6,000) this number of inspections appears to be, and is in point of fact, inadequate. But taking into account the small number of inspectors for the whole district this work is really more than could ave been reasonably expected. It has been carried out under considerable pressure of routine work throughout the year. THE MORTUARY AND SHELTER. The total number of bodies received at the Mortuary in Northampton Road during 1899 was 218 as compared with 217 in 1898. Eleven bodies were brought in by the police and the remainder by undertakers and private persons. Out of the 218 cases there were 168 private burials and 50 Holborn Guardian cases. These 218 cases may be divided as follows:— 1899. 1898. Inquest cases 158 168 Infectious cases 15 8 Bodies deposited by Vestry orders 12 10 Bodies brought for convenience of relatives, etc. 33 31 218 217 Of the 158 inquests post-mortem examinations were necessary in 62 cases. The infectious cases included 1 of measles, 5 of enteric fever, 2 of scarlet fever, and 7 of diphtheria. The Shelter, 47, Northampton Road, contains six rooms furnished for the use of persons temporarily displaced for disinfection purposes. The Shelter is in charge of a caretaker who lives in the next house. During 1899 the Shelter was used 24 times as against 21 in 1898. Probably its situation in proximity to the mortuary militates against a larger measure of use. The Holborn Board of Works use it in common with the Vestry. 85 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The new bye-laws as to houses let in lodgings which changed the minimum permissible cubic space from 350 cubic feet per head to 400 cubic feet in rooms day and night, were enforced during the year. At the beginning of the year 1900 there were 169 houses on the register. During 1899 the number of houses placed for the first time on the register was 40. The summonses which were issued to owners of registered houses for not complying with the bye-laws numbered 17. Steady but continued progress should be made with the work of placing suitable houses on this register as it is one of the most satisfactory and reliable ways of maintaining a good standard of sanitation in such houses. All over the district the question of overcrowding has not been lost sight of. A common standard of 400 cubic feet per head (two children under 12 counting as one adult) has been adopted. Reform in a matter like overcrowding is, and must be, slow and delicate work. The lack of accommodation for the displaced is, of course, the chief difficulty. WORKSHOPS. In 1897 after the London County Council inspection, carried out by Dr. Young, a register was established containing a complete list of the workshops in the district. The facts which this register contain refer to the address, name of occupier, trade or business, position, cubic space, number of gas burners, number of occupants allowed in each workshop, and the details of ventilation and sanitary convenience. During the year 91 workshops were inspected and placed upon this register. The total number on the register at the end of 1899 was 220. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, The chief work under this Act in 1899 was in connection with the insanitary area known as the Aylesbury Place Scheme. 1 he c 2 36 preliminary representation under Part I. of the Act was made by Dr. Glaister in 1898. The representation was considered by the London County Council who advised a scheme under Part II. During the year the late Dr. Glaister, assisted by Inspector Green, collected the necessary evidence concerning the area. Although this is not a matter for lengthy comment here, the collection and arrangement of such evidence involved a very considerable amount of work.* Briefly, the area included in the scheme was 4,915 square yards, of which 3,817 square yards were covered by buildings, the remaining 1,098 being footways, etc. The total number of houses was 73. The population was 511. The average mortality during the last five years had been 36.4 per 1,000, whereas the whole parish mortality was 2105 and that for London 20.5. The average infantile mortality for the last five years was 447 as compared with 168 in the parish. The number of notifications was 14.4 per 1,000 compared with 11.2 per 1,000 in the parish generally. The density of population was found to be 503.0 per acre in the condemned area. During the year further consideration was given to Nos. 1-7, Bolton Court, and the Medical Officer was instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain a closing order under Section 32, subsection 2, and then a demolition order. FOOD AND DRUGS. There have been 36 summonses under the Food and Drugs Act during 1899 as compared with 38 in 1898. During the year the Vestry had under its consideration certain amendments of the Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and the question of the conveyance of Tuberculosis by means of milk. * Owing to the unfortunate illness and death of Dr. Glaister the Vestry appointed Dr. Evan Jones, the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, to act as their Medical Officer for the purposes of this scheme, and in March, 1900, he gave evidence at the Special Enquiry held at the Holborn Town Hall. 37 The Vestry co-operated with the Vestry of Battersea in forwarding certain objections to the Local Government Board concerning the Sale of Food and Drugs Bill then before Parliament. These objections related chiefly to the addition of preservatives in butter and milk, and to the administration of the Act being in the hands of the Chemical Department of Somerset House. The Vestry advocated a Court of Reference for such matters as suggested by a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1896. The Bill was made law and came into operation on January 1, 1900. A special report upon the Act was furnished by Mr. J. Kear Colwell, the Public Analyst on January 1, 1900, and a circular calling attention to the provisions of the Act, was sent to tradesmen and others in the Parish who will be affected by it. In view of the danger to the public health by the spread of tuberculosis by means of milk and cream, especially in the case of young children, invalids and others depending largely upon a milk diet, the Vestry joined in 1899 with the Vestries of Westminster, Chelsea and Hackney in commending the subject to the serious consideration of the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture. The Vestry urged upon the Boards that legislation should be promoted for preventing the sale of such tuberculous milk and for the regulation of dairies—cleanliness, ventilation, good order, and inspection of cows. The Vestry also unite with the Medical Officer of the London County Council in the view that articles directly derived from milk, such as ice-cream, Polish cheese, etc., should be placed upon the same footing in all respects as milk. There is very little doubt that though in the manufacture of ice cream, for example, the substance is boiled and therefore sterilized, that contamination readily occurs owing to storage in crowded living and sleeping rooms. 38 THE SANITARY INSPECTORS' REPORTS. For convenience of Sanitary inspection the parish is divided into 3 districts. The Sanitary Inspectors during 1899 were the late Inspector Bartlett (No. 1 District), Inspector Ensor (No. 2 District), Inspector Green (No. 3 District), and I append their reports which shew a very large amount of accomplished work.

The Vestry at that time re-organised the work of the Department and appointed a clerk (Mr. H. O. Harris). In October, 1899, owing to his resignation Mr. A. J. Johnston was appointed to the post. During the year the Public Health Committee considered the advisability of appointing a fourth inspector; but in view of the alterations likely to occur in the district when the new Borough was formed, this was not done. 41 TABLE OF DEATHS during the Year 1899, in the Clerkenwell Metropolitan District, classified according to Diseases, Ages and Localities.

Gentlemen, This Report covers the Library's first complete year of work under the Library Committee of the Vestry, and extends from April ist, 1899, to March 31st, 1900. The year has been one of much activity in the direction of extending and improving the equipment of the Library, while the regular work in all departments has been steady and satisfactory. Stock.—1,732 volumes were added during the year, of which 238 were placed in the Reference, 1,132 in the Lending and Juvenile departments, and 362 in the Pentonville Branch. There are now 5,608 volumes in the Reference, and 14,504 volumes in the Lending Library. They are classified as follows :— Science and Art ... ... ... ... 3>335 Social Science and Theology ^674 History, Travel, Biography 4.539 Language and Literature ... ... 545 Poetry and Drama ... ... ... 778 Prose Fiction and Juvenile ... ... 6,805 Miscellaneous ... ... ... ... 2,312 Total Stock ... 19,988 353 volumes were purchased to replace worn-out copies, and 22 volumes found in infected houses by the Medical Officer of Health were destroyed. Book Issues and Readers.—The total number of volumes issued was 110,205? of which 11,175 were for Reference, 98,316 for home reading, and 714 were issued on Sundays. These were classified as follows :— Science and Art ... ... ••• ••• 10,816 Social Science and Theology ... ... 2,408 History, Travel, Biography 9>372 Language and Literature ... ••• 1,102 Poetry and Drama 1,018 Prose Fiction and Juvenile ... ... 79>377 Miscellaneous 6,112 Total issues 110,205 6 The daily average issue, excluding Sunday and Juvenile figures, was 360, as against 382 volumes in 1898-99. There are 3,768 Adult Borrowers, of whom 407 hold Student's tickets, by which an additional non-fictional work may be obtained for home reading. The number of Juvenile tickets in force at March 31st, 1900, was 2,168, excluding 276 tickets available for the Lending Library. Juvenile Room.—The total issues from this department numbered 10,691 volumes, exclusive of the books placed on open shelves for use in the Reading Room. Although the attendance has fallen off considerably since the room was first opened, there is no doubt that it is greatly appreciated by the more studious boys and girls of the district. The Juvenile Room was closed on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the months of June to September inclusive. Sundays.—The Reference Reading Room remained open on Sundays from 3 to 9 p.m. during the year, save from June to September inclusive of 1899, when diminished attendances led to its being closed. The total attendance for the eight months was 4,168, a daily average of 122, while the number of books issued for reading on the premises was 714, a daily average of 21, as against an average of 129, and 29 respectively in 1898-99. Reading Rooms.—The number of visits to the Newsroom was about the same as in former years, namely a total of 547,690, or a daily average of 1,430. During acute stages of the South African War the newspaper stands have been greatly crowded, and it is evident that the newsroom during the past six months has been a centre for the distribution of news which could not have been provided by any other means. The Reference Reading Room has maintained its popularity, and it is estimated that the total number of visits during the year exceeded 140,000. Various improvements in the arrangement of this department are being effected, among them being: Open Reference Shelves.—The main Reading Room will be divided across its length by means of a large book-case, which will form a partition between departments devoted to open shelves of reference books, and a magazine reading room. 7 It is proposed to place on the open shelves a large selection of about 1,000 standard reference books on every branch of knowledge, to which students and general readers shall have free access without the formality of writing out application forms or making special enquiries. The books will be classified and clearly labelled on the shelves to enable readers to find what they require without assistance, and thus it is hoped to make many valuable works of history, biography, science and art easily accessible. Books relating to the industries of Clerkenwell, Encyclopaedias, Dictionaries, Atlases, Year-books, etc., will be stored upon the open shelves, and this special enclosure will also contain the reading table for the use of Ladies, and the writing table at present in the general reading room. The entrances and exits to and from the room will be controlled by means of a wicket, and the Assistant will have full oversight of the readers. These open-shelf reference libraries are provided in a large number of libraries, like the British Museum, etc., and generally throughout the United States. Our Librarian suggested the establishment of an open reference library at Clerkenwell as the result of his visit to the United States in 1893, but it was resolved to proceed first with the Open Access Lending Department which has been successfully working for six years, and which the Committee are glad to report has been adopted as a system in many other libraries. Pentonville Branch Library.—In compliance with the instructions of the Vestry, the Library Committee reported favourably upon the establishment of an experimental Branch Library and Reading Room for the Pentonville District, and proceeded to make the necessary arrangements when their suggestions were adopted. Suitable rooms were procured in the Penton Estate Offices, at the corner of Penton and Risinghill Streets, which Captain Penton leased on favourable terms, and these have been fitted up as an Evening Reading Room and Lending Library. A good selection of magazines and periodicals has been provided, and borrowers will have the choice of about 1,000 volumes, with theadditional privilege of selecting books from the Central 8 Library catalogues, which will be delivered at the branch on the day following application, if available. The Branch has now been opened and the Committee trust the inhabitants of the district will make good use of this extension of the Library, and find it of service. Lighting and Decoration.—The improvement in lighting foreshadowed in the last report has been successfully accomplished by the installation of the electric light in every part of the Library, and the result has been highly satisfactory, all the rooms being very well lighted. A scheme for cleaning and decorating the Library is under consideration by a special sub-committee, and it is hoped to have this important and very necessary work carried out before the Library is transferred to the new Borough Council of Finsbury. Miscellaneous.—The usual Library publications have been punctually issued, and the preparation of the last portion of the Class Guide—devoted to the miscellaneous classes—is in an advanced state. The best thanks of the Committee are due for the various gifts of books, periodicals, etc., enumerated on pp. 9 to 11 of this report. On behalf of the Library Committee, ARTHUR MILLWARD, Chairman.

(Extracted from the Weekly News and Chronicle, April 28, 1900.) In response to the almost unanimous wish of the inhabitants of the district, voiced in public by their representatives, the Vestry decided some time since to establish a branch library in No. 1 Ward. Immediately on the passing of the resolution the Library Committee took steps to put it into operation. Suitable rooms were procured in the Penton Estate Offices, at the corner of Penton Street and Risinghill Street, which Captain Penton leased on favourable terms. These have been fitted as an evening reading room and lending library. The branch contains about 1,000 volumes of recent literature, a collection of reference books, together with a selection of monthly and weekly magazines. The opening ceremony was performed on Monday, April 23, by Mr. Arthur Millward (Chairman of the Public Library Committee), who was supported by Messrs. J. Crowle-Smith, A. Daldorph, J. Gibson, H. G. Barnes, H. W. Fincham, T. A. Brunjes, G. Bassett, H. Bladon, A. W. Humphreys, E. J. Penny, Hale, Randall, Bray, Skinner, Dickson, Lemming, and Mr. J. D. Brown (Librarian). Mrs. Millward, accompanied by some lady friends, was also present. The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that as the Library really belonged to the Vestry—they were the Authorities under the Free Libraries Act—he thought it only right, on behalf of the Committee of Management, to ask the Chairman if he would be good enough to perform the opening ceremony, and if he had been in London he would have been with them that evening. He had, however, just received the following telegram from Mr. Tripp, who was in the country:—" Impossible to be in London before eight o'clock ; cordially congratulate No. 1 Ward and Library Committee on their success. Hope results will justify expenditure." (Hear, hear). He had also received a telegram from Mr. Putnam, regretting that through pressure of business he was unable to be present. Continuing, the Chairman said that in declaring that Branch open, he did so in the sincere hope that it would be beneficial to the inhabitants, and prove successful in every department. It was opened in almost the same unpretentious manner as the Central Library, and it was hoped that it might grow into something handsome and substantial like the parent institution. (Applause.) The establishment of that Branch was an experiment, partly designed to test the needs of outlying parts of the parish, in view of possible extensions in the same direction in other parts of the district, and to relieve the pressure at the Central Library, which was sometimes very great. It might be necessary in the future to extend the operations of the Library by means of district reading rooms and lending libraries, and the working of that Branch would enable the Committee to pretty accurately judge the extent to which such stations are likely to be used and required. Some London parishes, like Hampstead, which are not so very much larger in actual population and house area than Clerkenwell, have gone in greatly for district libraries, and in the provinces nearly every moderately-sized town has branch libraries, reading rooms, or book delivery stations. (Hear, hear.) The effect of this distribution of books and other means of spreading knowledge, tended to extend the usefulness of the Central Library, and increase its prosperity. It also gives the largest number of ratepayers some return for their Library 18 Rate. (Applause.) Birmingham, which is not ten times the size of Clerkenwell, has, besides a very fine central library, ten branch libraries, and no one complains that there are too many. Though some of these branches are as close together as our central library and this branch, not one is found superfluous, but, on the contrary, highly successful, and if there is any outcry at all it is in favour of having more branches. Those present nearly all knew of the difficulties with which they had to contend with in the central institution. Its establishment and working was very uphill work for the Committee of Management, who had to face opposition not only in the Vestry, but in the parish generally. It was very difficult work, but they had succeeded. Unpretentious as was the beginning they were now making in Pentonville, he looked forward to it as a good thing, not alone for the inhabitants of that portion of Clerkenwell, but also for those of the slice of Islington which was to be incorporated in the Borough of Finsbury under the new Act. Some opponents of the establishment of that branch argued that there was no necessity for it, as the Central Library was sufficiently convenient that any one who required a book could, without much loss of time, fetch it. But they must remember that it was a very densely populated neighbourhood, studded over with model dwellings, mainly inhabited by the industrial classes, who toiled long and hard, and who, when they returned to their homes at night, were not inclined to further exertion. If a book was at hand, they might remain at home during the evening, but with nothing to fill their leisure and occupy their minds, the probability was that they would seek relaxation in the glare and chatter of an adjacent public-house. He himself at one time was much prejudiced against public libraries, but since he had been a member of the Committee of Management he had derived great pleasure and instruction from reading, in fact, he had found in the well-filled and carefully selected book-shelves of the Clerkenwell Library a source of enjoyment that he had never in his life experienced before. This conclusively, to his mind, proved that if they expected improvement in the habits of the people they must offer them some counter attractions to those which many now too frequently indulged in in their spare moments. They must, therefore, rejoice that they were able to place this establishment in that district, where it was very much required by the people. Referring again to the extension of district libraries in Birmingham, he said that that town was the most forward in the United Kingdom in everything that an Englishman was proud of. [A voice : Except in politics. (Laughter.)] He was not there in a political capacity, so he would not discuss the point. If by their patronage of the Institution the people of the district showed that they appreciated the efforts of the committee, they would not alone increase the accommodation, but would try at some future date to establish a fully equipped library in their midst. The Chairman concluded by formally declaring the establishment open. Mr. Crowle-Smith begged to propose that a hearty vote of thanks be given to their Chairman for his kindness in declaring the branch open, and for his hospitality. (Hear, hear.) He might say that the action of the Library Committee was due directly to the mandate they had received from the electors of No. 1 Ward. It was a significant fact., and one that should not be overlooked, that the body of gentlemen who were returned from that ward to the Vestry, while some of them differed diametrically in politics, were unanimous—speaking for the residents—that that Branch Library should' be opened, and it was in response to that wish that these rooms were now ready for use. (Applause.) He need not tell those that knew him that he was an 19 thusiastic supporter of the development of libraries, and one of the things that they wanted in Clerkenwell was a further extension of the benefits of the parent institution. He was not afraid to make this statement publicly, although he was cognizant that it would bring criticism on his shoulders. The Bishop of London recently stated that the growth of education had decreased the criminal returns of the country by something like 40 per cent. If this was so, they, the public men of Clerkenwell, should give every opportunity they possibly could to the outlying districts of the parish to participate in the benefits of the free library movement. (Hear, hear.) They had had opposition in the past, and no doubt but that their schemes would be opposed again, but if the residents of the parish supported the development hinted at by the Chairman, they should go ahead, especially when the new Council was established, and rooms like that in which they were now assembled would be in the near future opened in every part of the Porough of Finsbury. (Applause.) As one of the political opponents of Mr. Millward, he should like to say that he much appreciated the courtesy, kindness, and genial manner in which he sits on the Library Committee. Mr. Randall, in seconding the vote of thanks, said that he was sure the Branch would be so extensively used by the inhabitants of Pentonville district that it would have to be enlarged. Mr. Daldorph supported the motion. They must all be very grateful to Mr, Millward, who not only had the cares of a large business on his shoulders, but was continually aiding one good cause or another by his vocal talents—it was only on the previous night that he had delighted an audience at the Queen's Hall by his exquisite and sympathetic rendering of a sacred song—for coming there hat day to open this Branch Library. He hoped that the experiment would be a success, and would not only justify the expenditure on it, but the trouble gone to. (Hear, hear.) The vote was carried unanimously. Mr. Hale moved a vote of thanks to Captain Penton for his generosity in leasing the rooms to the Library Committee on such favourable terms. The gallant Captain was always ready and willing to aid the spread of intelligence. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Bladon, who seconded the motion, hoped before long a similar Branch would be opened in No. 5 Ward. The motion was carried amid applause. On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Skinner, a vote of thanks was also passed to Mr. Brown, the Librarian, for the care with which he had organised the Branch. The proceedings then terminated.
