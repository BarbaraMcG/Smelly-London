REPORT to The Board of Works for the Lewisham district TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1878, by F. EACHUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Report of the Sanitary State of the Lewisham District during the year 1878, consisting of the following tables:— In Table I. (page 6), will be found the estimated population, inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages, in the district during the year, and also during the preceding ten years. In Table II. (page 7), the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates in the public institutions. In Table III. (page 8), the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. In Table IV. (page 14), the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and proportion to population. In Table V. (page 15), the number of deaths in the 10 years 1868 to 1877, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in 1878. In Table VI. (page 16,) the Inspectors' Report of sanitary work done during the year. In Table VII. (page 17,) the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population, 1878, with the birth and death rate in the different Registrars' Sub-districts in Lewisham Parish and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." In Table VIII. (page 18), the area, census population in 2 1861 and 1871, the estimated population in 1878, and mortality in various Metropolitan Districts, and in England and Wales, &c. In Table IX. (page 19), the population, persons to an acre, births and deaths, annual birth and death rates, mean temperature and rainfall, in the year 1878, in London and twenty-two other large towns of the United Kingdom, and the Lewisham District. In Table X. (page 20,) the number of children between the ages of 3 and 13 years of age attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Parish of Lewisham, including the Hamlet of Penge, during the year ending December, 1878. Marriages. During the year ending the 31st of December, 1878, 275 marriages took place in the parish of Lewisham, of which 216 were solemnized in the several Church of England churches in the parish, 35 in Nonconformist chapels, and 24 at the Register Office. One hundred and ten marriages took place in the Ilamlet of Penge, of which 94 were solemnized in Church of England churches, 7 in Nonconformist chapels, and 9 at the Register Office. Births. The registered births in the district during the 52 weeks of the year 1878 amounted to 2,121; males 1,081, females 1,040, showing an increase of 139 births over that of the number registered during the year 1877. The birth rate to population was 33.37 per 1,000. In the United Kingdom 1,152,525 births were registered during the year 1878, equal to a birth rate of 34.0 per 1,000 persons estimated to be living in the middle of the year. In London 129,184 births were registered, the annual birth rate being 36.2 per 1,000. In England and Wales 891,418 births were registered, the annual birth rate being 359 per 1,000. The natural increase of population in the United Kingdom by excess of births over deaths was 430,360. 3 Deaths. The number of deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1878 was 1,058; of this number the deaths amongst males was 524, amongst females 534. The annual rate of mortality in the district was 16.64 per 1,000, being a higher death rate than that of the year 1877, but a lower death rate than the average of England and Wales or the Metropolitan district. The annual rate of mortality of England and Wales was 20.4. In the Metropolitan and City Police Districts, 20.7. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be observed that of the 1,058 deaths registered from all causes in the year 1878, 310, or 29.30 per cent., died under one year of age; 144, or 13.61 per cent., died between the ages of 1 and 5 years; so that 454, or 42.91 per cent. of the whole number of deaths were those of children under 5 years of age. 310 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 89 between the ages of 1 and 2 55 „ „ „ 2 ,, 5 45 „ „ „ 5 ,, 15 48 „ „ „ 15 „ 25 56 „ „ „ 25 ,, 35 75 „ „ „ 35 ,, 45 81 „ „ „ 45 „ 55 90 „ „ „ 55 „ 65 108 „ „ „ 65 „ 75 80 „ „ „ 75 „ 85 20 „ „ „ 85 „ 95 1 ,, ,, ,, 95 and upwards. Of the diseases which produced the mortality at these ages:— 207 deaths took place from zymotic diseases. 198 „ „ constitutional diseases. 456 „ „ local diseases. 169 „ „ developmental diseases. 17 „ „ violent deaths. 11 „ „ not specified. 4 Preventable Diseases. The seven principal zymotic diseases—viz., small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diptheria, whooping congh, fever, and diarrhoea, caused 156 deaths, at the rate of 2.46 per 1,000 of the population. The proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases to 1,000 deaths from all causes in the ten years —1868 to 1877—was in London 184.1, in England and Wales 168.4, and in this district 162.8. Small-pox has caused 5 deaths. The annual average for the past 10 years—1868 to 1877—having been 2.8. Measles.— The annual average mortality for the past 10 years from measles has been 16.7. This year the mortality from measles has amounted to 13. Scarlet Fever.—32 deaths have taken place from scarlet fever. The annual average for the last 10 years having been 32.2. Diphtheria.—8 deaths took place from diphtheria; the annual average for the last 10 years having been 7.3. Whooping Cough.—47 deaths took place from this cause during the year 1878; the annual average for the last 10 years having been 22.3. Fever.—10 deaths took place from this cause ; the annual average of 10 years having been 19 5. Diarrhoea.—41 deaths took place from diarrhoea ; the annual average number for the last ten years having been 36.1. Water Supply. The purity of the water supplied by the water companies is of little importance, if the cisterns for storing the water are kept in a foul state from connection between the overflow pipe and the water-closet or drain, or from neglect to place the cistern in a proper and accessible situation, so that it may be frequently inspected and frequently cleansed. The Board of Trade regulations relative to waste pipes provide that no overflow or waste pipe other than a warning pipe shall be attached to any cistern supplied with water by 5 a company, and every such overflow pipe or waste pipe existing when these regulations come into operation shall be removed. This would tend to remove the poisonous effluvia from the drain which would otherwise ascend through the pipe. Sewer Gases. Continued care is required to prevent the ingress of foul air into houses from drains. Hundreds of houses still communicate with the sewers by waste pipes, sink pipes, water-closets, soil pipes, bath pipes, basin pipes, &c.; and, although supposed to be secured by what are called traps, still admit poisonous gases, often laden with the germs of infectious diseases. A great amount of trouble has been taken to remedy these dangers in the construction of new houses in the district, but without constant care little or no attention is paid to drainage which is hidden out of sight. No house should in any way communicate with a sewer, but should have its connection so broken that any foul gas can only get vent into the open air. Cow Houses and Dairies. The cow houses and dairies have been frequently inspected. It is important that this should be done, in order that the surroundings of these useful establishments be rendered as pure and clean as practicable, and any disease amongst the cattle, or those attending upon them be removed at once. Milk is such an important article of diet amongst infants and invalids that regulations as to cow houses and dairies cannot be too stringent. The more stringent the regulations the better both as regards the proprietors and the consumers. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON. 6 TABLE I.

Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting my Tenth Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. The following table will give the quantities of material purchased during the year:— Division. Granite. Port Philip Stone. Land Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Coarse Gravel. Fine Gravel. Hard Core. Total. Lewisham, cubic Tarda 3563 5968 2017 1204 1403 994 ... 15147 Penge, ditto 854 ... 674 ... 901 ... ... 2429 Total 4417 5966 2691 1204 2304 994 ... 17576 Note.—This quantity of material includes that used upon the Greenwich Boundary Road-. Sydenham-hill, and gravel for tar-paving repairs; also the improvements which have been charged to Highways, and the material in hand on the 25th of March. On account of the heavy rainfalls during the year, the floods in the spring (succeeded by severe and lasting frosts in the winter) have made the year the worst I have had during ten years for maintaining the roads. Notwithstanding the wet season, at the present time they can be favourably compared with any roads in London. Throughout the whole of the year they have been scarcely ever dry, and I was compelled to use a larger quantity than I anticipated of Granite and Port Philip stone, in order to keep them up. Had I allowed the roads to get out of repair, the ultimate cost to the Board would have been much greater. I consider the traffic on the highways generally is increasing. Great attention has been paid to the sweeping and cleansing of the roads. About 12,300 cubic yards of sweepings, &c., were removed from the 2 roads in Lewisham Parish, and 1,200 cubic yards in Penge. These quantities do not include the material taken away by the contractors for the removal of road scrapings, dead leaves, &c.., which amount to something considerable. No doubt cleansing the roads is essential to the health of the District, particularly in autumn, when the leaves are falling, but it forms a large item in the cost of highways. I admire trees in a road, but I must say it appears to me they ought to be properly trimmed, both on the score of health, convenience of traffic, and economy of road maintenance. A great many notices were served asking residents to cut the trees in front of their houses. In most cases they were promptly attended to. Some of the tenants asked me to allow the Board's men to do the work, which I did. The rainfall from the 26th of March, 1878, to the 25th of March, 1879 (inclusive) was as follows:— No. of days on which lain fell. INCHES DEC. 4 1878.

January 2.47 21 February 3.95 10 March to 26th (inclusive) 0.49 172 32.55 During this period rain fell on 172 days. There was 9.61 inches more rain this year than in the corresponding period last year. The Greenwich Boundary Roads were maintained by the Lewisham Board at a contract price, and also the road of Sydenham Hill, the Camberwell Vestry paying half the ascertained cost. ROAD WATERING. The larger portion of the Lewisham, together with the Blackheath Roads, were watered by horses belonging to the 3 Board; the remaining portion of the Lewisham Roads being watered by men and horses supplied by Mr. Lane at a contract price of 9s. per day for horse and man. In Sydenham and Forest Hill a portion of the roads were watered by horses belonging to the Board, but the greater portion by horses and men supplied by Mr. Stimpson at 9s. per horse and man per day. The contract for watering the Lower Sydenham Roads was let to Mr. Roberts at 9s. 3d. per horse and man per day. In the Hamlet of Penge Mr. Winnitrith supplied horses and men at a contract price of 8s. 6d. per horse and man per day. At the end of this Report I attach a list of all the roads watered during the year in Blackheath, Lewisham, Sydenham, Forest Hill, and a portion of Beckenham. The roads in Beckenham were watered by horses and men employed by the Lewisham Board of Works ; the Beckenham Local Board paying the cost of the same. The road of Sydenham Hill was also watered, the Camberwell Vestry paying half the cost. LIGHTING. In Lewisham Parish at present there are 535 lamps, lighted by the Phoenix Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 5s. per lamp per annum, and 586 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 323 lamps, lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp. Thirty-five lamps were removed during the year. The whole of the lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company were carefully counted during the year. It was found that there were two more lamps than had been paid for. The matter was of course put right. The Indices of the meter lamps were regularly read during the year. The following list will give the new lamps put up during the year:— Lewisham. Avenue Road 1 Algernon Road 4 *Bromley Road 17 Brockley Road 17 4 Church Road 2 Dartmouth Road 1 Dacres Road 1 Ennersdale Road 4 Elswick and Farley Road 3 Harvard Road 3 *Morley Road 1 Higham Circus 1 Honley Road 1 *Lethbridge Road 2 *Nightingale Grove 2 *Park Road (Hither Green) 2 St. Mark's Road 1 Sydenham Hill 1 Sunderland Road 3 Sabin's Lane 1 *Slaithwaite Road 2 West Hill 2 West Road 2 Stanstead Lane 2 76 Penge. Anerley Road 3 Beckenham Road 1 Challin Street 1 Genoa Road 1 Green Lane 3 Minden Road 1 Madeline Road 1 Melvin Road 1 Malcolm Road 1 Maberley Road 1 Pawleyn Road 2 Padua Road 1 Wordsworth Road 2 Wheathill Road 1 20 8 The lamps marked 8 strictly speaking should have been included in last year's report. 5 During the frost great complaints were made of the bad light the lamps gave, and many went out. This was no doubt caused by deposits of naphthaline. DUSTING. In the Parish of Lewisham the Dust and Ashes have been collected by the horses and carts belonging to the Board. It is a difficult thing to arrive at the exact quantity removed during the year. In Lewisham it cannot be less than 12,750 cubic yards. On an average there are eight horses and carts employed daily in the collection. The dust has all been sold more or less advantageously, but it is so mixed with garden rubbish and other matter that its value is much reduced. In the Hamlet of Penge the Board contracted for the supply of horses, carts, and harness, and employed their own men. Mr. Craker supplied horses, carts, &c., at 7s. for horse, cart, and harness per day for a portion of the year, and Mr. Winnifrith for 5s. per day for horse, cart, and harness for the remainder of the year. There were 2,950 cubic yards of Dust and Ashes collected in Penge during the year, which were sold. BOARDS HORSES, &c. All the horses are in good health, and there really has not been a case of sickness in the stable during the year. The number of horses has not been increased. There are seventeen. I should be glad to do without hiring, as far as possible, for Highway work. I am of opinion if six horses were kept at the Stone Yard, Forest Hill, it would be a great advantage. That is to increase the stud of horses to twenty-seven, and keep six or eight of them at Forest Hill, and the remainder at Catford. It is about eleven years since the Board commenced to keep horses. The number then was ten. All the horses required at that time for the collection of Dust were hired. There are eight horses now employed in Dusting, consequently I have fewer horses at my disposal at the present time for Highway Work than I had years ago. Of course if the Board kept horses at the Stone Yard, Forest Hill, stables would have to be built, but this need not be a costly affair. It has now become quite a common thing for Local and District Boards to keep their own horses. 6 NEW WORKS. Kerbing, Channelling, and Crossings, &c. Lewisham Parish. Locality. Description of Works.

The most important Road Improvement completed during the year was widening the Railway Bridge over the Crystal Palace and West End Branch in the Anerley Road, Penge. The width of the Road was increased from 29 feet to over 45 feet. When I submitted the drawings to the Penge Committee in 1874, there appeared very little chance of the alteration being carried out. This makes the second Railway Bridge upon the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway the Board have widened. There yet remain two others, viz.:—the Bridges near Forest Hill and Anerley Station. I trust it may not be long before these works are done. The Roadway of Lee Bridge, Lewisham, was widened from 40 feet to 50 feet. More than one fatal accident has occured here, said to have been caused by the narrowness of Lewis Grove. The widening of Stoney Lane was completed, which cannot fail to 9 be a great convenience to the public. Major Foster paid for the Kerbing and Channelling of the Footpath. An arrangement was also made with that gentleman to give up the requisite land to make the Roadway from the foot of Perry Hill to Catford Hill 40 feet wide. The Perry Yale Improvement was completed. The Roadway has been increased from 20 feet to 40 feet. There were several other small improvements carried out and charged to Highways which I do not consider of sufficient importance to include in the list I have made. NEW STREETS.

Avenue Road, Lewisham Blackheath Hill Dulwich Wood House, Sydenham Limes Grove, Lewisham Mary Ann Place, Catford Hill Royal Parade, Blackheath West Hill, Sydenham Man-holes constructed in Public Sewers which art as Ventilators. Bennett Place, Blackheath Kent House Road, Lower Sydenham The Vale, Blackheath PENGE. Beckenham Road (opposite Penge Nursery), Clarina Road. Independent of the ventilators in the Public Sewers, every new house has a ventilator from the soil pipe. I have been obliged to summons some parties and in all cases I have succeeded in getting the Board's regulations carried out. During the year the larger sewers vested in the Board have been regularly cleansed by the Flushing Men, and considerably more than 100 loads of deposit have been removed. 12 SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. The following Surface Water Drains were laid during the year:— Name of New Street or Road. Size of Pipe. Length of Pipe in feet. Remarks. Bowness Road 9 300 Laid at Private Cost. Brownhill Road Byne Road 9 750 Ditto Engleheart Road 12 900 Ditto Jutland Roa 9 300 Ditto Laleham Road 9 550 Ditto Lower Sydenham 18 220 Laid at Public Cost. Penge Lane 9 600 Laid at Private Cost. Plassy Road 12 600 Ditto Ringstead Road 12 1200 Ditto Tredown Road 12 700 Ditto Venner Road 9 2400 Ditto We verton Road 9 900 Ditto This will show that some progress is being made towards separating surface water from sewage. I prepared and submitted to the Sydenham and Forest Hill Committee (Min. Page 28, Par. 25-6) a scheme for separating surface water and sewage in parts of that division. Upon the morning of the 11th of April, Lewisham and Lee were visited by probably the greatest flood ever witnessed in the neighbourhood. James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S., in his valuable quarterly paper on the meteorology of England, gives the rainfall in the neighbourhood of London as follows:—"On the 10th day rain fell at many places, and continued for several hours on the 11th. On these days the rainfall in the London district was very remarkable. At Caterham, the fall in the two days was 1.6 inches; at Croydon, 2.2 inches; at Blackheath, 2 inches nearly; at Greenwich Observatory, 2.8 inches; north of London, at Camden Square, where the rain was heaviest, 3.23 inches; at Muswell Hill, 2.8 inches; at Chiswick, 2.3 inches. And Mr. G. J. Simons states that 2½ inches out of 3.23 inches fell in 12 hours." The rain guage at Forest Hill Stoneyard gave during the night of the 10th and up to 9 o'clock a.m. on the 11th, 2.48; and the total up to 2 o'clock p.m., when it had ceased raining, 3.02. with such a large rainfall as I have stated, and extending 13 over so great an area, there can be little surprise that the flood was so high. The County Bridge in Southend Lane, the Bridge at Stonebridge Villas, Lewisham, and the Bridge in Eastdown Park were destroyed. The Lewisham Board, in May following (Min., page 135), determined, conjointly with the Plumstead Board, to re-build the Bridge in Eastdown Park; but the Plumstead Board raised the question of the liability of the owners of the adjoining land to re-construct the Bridge, and the matter was delayed, and, in consequence, great inconvenience was felt by the inhabitants of Eastdown Park. The Plumstead Board, after some pressure, consented to pay half the cost of a temporary Bridge, which was at once erected by the Lewisham Board (Min., page 300, par. 6-2). The Bridge in Beckenham Lane has been re-constructed by the County, and also the Bridge near Stonebridge Villas at private cost. In a Report of this nature I cannot minutely describe the damage done by this flood, but a great deal was done by the River Qaaggy, which simply overflowed its banks at several points, especially at Eltham Bridge, and ran down the Lee Road in a torrent. The River Ravensbourne also flooded the lower parts of Lewisham and other places. The District was also visited by a severe storm on Sunday, the 23rd June. The inhabitants of Penge suffered the most, some of the basements of the houses in the Beckenham Road were flooded to the extent of five or six feet (Min., page 208, par. 8). I am glad to say the Metropolitan Board have in contemplation the construction of a new sewer from Lee Bridge to Deptford. This cannot fail to do good, and I hope to see the work carried out soon. The Public Recreation Ground at Sydenham was opened with great eclat, upon Saturday, the 1st of June. On account of the wet season a push had to be made to complete the work of laying out, draining, planting, &c., which, I am glad to say, was successfully accomplished before the time of opening. A platform, with enclosures, was erected on the ground, and many hundreds of flags hung. The day turned out one of the few fine ones of the year, and the whole affair, I think I may venture to say, was a great 14 success. For particulars of the opening see Min. page 185, par 7. Referring to my last year's Report, page 14, 1 am glad to say the outfall sewer on Major Foster's estate, West Hill, is now completed, and also the sewers in the streets built upon on Webb's Estate, Brockley Lane; but the sewer in the valley of Quaggy, to drain Ennersdale Road, &c., &c., is in statu quo. Difficulties have arisen which have prevented the work from being carried out. I append to this report a list of New Streets sanctioned in the District by the Metropolitan Board of Works. A large number of plans have been prepared during the year, and I cannot have written less than 1,500 letters myself on the Board's business. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. APPENDIX.
