EB AR9 AC C44 21(3) EAST BARBET SEVENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the East Barnet Urban Sanitary District I 947 East Barbet Urban District Council. SEVENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1947. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council. I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1947. Milk Supply. There are now only two farms in the district at which milk is produced and the milk from one of these farms is primarily for their own consumption, only a very small quantity indeed being sold to a dairy company. The great change in character of East Barnet during the past twenty odd years is reflected in the steady diminution of the number of farms, from some 10 to 2. It will be noticed from the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector that the percentage of unsatisfactory milk samples has fallen steadily for the past few years. Every care is taken to ensure that clean milk only is sold in this area, but this depends on constant vigilance and supervision, and even so the human factor occasionally fails. Water Supply. The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Gas and Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date chemical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,278 examinations were made 99.5 per cent, being b. coli free in 100 c.c.'s. 2 Samples are also sent periodically to independent analysts in London for their examination and the following report is characteristic of such examinations :— "This is a clear and bright water free from odour and taste and neutral in re-action. It is hard in character, free from metals and contains no excess of saline matter. Both organically and bacteriologically the water is of a high degree of purity and is a pure and wholesome water suitable for public supply purposes." 12 samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination. The reports were in every case satisfactory. Diphtheria Prophylaxis. The figures as supplied to us now show 83 per cent, immunised. There is little prejudice against this most valuable procedure and it is essential that the public should realise how necessary is protection against Diphtheria. There is some fear that the increasing rarity of the disease may produce too much complacency. Of the three cases of Diphtheria notified during the year, one had received only one injection, and the remaining two were adults and had not been immunised. Scabies. During the year some 139 cases and contacts have been treated. A steady decrease. Little persuasion is now needed to get people to undergo treatment and recurrences have been infinitesimal in number. Ambulance. This is the last complete year in which the service will be operated by the Council. Number of cases during the year was 760 and in noting with regret the transference to the County Council I would like to stress the valuable services performed by the Ambulance personnel. Infectious Diseases. During August and September there were 7 cases of Poliomyelitis notified, following the pattern of 1946. Four of the cases were children ranging from 4| to 11 years old. No source of infection was able to be traced, nor were any of the cases known contacts. The figures show little variation worthy of comment except perhaps to say that Measles tends to become more prominent each 3 year. I regret that there is still considerable difficulty in obtaining supplies of convalescent measles serum for attenuation of the disease in suitable cases. Protective injection against WhoopingCough seems still to be of doubtful value. Tuberculosis. Figures compare closely with previous year. The housing problem is closely linked with the tuberculosis problem and I would wish that it were possible to give more priority in adequate accommodation to cases of tuberculosis. Here I would record my thanks to the Housing Officer for his co-operation with the Public Health Department in all matters. Finally, may I draw particular attention to the amount of work covered in the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and express the opinion that in view of conditions generally, the number of nuisances and sanitary defects needing attention is likely to increase still further. The work of this department continues to increase both in amount and importance and I would like to express my most sincere thanks to the members of my staff for their untiring patience and perseverance throughout the year. Your obedient Servant, C. M. SCOTT, m.r.c.s. (Eng.), l.r.c.p. (Lond.), Medical Officer of Health to the Council and A/Assistant School Medical Officer. 4 Area and Rateable Value.

There were 21 deaths of children under one year as compared with 28 last year, a death rate per 1,000 live births of 30.0. Last year the figure was 36.6 and for 1945 25.1. For England and Wales the rate was 43 for 1947 and 43 for 1946. Prevalence of, and Control over, Infectious Diseases. With the exception of Mumps, all cases of infectious disease are now notifiable in the area, and particulars of those cases notified are given in Table 1. 5 With regard to Diphtheria, every facility for prompt diagnosis and treatment is placed at the disposal of local doctors, swabs for examinations of throat, etc., and a supply of antitoxin are kept in readiness at the Town Hall. In addition, the Council has now given facilities for the supply of immunising serum. Similar facilities for bacteriological diagnosis are available in cases of Tuberculosis and other Infectious Diseases and full advantage is taken of them. In all infectious cases where patients are removed to isolation or special hospitals, the patient's home is visited and disinfection thoroughly carried out. Smallpox. No cases of this disease were notified during the year. Tuberculosis. A table is given showing new cases and mortality during 1947. Whenever possible, all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis likely to benefit are sent to the County Sanatorium at WTare. In every case thorough disinfection of the premises, etc., is carried out as soon as the patient has been removed. TABLE 1.

Difficulties and delays have also been experienced caused by the necessity of applying for licences under the Defence Regulations relating to the control of civil building, and in such cases it was necessary to allow extra periods of time for the commencement and execution of the required repairs. There were no legal proceedings against property owners in 1947, but in three cases where statutory notices had not been complied with it was necessary to carry out the work in the owner's default. Two of these were for defective drains, which were taken 12 up and relaid and the third for repairs to a dwelling house, to comply with a statutory notice served under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936. In each case tenders were invited from local builders, the lowest was accepted and the work was duly carried out. The expenses of the redrainage works, amounting to £23 8s. Od., and £32 respectively, were duly repaid by the owners concerned, and as regards the expense of repairing the dwelling house, amounting to £74 5s. Od., arrangements were made to repay by quarterly instalments. The vexed question of who should provide the dustbin was very much to the fore during the year and was settled in one case, by an appeal to the Barnet Magistrates Court. The Public Health Act which authorises notices to be served states that the notice requiring the renewal of a defective dustbin may be served on either the owner or the tenant, and leaves the matter to the local authority to decide. The local authority's decision, however, is not necessarily final, as whoever is served with the notice has a right of appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. In the past the owner has always been required to provide the new bin, unless there are exceptional circumstances, but owing to the very large increase in the the price of dustbins— from about 4/6 to 27/6 or 30/ property owners were objecting to providing this essential article, and were appealing against such a requirement. Conflicting decisions have been given in such cases in various parts of the country, some Magistrates holding that it was the owner's duty and others the tenant's. The Croydon Magistrates decided that it was the tenant's duty to provide the bin, and this case was quoted in an appeal which was made by an owner who was served with a notice to renew a dilapidated dustbin at a house in Longmore Avenue. Both owner and tenant repudiated liability. The Magistrates, however, after hearing all sides, the owner's, the tenant's and the Council's, decided that the tenant should provide the bin, giving as their reason that what was equitable in 1939 might not be so today, and they felt that the bin should be provided by the tenant. Rat Destruction. One hundred and nine complaints of rat infestation were received (134 in 1946), all of which were investigated and advice given as to the best methods of dealing with them. All the premises affected were repeatedly visited until finally cleared of rats. Many cases were also visited by the staff of the County Pests Officer at our request, and I must again acknowledge the valuable assistance 13 and cordial co-operation of Mr. Sharp and his staff. There were no heavy infestations and all could be classed as belonging to the " Minor secondary " type. The annual ten per cent, test of the sewer manholes, to ascertain the extent of rat infestation of the sewers, was again carried out at the request of the Ministry of Food. Test baits of sausage rusk were laid in 178 manholes and when inspected two days afterwards only 26 of the baits had disappeared. Pre-baiting as a preliminary to poison baiting was then undertaken in the sewers in the vicinity of those where the test baits had gone. This again resulted in only a few " takes "—20 out of 158 baited. These 20 manholes were then poison baited with the result that there were no complete " takes " and in only three sewer manholes were the poison baits partly consumed. There was no doubt that some of the test baits and some of the pre-baits placed in the surface water sewers were not taken by rats but were swept away by surface water as rain occurred on occasions after the baits had been placed in position at the bottom of the manholes. These operations proved once again that the extent of rat infestation of the sewers was very slight. Full particulars were supplied to the Infestation Division of the Ministry of Food. Verminous Houses. Sixteen privately owned houses, four council houses and four requisitioned houses were found to be infested with insects. All were disinfested by stripping and burning wallpaper and spraying with " Zaldecide " or " Cooper's D.D.T." liquid insectide after loosening or removal of picture rails, skirting boards and architraves, followed where necessary by sealing and fumigation by sulphur of the infested rooms.

The following is a summary of the results of the examinations:— 15 Test applied :— Designation. No. of Samples submitted. (a) Plate Count Result of Examination. (b) b coli. (c) Methylene blue test.

Sterilized 5 (c) and (e) 1 Unsatisfactory. Channel Islands Pasteurised 14 (c) and (e) Satisfactory. A copy of the report of each sample was supplied to the retailer or dairy proprietor. In the case of unsatisfactory samples, visits were paid to the premises of the dairy concerned and investigations made into the cause of the unsatisfactory report, or if the premises were outside our area a letter was sent to the particular person or firm pointing out that the report was not satisfactory and asking for an investigation. The percentage of unsatisfactory samples was 9. The previous year it was 6% ; in 1945, 10% ; in 1944, 7% ; in 1943, 9% ; in 1942, 18% and in 1941, 33%. Six of the seven unsatisfactory samples of Tuberculin Tested milk were from one firm's supply, and action was taken for a breach of the Special Designations Order. Notice was served on the firm, of a proposal to suspend or revoke the supplementary licence, and they were invited to attend a meeting to afford them an opportunity of making representations in regard thereto. A representative of the firm who attended before the General Purposes Committee attributed the fault to the farmer, as samples taken on arrival at the firm's dairy were below the bacteriological standard for that particular grade. They had therefore decided to pasteurise the milk and sell it in future as Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised. The matter of the farm was referred to the County Health Inspector as that farm was situated in Hertfordshire and was licenced for the production of Tuberculin Tested milk by the County Council. Since the firm commenced to pasteurise the milk many samples have been taken and all were found on examination to be quite satisfactory. » Meat Inspection. The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been duly observed as regards the butchers' shops in the district. 16 Inspection of Other Foods. All restaurants, snack bars, fried fish shops and other places where food is prepared have been visited and their kitchens and cooking utensils inspected for cleanliness.
