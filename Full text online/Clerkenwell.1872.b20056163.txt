For the Year 1872—73. LONDON: GOODE & Co., PRINTERS, &c., 26a, SEKFORDE STREET, E.C. 1873. SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the VESTRY of the parish of Saint fames and Saint Johm, CIerkenwall. 1872—3. Presented pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120. MEMORANDUM. In some of the previous Reports it has heen stated how the Collections of the Poor Kate came to devolve npon the Vestry, viz., by the operation of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, and the consequent abolition of the Board of Guardians or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, in January, 1868. This question having, however, been again raised in 1871, Counsel's Opinion was taken thereon, by which it appeared that the operation of the above Act had transferred the Relief of the Poor to the Guardians constituted under the new Poor Law, but had not affected the powers and duties of the former Board as regards the Collection of the Poor Rate. The Vestry therefore, on the making of the next Rate for the Relief of the Poor, in November, 1871, handed over the collection of same to the local Guardians or Governors, whose meetings (which had ceased since January, 1868,) were revived for the purpose, and who will therefore account for the Poor Rate in future. Such Poor Rates as were in collection by the Vestry at this time, it was deemed convenient and expedient should be continued by them to the close, hence the annexed account of Poor Rates made previous to November. 1871.

Dated this second day of July, 1873. JOHN BONE LEWIS, JOHN MASON, HERVEY BYASS. JOSEPH VAUGHAN HILL, HENRY THOMAS BARRETT Auditors. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen:-we the undersigned Auditors of Accounts for the Parish beg to report that we have carefully examined and audited the Accounts of the v estry for the year ending Lady-day last. During our Audit we have observed a charge of £15 : 15s. for a Testimonial to E. J. Thompson, Esq., in recognition of his sen ices as Representative df Clerkenwell at the Metropolitan Board of Works, and though we have passed the account, the majority of the Auditors venture to question the legahty of such a charge. We have again great pleasure in recording our satisfaction at the manner in which the Accounts have been kept, and we tender our cordial thanks to Mr. Paget and his Son their kind attention to us, and for the information rendered by them upon all matters in connection with the Accounts which have rendered everything most clear and satisfactory and greatly facilitated our work. We cannot conclude without giving Mr. Paget, Junr., the credit which is justly due to him, for the very excellent manner and great accuracy with which his books are kept, and cannot help remarking that no error or erasure in his Ledger has come under our observation during the Audit, likewise for his admirable production of the Balance Sheet, and for the thorough knowledge he evinces of his business, which fully confirms our remark last year that he does credit both to himself and the Vestry.

Gentlemen, I hereby do myself the honor of laying before you my Annual Report, for the year 1872; being the 17th which I have had the honor of submitting to you. In this, as in my former Reports, I have endeavoured as far as possible, to retain the same form, to allow of the ready comparison of the data. The number of deaths which arose from all causes in 1872, was 1323. The average number of deaths for the last 10 years, was 1538; hence the deaths were 215 below the average. And the number of deaths in 1871, being 1417; the deaths in 1872, were 94 less than in the preceding year. The subjoined table exhibits the number of deaths occurring in each of the last 10 years , the number of births for the same years being placed opposite:— 20 Deaths. Births. 1863 1509 2449 1864 1735 2224 1865 1613 2689 1866 1661 2434 1867 1497 2452 1868 1644 2478 1869 1512 2410 1870 1473 2415 1871 1417 2274 1872 1323 2353 1538 2317 The births were 36 more than the average. Tho sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, were as follows:— Deaths. Births. Excess. St. James 421 722 301 Amwell 301 573 272 Pentonville 269 485 216 Goswell 332 573 241 Every year, a certain number of the deaths of parishioners occur in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The estimated number of these for 1872 is 113. The number of births being 2353, and the deaths 1323, the excess, or the natural increase of the population, amounted to 1030. The number of deaths which arose from all the zymotic diseases in 1872, was 305; that for the preceding year being 302; thus there was an increase of 3. The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases in 1872, was 274; being a difference of 5 from the number for the preceding year. The numbers and causes of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the last 10 years are exhibited in the subjoined table:— 21 Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough Typhus. Diarrhoea. Total. 1863 26 44 136 66 52 42 376 1864 7 73 94 71 87 46 378 1865 12 27 57 88 84 48 316 1866 6 42 59 95 93 47 342 1867 20 44 49 35 71 50 269 1868 4 58 106 69 112 45 394 1869 0 28 116 81 74 44 343 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 1871 60 23 33 62 68 33 279 1872 15 35 20 105 76 23 274 The average number of deaths from these diseases, during the last 10 years, was 329 ; so that the number for 1872 is 55 beloy the average. The number of deaths from all causes, in infants and childre under 5 years of age, was 731; being 71 more than in the precedins year. The deaths at and above 60 were 200; including 25 at and above 80. The numbers for the preceding year were 260 and 44. 243 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases; the number for 187 being 287. 38 deaths occurred in the Workhouse, 16 of males, 22 of female The numbers for the preceding 10 years having been 172 158 167, 174, 156, 186, 178, 140, 107, and 75. The number of inmate 22 was 397, at the end of the year, viz. : 176 males, 134 females, and 87 children. 15 deaths took place in the House of Correction; the number for 1871 being 24. 5 deaths occurred in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 30 ; the number for 1871 being 26. 8 of these arose from fractures and contusions ; 2 from wounds ; 2 from burns and scalds ; 19 from accidental suffocation in infants ; ??? from other causes. 3 children were murdered during the year. 8 deaths arose from suicide, viz.: 1 from wound ; 1 from poison ; and 6 from hanging. 108 inquests were held in the year ; the number for the preceding year having been 115. The Table appended to this Report, contains an enumeration of the deaths, according to the diseases and ages, in further detail. Hence the mortality of the year 1872 was below that of the Average of the last 10 years ; below that of the preceding year ; and in fact, below that occuring in any year during the existence of the Vestry ; the mortality per 1000 being 20. This result is obtained ???y comparing the numbers of deaths registered in the district during each of the years concerned. But I have stated that a certain number of deaths of parishioners occur in Hospitals, &c., the number of which calculated as belonging to Clerkenwell in 1872 Amounted to 113. The addition of these would raise the mortality per 1000 to 21. But it must be borne in mind, that many of the patients who die in the Metropolitan Hospitals are brought from the country, and so tend considerably to raise the mortality of the metropolis and its component districts. In 18 large towns of England, the mortality per 1000 was determined by the Registrar-General for 1872 to be :—average total 55.8; London, 21.4; Portsmouth, 22.9; Norwich, 26.3; Bristol, 22; Wolverhampton, 25.9 ; Birmingham, 23.0 ; Leicester, 26.8 ; Nottingham, 25.3; Liverpool, 27.1; Manchester, 28.6; Salford, 25.8; Dldham, 31 1 ; Bradford, 26.3 ; Leeds, 27.9 ; Sheffield, 26.0 ; Hull, 26.1; Sunderland, 26.5 ; Newcastle-on-Tyne, 26.3.

The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases was 274; being 5 fewer than in the preceding year, and 55 less than the average of the last 10 years. The principal points to be noticed in regard to these diseases are:—a great reduction in the number of deaths from Small Pox a slight increase in the mortality from Measles; a reduction in the deaths from Scarlet Fever; an increase in those arising from Hooping-Cough ; a reduction in the deaths from Typhus ; and some increase in the deaths from Diarrhœa. The fumigation and disinfection of the houses where Small Pox and Typhus were known to have occurred, were followed up as in preceding years. Slaughter-Houses.—The Slaughter-Houses were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself, prior to the licensing. They were 33, kept by 32 butchers. In 1871, the numbers were 33 and 33 respectively. The regulations under which they are licensed were stated in my last Report. The Vestry have agreed to their being officially inspected twice a year, instead of once as hitherto. Cow-Houses.—These were found to be 31, kept by 28 cow keepers, the number of Cows being 329. In 1871, the numbers were 31, 26, and 367. The most remarkable event, in a sanitary point of view, occuring in the district during the year, was an outbreak of Typhoid Fever in North Avenue. This is a broad, open, well-paved court, but situated at a very low level. It contains 32 one-storey houses, and 280 inhabitants. Seventeen cases of Typhoid Fever are known to have occurred there, with at least one death. This diffusion of Fever seemed to arise from the existence of a communication between the two underground water-tanks and the drains. The houses are in fair order, except that the drains run very near the surface in the wash-houses, and the closets which are in the washhouses and so in the houses, are unprovided with water. 28 The handles of the pumps, by means of which the water was formerly drawn from the tanks, have since been removed, and a new and proper supply by means of the usual above-ground cisterns, has been laid on. The Meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1872. Temperature, Average. Difference from Average of 101 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation—100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 57 years. Year 50.7 + 2.2 45.2 82 29.63 30.0 + 1.2 Winter Quarter (Jan. Feb. Mar.) 43.6 + 5.0 39.5 86 29.57 6.5 + 1.4 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 52.8 + 0.5 45.2 76 29.73 5.7 0.0 Summer Quarter (July, Aug. Sept.) 61.6 + 1.5 54.0 77 29.74 6.5 —0.8 Autumn Quarter (Oct. Nov. Dec.) 45.3 + 1.7 42.1 89 29.48 11.3 + 4.2 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year was above the average, as was that of each quarter, especially the winter quarter, and the summer and autumn quarters.

At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 18th December, 1873. " The Clerk called attention to the fact that since the " Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Hate, which duty had "reverted to the Gnardians or Governors of the Poor under " the Local Act, aud which Board had been revived for the "purpose in November, 1871, there was no Poor Rate "Account published, except the remainder of those in " collection by the Vestry previous to that time, and suggested " whether it would not be desirable, by an agreement between " both Boards, to publish the Poor Bate Account of the " Guardians or Governors as an appendix to the Annual "Beports of the Vestry, in which case there would be one " and a-half years' Poor Rate Account to be appended to " the Report about to be issued for the year ended Lady-day " last. " It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by Mr. Dore, " and—t " Resolved that such suggestion be approved and " adopted." (.Extract from Board Minutes.) BOBEBT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
