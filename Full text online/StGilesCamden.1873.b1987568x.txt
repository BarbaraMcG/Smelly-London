ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1874. The Board, in compliance with the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act (under which it was constituted), presents to the Parishioners the Annual Report of its proceedings, comprising the Works commenced and completed, and those in progress; the proceedings for the Removal of Nuisances, and the improvement of the Sanitary Condition of the District; the Reports of the Medical Officer of Health, and of the Analyst under the Adulteration of Food Act 1872, together with the Accounts, in abstract and summary statements. The meetings held during the year commencing June, 1873, and ending May, 1874, have been as follows:— 40 Meetings of the Board 15 „ of the Finance Committee 10 „ of the Works Committee 20 „ of the Sanitary Committee 7 „ of Special Committees on various subjects 92 It will be seen by the Accounts appended to this Report, that the sum of £3,434 16s. paid to the Metropolitan Board of Works consisted of the following sums, for payment whereof precepts were made on this District, viz.:— For the Consolidated Rate, including therein Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Sinking Fund and General Expenses, the sum of . £3,377 1 9 For payment of the debts and liabilities of the late Commissioners of Sewers 57 14 3 Making together £3,434 16 0 b 2 8 The following table shows the several amounts paid by this District to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the last seven years:— Year. Amount. £ s. d. 1867-8 7,328 12 10 1868-9 6,297 8 5 1869-70 6,303 4 0 1870-1 6,648 13 10 1871-2 4,308 14 4 1872-3 3,244 0 10 1873-4 3,434 16 0 This Board would call the attention of the Parishioners to the above items, against which there is no appeal, and over which they have no control. The precepts for the year 1874-5, amount to £5,605 13s. 8d. nearly a sixth part of the annual expenditure of this Board. The following table shows the amount paid by this District to the London School Board since it was constituted:— Year. Amount. £ s. d. 1871 719 11 9 1872 1,208 8 10 1873 939 15 11 The precept and election expenses this year amount to £2,348 5s. 1d. This Board have no power of appeal against, or control over, these amounts. Watering the Streets. The District was efficiently watered, under contract from the 1st day of March to the 1st day of October, 1873, at the cost (including the repair of stand-posts and pipes, amounting to £63 4s. 1d.) of £1,078 4 1 The water used for such purpose was 3,777,000 gallons, at a cost of 1s. per 1,000 gallons, amounting to, (including meter hire) 199 6 0 Making a total expenditure of £1,27710 1 Cleansing the Streets. There have been 31 Street Orderlies in the constant employ of the Board during the year, at a cost of £1,519 12 3 The cost of removing the slop and dirt under contract was 1,594 18 0 Making the total cost £3,114 10 3 9 Lighting the Streets. The following sums were paid to the undermentioned Gas Companies for this purpose:— The Imperial Gas Company . £2,419 10 10 The London „ „ 1,568 2 5 The Chartered „ „ 62 16 7 Gas columns and alterations . 42 1 6 £4,092 11 4 In the month of December, 1873, the several Gas Companies supplying this District gave notice to this Board that the price of Gas would be raised. The Companies subsequently applied to the Board of Trade to nominate Commissioners to consider their application to raise such prices. The Commissioners on their appointment held a long investigation, and the application was opposed by the Metropohtan Board of Works, but resulted in the Imperial Gas Company being allowed to increase their charge from £4 8s. per lamp, to £5 18s.; the London Gas Company to £5 1s.; and the Chartered Gas from £4 9s. 9d. to £5 1s. 3d. Much dissatisfaction is expressed by the inhabitants with this decision, and active measures are being taken, with the view of reducing the excessively high price of Gas. The cost of removing the Dust and Ashes from the dwelling houses in the District during the year was £1,248 15s. The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868. Under this Act, this Board has been enabled to enforce considerable improvements during the past year, in and immediately adjoining one of the worst parts of St. Giles. They have made orders for the demolition of some buildings which have long existed in the yards of the houses on the north and south sides of Church Lane,, Carrier street and Church street, and the entire demolition of the wretched dwellings called Welch's and Kennedy Courts. The freeholders of these properties have taken, or are about to take steps to materially improve the property by carrying out the alterations and improvements directed by the orders of the Board. It is, however, much to be regretted that the entire property isnot taken down and rebuilt in a suitable manner. This,, however,, the Board had not power to compel. Dust and Ashes. 10 Sunday Trading Acts. The joint Vestry of the parishes of St. Giles and Bloomsbury, having felt it their duty to carry out the provisions of these Acts, in consequence of the nuisance and disquietude caused in various parts of the parishes by Sunday Trading, especially in Broad Street, St. Andrew Street, Little and Great Earl Streets, Dudley Street, Drury Lane and Crown Street, applied in the month of July, 1873, to this Board (in whom the power was vested) to enforce the law relating to the same; and the Board having resolved to comply with the application, appointed a Committee to take proceedings to suppress Sunday Trading. The joint Vestry had caused notices to be extensively circulated in the localities above mentioned, requesting the shopkeepers to keep their shops closed after 10.30 a.m. on Sundays. Of these persons a large proportion complied with the notice, but the remainder absolutely declined. The result was that 179 prosecutions were instituted against the offenders, and 168 convicted, in fines, varying from 1s. to 5s.—-the latter sum being the fine imposed by the Statute of Charles for suppressing Sunday Trading. The paucity and inequality of the fines, and the small sums imposed by the magistrates for expenses, and also the considerable time occupied in hearing the summonses, which were very numerous, induced several of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis to meet and discuss the course to be pursued. After several meetings held at the Vestry Hall of St. James's, Westminster, they determined to memorialise the Home Secretary, to obtain an amendment of the law; and on the 7th of May last, having previously presented a memorial, a Deputation from the following parishes attended him, viz.:—St. Pancras; St. George, Hanover Square; Paddington; Shoreditch; Chelsea; St. James, Westminster; Kensington; St. Luke, Old Street; St. George's-in-the-East; St. Giles and Bloomsbury; St. Clement Danes; St. Martin's-in-the-Fields; St. Ann's, Soho; St. Paul's, Covent Garden; Bermondsey; St. Saviour's; St. Mary-le-Strand and Lambeth; and represented to the Home Secretary the causes and grounds of their complaint, and suggested the remedies for the removal thereof. The Home Secretary, in answer to the Deputation, stated he thought the complaint was of the administration of the law, and promised to see the magistrates on the subject. The Board hope that the application to the Home Secretary will have a beneficial result, and that Sunday Trading throughout London will be suppressed. Nuisances. There have been several cases of prosecution and convictions under the Nuisances Removal Acts. The Medical Officer's Report, hereunto annexed, will supply further information under this head. 11 Cab-Stand in Russell Spare. In the month of April last, the Chief Commissioner of Police established a Hackney Carriage Stand in the south-west corner of Russell Square. Applications were made by the residents to this Board to take measures to have the same removed. The Board accordingly applied to the Chief Commissionerof Police, who complied with the Board's request. Death of the late Clerk to the Board. The Board has in the past year sustained by the death of its clerk, the late Mr. Robert Finnis, the loss of a highly valued officer. Mr. Finnis held the appointment of Clerk to the Board from its creation, upwards of eighteen years, and his legal knowledge, long experience and courteous manners were highly esteemed by every Member of the Board, and the Parishioners generally.

SURVEYOR'S DEPARTMENT-REPORT. Gentlemen,— Appended is a summary, of the Works commenced, completed, and in progress under the superintendence of this Department for the year ending 25th March, 1874. MAINTENANCE OF STREETS. The cost of keeping in repair the undermentioned Macadamized Streets in the District during the year, namely, Bedford Square, Bedford Place, Bernard Street, Brunswick Square, Chenies Street, Hart Street, Montague Street, Russell Square, Torrington Place, Upper Bedford Place, &c., was as follows:— 1,702 yards of broken Granite £1,354 10 2 The cost of labour in repairing and spreading the materials on the streets for the year was . 133 14 11 The cost of the steam roller in consolidating the Macadam was 67 14 6 Making together £1,555 19 7 CARRIAGE-WAYS. The Carriage-way Paving of the following Streets have been redressed and relayed on a bed of concrete 9 inches deep, at the following cost:— Crown Street £522 7 6 Streatham Street 75 17 8 Bloomsbury Market 111910 Compton Mews 379 4 5 Tavistock Mews 349 11 4 The following Streets have been repaved with new Aberdeen Granite Cubes:— Tottenham Court Road £2,009 1 7 Holborn (from Newton Street to New Oxford Street) 834 4 11 Making together £2,843 6 6 The attention of the Board has been called to the several systems of Paving lately tried in Holborn, the Strand, and the City, and they have been urged to adopt the same. Two of the patented Asphaltes used for that purpose in King William Street, City, c 2 24 resulted in utter failures, and had to be removed. The Val de Travers Asphalte is laid down in Cheapside and Holborn, and Wood Paving on Ludgate Hill, and the Strand. The costs of these Pavements are respectively 16s. and 17s. per yard, and exceed the cost of Granite by 3s. and 4s. per yard. The annual cost of repair of that in Holborn, about 8,300 square yards, is £200 per annum. The Asphalte Pavement, as appears by the Report of the City Surveyor, is productive of a larger number of accidents. It is very expensive to keep in repair. The Wood Pavement has not been laid down a sufficiently long period to test its durability and usefulness; and under these circumstances, I have not been able to recommend the adoption by the Board of any other description of Pavement than that now in use in this District. I am very desirous that the Board should avail themselves of all beneficial improvements from time to time as they arise. FOOTWAY PAYING. The following Streets have been repaired with new 3-inch Yorkshire Paving and Curb, namely:— Bury Place £74 15 3 Little Queen Street 78 1 7 At a cost of £152 16 10 The following Streets and Mews in the District are paved with Pebbles, and are to be repaired and paved with Guernsey Granite as circumstances permit, namely:— Alfred Mews Bedford Head Yard (Southampton Row) Bernard Mews Chapel Place (Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields) Colonnade Mews Caroline Mews Chenieb Mews Charlotte Mews George Yard (Little Queem Street) Gower Mews Hunter Mews Henrietta Mews King's Arms Yard (Silver Street) King's Arms Yard (Coal Yard) King's Arms Yard (Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields) King's Head Yard (Duke Street, Bloomsbury) Little Britain Montague Mews (Upper) New Yard (Great Queen Street) Pied Bull Yard Queen's Head Yard (Great Queen Street) Red Lion Yard (Part) Russell Mews (Part) Torrington Mews East Torrington Mews (Part) Woburn Mews East Woburn Mews West Sewers Works.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— 1. I have the honour to present to you my Report on the Sanitary State of the District for the year 1873. As in former years, I introduce an analysis of the facts, with a brief citation of the rates of mortality, &c., for the whole Metropolis, to afford a standard for comparison. The Registered Births in the Metropolis for the year 1873 numbered 121,100, giving a rate of 35.55 per 1000 of persons living. The Registered Deaths were 76,634, yielding a rate of 22.45. 2. The Death-rate for London was rather in excess of the year 1872, viz. 21.3, but less than the average of the previous ten years, viz. 24.3. We must therefore regard 1873, as, on the whole, a healthy year. The last quarter, however, evidenced a decided increase of mortality, the Death-rate having sprung to 25.3, thus contrasting unfavourably with the rate for the last quarter of 1872, which was only 19.8. 26 3. This rapid augmentation of the Death-rate was mainly owing to an epidemic of measles which prevailed in the months of November and December, with a fatality unknown since the new system of Registration has been in force. During the quarter, 1,420 Deaths arose from measles alone. 4. The Births in St. Giles District in 1873 were 1,639, at the rate of 32.5 per 1000 of its population; and the Deaths 1,277, at the rate of 23.90 per 1000. Thus our Birth-rate was lower and our Deathrate higher that the rates for the Metropolis. Nevertheless, our Death-rate is a low one for St. Giles. Like the Metropolis at large, we suffered a considerable mortality from Measles in the last quarter, and had besides a misfortune of our own in an outbreak of Typhus Fever in Great Wild Street and the adjacent courts (§ 32). 5. Atmospheric Phenomena.— During this quarter, the temperature was very variable and prejudicial to health. From about the middle of October to the middle of November the weather was unusually cold; the deficiency of mean temperature, as stated in Mr. Glaisher's Report, published by the Registrar General, being about 3½°; "then, from November 17th to December 7, the weather was mostly warm, and the excess of mean temperature was 3.l°. A week of very cold weather ensued, the deficiency of temperature on the 9th, 10thand 11th being 11½°,16½° and 12½° respectively." The dense fog that prevailed during these days will not be readily forgotten. It was caused by the downward current of cold air precipitating the moisture and smoke in our atmosphere. There was neither rain nor wind during this period, and the consequent stagnation of the atmosphere was a coinciding cause of the fog. The Birth-rate in St. Giles District. 6. The Registered Births in St. Giles District for the year 1873 were 1,778; but this number requires correction, inasmuch as there were 139 Births in the British Lying-in Hospital which did not belong to St. Giles District. Subtracting this number, the Births are reduced to 1,639. These 139 Births are moreover registered in the St. Giles South Sub-District, whose aggregate is increased to this extent. The importance of deducting these Births, in order to make an approximately correct statement, will be apparent on considering that whilst St. Giles South, with a population of 19,089, is charged with 837 Births, St. George Bloomsbury, with a population of 17,843, is charged with only 469 Births. In other words, each woman in the Southern District of St. Giles is supposed to give birth to two children (nearly) as against one borne by each woman in St. George, Bloomsbury. 7. The Births in St. George, Bloomsbury, are, however, comparatively few on account of the large number of single persons —maid servants—who live there, a cause that influences the Death registers in a similar degree. 8. Among the Births in the British Lying-in Hospital, there 27 were 6 belonging to St. George, Bloomsbury, 14 to St. Giles South, and 6 to St. Giles North. The 12 Births divided between the St. George and St. Giles North Sub-Districts must be deducted from the registered number of the St. Giles South Sub-District. 9. Further correction must be made for the Births occurring in the Workhouse, viz., 106. Of this number, 7 belonged to the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury; 24 to St. Giles North, and 45 to St. Giles South. There were 17 Births in which the previous residences of the mothers could not be ascertained. There were also 13 women confined in the Workhouse who belonged to the Strand District. These, for convenience sake, are enumerated with the 17 Workhouse Births=30. 10. As the Workhouse is in the Sub-District of St. Giles South, all the Births occurring therein are registered against that Sub-District; thus further augmenting the apparent number of its Births. The Births belonging to St. George and to St. Giles North Sub-Districts must be, therefore, added to the record for those Sub-Districts, and subtracted from St. Giles South. These various corrections having been made, the following table expresses the results:— TABLE No. 1. The Birth-rate to Population in St. Giles and its Sub-Districts in 1873. Sub-Disteicts. Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1000. St. George, Bloomsbury. 17,843 482 1 in 37 27 St. Giles South 19,089 625 1 in 30.5 32.7 St. Giles North 16,497 502 1 in 32.8 30.4 Workhouse (previous residences unknown) ... 30 ... ... Whole District 53,429 1,639 1 in 32.6 32.5 The Death-rate in St. Giles District. 11. The Death-rate must be ascertained by the same method as that by which the Birth-rate was determined. The registered morality for the year was 1,166—of which number there were 301 Deaths recorded against St. George, Bloomsbury, 551 against St. Giles South, and 314 against St. Giles North. To the aggregate number of 1,166 must be added the Deaths of persons belonging to St. Giles District in the various general Hospitals of London, namely, 89 ; also the Deaths in the Highgate Infirmary—40. These must be distributed among the Sub-Districts according to the previous residences of the deceased persons. The Deaths not belonging to us in the British Lying-in Hospital (61) and in the Infants' Home (12), 28 must be deducted in a similar way. The Deaths from Fever in Stockwell (17) are incorporated. Besides these, there were 161 Deaths in the Workhouse, which must be distributed among the Sub-Districts, according to the previous residences of the deceased persons during the current year. There were 42 Deaths in the Workhouse that could not be appropriated to the Sub-Districts. The results of these corrections are stated in the following table:— TABLE No. 2.—The Death-rate to Population is St. Giles and its Sub-Districts in 1873. Sub-Districts. Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Rate per 1000.

Whole District 53,429 1,277 1 in 41.8 23.90 12. It would be convenient here to compare the Death-rate for last year with the average Death-rate, and with the Death-rate for each year during the last ten years.

The foregoing table shows that the Death-rate for 1873 was within a fraction the same as that for the previous year, which was the lowest Death-rate on record. We have reason, therefore, to congratulate the District on the continuance of a very favourable state of the public health. Our Death-rate last year was only 23.9, whilst the average Death-rate for the previous ten years was 27.74. Thus about 400 human beings have had their lease of life extended during the past two years. 14. It would be most imprudent, however, to "rest and be thankful" for this increased healthfulness. The present rate is only comparatively good ; in itself it indicates a large amount of preventable mortality, and the existence among us of numerous causes of physical impoverishment and suffering. It is simply an encourage- * There were 42 deaths in the Workhouse that could not be allocated to either of the Sub-Districts These are taken into account in estimating the Death-Rate for the whole District. (Vide Table No. 2.) 29 merit to proceed with the important improvements in which your Board has been actively engaged during the past two years, and to which I shall hereafter refer. 15. It is noticeable that the Death-rate for Bloomsbury was only 18 per 1000, whilst for St. Giles South, it was 30.2, indicating a much higher sanitary condition in the former Sub-District than in the latter. This is no doubt true, but at the same time, it is necessary to reiterate a fact to which I have already drawn attention (§7), that the population of Bloomsbury consists largely of servants, who do not die in the Sub-Districts, consequently the low Death-rate is rather apparent than real. 16. This observation should be extended to large quarters of the Metropolis reputed to have a low mortality, namely: Paddington, St. George, Hanover Square, Kensington, parts of Marylebone, the City, etc. Besides household servants, nearly the whole of the assistants in the warehouses and retail shops of London come from the provinces, and return thither when they are seriously ill. Before a strictly correct Death-rate can be fixed, these circumstances must be taken into account. The Death-rate among Infants in St. Giles District. 17. The number of Deaths among Infants under one year of age was 314. This is about the number we usually sustain. Of this number 94 belonged to the Sub-District of Bloomsbury, 124 to St. Giles South, and 96 to St. Giles North. The rate of Morality to the Births in each Sub-District was as follows:— Whole District 1 Death in every 5.1 Births = 19.5 per cent, of Births. St. George, Bloomsbury 1 do. do. 5.1 do. = 19.5 „ St. Giles South 1 do. do. 5.0 do. = 19.8 „ St. Giles North 1 do. do. 5.2 do. = 19.1 „ In the foregoing estimate for the whole District, 30 Births which occurred in the Workhouse are omitted, the previous residences of the mothers being unknown. Their inclusion, however, would only make a difference of the decimal 1. The Death-rate among Persons 60 years of Age and upwards. 18. 279 persons died at these ages, of which 68 belonged to the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury, 151 to St. Giles South, and 60 to St. Giles North. The ratios to the whole mortality and to population are thus expressed:— Whole District 1 death in every 4.57 of all deaths and in every 191.5 of pop. St. George, Bloomsbury 1 do. do. 4.07 do. and do. 262.0 do. St. Giles South 1 do. do. 3.83 do. and do. 126.4 do. St. Giles North 1 do. do. 5.6 do. and do. 241.6 do. St. Giles South has had the largest number of Deaths above 60 years of age, both in relation to total Deaths and to Population. This must be owing to the undue number of old persons living in that Sub-District, who are partly immigrants from Ireland and partly 30 drawn thither by the Workhouse, and the large number of common lodging-houses in the Sub-District. The Death-rate among Persons at all Ages. 19. There were 684 Deaths at all ages (exclusive of infants and persons 60 years of age and upwards) in the District during the year 1873. Of these, 160 occurred in St. George, Bloomsbury; 303 in St. Giles South; and 179 in St. Giles North. There were 42 Deaths in the Workhouse that could not be allocated to the several Sub-Districts. These 684 Deaths (nearly the exact number of last year, viz. 683,) are equivalent to 1 death in every 78.1 of our population. Thus there has been a similar saving of human life to that of last year, which I then computed at 28 per cent, of the Deaths at those ages,—the most active and useful periods of life. 20. The following table exhibits the proportion of Deaths from 8ome of the more important Diseases in the three Sub-Districts. It will be observed that much more than half of the Deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia occurred in St. Giles South, and nearly half of the Deaths from Phthisis. Nearly half of the Deaths also from Diseases of the Heart and Tabes, and just half of the Deaths from Premature Birth and from Cancer, occurred in the same Sub-District. TABLE No. 4.—The Mortality in the Sub-Districts from more important Diseases in 1873. Diseases. Sub-Districts. Total. Bloomsbury. St. Giles South. St. Giles North. Phthisis 43 72 44 159 Bronchitis 47 144 63 254 Pneumonia 10 31 9 50 Disease of Heart 19 33 20 72 Cancer 8 13 5 26 Tabes 6 13 9 28 Hydrocephalus 7 9 10 26 Apoplexy 10 12 5 27 Paralysis 3 12 5 20 Convulsions 7 8 6 21 Disease of Liver 10 5 4 19 Premature Birth 3 10 7 20 Old Age 8 15 8 31 Atrophy and Debility 29 27 23 79 Death-rate among the Zymotic Diseases. 21. We have already noticed that our mortality among persons at all ages was within one, last year, of that recorded in the previous year, and we now find that the mortality from Zymotic Diseases in 31 the two years bears the same proportion to each other, viz.:—237 in 1873 against 238 in 1872. These coincidences are remarkable, and serve to show the equality of sanitary conditions in the two years. (See also Death-rate, § 13.) 22. Of the 237 Zymotic Diseases, only 217 belonged to the Miasmatic order, the remainder being Enthetic, Dietic and Parasitic Diseases. Last year the number of Miasmatic Diseases was 211; there has been little difference, therefore, in the two years. Both years show a much lower ratio than the average of 10 years, which is 307, or about 43 per cent, greater than the mean of the last two years. This is obviously a favourable condition of things. 23. Small Pox.—No deaths from Small Pox occurred during the year. The contagion in this District seems to be exhausted, but it may re-appear among us at any time, and no foresight can predict when or whence. The Board of Guardians continue to carry out the provisions of the Vaccination Act. 24. Measles.—Our deaths from this cause were 27—a smaller number than last year, viz. 37, but nearly exactly the mean for 10 years (27.2). Notwithstanding that our mortality from Measles has not exceeded the average, yet during the last two months of the year, our District, in common with the Metropolis at large, suffered severely from this disease. We had 14 deaths in the two months; we also had 7 deaths in the first month of the present year, when the epidemic abated. The mortality from Measles during this epidemic was greater than has been before recorded since the new system of Registration has been established. 25. It is remarkable that since 1870, the Metropolis has been scourged by three epidemics, the most fatal of their species that have been known for many years, viz., Scarlet Fever in 1870, Small Pox in 1871, and Measles in 1873. In 1870 St. Giles District lost 103 persons from Scarlet Fever; in 1871, 88 from Small Pox; and in 1873 we came under the common infliction of Measles, although, happily, we suffered less than our share; and yet, our Death-rate from Zymotic Diseases has been undergoing a steady diminution. 26. Scarletina.—Our mortality from this disease (8) was very slight, the mean of ten years being 47. 27. Whooping Cough.—This usually fatal affection in St. Giles also visited us mildly, our deaths being 29, whilst our mean mortality is 47. 28. Diarrhoea gave 80 deaths, which is about our usual number. As we have invariably observed, the larger number of deaths from this disease occurred in the autumnal months, and among children; 38 of these deaths occurred in the month of August. Especial inquiries were conducted to ascertain the social and physical conditions of the victims. The results may be thus stated. All the deaths were of children under 5 years of age, and 32 out of the 38 were under 1 year of age. The mothers could not be traced in two instances; in the remaining 30, it was ascertained that only two children had received their nourishment exclusively from the mother's 32 breast ; and in the case of these two, it was admitted that the supply was scanty and difficult. All the others were fed with farinaceous food of various kinds, cows' milk or condensed milk. Two or three had the breast occasionally. 29. There was no "overcrowding," in the legal sense in any instance, and in all the houses the supply of water was good, with the exception of one, where there was an underground tank. 30. Seven of the children were illegitimate, which is about three times more than the due proportion. Four were twins. 31. The evidence makes it clear that these deaths occurred among debilitated, ill-fed, and probably ill-cared-for children. Infants brought up by hand, with scanty and indigestible food, fall easily into a state of debility, which disables them from resisting the injurious influence of high temperature and close fetid rooms. Typhus Fever. 32. At the commencement of September, I was informed of the occurrence of six cases of Typhus Fever—four of these in Lincoln Court, and two in Great Wild Street. This outbreak was so unexpected that further inquiries were immediately instituted, with the view to ascertain the cause. The localisation of the fever led me to believe that the disturbance of old deposits of filth in the basements of three houses that had been destroyed by fire in Lincoln Court—a disturbance caused by the removal of the old foundations preparatory to rebuilding—had set free poisonous gases which generated the fever. All the sufferers in Lincoln Court lived in close proximity to the ruins of these houses. 33. These cases were soon followed by others in the same month, fourteen of them in the same locality, and four others in various parts of the District. 34. The fever continued to prevail to about the middle of the following month, when it declined. 35. The annexed table exhibits the mortality during the entire year, with the sex and age of the sufferers. TABLE No. 5.—Showing the Deaths from Fever, with Sub-District, Sex and Age. Disease.

All the deaths from Typhus, with one exception, were among patients who had previously lived in St. Giles South. St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Giles South suffered from Typhoid Fever in equal proportion. St. Giles North was most free from these diseases. 37. The more minute information relating to the facts summarised in the foregoing tables is contained in the tables in the Appendix, and I beg to refer to them for all the details of age, sex, locality, &c., that may be required for further research. I do not think that they demand more especial comment on this occasion. 38. Inquest Cases.—There were 99 Inquest Cases during the year. Of these, 24 deaths occurred in St. George, Bloomsbury, 58 in St. Giles South, and 17 in St. Giles North. In four instances the verdicts returned were " wilful murder " of infants. One was rupture of uterus during childbirth. There were fourteen verdicts of "suffocation" of infants in bed. They were presumably caused by negligence. There were three of suicide by poisoning, namely, one by strychnia, one by cyanide of potassium, and one by laudanum. There were two suicides by hanging, one by cutting throat, and one by jumping out of window. The others were chiefly deaths from ordinary diseases, and accidents. 39. Non-Certified Cases.—I am happy to say that there were fewer Non-Certified Cases last year than in former years, only six having been so returned. This, I hope, is an evidence of greater strictness in the registration. Cases certified as Unknown, were four—two of them from the Workhouse. Mortality in the Workhouse and other Local Institutions. 40. The aggregate number of deaths attributable to the Workhouse was 222; of these 44 occurred in the Highgate Infirmary, and 17 at Stockwell, leaving 161 to the Workhouse itself. Ten of the deaths in the Workhouse belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, by previous residence, 68 to St. Giles South, and 41 to St. Giles North. All these deaths are properly distributed and incorporated in Table No. 2. 41. The deaths in the Workhouse have not been so numerous as in past years, owing to the removal of many patients to the Highgate and Stockwell Infirmaries. The deaths in the Highgate Infirmary arose chiefly from diseases of the lungs, and those in Stockwell from Typhus Fever. The Bloomsbury Dispensary. 42. The following table shows the number of cases that have been under treatment in this Institution during the year. 34 TABLE No. 6. New cases treated at the Bloomsbury Dispensary, 1873.

The Physicians' cases have not been so numerous as usual,— a circumstance in correspondence with the general liealthfulness of the year. The Surgeons' cases have maintained their ordinary ratio; accidents and injuries requiring surgical treatment being little influenced by weather. The mortality has been small, namely, 82 this year, against 115 in 1872, and 118 in 1871. 44. The British Lying-In Hospital.—There were 169 women received into this Hospital daring the year. The births were 172, among which there were three sets of twins, two of which sets were all females, and one set, one male and one female. The male births were 76, and the females 96. Two of the male and one of the female children died. The causes of death were premature birth in one case, debility (the child being a twin) in a second, and Peritonitis in a third. There were seven still births, not registered. Three of the mothers died, one from accidental hcemorrhage (soon after admission), one from puerperal fever (Septicaemia), and one from Pleurisy and Peritonitis. Twenty six of the women confined, belonged to St. Giles District, in the following proportions, viz., 6 to St. George, Bloomsbury, 19 to St. Giles South, and 6 to St. Giles North. The Hospital was closed for two months in the autumn, to be cleansed and purified, as is the ordinary practice. 45. The Infants' Home.—The Medical Attendant of this institution, Dr. Paramore, has kindly favoured me with the facts contained in the following statements. Eighty children have been received into the Home in the usual manner, but several others were brought there in consequence of illness. The deaths were 12: one from Tabes Mesenterica, one from Debility and Bronchitis, one from Debility and Diarrhoea, five others from Debility, two from Pneumonia. The causes of death in the other two instances were not known to Dr. Paramore, the children having been attended by other practitioners. The Sanitary Work of the Year. 46. Each year brings with it, not only its ordinary round of duties, but generally some exceptional labour, which demands for a time unusual application on the part of the Inspectors. This year it 35 has been an outbreak of Typhus Fever in Great Wild Street and Lincoln Court, and various measures in connexion with the improvements in Church Lane and the adjoining courts. House Improvements in St. Giles District effected under the Superintendence of the Sanitary Inspectors between Lady-day, 1872, and Lady-day, 1873. Inspector Harnack.

Cow-Sheds.—The Cow-sheds have been properly inspected, and suggestions made for their improvement. 49. Slaughter-houses.—The Justices declined to grant the licences for the period of a year, in the expectation that Parliament would deal with the question in a definitive way in the present session. As the action of Parliament will be known, in all probability, before this Report can be in the hands of the Board, it would be inexpedient for me to occupy space in dilating on the evils of the present system of private slaughtering; but I may express the hope that such a pernicious practice will be abolished. Under a wellarranged system of public abattoirs, with proper inspection and responsible administration, the public would have adequate security against the slaughtering of diseased animals, and the offensive fouling of the drains by the offal and refuse. At the same time there can be no doubt that meat would become cheaper, as it has been in Edinburgh, Berlin, and other towns where the system of public abattoirs has been adopted. 50. Bake-houses.—No complaint has been made of these during the year, and the Regulations of your Board have been fairly carried out. 51. Bad Food.—The following list includes all the articles that have been seized during the year. This part of the duties of the Inspectors is of the greatest advantage to the public, inasmuch as the seizures, although not frequent, act as a deterrent to unscrupulous dealers, who are rarely caught a second time committing the offence.

Underground Rooms.—Convictions have been obtained during the year against several owners of houses in the District, for permitting their Underground Rooms to be illegally occupied. 53. Several Underground Tanks have also been abolished, besides those already referred to in the paragraph relating to private slaughter-houses. The continuous improvement in the District has, no doubt, largely tended to raise the health of our population to its present standard, which I earnestly hope will be maintained. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 1st May, 1874. GEORGE ROSS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX. TABLE I. Registered Deaths in 52 Weeks of 1873.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST Appointed under the Adulteration of Food, Drink, and Drugs Act. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— My appointment as Analyst to your Board dates from the 29th of March, 1873, and this Report will comprise a brief statement of the Analyses I have made in the twelve months commencing from that date. I have from to time furnished you with detailed Reports, in which full particulars have been given, which it will be unnecessary to repeat here. The total number of Analyses made has been 398, and the substances analysed have comprised milk, bread, flour, tea, coffee, sugar, butter, pepper, mustard, vinegar, sauces, jam, marmalade, confectionery, arrowroot, rhubarb, carbonate of soda, citric acid, and white precipitate. Among these articles, adulterations have been detected in milk, mustard, coffee, pepper, bread, butter, and vinegar. Milk is the article that appears to have been most largely and generally adulterated; and as this is a very important article of diet, the attention of the Inspector was for some time confined in a great measure to the collection of samples of milk from all the dealers in that article throughout the district. The number of samples thus collected was 325; and of these, no less than 114 were found to be adulterated, and some of them very largely adulterated, with water. In many of the other cases, although the milk had not been adulterated according to the legally recognized meaning of the term "adulterated," it had been deteriorated in quality by the abstraction of part of the cream. Mustard is also an article that has been very generally adulterated, by the addition of flour and turmeric; but this is a much less serious adulteration. Of 16 samples of mustard submitted to me by the Inspector for analysis, 10 have been found to be adulterated. I have also found 2 samples of coffee, 2 of pepper, 1 of bread, 1 of butter, and 3 of vinegar adulterated. It is satisfactory to be able to state, however, that in none of these cases have the adulterations been such as to be likely to prove injurious to health, excepting that in the case of milk, the lowering of its nutritive properties by the addition of water may be injurious to the health of those, and especially of children, with whom it constitutes a principal article of food. There is evidence already of considerable improvement in the quality of many of the articles of food supplied to the public. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 17, Bloomsbury Square, T. REDWOOD. 8th June, 1874. SUGGESTIONS FOR THE BETTER CONSTRUCTION OF DWELLING HOUSES. By GEORGE ROSS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles' District. The subsoil of every area intended for the erection of dwelling-houses thereon, should be properly drained before the buildings are begun. If the soil be clay, it should be burnt, and a layer laid down to improve the drainage, and purify foul waters. The entire site of every dwelling-house should be covered with concrete, Portland cement, or other impermeable material. The footings of every house should stand upon concrete. Every wall should have a damp-proof course of slate, asphalte, or otherwise. No staircase should be less than 3 feet wide, with proper openings for ventilation, and should be always external to the rooms. No habitable room should be less than 9 feet in height, or less than 150 feet superficial area. It should be provided with a window at least 16 square feet in size, and a fire-place. Every room in a basement, having an external wall and provided with a window and fire-place, should have an open area from 6 inches below the flooring along the whole length of the external wall, and at least 4 feet wide. The ceiling of such room should be at least twothirds of the height of the room above the top of the area wall, or surface of pavement of street. The surface of the said area should be covered with cement concrete. Every house intended for human habitation, unless every room can be lighted and ventilated from a street or open space, should have an 2 open space in the rear thereof of at least 150 square feet in area, and never less than 10 feet in width in any part. Such space to belong exclusively to the house. All block buildings, meaning, thereby, buildings intended for the occupation of numerous families, and more than 25 feet wide in their largest frontage, should have staircases and passages external to the walls of the house, to provide ready escape in case of fire, and to prevent the spread of disease. A suite of rooms in such houses intended for the occupation of a separate family should have no communication with other rooms; and each suite of rooms should be entered directly from the street or outer staircase. The houses and rooms should be so arranged that through ventilation is secured. In the case of block buildings, at least half of the superficial area should be left open for ventilation, and a space of at least 30 feet in depth should be left between the wall of each block, or of one block and of any other house, back and front. The water-closet, or other contrivance for the like purpose, should be always detached from the house, or so situated that there should be space for a current of air between the house and the closet. The water supply for drinking, cooking, etc., should be separate from the supply to the closet, and should be constant. No house-drain should be carried under the basement of a house, but have a fall to a sewer in the rear. The inverts of sewers should be made of Portland cement or of other impermeable substance. In all new neighbourhoods the paving of the roads and foot pavements should be completed before the houses are permitted to be occupied. No new house should be allowed to be occupied without a certificate from a Medical Officer of Health or a Surveyor, that the regulations have been complied with, and that it is fit for human habitation.
