ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO The Board of Works of the Lewisham District, FOR THE YEAR 1864, BY F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., M.R.C.S., L.A.C., Medical Officer o f Health for the Lewisham District; Medical Officer to North Surrey District School; Surgeon P Division of Police. Gentlemen, In accordance with the provisions of the 43rd Section of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 18G2 (25 and 26 Victoria, cap. 102), which enacts that "The Medical Officer of Health shall make an Annual Report to the District Hoard of the Sanitary condition of the District," &c. I present to you this my Report for the year ending December, 1864, former publications having consisted of monthly reports, together with tables of mortality for each year. The Lewisham District consists of the Parish of Lowisham and the Hamlet of Penge. The Statistical Reports as to Births and Deaths relate to certain divisions for the purpose of registration, entitled by the Registrar General sub-districts, and to each of which there is a Registrar of births and deaths.* Thus, according to the census of 1861, the population was as under, viz.— Blackheatli (a portion of the Lee sub-district in the parish of Lewisham) 4,841 Lewisham Village (sub-district) 7,372 Sydenham (sub-district) 10,595 Ilamlet of Penge (a portion of Croydon sub-district) 5,015 Total population of District 27,823 But as more than 3 years have elapsed since the census was taken, and the population has increased considerably during that time, in order to arrive at an approximate knowledge of the Birth and Death rate, the increase of population must be taken into account for that time ; I have therefore added to the known population of the different sub-districts a number equivalent to the rate of increase which was found *These sub-districts must not be confounded with the Wards, the population of which, according to the census of 1861, was:- Blackheath Ward 5,492; Lewisham Ward 8,994; Sydenham Ward 8,322; Hamlet of Penge 5015. Total population of district 27,823. 7 to have taken place between the census of 1851 and 1861, and which is, judging from the increase of the number of inhabited houses, within the mark. Thus Registrar's Sub-District Population Census. 18.51. Population Census. 1861. Rate of Increase per ann. Estimated Increase in 3 ½ years. Calculated Population. 1864.

Indeed, the mortality has not been so high since the influenza year of 1847 and the cholera years 1849 and 1854. The average rate of mortality for the whole of London having amounted to 26.35 per 1000, whilst the average from 1851 to 1861 was 23.6 per 1000. The highest average death rate of any of the Metropolitan Districts between 1851 and 1861 amounted to 28l8 per 1000, whilst the lowest average death rate in Great Britain between 1851 and 1861 occurred in the towns of Eastbourne, Glendale, and Rothbury, and numbered 15 per 1000. The average rate of mortality tor this District between the years 1851 and 1861 amounted to 16 8 per 1000, and was the lowest of any Metropolitan District savo one. But this year the Lewisham District contributed its quota to the increased rate of mortality of the Metropolis, although in one portion of the District the death rate was small. Thus, in Blackheath the deaths were at the rate of 15.28 to 1000. Lewisham (without Union Workhouse) 18 04 „ Sydenham 17.36 „ Penge 16.70 „ whilst for the whole District, including the Union Workhouse and Institutions, the mortality was at the rate of 18.70 to the 1000. The mortality tables appended, give a detailed account of the causes of death, and the different ages at which death took place in the District, classified according to the plan adopted by the Registrar General. From these tables I have made the following abstract. Thus 100 deaths took place from zymotic diseases, Out of which 8 died of small pox. 10 „ of measles. 36 ,, of scarlet fever. 10 „ from diptheria. 15 ,, from whooping cough. 19 ,, from typhus or typhoid fever. 7 „ from erysipelas. 29 ,, from diarrhœa. 9 111 deaths took place from constitutional diseases, Out of which 63 died of consumption of the lungs. ,, of other tubercular diseases. 235 deaths took place from local diseases, affecting the brain, lungs, heart, iutestines, &c., Out of which 84 died of inflammation of the lungs. 73 died of developmental diseases. 16 „ of violent deaths. 3 „ from causes not specified. 598 1 10 deaths took place in infants under 1. 126 ,, ,, between 1 and 10. 22 ,, „ between 10 and 20. 79 „ „ between 20 and 40. 93 „ „ between 40 and 60. 103 „ „ between 60 and 80. 35 „ „ above 80 years. 598 The Public Institutions which augment the population of the District, are The Royal Naval Asylum. The Watermens' and Lightermens' Asylum. The North Surrey District School. The Union Workhouse. The Royal Naval Asylum is a building erected and endowed at the expense of the late Dowager Queen Adelaide; it contains 12 well arranged houses for the accommodation of 12 ladies, being the widows or orphans of officers of the Royal Navy, and contains a population of about 40. It has a deep well upon the premises, but is also supplied with water from the Lambeth Company. It is drained into the sewer close adjacent. The Watermens' and Lightermens' Asylum consists of a large and well arranged building forming three sides of a square open to S.W. It contains 41 separate cottages for the accommodation of aged or infirm Watermen or Lightermen or their widows. Each cottage has a sitting-room, bed-room, kitchen, and a water-closet outside the house. 10 The inhabitants of the place number about 50, of which 39 are females. It is drained into a proper drain in the Penge Road. Supplied with water by the Lambeth Company, although 2 pumps exist upon the premises. The North Surrey District School at Anerley, Penge, is a well situated, well constructed, and well ventilated building, and except its Infirmary, which is not so well planned, is admirably adapted for its purposes. The building and grounds occupy 50 acres of land. The grounds slope gradually from the front of the building toward the South-east. The land is divided into garden ground, meadow, and arable land; and 18 cows, besides pigs and poultry, are kept upon the premises. The sewage from the whole building runs into deodorizing tanks from which the land is constantly irrigated, and the effect is greatly to augment the crops, and no unpleasant odour is observable from its use. The water supply is from a deep pump well, from whence an excellent supply of water is kept up by a steam engine. The building is lighted by gas made upon the premises. Upwards of 800 children (from the Parishes and Unions of Chelsea, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham, Richmond, St. Pancras, Wandsworth, and Clapham), are educated and trained to different occupations and trades. The boys, at the age of about 10, are employed and instructed, on alternate days, in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and as bakers, gardeners, engineers, gas makers, gas fitters, carpenters, painters, bricklayers, shoemakers, tailors, and a certain number are instructed in music, and taught to play upon brass instruments. The girls, after the age of 9, are instructed on alternate days in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in washing, needlework, dairy-work, and the general duties of domestic servants. Ophthalmia, a troublesome contagious disease of the eye, which has prejudicially affected many of the public institutions of this country, has also affected the children in this school; originating in accidental contagion, it rapidly spread amongst the children, so that 40 or more have been affected at one time. A large proportion of the children in this establishment are naturally of weak constitutions, sometimes arising from here- 11 ditary taint, and sometimes from exposure and want, consequently many, especially those recently admitted to the school, suffer for a time from diseases of the skin. But Ophthalmia quite took the place of skin disease. It was, doubtless, materially affected by atmospheric conditions, as many more children were admitted to the infirmary suffering from the disease when the wind blew from northerly and easterly quarters. It was seen to affect those children whose diet had been either insufficient or not sufficiently varied, or those children who had been exposed to draught or cold. I am happy to say that by separation, isolation, classification, by careful mcdical treatment, and an improved dietary scale, with extra allowance of meat and frequent fresh vegetables, the disease has diminished in severity and nearly disappeared. The average annual mortality in this institution for some years past has been 1 in 200, but 7 deaths have occurred in this establishment during the year. Children are admitted into the North Surrey District School at the ago of 2, and situations arc readily procured for them as soon as they arrive at the age of 1G. In addition to the children who are employed in trades and domestic occupations, all the boys who learn music, are applied for by the colonels of regiments for military bands. The Union Workhouse, situated in the village of Lewisham, is a quadrangular building open on one side to the south, with a well paved yard in the centre for exercise. It was originally two private dwelling houses, to which various additions have from time to time been made; and is now capable of accommodating 235 inmates. In addition to this there is a separate building about 100 yards from the main building containing wards for the reception of 1G infectious cases, allowing 500 cubic feet of air for each case. There are also yards for laundry and other work, and a good kitchen garden. The drainage of the house is into the main sewer. The water supply is from a well in the yard, and appears to be abundant and of good quality. The general wards are ventilated by windows facing each other and by ventilators in the walls and ceilings, and the appear to be sweet and free from draught. The Workhouse receives paupers from the parisncs of 12 Lewisham (including Sydenham) Lee Kidbrook Mottingham Charlton Eltliam Plum stead Comprising a population of 65,757 persons. The greatest number of inmates in the house at one time was 230, but 1,138 paupers passed through the house during the year. Scarcely any accommodation is provided for able-bodied persons, it being the object of the Guardians to make the Workhouse an Asylum for the sick and infirm; and work is provided for able-bodied men in the stone yard, &c., when out of employment. The establishment seems to be under good management, and the excellent Medical Officer, Mr. Stott, visits the wards daily (of course more frequently if necessary), and under his able superintendence the Workhouse partakes more of the character of a comfortable hospital. The mortality was large during the year, 46 deaths having been registered. But many of the cases when brought to the hospital were moribund, many hopeless, and others nearly worn out with old age. In reviewing the year 1864, we find that it was an exceptional year, and although this district has stood the test of comparison with other districts, it was, in common with them, a year of unusual sickness and mortality. Of this mortality much has arisen from causes which have been totally beyond the reach of human control. But the deaths from diseases of the epidemic class, or those which we believe may be prevented by attention to sanitary laws, have been much larger than they should have been. The mortality from this cause increased from 79 in 18G1, to 99 in 1862, to 126 in 1863, and 160 in 1864. I have in each monthly report particularly specified the locality in which deaths from this cause have occurred, and from this information it may be readily ascertained where the exact spots exist in which epidemic disease is likely to originate. I need only name two of the most patent instances which will be sufficient as an example. Out of 49 deaths from epidemic disease which have occurred in Sydenham during the past year, 17 have taken place in the Wells Road (in 13 which I am happy to say a new sewer is now constructed), and 10 in West Kent Park. Thus more than half of the entire number of deaths from this cause have occurred in the neighbourhood of two localities. Much h as been done by sanitary measures, frequent inspection of houses, &c., removal of nuisances, new drainage, and water supply, to render the district more healthy; but still, undoubtedly, as population increases, much more remains to be done; for the deaths from diseases of the epidemic class do not represent a tittle of the trouble, sorrow, and pauperism which is likely to result from sickness, and consequent privation, among the poorer class, and it is in localities which we know produce and foster disease and are foci of contagion for other Portions of the neighbourhood, that the force of the local authority is incessantly requisite to compel the provision of proper water supply, proper cleanliness, proper ventilation, and proper (well ventilated) drainage. In my first Report, published in 1856, I brought under the notice of the Board the general results which would take place from inattention to sanitary laws, such as want of light, want of ventilation, deficient or inferior supply of water; and this district, from its being spread over a large surface, points out perhaps more clearly than many others, the contrast between those parts which are well arranged, in a sanitary form of view, and those that are deficient in that respect; and as it is of the utmost importance fully to understand "what are the surrounding circumstances which add to or detract from the causes which shorten or prolong life," and what are the conditions especially necessary to ensure freedom from the epidemic class of disease which annually increases the mortality of every district, it will be desirable, after some years' experience, to consider a few points which are well known to bear upon the subject. The Water Supply of the district is derived from two sources; Blackheath and Lewisham being supplied by the Kent Water Works Company; Sydenham and Penge by the Lambeth Water Works Company. The Kent Water Works Company formerly derived their supply from the Ravensbourne river, but since the wholesale contamination of the river with sewage (which will be partly put a stop to by the new sewer), have been obliged to resort to artesian wells, which afford a considerable supply. The Lambeth Water Works Company obtain their supply from the Thames at Long Ditton. 14 Both these companies supply water upon the intermittent principle, necessitating the use of cisterns to store the water. Section 67, of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, enacts that a sufficient supply of water (not exceeding 30 gallons each person) shall be afforded to every house, and that if the water supply is not sufficient for the number of persons residing in the house (being more than one single family), proceedings may be taken as for overcrowding. Section 70 of the same Act also empowers any District Board to erect drinking fountains; and section 116 ot the original Act empowers District Boards to erect pumps for the gratuitous supply of water to the inhabitants. Examined at almost any season of the year the cisterns attached to many of the poorer class of houses contain water which is unfit for drinking. The cistern is placed over the water-closet. In many instances there is no cover, or the lid is removed, and the water is exposed to the sun's rays. The cistern is placed over the water-closet with (as I have seen sometimes the case) an untrapped waste pipe blowing sewer gas over the surface of the water. On the surface of the water may be seen green scum, the sides of the cistern covered with slime, and the bottom of the cistern loaded with mud, consisting of earthy and decomposing organic matter, and containing an abundant supply of dead and living animalcules, and in many cases no information can be obtained of their having been cleansed. Now, the connection between tainted water and cholera was fully established during the last epidemic; but although, except in epidemic times, we are not to look for such fatal results as then occurred; still, poisons of this kind contained in water are introduced into the system in such a subtle form, and in a condition which renders them so easily absorbed into the body, and in such an unobserved manner, that people are rendered ailing and miserable, and fit for the reception of any disorder; and it becomes an important duty to endeavour to get a supply as pure as possible. The only way in which to secure this effectually is by having a constant supply afforded without cisterns and with such apparatus (a spring tap would probably suffice), as would tend to prevent waste. This would not only improve the health but the morals of the people, as a supply of impure water tends to disgust the poorer class of people, and induces them to resort to less disagreeable beverages. Drinking fountains in various parts of the district, 15 ing pure filtered water, would also be a valuable addition to (the comfort and health of the inhabitants, especially in the summer time. Ventilation of Sewhus. The offensive smell from ventilating shafts in the roads, and from gullies when the water has escaped from the traps in dry weather, has been frequently a subject of complaint. This offensive smell would not be so much occasioned by fresh sewage, but in this district, like many other progressive districts, new sowers frequently receive the contents of old drains connected with cesspools or masses of putrefactive decomposition, and thence the effluvium is worse than it otherwise would be. Hut the ventilation of sewers is of the utmost importance to health. It has been proved (by Dr. Sanderson) that in the interior of houses where fires are kept, a continued diminution of the pressure of the atmosphere takes place, and there is a continual pouring into the house of sewer gas; the means of entry being through water-closets, waste pipes to cisterns, sinks, and drains in the house. The closing of ventilating shafts would therefore assist in forcing into houses a deadly supply of sewer gas, and would render the sewer unsafe for any workmen to enter it for the purposes of cleansing or repair. The means of remedying the offensive smell from these sewer openings or ventilating shafts, would be either by dry charcoal gratings, or by chimneys erected against some building and communicating with the sewer, and so high that the gases would be thrown out of reach, and oxidized by the atmosphere. But as impure air, like impure water, though sometimes slow (unless concentrated) is always certain in producing its pernicious effects, in my opinion no system of drainage can be perfect which admits the possibility of the entry of sewer gas into the house, and no house can be wholesome in which the entry of fresh air and the exit of foul air is not provided for. Sewer gas may enter dwelling houses in several ways, as before mentioned, viz., by water-closets and soil pipes, waste pipes to water cisterns which communicate with the closet pipe or with the sewer, by sinks, which are always msufficienty trapped, in which the trap is frequently removed, or by drain pipes under houses insufficiently cemented. 16 The drainage of houses appears to me to be faulty in principle. All these inconveniences might with small amount of cost be remedied, by cutting off all direct communication with the sewer. Thus— Let the water-closet be well trapped and in a well ventilated building, which may be connected with the house, but not within it. Do not allow the soil pipe to bo within the house; do not let the waste pipes from cisterns, or the pipes from sinks communicate directly with sewers or cesspools; these pipes should merely pass through the wall of the house, and have a free end hanging a few inches above a trapped gully outside tho house. By this arrangement many of the inconveniences of stopped drains would be avoided, and no sewer gas from this constant cause could enter the house. It appears to me always injudicious to place a drain within a dwelling-house, and I have from this cause seen pernicious effects to arise from the entry of sewer gas. If it is positively necessary to resort to this method of drainage, the pipes should be well cemented together, and carried at a sufficient depth in the earth; and to make this additionally secure, they should be ventilated by stack pipes or shafts outside the houso. The ventilation of houses is also of immense importance; no house should be so closed, either by day or night, as to exclude the ingress of fresh air or the egress of foul or used-up air, and no house can be wholesome in which this is not provided for. The decomposition of air by human beings in a closed room soon deteriorates the atmosphere, and renders it unfit for oxidizing and purifying the blood. This decomposition of air is increased enormously when gas is burned—one gas jet consumes as much oxygen as five human beings. The sitting rooms should have communication with the exterior air, when occupied in the day time, by means of a properly constructed ventilator; but it might be sufficient in this changeable climate to keep a landing window open, or have an open ventilator in the ceiling of the landing at night. Overcrowding. The only legal means for preventing overcrowding is by section 29 of Nuisances Removal Act, section 67 Metropolis 17 Local Management Act (referred to under head of Waters), and Lodging-house Act. Section 29 Nuisances Removal Act enacts, That whenever a house occupied by more than one family is so overcrowded as to be a nuisance or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, the local authority shall, upon the certificate of the Officer of Health, cause proceedings to be taken before the Justice, who are empowered to make such order as thev think fit, and to inflict a penalty, not exceeding 40s., upon the person permitting such overcrowding. Magistrates have decided in some cases that overcrowding exists where the amount of cubic space is less than 400 feet for each person. Hut these enactments must all fall short of the purpose, unless better accommodation is provided for the poor, as the scarcity and high rental of cottages almost necessitates overcrowding, which, although not so much felt in this neighbourhood as many others, still obtrudes itself upon our attention sometimes. No more benevolent proceeding, to improve the status of the mechanic and labouring man, to prevent degradation, and reduce sickness and mortality, could be undertaken, than that of providing house accommodation for the poorer class; and if a joint stock company could be formed in every town (under proper management) for the purpose of purchasing sufficient land upon which to erect small cottages for the poor, it would not only be a benevolent undertaking, but would prove remunerative. Bakehouses. During the year 1864 the Act for the Regulation of Bakehouses came into operation, since which the bakehouses of the district have been frequently examined, and most of them have been found to be in a clean state, and the regulations contained in the Act appear to be carried out. In two instances the proprietors have had to be cautioned, but exhibited a readiness to adopt the suggestions of the Inspector. Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses. The Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses of the District have also been inspected, and in one or two instances the licenses have been opposed, from the fact that they were erected in the midst of inhabited houses, and that they were not kept in a sufficiently clean state. With some exceptions in this district, the animals are 18 turned out to grass in the summer time, and brought up to the cowhouses in winter. But it is my opinion that cowhouses and slaughterhouses should not be allowed to bo erected in the midst of dwelling houses, as 1st, they must depreciate the value of property in their neighbourhood; 2nd, as a matter of course nuisances must arise, with ever so great attention to cleanliness, which are likely to be prejudicial to health. 3rd. The shutting up of cows continually, in many instances without light, and in a close locality, without sufficient supply of air, must be productive of disease in the animals, and entail consequent loss to the owner. Cowhouses should be placed in country fields alone, where the animals could have free fresh air and exercise, with an abundant supply of fresh food. This would make them more healthy, and would make milk a much more desirable beverage, and food for children and invalids, than a great deal of it is at the present day; and is most important, when it is considered how dependant infants and invalids arc upon this aliment. The only way of overcoming the slaughterhouse nuisance will be that of having public abattoirs erected out of reach of dwelling houses, where only animals can be killed and whence offal and filth can be frequently removed, under proper and constant supervision. Scavenger. No efficient system of scavengering is at present adopted in this district. It would, I think, greatly improve the cleanliness of the district, and at the same time conduce to the comfort and health of the inhabitants, if a scavenger were appointed to keep the roads and paths clean, and attend to the removal of dust and refuse of all kinds from houses.
