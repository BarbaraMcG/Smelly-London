REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR 1881-82, and REPORTS AP THE MEDICAL OFFICER, ANALYST, AND SURVEYOR; Also Accounts in Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board during the same period. Printed in accordance with, section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. In pursuance of the provisions of the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act, 1879, the Metropolitan Board of Works, in October last, issued notices requiring this Board to execute certain Flood-works for the protection of the district from inundations caused by the overflow of the River Thames, as shown upon the accompanying plans and sections; and, in compliance therewith, this Board has caused the following public landing stairs and places under its control to be raised to the required height—18 ft. above ordnance datum—at an estimated cost of £144, viz.: — Thames Floods. Bull Stairs. Clark's Alley. Old Barge House Stairs. Emerson Street. Marigold Alley. Rose Alley. Blackfriars Bridge Wharf. Horseshoe Alley. Pike Gardens. Bankend. Similar notices, with plans and sections, were about the same 4 time issued by the Metropolitan Board of Works, requiring private owners of riverside property in the District to raise the frontages of their several wharves and premises to a corresponding level. In most instances these notices were complied with immediately; in others the works were delayed for a considerable time; but all have now, it is believed, been carried out in accordance with the Metropolitan Board's requirements. Moveable slides, or dams, having in some cases been sanctioned for the convenience of wharfingers in loading and unloading goods, this Board, in January last, addressed a circular letter to the owners of the wharves in question, calling their attention to the danger to which the district will be exposed in the event of the same not being kept in working order, and ready for use at all times; it being the intention of the legislature that the barriers should always be kept in position, except when business, necessitating their removal, is actually being carried on. Neglect in this respect has, nevertheless, occurred; the parties have been summoned, and mitigated penalties inflicted, which it is hoped will operate as a caution. It is much to be regretted that the original application made by this Board to the Metropolitan Board for an Embankment was not complied with, and that that Board should have resorted to expedients for keeping out the tide which involve risk, are not of a permanent character, and require constant attention and supervision. Under these circumstances, this Board has thought it necessary to retain the inner defences, which on so many occasions have been efficacious in averting inundations, until such time, at least, as the new works shall have been tested and proved to be a sufficient safeguard. Schemes in Parliament. Parliamentary Plans and Books of Reference were, in November last, deposited with the Clerk of the Board in respect of the following projected new Railways, Widenings, and Extensions:— South Western and City Junction. Waterloo and City. South Eastern Railway (New Lines and Widenings). Ditto (various powers). The Board instructed Mr. J. H. Bukney, of No. 27, Borough High Street, Solicitor, to prepare and lodge petitions against the above (with the exception of the last-named, which will not 5 injuriously affect the District), in order to obtain the insertion of clauses for the protection of the interests of the District, and petitions were presented accordingly. The South "Western and City Junction, and Waterloo and City schemes, were shortly afterwards withdrawn by the promoters. The remaining one, that of the South Eastern Railway Company, for New Lines and Widenings, is being proceeded with. This Bill seeks for power, inter alia, to construct Railways known and described on the deposited plans, as Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4; the main portion (No. 1), about two miles in length, commencing at the Bricklayers' Arms Station, Old Kent Road. This Line, after passing through the Parishes of Bermondsey, Newington, and St. George-the-Martyr, will enter this District at the Parish boundary in Southwark Bridge Road, crossing that thoroughfare, Great Guildford Street, and Union Street, and terminate by a junction with the Charing Cross Line in the neighbourhood of Ewer Street. No. 2, a Branch Line, will commence at Red Cross Street and terminate by another junction with the Charing Cross Line at Worcester Street, crossing Union Street on its way. No. 3, a Branch Line to establish a connection with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, was rejected by the Official Referees, the preamble not having been proved. No. 4 will not affect this District. At the outset the promoters raised certain technical objections to the locus standi of the Board, and the case had to be argued before the Referees, Mr. Balfour Browne being the counsel retained on behalf of this Board, and resulted in the promoters being defeated, and the locus standi maintained. Shortly afterwards the Bill was considered by a select Committee of the House of Commons, Counsel again appearing in support of the Petition. Mr. Arnold Goodwin was called as a witness on behalf of the Board; Messrs. Back, Evans, and Sennett also attending for the purpose of giving evidence. Ultimately, after the most strenuous and persistent opposition on the part of the promoters to the introduction of the clauses sought for, and an effort on their part to divest this Board of its jurisdiction over Streets and Sewers in favour of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the following clauses were agreed to, and now stand as part of the Bill. 6 1. All widenings of existing bridges over any road or street to be of the same character as the existing bridges, and every new bridge over any road or street to be effected and carried out by means of iron girder bridges of a single span, and no part of the abutment or piers of any such bridge to encroach upon any road or street, or the footways thereof; and in each case there is to be a clear headway, not less than the headway shown in respect thereof upon the deposited plans and sections, for the entire width of the widened or new bridge, as the case may be. 2. Every widening of an existing bridge over any road or street, and every new bridge over any road or street, to be water tight, or as nearly so as practicable; and to be so constructed as to deaden, so far as is practicable, the sound of engines, carriages, and traffic passing over them. The faces of the abutments of the piers of the bridges to be constructed of such material as, failing agreement, shall be settled by arbitration. 3. The Company not to commence the construction of any of the before mentioned widenings or new bridges, nor break up or disturb any road, street, or place under the control or direction of the Board until they have given 21 days notice in writing of their intention to commence the same, specifying the nature of the ivork to be done, and the street intended to be broken up and disturbed, to the Surveyor of the Board ; nor until he shall have signified his approval of the same, unless he shall fail to signify such approval, &c. 4. The Company to comply with, and conform to all reasonable directions of such surveyors, in the execution, erection, and subsequent maintenance of the widenings, new bridges, and works connected there- with respectively. 5. The Company to repay to the Board the cost of any extra lamps, including the expense of lighting or maintaining the same, which may, in the opinion of the Board, be necessary for lighting any road or street crossed by such widenings or bridges respectively after the completion thereof; and to save harmless the Board against all and every expense to be occasioned thereby; and such work to be done to the reasonable satisfaction of the said Surveyor at the costs, charges, and expenses in all respects of the Company; and all costs, charges, and expenses which the Board may be put to by reason of the works of the 7 Company, whether in the execution of the works, the preparation or examination of plans or designs, or superintendence or otherwise, to he paid to the Board by the Company on demand. 6. The Company not to affix or exhibit, or authorise or permit the affixing or exhibition of any placard or advertisement to or upon the outside of any wall or other part of the railways and works by the Act authorised within the Metropolis, so as to be visible from the street, except such as shall be approved by the Clerk of the Board in writing, or as relate to the Company's railway, and their train, steamboat, or other service. 7. Any dispute or difference of opinion between the Company and the Board, touching the reasonableness of the requirements of any surveyor acting for the Board, to be referred to the arbitration of an engineer to be appointed by the Board of Trade. 8. Except as expressly enacted in the Act, nothing therein contained to extend, or be deemed or construed to extend, prejudice, diminish, alter, or take away any of the rights, powers, authorities, or privileges vested in the Board. An objectionable Clause in the Bill, empowering the Promoters to take such parts only of the Lands, Buildings, &c., in the District as might suit their convenience, contrary to the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, was, in consequence of this Board's opposition thereto, withdrawn. The Bill in its amended form has passed the House of Commons, and is now before the Lords. The South London Tramways Act, 1881, authorising various extensions of Tramways in South London (referred to in this Board's last Annual Report) has become Law, having received the Royal Assent on the 11th August, 1881. The works authorised by the Act which affect the St. Saviour's District are numbered 55, 56, 57, and 58, in the Parliamentary Plans and Books of Reference. Nos. 55 and 56 will pass along the Southwark Bridge Road, converge into a single line at Southwark Street, and terminate at a point chains to the north of Sumner Street. Nos. 57 and 58 will commence by a junction with the first-named, pass along the eastern portion of Southwark Street, converge into a single line near Red Cross Street, and terminate at a point chains eastward Street Tramways. 8 of that thoroughfare, near the pedestal lamp column at the Borough end of Southwark Street. Owing, however, to urgent representations made by this Board to the Company as to the obstruction, inconvenience, and danger which would result from the running of Tramcars so near the Borough High Street, particularly on market mornings, when the traffic to and from the Borough Market is very great, they have consented not to run them beyond the principal entrance to the Hop Exchange, except on Sundays and Public Holidays. The works are being proceeded with in the adjoining Parishes of Lambeth and St. George-the-Martyr, and will shortly be commenced in St. Saviour's, notice to that effect having been received in May last from the Engineer of the Company. Lighting. The Board has accepted an offer made by the South Metropolitan Gas Company to undertake the lighting of the public lamps in Southwark Street, which are now supplied by meter, upon the same terms as the other lamps, viz., £3 17s. per lamp per annum, subject to an abatement of 5 per cent. if paid within a month after Quarter Day. The present cost is somewhat in excess of that amount. The Company have announced a reduction in their charge for the erection of street lamps, from £3 to £2 17s. 6d. The Board has substituted one of Sugg's burners for the three lights on the standard column opposite the London and County Bank, Borough; and has placed a similar burner, and also one of Bray's, at the crossing in Southwark Street and Southwark Bridge Road, in order to test the comparative cost. The Anglo-American (Brush) Electric Light Company supplying the electric light on the central lamp column at the west end of Southwark Street have consented to reduce their charge for the same to £60 per annum, a sum equivalent to the cost of lighting the similar lamp at the east end with gas. Bed Cross Place. In conformity with an order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 23rd December last, the several houses and premises in the line of thoroughfare extending from Borough High Street to Red Cross Street, and known by the names of Red Cross 0 Court and Red Cross Square, in the Parishes of Saint George the Martyr and Saint Saviour, Southwark, have been re-numbered, and the whole line of thoroughfare has been named "Red Cross Place. S.E." 9 In June, 1881, application was made to the Board by Mr. Dunnage, Architect, on behalf of Mr. George Doo, for the consent of the Board to certain alterations in the frontage of Saint Mary Overy's Dock, and Saint Mary Overy's Wharf, towards Winchester Street, and for permission to close the ancient passage way leading from the Dock to Clink Street, as shown upon the plan which accompanied the application. After many conferences, and a great deal of negotiation with the parties, an arrangement was come to in August last whereby certain alterations in the Dock are to be carried out. Little Winchester Street is to be widened, and a new passage way 6 feet wide formed and dedicated to the public in lieu of the old one, which is to be abolished. For this purpose the consent of the Justices of the Peace for the Newington Division of the County of Surrey, and of the Vestry of Saint Saviour's, had also to be obtained, pursuant to section 84 of the Highway Act, 1835. Saint Mary Overy's Wharf and Dock. A new Drinking Fountain, of polished granite, has, with the consent of this Board, been erected by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in the Blackfriars Boad, opposite Christchurch, the former one having been destroyed. Drinking Fountain. A circular letter having been received from the Board of Works for the Westminster District, inviting this Board to send delegates to attend a conference on the subject of the proposed Municipal Government of London, the Board appointed Mr. Bideal, Mr. Sandeman, and Mr. Stafford, as delegates accordingly. Delegates. Contracts, in addition to those set forth in the audited list of Contracts on page 43, have lately been entered into by Mr. Edmund Beddin for Scavenging and Dusting for a period of three years from the 24th June instant, and for Watering during the years 1883-4-5, determinable by either party at the end of the first or second year of the said terms respectively on notice to that effect, the prices being as under: — Contracts.

W. H. ATKINS. Board Room, Emerson Street, Bankside, S.E. 24th June, 1882. 11 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have to night to read to you my twenty-sixth Annual Report, and in doing so, feel that before beginning I have two points to bring before your notice. The first one is, that I wish to express my gratitude to the members of the Board who, without feelings of indifference, listen patiently to a formal and perhaps dull report; a report of our proceedings in Sanitary works carried on in the parish which, when perhaps calculated month by month, are not great, but which nevertheless may amount to something important as we go on yearly. The second is, that in such reports repetition is inevitable, and should an account of the proceedings be monotonous, I trust it may be overlooked by the hope that the course we are pursuing is a safe and sure one, and that we can by our present works hand down to our descendants a condition of health and enjoyment which they will regard as the greatest blessing we could bestow on them. But we have meanwhile, in the vast and complicated measures of Sanitary reform, many obstacles which at times appear almost unsurmountable to contend with. As you know, there are multitudes of persons whose prejudices, ignorance, and neglect will be continually acting as impediments to the advancement and furtherance of our scientific Sanitary arrangements; and a more lamentable instance of these facts I cannot bring before your notice than the antagonism of a certain 12 part of the population to the compulsory operation of vaccination, who style themselves anti-vaccinationists. That Smallpox is one of the greatest scourges the human frame is subject to is undoubted, and that by the proper preventive measures of vaccination we can entirely alter the form of this disease, and defeat it of its deadliest effects, is by past experience proved by overwhelming evidence. In support of this evidence I would call your attention to the following statistics, these being only a few of a great number. In a severe epidemic of Smallpox which prevailed at Norwich in 1819, the annexed table shows the result: — Total number of persons in 112 infected households. Number. Cases of Smallpox. Deaths by Smallpox. 603 202 46 1. Protected by previous Smallpox 297 — — 2. Protected by vaccination 91 2 — 3. Unprotected 215 200 46 Similarly in the severe epidemic of 1828, at Marseilles, the number of cases and of deaths, and their relation to the vaccinated, non-vaccinated, and variolated masses of exposed population were stated as follows:— The first column of figures representing an estimate (which of course can only be approximative) made for the purpose by the Société Roy. de Médicine. Total number of persons at the ages (0 30) which were almost exclusively susceptible. Number. Cases of Smallpox. Deaths by Smallpox. 40,000 6,020 1,024 1. Protected by previous Smallpox 2,000 20 4 2. Protected by vaccination 30,000 2,000 20 3. Unprotected 8,000 4,000 1,000 13 So also in Copenhagen. Of 659 vaccinated persons who suffered in the Smallpox epidemics of 1823-7 only 5 died, being at the rate of 1 in 132; while of 176 non-vaccinated persons who caught the disease more than a fourth seem to have died; and similarly in the epidemics of 1828-30, and part of that of 1832-7, it seems that out of 228 unprotected patients 63 had died; but of 1,373 cases of post-vaccinal Smallpox only 14 were fatal. Dr. Kinnis, formerly Superintendent of Vaccination at Colombo, in his "Report on Smallpox as it appeared at Ceylon in 1833-4," and in an Appendix relating to observations made by Dr. Forbes in the epidemic of 1830, gives enumerations from which the annexed table is compiled. OCCURRENCE AND FATALITY OF SMALL POX:— Number of Cases. Number of Deaths. Percentage of Deaths. 1. In persons decidedly not vaccinated 351 146 41½ 2. In persons having no marks, or but unsatisfactory marks, of vaccination 199 52 26 1/10 3. In persons having satisfactory marks of vaccination 187 3 1 3/5 Observations, more or less to the same effect, have been made, I believe, in every country to which vaccination has been extended, and at every time when epidemic Smallpox has prevailed. Sometimes the difference has seemed less, sometimes more; but difference, and very great difference, in favour of vaccinated persons, as regards the severity of Smallpox, is made certain by the general and strong testimony of innumerable observers. This, however, is only a part of the case, and I venture especially to beg your attention to what remains, as it is of much administrative importance. When the above and similar statistics are seen in mass, it is merely noticed, that among a number of persons suffering from Smallpox, those who have previously been vaccinated incur much less risk than others. But when such a mass is dissected, there comes out as a second fact, that this lesser 14 risk of the vaccinated has a graduated scale of its own, and that among vaccinated persons infected with Smallpox the danger of the disease is chiefly determined by the badness and insufficiency of their vaccination. The establishment of this truth is the work of Mr. Marson, who for a great number of years was resident Surgeon of the London Smallpox Hospital, and who founds his conclusions on many thousands of cases. His conclusions are as follows:— That the fatality of Smallpox, when it attacks the unvaccinated, is 350 per thousand; that its fatality to such vaccinated persons as it infects is, taking them indiscriminately, 70 per thousand. But, distinguishing vaccinated persons into two classes, those (1) who have been vaccinated in the best known manner, and those (2) who have been badly vaccinated, the fatality of Smallpox, if it infects the former, will be 5 per thousand; if it infects the latter, 150 per thousand: that the risk of the one will be thirty times the risk of the other. Such, then, is the almost perfect security which well performed infantine vaccination confers against death by Smallpox. The number of cases of Smallpox in the district was 168; of these 92 were removed to the Hospitals at Stockwell, Deptford, Homerton, and Fulham; 9 were removed to the Highgate Hospital, and the expenses paid by your Board; 67 were treated at their homes. Those treated at home were in every practicable instance isolated, and, when necessary, nurses were provided by your order. In a number of cases I ordered every article of bedclothing to be destroyed, and in every such case fresh articles were immediately given. 1 say immediately, because it has come to my knowledge that complaints have been made of poor people being kept unprovided with bedclothing sometime after their own had been destroyed. In one case, where isolation was impossible, and where a number of children of different families inhabited the same house, I caused the healthy children to be vaccinated, and removed them into the country. Out of the 168 cases, 6 proved fatal in the district and 14 in the Hospitals. 15 Among the most important steps taken to arrest the disease were the following:— I inspected over 1,900 children at the various schools in the district, and found, that of this number 61 had never been vaccinated at all, 372 had evidences of insufficient protection by only having one or two very faint marks, whilst the remaining number were efficiently vaccinated. I gave the names and addresses of the unvaccinated children to the Vaccination Officer, and requested him to take steps to have them vaccinated immediately. Further, the Relieving Officers gave me immediate information of every case of infection that came under their notice, which enabled me to take such measures to prevent the spread of disease as I deemed necessary. In every instance all articles likely to contain or convey infection were thoroughly disinfected under the superintendence of your Inspector, as well as the rooms which had been inhabited by the sick. The number of deaths registered in Christchurch amounted to 347, in St. Saviour 290, making in all a total of 637. The number of births registered was 1,009, 475 occurring in Christchurch and 534 in St. Saviour. The total number of births registered in 1880 was 1,013, there being only a difference of 4 births in this year. The births were comprised in the following details:— Christchurch Males 243 Females 232 475 St. Saviour Males 256 Females 278 534 1,009 85 deaths occurred in Christchurch Workhouse; 74 of this number were deaths of people over 60 years of age, there being 69 between 60 and 80 years, 4 over 80 years, and 1 at the very advanced age of 105. 16 The following is a statement of all the deaths which occurred from various causes during the year:— DISEASES.

I have the satisfaction to report that the Lambeth Company have served notices on the owners and occupiers within a further division of our district for constant supply. This new division is the area bounded by lines drawn along the respective centres of the following places, viz.:— Southwards along Southwark Bridge Road as far as Great Suffolk Street, and both sides of Great Suffolk Street. Much of the water is rendered unfit for domestic purposes by being received in cisterns and butts which are in a disgusting and filthy condition. On examination, more or less organic deposit is apparent, and under the microscope the water is found to abound in infusorial life. A remedy for this state of things will be found in the establishment of the constant supply system, and the consequent abolition of these unfit receptacles. Gas Supply. Tho average of the observations made during the year gave an illuminating power equal to 16 sperm candles. The proportion of Ammonia has never reached the prescribed quantity of 2.5 grains for 100 cubic feet of Gas. Sulphuretted Hydrogen was never present. In directing your attention to the table of sanitary work, I venture to suggest that your commendation is particularly due to Mr. Buckworth, your Inspector, for the energy and perseverance ho has displayed in the discovery and abatement of nuisances, and my personal very sincere thanks, and the thanks of the Board, are due to the Sanitary Committee for their exertions during the past year. 19 Notices served and work done for the abatement of nuisances for the year 1881.

Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital Gentlemen, Sept. 26th, 1881. During the past quarter I have analysed twenty-eight articles of food. As a result of the analysis of eight samples of mornings' Mile, and eight of afternoons', I find those of the morning inferior to those of the afternoon. Three of the morning milks were adulterated with, respectively, 7, 14, and 24 per cent., but, as usual, the adulterant was only water. Of course, only water may mean irremediable mischief to the consumers. The admixture of so much London tap-water means simply the loss of so much money, and injury probably to the lives of infants; but the admixture of water even in small quantity, from an impure service in the country, may mean death. I would venture to repeat the caution I have given before, that with milk the chance of adulteration is so considerable, it is better always to boil it for the use of infants and young persons. If milk could be depended upon, there would be no need for the innumerable artificial drinks which are now before the Public; they are a new source of danger, as everything depends in the first place upon the purity of the water employed, and in the second upon the qualifications of the manufacturer. Milk is a nutritious drink, and contains the phosphates in assimilable condition. Would that the adulteration of milk were looked upon in its proper light, us distinctly criminal! 21 Three varieties of Condensed Milks have been examined. The cooking process through which they have passed renders them perfectly safe, and as long as they are kept up to the mark they must be considered valuable adjuncts. Oue sample of Bread gave all the indications of the presence of alum. On further analysis, I found, however, that the possible alum, judging from the alumina, amounted only to 3½ grains per 4-lb. loaf. The iron was double the ordinary quantity, and I have reason to believe that the indications with the logwood test were due to iron and not to alumina. Two Butters were found unadulterated. They were good indications of the fact which I have previously mentioned, that the genuine article always contains a considerable percentage of water, without which there is but little or no taste. The imitation butters are generally dry and sticky. To those who are interested, I may mention that I have analysed two Baking Powders and two Egg Powders. Both kinds answer the purpose for which they are intended. In the attempt to introduce nitrogen, as a substitute for eggs, No. 48 is far superior to No. 50. It should, however, be remembered, that their chief value is as substitutes for yeast. Considering the quantity recommended to be used, it would be leaning upon a broken reed to suppose them substitutes for eggs as to nutrition. One Pepper and one Mustard complete my list. The mustard was exceptionally good. Dec. 21st, 1881. During the past quarter I have examined eight samples of Milks. Four of these had been tampered with to the extent, respectively, of 5, 7, 9, and 22 per cent. of added water. In two instances the vendors have been warned, and one vendor has been prosecuted. Although this record is not good, yet does it contrast favourably with the past. In October, 1874, eight milks were taken by our former Inspector, Mr. Errington. Two of these were nearly up to the mark. One was skimmed, and the other five were adulterated with, respectively, 10, 28, 40, 41, and 44 per cent. of added 22 water. In the time corresponding, in the present year, only one in four was admixed, and then with 5 per cent. of added water. Later on, in the year 1874, six samples of Milk were taken. One was skimmed, and the other five admixed with, respectively, 10, 12, 12½, 15, and 21 per cent. of water. I have taken corresponding periods, as being more fair, by way of comparison. I have also analysed two Condensed Milks, and am glad to be able to record a distinct increase in the amount of butter. We have never found a condensed milk which contained less than the amount allowed by the standard of the Society of Public Analysts; nevertheless, the fact remains that all these condensed milks are, some more, some less, skimmed. In making this statement, I have nothing to recall in what I have said on former occasions. These condensed milks are a real boon to the Londoner, and as such should be thankfully received, and I have to report an improvement of a very satisfactory character since I have first known them. Of five Buttees, three were genuine according to the standard of Somerset House. Two were admixed with about 15 per cent. of fat other than butter-fat. Considering the quantity, the actual diminution in the percentage of water, and that the butters were pleasant to the taste, and rich in the volatile fatty acids, I have passed them. A sample of Laed, of excellent quality, has also been analysed. Four Beeads and two Floues do not call for notice. One bread, however, indicated the presence of alum, but this was not confirmed on further analysis. One Poetee was of fair quality: it only contained 36 2/5 grains of salt per gallon. Two Drugs complete my list. A sample of Sulphate of Quinine was of very good quality. I may mention that I have always found less water than is generally given in the analysis. The Glyceein had a density somewhat above that of the London Pharmacopoeia, and contained, therefore, a trifle less water. The sample was, however, not perfectly free from lead. 23 March 15th, 1882. During the quarter I have analysed thirty-one articles, and have been compelled to make duplicate analyses of thirteen, or forty-four in all. I had no intention of analysing so many Milks, but I found them so unsatisfactory, that I requested our Inspector to take five additional samples. I thought of a system of partial analysis, but these were so curious, that I was obliged to re-analyse four out of five. One was adulterated with 12 per cent., another with 24 per cent., a third with 8 per cent. of water. This last was a topskim, and contained 30 per cent. of cream and 8½ per cent. of fat. Another of the same batch was also a top-skim, but it was not in the least adulterated; and yet another a little watered, but otherwise passable. Besides these five, 11 other samples have been taken; of these, six were adulterated with, respectively, 9, 11, 5, 12, 8, and 9 per cent. of water. In one case we had a top-skim with 27 per cent. of cream, but in other respects of good quality. In another case, the amount of solids, not fat, was so large as to necessitate much additional trouble to the analyst; the result, however, was satisfactory. One Condensed Milk has been analysed, as it is advertised free from added sugar. The addition of sugar renders the condensed milks very unpalatable to some. I am, therefore, pleased to mention the fact, that this particular sample is perfectly free from sugar, or any other addition. It is so unusually rich, as to suggest that most condensed milks are somewhat skimmed. The concentration is as three to one, or three pints condensed into one pint. Of three Butters analysed, one was good, a second suspicious, and a third consisted of Butterine. Samples, respectively, of Oatmeal and of Coffee were very good. A Cacao sold as a mixture contained 40 per cent. of cacao. A Vinegar was of fair quality, and free from lead, but a sample of Pickled Onions contained a very distinct trace of Copper, suggestive of leaving the pickles in a brass or copper vessel overnight. The Ketchup was certainly made from mushrooms, and was of 24 9 very pleasant flavour; it was quite free from animal tissue, from lead, and from copper. Under the microscope, bacteria were seen to be very numerous, and suggestive of the advisability of heating before eating. Of Alcoholic Liquors, two Spirits and three Beers have been examined. The Gin was only a very little below par, and the Whiskey a very little above. The gin contained a very distinct trace of lead. As to the Beers, since the use of sugar has become so general, they have very much altered in character. One of them contained an inordinate quantity of chlorides, both as chloride of sodium (common salt) and chloride of potassium; the latter, probably, from the sugar employed. 22nd June, 1882. During the past quarter I have analysed twenty-nine articles of food, several of them in duplicate. There is a considerable improvement in the quality of Milks, as, indeed, one would expect in the spring quarter of the year. Only three were adulterated out of sixteen; two of them, however, very considerably with, respectively, 18 and 36 per cent. of water. A sample of Condensed Milk of very high quality has been analysed, and deserves attention. The same remark applies to an Essence of Cacao, which is everything that the name expresses. A Sugar and a Treacle were of excellent quality, clean and very free from the chlorides of sodium snd potassium. The treacle was much richer in sugar than is commonly the case, and was perfectly free from any metallic contamination. Two Coffees were genuine, and call for no further remark. The only fault attaching to a sample of Pickled Cabbage was its toughness. It contained a mere trace of lead, but no copper: generally a trace of the latter is met with. A Mushroom Ketchup well deserved its name, and had a powerful mushroom odour. The ash, as usual, consisted almost entirely of salt, which amounted to 8½ per cent. Five Ales have also been analysed. They vary very much in 25 quality, and in their keeping power. In the time that Nos. 28, 44, 46, and 47 kept well, No. 45 turned rapidly sour and mouldy. One reason was to hand: it contained less alcohol. The amount of extractive was far below that of the others. There has been no question as to salt, this being less than the admitted quantity. It would be well if those who drink beer would remember the amount of alcohol which the beers contain. Calculated as proof spirit, the beers brought by our Inspecter average 10 per cent., so that a man who drinks a pint of beer at a meal partakes of more than is good for his health, and a quantity absolutely injurious if taken on an empty stomach. My report will be seen to be far more satisfactory than that of last quarter. The Certificates are in the hand of the Inspector. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS.
