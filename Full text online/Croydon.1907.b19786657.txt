C KO HEALTH REPORT FOR 1907 of the Croydon Rural District by the Medical Officer of health. Submitted to the Council 6th February, 1908. Wallington : William Pile, Ltd., Printers, 19, Manor Road. Croydon Rural District Council. HEALTH REPORT FOR 1907. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my tenth Annual Report upon the Health and Sanitary condition of the District, Appended are the statistical tables, and the report on the working of the Factory and Workshops Act, in accordance with the requirements of the Home Office. The Death Rate is extremely low, being only 9.7; the Birth Rate is also low, being 24 6 per thousand of population. The year 1907, generally speaking, has been a fairly healthy one, with no very serious outbreaks of epidemic disease. It is with pleasure that I have again to place on record the kind help and assistance which I have received from the Council and all its officers with whom my work has brought me into contact. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, C. M. FEGEN. 6th February, 190S. CONTENTS. pages.

I.—AREA AND POPULATION. The District consists of nine parishes, and the total area is 22,766 acres. The largest Parish is Coulsdon, with 4,314 acres, and the smallest Wallington, with 823 acres. In the year 1901, at the time of the last Census, the population was 38,071, but omitting the three large institutions, viz.: — The Cane Hill Asylum, the Holborn Workhouse, and the Holborn Schools, the total population was 34,180, of which number 16,202 were males and 17,978 were females. At the middle of 1907, the population was estimated to have increased to 70,950, but omitting all institutions, the corrected number was 66,300, of which number 32,445 were males and 33,855 were females. The number of inhabitants in the three large institutions has increased from 2,468 in 1891 to 3,759 in 1907 ; this shows a decrease of 55 since the middle of 1906. The number of occupied houses in the District was : In 1881 3,730 „ 1891 4,845 „ 1900 6,597 „ 1901 7,027 „ 1902 7.694 „ 1903 8,316 „ 1904 9,421 „ 1905 10,493 „ 1906 11,614 „ 1907 13,086 8 This shows an increase of 9,356 in the number of houses occupied during the last 26 years, and in nearly every parish the supply is unequal to the demand. The subjoined table will show the number of houses in each parish in the years 1891, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, and also the increases between the years 1891 and 1903, 1903 and 1904, 1904 and 1905, 1905 and 1906, 1906 and 1907, and 1891 and 1907.

In the District generally the average number of parsons occupying each house in 1891 was 5.4, but at the census in 1901 it was found to have fallen to 4.8, while for 1907 it is estimated at 5.0. The average number of persons per inhabited house remains as a general rule fairly constant for each locality, 9 though varying considerably in different parishes according to the class of house erected. ]n many parts of the district "tenement" house or houses let in flats have been built, such houses of course having a considerably larger number of inmates. The natural increase during the year has been 986 more births than deaths. In 1897 the increase was 474 „ 1898 „ 392 „ 1899 „ 879 ,. 1900 ,, 460 „ 1901 „ 543 „ 1902 „ 552 „ 1903 „ 730 „ 1904 „ 763 „ 1905 „ 879 ., 1906 „ 921 „ 1907 „ 986 It has amounted to 9,7.41 since the census in 1891. The greatest excess of Births over Deaths in 1907 was at Mitcham with 430, Merton with 212, Beddington with 107, and Coulsdon with 94. Excess of Births over Deaths. Deaths in 1907. Births in 1907.

Births. The number of Births registered in the District was 1635, as compared with 1600 in 1906,1408 in 1905, 1284 in 1904, 1161 in 1903, and 976 in 1902. Of this, number 39 children were registered as being illegiti- mate. This gives an illegitimate birth-rate of 2.3 per cent, of total births. No. of Illegitimate Births. Percentage.

Exclusive of those Deaths which occurred in Public Institutions situated within the district, the deaths registered during the year numbered 649. This number includes those persons from within the district who died outside, either at the Workhouse, Workhouse Infirmary, or at the General Hospital at Croydon; the Surrey County Asylum at Brookwood ; the Cottage Hospital at Carshalton ; or the Council's Isolation Hospital at Beddington Corner. The number of these Deaths was 113. The mortality corresponds to a death rate of 9.7 per thousand of population, as against 11.3 in 1906, 9.6 in 1905, 11.0 in 1904, 10.4 in 1903, and 11.3 in 1902, and as against an average of 11.5 during the ten years 1906.1897. The death rate in England and Wales in 1907 was 15.0 per thousand, which was 0.4 per thousand above the rate in 1906, lower than the rate in any other year on record; compared with the average rate in the ten years 1897.1906, the death rate in 1907 shows a decrease of 1.7 per thousand. 12 Mortality.* Parish.

N.B.—The number of deaths occurring to non.residents in public institutions in the District in 1907 was 239. Mortality at Different Ages. Infantile Mortality.—The number of infants under the age of one year who died during 1907 was 170, as against 199 in 1906, 138 in 1905, 158 in 1904, 109 in 1903, and 106 in 1902,the infantile mortality rate, therefore, being 103 per thousand births, as against 124 in 1906, 98 in 1905, 123 in 1904, 94 in 1903, 108 in 1902, and an average of 117 in the ten years 1897 to l906. The deaths of children under the age of one year, numbering 170, gives a percentage rate of 26.1 of the deaths at all ages, as against 293 in 1906, 26.0 in 1905 29 3 in 1904, 25.5 in 1903, and 25.0 in 1902. The rate of Mortality in England and Wales among infants under one year of age to 1000 registered births, was 118, which is 14 per 1000 below the rate in 1906. The rate in 1907 was lower than the rate in any other year on record. 13 The deaths of children between the ages of one and five years, numbering 70, gives a percentage of 10.7 of total deaths, as against 12.9 in 1906, 7.7 in 1905, 8.0 in 1904, 6.7 in 1903, and 9.2 in 1902. The deaths occurring in persons over 65 years of age, numbering 149, give a percentage of 22.9 of total deaths, as against 21.5 in 1906, 27.4 in 1905, 22.8 in 1904, 28 3 in 1903, and 27.5 in 1902.

Typhoid (or Enteric) and Puerperal Fevers. During the year 1907 the deaths from these complaints numbered 109, the Zymotic Death Hate therefore, being 1.6 per 1,000 of population, as compared with 1.7 in 1906, 0.9 in 1905, 1.5 in 1904, 1.7 in 1903, and 1.04 in 1902. The deaths from Phthisis numbered 51, as against 42 last year, 38 in 1905, 37 in 1904, and 33 in 1903, The Phthisical Death Rate is, therefore, 0.7 per thousand of the population, as against 0.7 in 1906, 0 6 in 1905, 07 in 1904, and 0.8 in 1903. The deaths from Pulmonary Diseases numbered 97, as against 88 last year, 84 in 1905, 126 in 1994, and 61 in 1903. This gives a Death Rate of l.4, as against 1.4 in 1906, 1.5 in 1905, 2.6 in 1904, and 1.4 in 1903. The deaths from Influenza numbered 14 as against 8 last year, 7 in 1905, 10 in 1904, and 8 in 1902. This gives a Death Rate of 0.2 per thousand of population, as against 0.1 last year, 0.2 in 1905, 0.2 in 1904, and 0.14 in 1903. To various forms of violence, whether self-inflicted ar otherwise, 21 deaths were due, in all of which cases inquests were held. This gives a death Rate of 0.3, as against. 0.3 in 1906, 0.2 in 1905, 0.48 in 1904, and 0.5 in 1903. 15 Birth Hate, Death Rate, and Analysis of Mortality in the year 1907.

These deaths included :— 26 from Phthisis. 17 ,, Cancer (malignant disease). 35 ,, Lung Complaints. 29 „ Heart Diseases. 88 ,, Brain Diseases. III.—INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act has been in force in this District since the year 1890. In July of that year Measles was also included in the list of notifiable diseases, and in the summer of 1894, it was considered necessary that Diarrhoea should, for a short period, also be considered a notifiable desease. Owing 16 to the epidemic of Small Pox that existed in and around London, as well as the Croydon Rural District, during the latter part of 1901 and the beginning of 1902, Chicken Pox was also made a Notifiable Disease, and continued to be so until the end of July, 1903. It was of great assistance in combating the outbreak of Small Pox. The Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act is also in force in this District. During the year 917 cases of Infectious Disease were either notified to the Sanitary Department or came to its knowledge through the vigilance of its Inspectors. Of this number 326 were due to Measles. Consequently, excluding this disease, there were 591 cases of other Notifiable Diseases, as against 439 in 1906, 397 in 1905, 333 in 1904, 227 in 1903, and 321 in 1902. Reference to Table III. at the end of the report will show:— Firstly, cases notified in the whole District, with the ages of incidence and the nature of the Infectious Disease. Secondly, the total number of cases (and nature of the disease) in each locality. Thirdly, the number of cases removed from each locality to the Isolation Hospital. Infantile Summer Diarrhœa. During the year 40 deaths occurred from this disease, as compared with 18 in 1902, 28 in 1903, 39 in 1904, 24 in 1905, and 71 in 1906. Reference to Table 17 XIII. in the appendix will show the circumstances, feeding, and family history of the victims to this, to some large extent, preventable disease in 1907, and Table XIV. the parishes and roads (or streets) invaded during the past seven years. Scarlet Fever. During the year 317 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, and the largest number coming from Coulsdon. This is 128 more cases than in the previous year, but out of this number the disease had a fatal ending in only seven cases. One hundred and eighty six cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital. Diphtheria. During 1907, 190 cases of Diphtheria were notified, as against 161 in 1906, and 134 in 1905. One hundred and twenty-four of these cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital. There were 24 deaths, nine of which occurred in cases not removed to the Hospital. Typhoid Fever. During the year 15 cases of Typhoid Fever were notified, as against 33 in 1906, and 18 cases in 1905. Eleven of these cases were removed to the Hospital. Of the 15 cases the disease had a fatal ending in 3 cases. Phthisis. During the year 51 deaths occurred from Phthisis, as against 42 in 1906, 38 in 1905, and 37 in 1904. This increase is perhaps not excessive if the large growth of the district be taken in consideration. 18 During the year I have examined the sputum of 97 persons, with a positive result in 57 cases. In all 114 such examinations were made. Disinfection (repeated in several instances) has again been largely carried out in the rooms occupied by Phthisical persons, and the clothing, &c., has been systematically dealt with at the Council's Disinfecting Station. 1V.—PREVENTIVE MEASURES: During the year 374 patients were admitted to the Isolation Hospital at Beddington Corner, including 43 patients from neighbouring authorities. The usual routine preventive and precautionary measures have been continued as in previous years to check the extension of infectious disease with most satisfactory results. Isolation, disinfection and quarantine have been carried out under the careful and intelligent supervision of the Sanitary Staff, and outbreaks of infectious disease have been very materially limited. Unrecognised cases as in previous years have been the origin of most outbreaks, and such unrecognised cases are always likely to exist in all diseases, especially if the attack is a very mild type, so mild indeed are some of these cases that the advice of a medical man is, by the parents of the patients, considered superfluous. These, unfortunately, are the cases which prove the nuclei of almost every epidemic. Immediately on notificAation being received of the existence of cases of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, and Small Pox, it is the custom to offer hospital 19 treatment, and, if the offer is accepted, the patient is at once removed to the Hospital; in no case should longer than two hours elapse after receiving the intimation of the existence of infectious disease in any house before the patient, if for removal, is in the Hospital, unless the ambulance is in use removing another case, when removal may be delayed considerably. Any delay is to be deprecated in all cases of diphtheria. In all cases of Typhoid Fever which are not admitted to the Hospital, sanitary pails, of a special character, furnished with air-tight screw lids, are left at the infected houses for the reception of all excreta and other waste products of the sick room. These pails are collected daily, and their contents are dealt with in the destructor at the Hospital. In every case of Notifiable Disease enquiries are made and recorded as to the number of persons in the house, where they are employed, milk supply, water supply, laundry, conditions of drains, etc., together with the history of the case and the probable cause of infection. Notice is at once sent to any school attended by children from infected houses, and these children are then excluded from school on my certificate, and are not allowed to return until due notice has been given to the school authorities of their freedom from possible infection. Disinfection of infected rooms is carried out by fumigation with sulphur dioxide or formic aldehyde, and of the bedding and the clothes in the steam disinfector at the disinfecting station at the Isolation Hospital. Disinfectants are supplied free of charge during illness. 20 After the rooms have been disinfected the owners of the premises are required to strip and whitewash the ceilings and walls, under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors. This applies to all cases of Infectious Disease, and in the event of cases of Phthisis or Cancer occurring, on request, the rooms, as well as the bedding, clothing, etc., are from time to time disinfected. During the year 404 houses and 10,451 articles were disinfected. The Council places at the disposal of all medical practitioners, free of charge, means of having the diagnosis of all cases of infectious or contagious disease confirmed or otherwise by bacteriological examination, and also, at the end of the illness, for determining whether the patient is free from the specific bacterium or not. During the year 1,011 such examinations have been made. While with regard to Diphtheria it is the custom to consider each case infective until the bacteriological examination shows the throat to be free from the true or pseudo-diphtheritic bacillus. Y.—ISOLATION HOSPITAL. The Isolation Hospital at Beddington Corner was opened at the beginning of March, 1899, and since that date 1,954 patients have been admitted. Accommodation.—The Isolation Hospital was opened to provide accommodation for 28 patients, namely 10 beds for Scarlet Fever cases, 10 beds for Diphtheria cases, 4 beds for Typhoid Fever cases, and 4 beds for doubtful cases. However, almost from its earliest days the accommodation proved unequal to the demand. 21 In 1904, a contract was entered into by the Council to considerably extend the accommodation at the Hospital, and in June 1905, an additional Scarlet Fever pavilion was completed, and has practically been full since. Staff.—The Staff consists of— 1 Matron 1 Assistant Matron 9 Nurses 1 Probationer Nurse 2 Laundresses 2 Engineers 5 Servants 5 Wardmaids. 1 Seamstress. 1 Gardener Porter and Portress During the year 374 patients have been admitted, of which number 228 were suffering from Scarlet Fever 125 ,, Diphtheria 11 ,, Typhoid Fever 2 ,, Puerperal Fever 8 „ Cerebro-spinal Meningitis 1 ,, Typhus Fever 4 ,, Erysipelas Forty-three patients were admitted by arrangement with other authorities. Thirty patients died. Nine from Scarlet Fevert fifteen from Diphtheria, two from Typhoid Fever, two from Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, one from Puerperal Fever, and one from Typhus Fever. The throat and nasal passages of every patient admitted to your hospital were examined, and it was found that out of the 353 cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria admitted, 201 had enlarged tonsils, 57 had adenoid growths, 11 had nasal polypi, 43 had had previous 22 attacks of tonsilitis, 5 Scarlet Fever, and 4 Diphtheria had had a previous attack of the disease for which they were admitted, and 47 cases were found to be suffering from both Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. During the year, after admission to the Scarlet Fever wards, it was found that in several cases Whooping cough, measles, chicken pox, and ringworm were coincident complications of the disease. Every case is regarded as being infectious so long as any congestion of the throat or fauces existed, or where there was any cough or any discharge from either the ears or nose, or when any sore existed, and until these troubles had entirely disappeared no patient is discharged from the Hospital, thus minimising to a large extent the always possible risk of the occurence of " Return Cases." Very instructive information has been obtained with reference to the prolongation of the infection in cases of Diphtheria. It has been found that where the bacillus of Diphtheria exists for a long time after the recovery of the patient, it has in every case been associated with the existence of decayed teeth, and in many cases where such decayed teeth have been removed, the bacillus of Diphtheria has very rapidly disappeared from the throat. It has also been noted that in practically 95 per cent of the cases of Diphtheria, decayed teeth have been found. 23 Parish. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Typhoid Fever. Puerperal Fever.

Water Courses.—The condition of all water courses is under the constant supervision of your officers, and material improvements have been effected and maintained. House Refuse Collection.—The collection of house refuse has been largely extended during the year, and except in the very rural portions, no part of the district is now without frequent and adequate collection. Nuisances have from time to time been dealt with with regard to the deposits made in this district of house refuse, which is brought in, both by road and rail, from the Metropolis. Legal Proceedings.—In the following cases legal proceedings were taken:— Particulars. Result. For depositing house refuse so as to be a nuisance. Case sub judice. For depositing house refuse so as to be a nuisance. Case sub judice. Summons issued in respect of a nuisance. Summons withdrawn, nuisance abated. For depositing house refuse so as to be a nuisance. Case sub judice. For being in possession of diseased meat. Defendant committed to prison for one month. REGULATED TRADES. (1) Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. There were 111 premises registered under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order at the end of the year. This is 4 more than the previous year. 25 During the year a very considerable amount of attention was paid to all dairies, cowsheds, milkshops, and the milk supply generally in the district. As milk is the staple food for all children and most invalids it is absolutely essential that the milk should be from healthy cows kept in an healthy and natural manner, and that no preservatives whatever should be used. (2) Slaughterhouses. There are 21 slaughterhouses in the district, all of which are regulated by the bye-laws of the Council. They have received very full attention from your officers. (3) Bakehouses. There are 38 bakehouses in the District. This is 2 more than the previous year. (4) Piggeries. There are 50 piggeries in the district, and as is usual with the hot weather, came several complaints of the piggeries, more particularly in Eastfields, Mitchain. All the piggeries are receiving special attention from your officers. Parish. Dairies. Cowsheds. Milkshops. Butcher's Shops. Slaughterhouses. Piggeries. Bakehouses. Total.

SANITARY SURVEYOR'S DEPARTMENT. I am indebted to Mr. Chart for the subjoined information:— The Sewage Disposal Works have demanded very great attention during the year. The Council has, on the suggestion of the Surveyor, determined to set aside annually a sum of £750 for further increasing the area of the contact beds. Extensions of sewers have been made at Sandy Lane and Smithambottom Lane, Beddington, and Riddlesdown Road, Coulsdon. A scheme has been prepared for the sewerage of the district known as West Barnes, comprising about 280 acres of land, which is incapable of being Sewered by gravitation to the existing low level sewer at Merton a provisional agreement for the acquisition of a site for a pumping station has been entered into and the owners of the estates have agreed to contribute about two-thirds of the cost. The sewage will be lifted from a sump about 30 feet below the surface by duplicate Worthington pumps driven by electric motors. New Streets and Buildings. During the year the Council have had plans deposited for the laying out of 15 new streets, and for the erection of 1,098 buildings in the District. 27 The following New Streets have been made up under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Private Streets Works Act, 1892 :— Beddington—Plough Lane, Woodcote Valley Road. Coulsdon—Fairdene Road, Red Down Road. Merton—Grand Drive, Edna Road, Quintin Avenue. Mitcham—Caithness Road. Sanderstead—Edgar Road, Kendall Avenue. Wallington—Avenue Road, Grosvenor Gardens, Grosvenor Road, Marchmont Road, Stanley Gardens, Oxford Road. The Croydon Borough Tramways, which have their southern terminus at Purley, convey large number of holiday seekers to this point, and it has been found necessary to construct a new Sanitary Convenience for both sexes. After much trouble and negociaticn the Council have acquired a site, and the new Convenience, providing 17 urinals and 2 W.C's. for men and 6 W.C's. for women, with lavatories and caretaker's apartment, will shortly be opened. VII.—INSPECTORS' WORK. Subjoined appears a summary of the Inspectors work during the past year. It will be seen that no less than 10,469 visits have been paid by them, as against 9,660 in 1906, 8,905 in 1905, 7,904 in 1904, 8.083 in 1903, 9,244 in 1902. I have again to bear testimony to the extreme care and accuracy, and the unceasing vigilance which each Inspector displays in the carrying out of his arduous and very often extremely unpleasant duties. 28 Summary of Inspectors' Work for the Year 1907.

The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10, and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in Public Institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in Public Institutions elsewhere. The "Public institutions" to be taken into account for the purposes of these Tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses and lunatic asylums. A list of the institutions in respect of the deaths in which corrections have been made should be given on the back of this Table.

Block 1 may, if desired, be used for the whole district: and blocks 2, 3, ire., for the several localities. In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (b) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub.columns c of this table, and those of non.residents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table I. as to meaning of terms "resident" and "non.resident.") (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions, whether within or without the district, are to be allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables I. and IV.; thus the totals of sub.columnsa, b, and c should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12 respectively, Table I. the gross total of the sub.columns c should agree with the total of column 2 in Table IV., and the gross total of sub.columns d with the total of column 3 in Table IV. 33 TABLE III.—Cases of Infectious Disease notified during the year 1907.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. †The figures required in column 2 and 3 are the total number of lists received from employers who sent them both in February and August as required by the Act and of the entries of names of outworkers on those lists. They will, therefore, usually be double of the number of such employers and (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August list of the same employer the same outworkers name will often be repeated. 57 Parish.
