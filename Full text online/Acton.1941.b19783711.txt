ACT 44 Borough of Acton , ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health together with the Report on the Medical \ Inspection of Schools FOR THE YEAR 1941 annual report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1941. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the annual report on the health of the Borough for the year 1941. The report of the School Medical Service is given at the end as a separate report. This year's annual report is curtailed, as requested by the Ministry of Health, and contains only the essential information with regard to statistics and general work of the Health department. The statistics for the Borough show that the birth rate per thousand of the population is 14.4 as compared with 14.0 in 1940. The death rate for 1941 is 12.5 as compared with 14.7 for 1940. The infantile mortality rate of children under one year is 47.8 as compared with 58.3 in 1940. In 1940 the death rate of maternal cases was 2.6 as compared with 2.9 in 1941. Actually there were the same number of cases in both year but the Registrar General estimates the population of action lawer than in 1940 and thus, the death rate is higher this year. During 1941, although the birth rate has only increased slightly, It would appear that by the large number of expectant mothers attending the ante-natal clinics, that the expectant mother is making a free use of the clinics. 4 As regards the notification of infectious diseases in the Borough, there were over 500 cases notified. The majority of these cases were attributed to measles and whooping cough, scarlet fever and diphtheria being very low during the year. I feel that the Council may congratulate themselves that there has been no large major epidemic during the year having regard to the fact that for a considerable part of the year one of the large sewers in the town was under repair. Under the conditions in which we now live, when our water supply or sewerage sytsem may be disrupted, all precautions have to be taken to prevent epidemics developing, it is very fortunate that there have been no cases of enteric fever during the year. Of the minor infectious and contagious diseases, and with regard to their seriousness on health, scabies appears to be definitely on the increase and every endeavour has been made to treat people who are known to be suffering from this unpleasant ailment. For some years now, scabies has been on the increase in this Borough, and when people were living in shelters it was not surprising that under the close conditions in which they lived with their fellow people, that one case of scabies could infect others. Although no case was traced in Acton to this cause, it was necessary to take all precautions to prevent an increase in scabies, by canying out a thorough treatment of any person known to be suffering from this complaint. Civil Defence still plays an important part in the work of the Borough, and every endeavour is made for the personnel to be housed at their Depots in a reasonable state of comfort. I still feel that it is my duty to inform you of the satisfactory manner in which the Civil Defence Casualty Services have been trained and their knowledge maintained by various tests that are being carried out. During this year a First Aid Party competition was arranged for the members of Stretcher Party Service and those of you who witnessed this competition will well remember the smart and efficient way in which the teams in the finals carried out first aid work set for them in the competition. I feel that the Casualty Service have carried out their duties, however trying and tedious, in a manner as fine as in 1940. I should like to thank the Staff of the Public Health Department for their kind co-operation and loyalty throughout the year. I remain, Your Obedient Servant, GEORGE E. B. PAYNE. STAFF. George E. B.

Laboratory Facilities. At the laboratory in the Town Hall examinations of cultures are carried out for the presence of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and sputa are examined for the presence of Tubercle Bacilli. Other specimens requiring examination are sent to the Emergency Medical Service Laboratory at Ealing. Ambulance Facilities. The Acton and Wembley Joint Hospital Committee possesses an Ambulance for the removal of infectious cases from the Acton and Wembley areas. Two ambulances are maintained at the Fire Station for accident and non-infectious cases. Nursing in the Home. The same arrangements are in existence as in previous years and during the year three hundred and four sick persons were nursed and 10,798 visits made. Hospital Provision. The Isolation Hospital is now managed by the Acton and Wembley Joint Hospital Committee. The Acton Voluntary Hospital is still admitting cases. Maternity and Child Welfare. The attendances at both the child welfare and ante natal clinics are well maintained. The National Milk Scheme has now been in operation for a year and by this arrangement every child under five can receive a pint of fresh milk each day. In certain circumstances on the recommendation of the Doctor or Medical Officer of a Welfare Clinic, the child may receive National Dried Milk in place of fresh milk. There are two grades of National Dried Milk—full cream and half cream, both of which are suitable for children under one year of age. The amount of proprietary dried milk sold by the Maternity and Child Welfare Department to Mothers, was 8,131 lbs. One would have expected that this sale of milk would have dropped in the advent of the National Milk Scheme, but for some reason, which at present it is very difficult to explain, the drop has not been so much as was at 9 first expected. I think, however, that one explanation is that Mothers are feeding their children artificially rather than by breast feeding, partly because owing to economic conditions, e.g., a Mother who has a young child and her husband in the forces, is necessarily forced to find work in order to keep herself and her child, as she is unable to manage adequately on the allotment made, so consequently she is unable to feed her child naturally herself as she must be away working as soon as possible and thus she feeds her child artificially because some friend or neighbour is able to look after the child while she is at work. Many of the Mothers do not seem to take kindly to the National Dried Milk and prefer to pay for the proprietary dried foods on which their other children have been reared. The number of mothers availing themselves of the use of the ante-natal clinic will necessitate the appointment of an extra health visitor. Maternal Mortality. There were two maternal deaths during the year, the first case was due to shock following acute post partum inversion of the uterus, and occurred in an institution outside the Borough; the other death occurred in the Acton Hospital, and was due to the pulmonary embolism associated with subinvolution of the uterus due to retention of part of the placenta. This patient attended the ante-natal clinic once only and neglected to carry out what advice was given. Infantile Mortality. There were 31 deaths occurring in children under one year, giving an infantile mortality figure of 47.8, as compared with 58.3 per 1,000 in 1940. The mortality rate for illegitimate children is 90.9 per thousand. Day Nursery. The Day Nursery in Bollo Bridge Road was re-opened in April of this year, the Matron and Assistant Matron were transferred from "Aigburth," Woking, to Acton and re-established the Day Nursery. The number of staff has been increased and staff rooms improved in order to provide additional facilities for the staff. The permission of the Committee has been obtained to instal a refrigerator and this is an added amenity to the Nursery. The number of children using the Nursery is about 28 to 30 per day. The total yearly attendances were 4,826. During this period there were 208 half-days and 4,618 whole day attendances. 10 During the early part of the year it was ascertained there was a need for a war-time day nursery in the Horn Lane area. After considerable difficulty, premises were found to which, although not by any means ideal, the Ministry's approval was given for the plans. The work necessitated much renovation of the premises. The nurseryconsists of a block of four two-storied houses in Horn Lane and when completed, will Serve a very useful purpose in this area. Unfortunately, these premises will not be ready for occupation until the early part of Further sites for war-time nurseries have been considered and St. Dunstan's Vicarage in East Acton has been approved by the Ministry as a site, and the plans have been submitted to the Ministry for approval. The Committee also approved the Priory Club premises as a day nursery and plans will be prepared for submission to the Ministry. At the request of the Committee, suitable premises in South Acton are to be found, plans of which will be drawn up when a suitable site has been approved by the Committee. Nurse Children. The number of foster mothers on the register in 1941 looking after nurse children was 17. Owing to so many female persons working, it is difficult to find enough foster mothers for these children.

During the year under review, there were notified 505 cases of infectious diseases. Of this number, 234 and 107 were attributed to Measles and Pertussis respectively; and of the remaining 164, 79 Were due to Pulmonary and 10 were notified as non-pulmonary tuberculosis; and 32 were due to pneumonia. Twelve cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, and 6 cases of Diphtheria were treated in the Isolation Hospital. There were no deaths caused by Scarlet Fever, but 2 children Succumbed from Diphtheria. Neither had been immunised against Diphtheria and in both cases the parents did not call for medical aid until the child was "in extremis." In all, 13 cases were admitted to the Isolation Hospital as Suffering from Diphtheria, but actually of this number only 3 Suffered from Diphtheria of the throat and as mentioned above, two died. One other child was admitted as a nasal carrier and the remainder admitted to the hospital were not diagnosed as suffering from Diphtheria, although the doctor seeing the case Considered than clinically Diphtheria. Every endeavour has been made by the use of films, articles in the Press, and circularizing the parents at regular intervals, to induce them to permit their children to be immunised against Diphtheria. During the year, 405 children under 5 and 192 school children were immunised against Diphtheria. The regulations requiring Measles and Pertussis Id be notified have now been in existence since 1940 but it has taken nearly a year for the medical practitioners to be educated to notify the cases in has been necessary to remind the doctors on several occasions and the result has been that 234 cases of Measles and 107 of Pertussis were notified during 1941 as compared with 28 and 4 respectively in 1940. 12 For some years now it has been the practice to recommend parents that if their young children have not had whooping cough, the child be immunised by a suitable vaccine against the disease. It is considered that immunity may last only a relatively short time, but this time is, in our opinion, of sufficient length to tide the young child over a period of months until such time as the epidemic has abated or the child has been removed from the area of infectivity. There were 432 cases immunised against pertussis, and by reference to the persons notified and the list of those known to be immunised, only 6 were found to have contracted the disease. There were 2 deaths of children under five from pertussis, one was due to pertussis and bronchitis, and the other due to the strain of coughing, for a blood vessel was ruptured in the brain. This latter case shows the seriousness of the disease, and suggests that if whooping cough could be prevented by inoculation, then in our opinion, every endeavour should be made to further this principle, for it is generally accepted by the medical profession that the sequelae of both Measles and Whooping Cough give rise to more subsequent ill-health and weaknesses than any other of the so-called childish ailments. There were 2 deaths due to Measles during the year. The procedure of preventing measles by a serum has been used in hospital but it is not yet a practical proposition for large numbers. There were 11 cases of Meningitis during the year and 2 of this number succumbed to the disease. During the year the treatment of this type of case has been completely revolutionised by the use of the sulphonalamide group cf drugs which have been employed so successfully in the treatment of pneumonia. There were 79 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and 10 of nonpulmonaiy, notified during the year. Considerable publicity has been given to this disease of recent months for statements have been made that tuberculosis is on the increase. While this is true in certain areas, figures for the year 1940 show that the number of cases notified were 78 pulmonary and 10 non-pulmonary, a total of 88 as compared with 89 for 1941. Scabies still continues to be on the increase for there were 155 treated in 1941, as compared with 63 cases treated in 1940. The Public Health Committee are giving this matter their consideration and it is to be hoped that further facilities can be obtained for treating these cases within the Borough. I think that these figures shown in the Table and quoted in the report of infectious disease on analysis are not adverse, having regard to the fact that a certain sewer was out of action for a greater part of the year, for there have been no large outbreaks of infectious diseases of the enteric fever or dysentery type. 13 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 1941.

Since the passing of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, a registered medical practitioner must notify cases he suspects of suffering from food poisoning. There were 4 cases notified during 1941. Of these cases, 3 were on investigation found to be probably due to the eating of cooked meats, the symptoms being mild and recovery taking place within 48 hours. In the other case, the illness was of longer duration and occurred as a result of eating a meal in a factory canteen. Several persons reported to the nurse at the factory as being unwell, and attributed their symptoms to partaking of the meal in the canteen. By the time the doctor reported the case and our investigations were started, the stock from which some gravy was made had been thrown away, although samples of the oxtails which had been the 'plat de jour' were examined bacteriologically and the report was as follows:— Specimen appeared normal in colour and had no bad odour. Cultures: non-lactose fermenting coliforms grown which proved negative on agglutination with any of the salmonella anti-sera. Also enterococci found, but these were found to be non-faecal. Animal feeding was carried out on rats, animals showed no sign of illness. Specimen of the faeces of the patient were also examined but showed no pathogenic organism. As frequently happens in this type of food poisoning, scientific investigation fails to find the cause, but one can frequently suspect certain items of food found to have been eaten by all, as the cause of the trouble. Acting on the information received from a nearby Health Department that certain people resident in that area were suffering from food poisoning as a result of eating food in a canteen of a factory in this Borough, I visited the factory and found that about .50 persons had been temporarily upset, one for as long as 14 days, by consuming food in this canteen. The common factor was found to be salt beef, but again there was none left for examination. At the same premises later in the year, a further outbreak of sickness occurred as a result of persons eating some curried meat. I had specimens from the personnel of the staff canteen examined, in all of which no pathogenic organisms were found. Certain advice was given to the manager in regard to hygiene and the storing of food, so as to prevent the advent of mice. The Sanitary Inspectors have given a large percentage of their time to dealing with unsound food, or food damaged by enemy action. All food found to be unfit for human consumption is 15 salvaged by the Ministry of Food, who arrange for it to be used as animal food. ACTON AND WEMBLEY JOINT ISOLATION HOSPITAL. REPORT 1941. The total number of patients admitted to the hospital in the year ending December 31st, 1941, was 287, compared with 338 in 1940 and 333 in 1939. The admission included 48 patients from Acton, 222 from Wembley, 16 from Ealing and 1 from Willesden. Although the majority suffered from Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, cases of 11 other infectious diseases were also admitted. Chiefly on this account, we were unable always to provide for the isolation of a particular disease, and arrangements had to be made for the treatment of a few patients in outside hospitals. Scarlet Fever. 119 cases of Scarlet Fever were admitted and there was no death. Of this total, 3 cases proved, after examination and due observation, not to have been suffering from this disease. 5 cases were admitted from houses, where the probable source of infection was a patient discharged (from hospital) less than 28 days previously. These are, of course, the so-called "return" cases. No mastoid operation was performed during the year. Diphtheria. 72 cases were admitted. No less than 36 of these had no definite clinical signs of the disease on admission, and all the swabs from the nose and throat were found to be negative. There were 3 deaths, and in each case the patient had not been immunised. Two of these cases died less than 36 hours after admission. 16 Measles. 34 cases were admitted. One child, aged 1 year, suffering from broncho-pneumonia, died within 2 hours of admission. All the cases were treated with M & B 693 and this fact may account for the almost complete absence of complications. Cerebro-Spinal Fever. 14 patients suffering from this disease were admitted and there were 2 deaths. Both of these patients, aged 16 months, died within an hour or two of admission. Two cases on admission were found to be suffering from Landry's Paralysis. This is an exceedingly rare form of paralysis, often ending fatally when the respiratory muscles become involved. Both cases were immediately transferred to the Central Middlesex Hospital, in order to secure treatment by means of Drinker's Apparatus, or, as it is more commonly called,—"the Iron Lung." A most satisfactory feature was the response, .in some cases remarkable, to treatment with M & B 693. Bacteriological examinations were carried out at the Ministry of Health's Regional Laboratory at Ealing. (Sgd.) H. L. SPARROW, Medical Superintendent. 17 ISOLATION HOSPITAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1941.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. Drainage and Sewerage. All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are drained into the main sewerage system. By arrangement with the London County Council the sewage is discharged into the London sewers. Storm water is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Public Cleansing. The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1941 was 13,604 tons of which 1,095 tons was salvage and the remaining 12,509 tons was burnt at the Refuse Destructor.

Ladies and Gentlemen,. We beg to submit the following report upon the schools and the school children of Acton for the year 1941. At the request of the Board of Education, this report is as brief as possible, while giving particulars as to the welfare of the school children and the services carried on by the Borough for their benefit. All schools were open in Acton for the whole of the year 1941 and all services were maintained. Medical inspections were carried out as in normal times and all Clinics to deal with special defects were in operation. There were no changes in the medical staff, but there was a reduction of one in the school nursing staff, caused by the retirement 30 of Nurse Evans. This deficiency was made good by the engagement of a dental attendant, thus releasing the remaining school nurses for more visiting and inspecting in the schools and homes. Mr. Slater, the School Dentist, joined H.M. Forces on 9th October, 1941, and a rota of local dentists took weekly sessions to carry on his work. The general development of the school children in Acton is maintaining its usual level. The only class of children showing any depreciation in height and weight over last year, are the girls aged 7—9, where there is a difference of 1% since last year, but if the figures for this age group are compared with those for the year 1939, the year 1941 shows a slight improvement over 1939, so there would appear to be no cause relating to the war or wartime feeding operating to produce the slight lowering in nutrition. Considerable advantage was taken of the provision of school meals and milk. 2,970 free meals were provided to Acton school children and 19,343 free bottles of milk were dispensed. The percentage of children receiving school milk, either paid or free, at the end of 1941, was extremely high, ranging from 70% to 96%, except in one senior boys' school where only 20% of the boys took milk. On free meals and/or milk, all children gained adequately except 2 and these responded to the addition of cod liver oil and malt. Attempts were made to decrease the verminous condition of the Acton school children. All families known to be chronic offenders in this respect, were given appointments with the Assistant School Medical Officer, who offered cleansing facilities to the whole family at the same time, with advice how to keep themselves from becoming reinfected. This was undertaken before compulsory powers of cleansing were given under the Scabies Order of 1941, but it was found that the majority of these families were well content with their state, desired no help, and resented as an insult being informed of what they must have known to be a fact from the frequent exclusion from school of their children, as verminous. There is an increase in the number of verminous children over 1940, but none over 1939, so the increase is presumably due to the increased school roll. At the beginning of 1941 there were 1938 children on the roll, and at the end of 1941 there were 3293. Scabies continued to be a nuisance all through the year. There were 94 cases, 59 families being affected. A table showing the distribution of those affected is in the report. Some of these cases were treated at home and some were sent to the Cleansing Baths at Kensington, with which Borough Acton has an arrangement for this purpose. 31 Immunisation against Diphtheria was carried out as formerly. To each parent invited to attend the medical inspection of his child, was put the question: "Has your child been protected against Diphtheria?" If the child had not been protected, immunisaticp was then offered and instructions given as to the Clinic to attend for this purpose. All parents of school entrants were approached about inoculation by the Head Mistress. The "follow-up" scheme adopted in previous years was also followed and all children whose immunisation was done three years ago, were offered re-inoculation (one injection) to bring the immunity up to its original level. A table showing the inoculations done, is contained in the Report. That Acton's school population has now a sufficiently large number of children protected to ensure relative freedom from Diphtheria is perhaps evidenced by the figures of the last four years. 1941 3 cases. 1940 2 „ 1939 3 „ 1938 9 „ The three children who developed Diphtheria in 1941 were un-inoculated, and one of them died. Clinics for the treatment of Otorrhoea and Otalgia and for the treatment of Post Nasal Catarrh were held as formerly. A table of cases treated is in the Report. 32 AVERAGE HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS.

V. E. Brander. REPORT OF THE SCHOOL DENTAL SURGEON. In view of the fact that it was not until January, 1942 that I joined the staff at Acton, a detailed report for the year 1941 is not possible. When Mt. Slater, l.d.s. (Bristol) joined H.M. Forces in October, the work was carried on by part-time private practitioners. Their efforts made possible the maintenance of a reasonable dental sen-ice in the circumstances. 41 The figures given below are of the work undertaken for Maternity and Child Welfare cases and for pupils attending the Acton County and Junior Technical Schools.
