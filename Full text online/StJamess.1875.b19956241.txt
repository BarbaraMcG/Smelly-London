C. HALL, RICHARD JEFFS, Auditors. Genral Rrport of Works, EXECUTED BY THE VESTIIY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1875-1876. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June 24th, 1876. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, The lists of the principal works that have been carried out during the period extending from March 25th, 1875, to March 25th, 1876, will give a more definite idea of the works executed by you in that interval of time than any written description, especially as they are all submitted to, approved by, and eventually agreed to by the majority of the Works Committee and the Vestry, and must of necessity be so fresh in the recollection of all who give their time and interest to the actual carrying out of the works detailed, that no written or printed account can add much to the information already in your possession. It has however to be explained that in order to obviate the inconvenience of making up the accounts to the 25th of March only, some of the items are carried on to the 24th of June, 1876, showing the total cost of the whole work. This is not, perhaps, strictly regular, but as it will be found to be more intelligible, may perhaps be pardoned, as the items will not appear again. Cutting the amounts in half, so to speak, is apt to lead to mistaken conclusions, 14 PAVING WORKS. Probably the most patent and generally noticeable works carried out under the supervision of the Vestry and their responsible Committee, the Works Committee, are the construction and maintenance of the paved surfaces of the Parish, and perhaps no district, small as it is in area, is of so great importance. A very slight reference to the record of the proceedings and action of the Works Committee and the subsequent approval of the same by the Vestry generally will show the patient investigation that is given to every question before positive action is taken upon any matter, and upon the whole the result proves that the time thus expended, although large, is not, or has not been more than the circumstances not only justified but demanded. The result must be taken as satisfactory, considering the exceptional nature of the traffic that has to be provided for, and the contingencies to be met or guarded against. It is a pleasure to be able to state that no accidents or casualties have occurred through want of forethought or neglect, however culpable the latter might be, during the twelve months which this Report records, which statement is in itself a proof of the careful vigilance exercised by the Works Committee in connection with all matters confided to their discretion, and to which the greatest amount of deliberation and ample discussion is given. As to cases of actual emergency, where prompt and definite action is necessary, 15 the officers of the Vestry feel that it is their duty to act promptly, but with as much discretion as they possess, always reporting the same on the earliest opportunity, considering that it is equally their duty so to do; and although the list would be very tedious and uninteresting to read if published, a very long list might be prepared of such sudden contingencies. The comparatively abbreviated list appended to this brief report will shew that a great amount of work has been executed with regard to paving within the twelve months ending on the 25th March, 1876, although the list refers solely to what may be called "special" works, a detailed list of the whole would fill a moderately sized volume. The MacAdam roads collectively are no small responsibility, nor are some of the comparatively old pitched paved roads and many of the footways. Taking all together, however, the general surfaces of the Parish are, if not perfect, equal to all that can be expected from the work they have to perform. The new works carried out in St. James's Street, the Haymarket, and the various others set forth in the list have, and there is no doubt will, answer all that is expected from them, and, although the matter does not form an actual item in this report, it is but just to state that the wood paving in Argyll Street has so far answered the expectations that were raised at the time it was executed, as to justify the execution of the work. The same statement is due to the wood paving in Little Pulteney 16 Street and the asphalte in Tyler Street: taking them as they are there is no reason to regret that the works were done. They are all proofs that the preliminary time and care bestowed by the Works Committee and the Vestry were judiciously expended, and certainly the works were well and conscientiously carried out by the various contractors who undertook the same. It is but due to those several gentlemen to record this statement—after twelve months experience. SEWERS WORKS. All works, such as paving works, that are carried out upon the surface, and therefore open to the inspection of the whole of the public, attract a great amount of public attention and criticism, being in fact a sort of public amusement gratis, for the time being. Very different are the works executed in connection with Sewerage and Drainage. The heavy responsibilities and difficulties and superior class of labour which are involved in connection with sewers matters, and the actual doing the work, are from necessity hidden from the general observation of the public. While the work is about, it is considered a nuisance, and when it is completed it is forgotten. But the instant results of any failure or hitch are so immediately felt by the sufferers, that as a rule, however prompt the measures may be to remedy the evil, great injury 17 may be the result of the delay, and this is notably the case in St. James's, where, like every other improvement, such improvements were originally adopted. Some of the oldest or first constructed sewers in the metropolis exist in this Parish, and year by year become more and more dilapidated, not from age, being constructed of good brickwork, which age does not much affect, but from a cause to which I have before alluded, and which must not be overlooked—the exertions of the rats. They cannot make much impression, if any, upon our modern work, but the soft bricks in use a couple of centuries since, and the imperfect manner in which the house and gulley drains were connected with the sewers, having given them what may be called a fair start, they lose no opportunity of turning the same to account, if not to their own advantage to the most serious injury of the fabrics they attack. They are the cause of much of the rapid decadence of many of the sewers and drains of the older parts of London, as well as undermining houses. A very little reflection will show the amount of mischief that will soon result from the labours of such a prolific and really powerful little animal, considering that they may be said as a rule to have it all their own way, being but rarely disturbed, and if they are, their means of concealing themselves are in such inaccessible places that no practical means of eradicature can be found. But if drains and sewers are carefully constructed, and with proper materials, they prove the most useful of b 18 scavengers, and on the whole are beneficial in a sanitary point of view. Most of the works set forth in the list accompanying this short report are due to the cause just mentioned, and if space permitted, and it were within the scope of such a report, a detailed account of the old sewers of St. James's and the locality generally would make a most interesting pamphlet. It is curious to discover that at the time they were built, from 200 to 150 years since, the quantity of second hand materials that were used at that time, and also the manner in which some had been shored from within—Crown Court, Eupert Street to wit, reconstructed some few years back, and the sewer in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, recently practically reconstructed, the invert or floor of which was composed simply of small boulders or pebbles about the size of a cocoanut, of beautiful silica or flint. Many of the old gully drains and the gullies themselves are equally interesting, and the peculiar manner in which some of these brick sewers and drains intersect each other, and the apparently unmeaning course they take, coupled with the age of the materials, and the way in which the bricks were manufactured, point to a much more distant period for their original construction than we are inclined to imagine. The work in connection with the Sackville Street sewer has been referred to; suffice it to say this was not commenced at all too soon, having been a source of anxiety for many years, and the rats not idle, 19 The piece in the Haymarket was to replace a most wretched brick culvert, it could be called nothing else, that almost undermined the front wall of the houses. The new buildings in course of construction will obviate the necessity for the continuance of this piece of sewer at all. The old piece of sewer destroyed in Jermyn street was also a most beneficial work, which might have been advantageously done when the new sewer was made. It was little more than an elongated cesspool between the vaults of several houses on each side, and cannot be illustrated without a diagram, which would be superfluous, as the facts were clearly understood by the Committee before the commencement of the work. Much time and labour is required to clear the sewers running east and west, which from want of fall cannot clear themselves. These, with attention to the gullies—no light matter—form the chief items comprised in the list of Sewers Works actually executed. The conversion of one old building and one comparatively modern one into a public Mortuary House and Examination Room, and the cost of the same will appear in next year's report. Suffice it to say now that these matters are accomplished as far as the structural alterations are concerned. The history of the building converted into the Mortuary House would be a most interesting one could its original purpose be ascertained. During the alterations such curious foundations were brought to 20 light, evidently having supported a most massive building at a totally different angle to the present, or were intended to have done, that the site must have been devoted to some structure of importance : and the date of the bricks, or rather of their manufacture, points to the conclusion that the original structure was of a more ancient date than would be supposed. Although the room itself has undergone many alterations and changes, these old footings and foundations have not been interfered with, and were not, more than was necessary to effect the last conversion from an armory into a Mortuary House, though a further investigation might, or might not, have led to some curious though perhaps not valuable information. The erection of two new Public Conveniences, or rather the replacing two existing ones with new, and the re-erection of the materials of a former one on a fresh site, completes the list of the most prominent of the works of the Vestry for twelve months. The new ones, to call them so, are situated in Wells Street, Jermyn Street, and in Little Vine Street, Piccadilly. The re-erected one is in Blenheim Street, by Oxford Street. To each of these a permanent supply of water has been given, and the gas is supplied by meter. The two first have been constructed upon a different principle than that formerly adopted, whether a permanent benefit or not time will show, as much has to be learnt upon this subject in such limited situations. Neither of these were undertaken without full and 21 even anxious consideration given first by the Works Committee, and afterwards, upon the recommendation of the Committee, by the Vestry, and at any rate valuable experience must be the result. The abolition of the generally patent and unsightly appearance of such structures is at least one point gained, and there can be no doubt that they are far more free from unpleasant odours than their predecessors, which, considering the use that is made of them, is a great step in itself. Little further need be said with regard to the routine business beyond the fact that it has all been attended to. There must be and is a great deal of it, but as the details of any interest are investigated at every Meeting, and especially by the Works Committee, in whom the Vestry justly place their confidence, very little additional light would be thrown upon the several matters by going further into them here. The usual maintenance of roads has been continued, all openings made good, guilies cleansed, sewers cleansed, house drains connected, and a very long list of miscellaneous matters attended to, and generally all has been done that it has been in the power of Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your humble, obedient, and grateful Servant to do, ALBERT P. HOWELL, Surveyor.

Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit for the year 1875 the following Report upon the Public Health of that important section of London known as the Parish of St. James, Westminster. The District of St. James's Palish covers an area of 164 statute acres, and, for the the Registration of Births and Deaths, is divided into three "Sub.Districts"—that of St. James's Square with an area of 85 acres, that of Golden Square with an area of 54 acres, and that of Berwick Street with au area of 25 acres. The density of the population, taking as a basis the enumeration of 1871, is 205 persons per acre. The Sub-Districts, however, vary greatly in this respect, that of St. James's Square having only 123 persons per acre, while that of Golden Square has 238, and that of Berwick Street no less than 411. 28 The numbers and distribution of the population at each of the last five decennial enumerations are shown by the following figures:— Census. St. James's District, Area 1G4 acres. St. James's Square Sub-District, Area 85 acres. Golden Square Sub-District, Area 54 acres. Berwick Street Sub-District, Area 25 acres. 1831 37,053 1841 37,398 13,337 13,612 10,449 1851 36,406 11,469 14,139 10,798 1861 35,326 10,753 13,966 10,607 1871 33,619 10,472 12,860 10,287 It thus appears that since 1841 the population of St. James's has been continuously decreasing, and that now it numbers some four thousands less than it did thirty years ago. This exceptional condition follows from the fact that St. James's has long since been fully built over, and that, of late years, it has increasingly become the centre for Clubs, Hotels, and splendid shops, retailing goods which are often unique in their quality and artistic value. The result has been an enormous rise in the value of houses and a gradual extrusion of the less wealthy and important residents. The first line of figures cannot be completed, as the Sub-District areas were not formed until 1837. 29 The mortality of St. James's during the last five years has been:— Year 1871 Deaths 680 „ 1872 „ 620 „ 1873 „ 629 „ 1874 „ 592 „ 1875 „ 621 During the year 1875 the following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's:— First Quarter 201 Second Quarter 156 Third Quarter 154 Fourth Quarter 175 686 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners Dying in the Workhouse 55 Dying in the Throat Hospital 10 65 621 621 deaths in a population of 33,500 is a death rate of 18.5 per 1000.

Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report of Articles Analysed during the year 1875, under the "Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875." I. The following are the articles upon which analyses have been required by the public:— DATE. SAMPLE. RESULT. Jan. 30. Milk. Poor but not adulterated. Mar. 9. Milk. Poor but yielding no evidence of adulteration. „ 15. Flour. Not adulterated. Apr. 17. Ale. Not adulterated. May 17. Milk. Not adulterated. Nov. 17. Bread. Not adulterated but inferior in quality. II. During the month of December, in consequence of a complaint made as to the quality of 52 bread sold in the Parish, I obtained under the powers vested in me by the Act twelve specimens of bread from various shops, in the locality, and subjected these to a careful analyis. Of these twelve specimens of bread some showed a small trace of alumina and some were of inferior manufacture, but none gave evidence of actual adulteration. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS, M.D. 5, Savile Row, W. January, 1876. Printed by J. Miles and Co., 122, Wardour Street, Oxford Street, w.
