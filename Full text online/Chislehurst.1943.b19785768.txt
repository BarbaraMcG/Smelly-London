Tel.18 2 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP HEALTH REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1943. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Health Report for the year 1943, this being the twenty-first one submitted by me as your Medical Officer of Health. The Report is again curtailed this year, and contains only such essential features as it is necessary to record. The population of the District as estimated by the Registrar-General at mid-year 1943 is 60,130. There was a decrease in the Birth Rate this year, viz.: 17.8 per thousand of population, as against 18.1 last year. A slight increase in the Death Rate took place, the Rate for the year being equal to 10.0 per thousand of population, as compared with 9.7 last year. A decrease again this year took place in the Infantile Mortality Rate, this being equal to 36 per thousand registered births, as compared with 38 last year and 52 in 1941. The year was a satisfactory one from the point of view of incidence of Infectious Disease, the number of notification certificates received being 1,603, as against 835 last year. This is mainly owing to a much larger number of cases of Scarlet Fever and Measles being notified. In submitting this Report, I desire to thank the Council and all its Officers for their kind help. In particular, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the loyal and efficient services rendered by Mr. Allen and all members of the Public Health Department. I am.
