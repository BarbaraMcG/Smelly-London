FRI 21 library PRIERN BARNST URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1 9 4 5. W.W. Mi llen. M.B. Ch.B. Medical Officer of Health. FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, N. 11. 19th. October 1944. To the Chairman and Members of the Friern Barnet Urban District Council.'' Gentlemen, This report is considerably delayed this year, owing to reduced war-time staff, and the long illness and subsequent death of your Medical Officer of Health, Dr. G, Pennant Evans. It covers the period from January 1st. 1945, to December 51st. 1943, inclusive, and will follow the usual abbreviated form in accordance with Circular 10/44 issued in February 1944.. No figures will bo given from which the population of the district or its wards, can bo inferred, and no data supplied by the Registrar General will bo included. "Although the country has been at war for over four years, the health of the district has not: deteriorated, and the incidence of notifiable disease has been very satisfactory. The usual sanitary services such as sewage disposal, water supply and public cleansing, have boon maintained, and in addition, very satisfactory work has been carried out in the collection of materials for the war effort, in the form generally known as salvage, with the result that vacant building sites, and privately owned open spaces of unfenced small plots of land, are at this time free from the "junk" that looks so unsightly, and encourages insect and other like pests. In this connection we had a considerable number of complaints in the late summer and early autumn, from residents in the Crescent area, of an infestation of crickets migrating from the controlled tip on the Central Ward allotments. Mr. Harman, your sanitary inspector, together with Mr. Marshall, your surveyor, investigated and found that the fermenting refuse generated so much heat, that the insects were attracted to and bred on the tip, especially beneath the sleeper road and platform. All herbage both on and around the tip was cut down, dried and burnt. The sides of the tip wore opened to allow the heat to disperse and bring it down to manageable proportions. The whole tip was sprayed heavily with creosote and oil, and the sleeper roads gassed under tarpaulin, with a mixture of powdered calcium and sodium cyanides, with the result that the tip was cleared of crickets in less than a week, subsequently the top of the tip was covered with a substantial layer of clay, above the daily cover of soil, and eventually the clay was again covered with garden soil before the plots were handed over. Wo found that this procedure reduced the temperature of the first foot of soil from 83 Fah. to 59 Fah. which was practically air temperature. Since then the tip has had additional spraying, and additional cover provided to the previously tipped area, and the Officers concerned are satisfied that there is no infestation of crickets on that portion of the tip, made since the late summer of 1942. The Council has now become the local authority for the administration of the Rats & Mice (Destruction) Act, and Infestation orders made by the Ministry of Food. -1- The artificial immunisation again&u Diphtheria has been continued, but the number of immunisations has not reached the standard desired, although every effort has been made by the School Medical Service and the Maternity and Child Welfare authority, to place the advantages of immunisation before parents and guardians. The number of children immunised at fit the clinic during the year has been 276, and I have to. express my best thanks to Dr. Stephen, the School Medical Officer', for her good work and assistance in this connection. The small clinic and cleansing station established in 1942 for the treatment of scabies, has done good work, having dealt with ISO new cases, and given 376 treatments. The cost of running this clinic, has been merely nominal, the only outgoings being for medicaments, fuel and light, and keeping the premises (requisitioned for civil defence purposes) clean. The actual work of treatment has been done voluntarily by members of the' local Red Cross organisation, working under the direction of Mrs. King, an industrial welfare nurse, and their good work has been much appreciated. Since the commencement, the clinic has treated 320 cases in all", to a successful conclusion, and as this ailment tends to be one of the causes, of absence from work, and school, it has made a substantial contribution to the, war effort, especially where those cases of, sepsis would ordinarily have kept the patient away from work or school for a long period. . The ambulance service has now been severed from the Fire Service, and is run by civil defence workers, and Satisfactory arrangements have been made for mutual assistance with adjoining authorities, should the ambulances of either not be immediately available for work within the district. The Womens Voluntary Service, by way of the car pool, has also been made use of for the conveyance to hospital of the patients' of private medical practitioners., on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health. I attach the usual tables of statistics,, which show that the essential public health work has been performed well by a reduced war-time staff, working under difficult and handicapping conditions. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W.W. Millien. M.B. Ch.B. Medical Officer of Health. -2- No. OF DWELLING HOUSES INSPECTED (seperate primary Inspections only) . (1). On Complaint 419 (2).
