ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1961 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hendon Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Report for the year 1961. The health statistics were good in 1961, and the Registrar-General has estimated a slight decrease in the population. The high birth rate of 1946, with its problem of the "bulge" for the educationalist, may in the near future, with the increase in the number of young women in the population, lead to an increase in the birth rate. The ratio of population of homes is lower than ever with an average figure of 3.3 persons per home, but with the little land available for building and the present price of houses there is no suggestion of surplus accommodation, and housing difficulties still persist. Several remedies have been tried. We now build upwards more than ever before, and numbers of families and industries have been moved out to new towns beyond the Green Belt. There is scope for a further suggestion-would it not be simpler if instead of moving factories and homes to the new towns, we instead extended a trend well-established in the higher income groups and gave some special encouragement by way of subsidy to retired people to move to the already established retirement areas at the South coast? Such an arrangement might lead to a substantia] increase in the number of people who do so, and who if in good health would regard such a move as a fitting reward for their years of work in the metropolis. The publication (in 1962) of the Report on Fluoridation of Domestic Water Supplies as a means of improving dental health reminds us of the fact that drinking water supplied by both the Metropolitan Water Board to the South part of the Borough, and the Colne Valley Water Company in the North is seriously deficient in this valuable trace element. A plea is often made by members of the general public for more medical research, but in the case of fluoridation the research scientists have reason to criticise the public's failure to adopt this recommendation with the same enthusiasm as have some forty million people in other countries. Local Government in the Greater London Area is complex and likely to change, and for this reason some years may elapse before fluoridation can be introduced, but in the meantime parents who are interested in this subject should consult their doctor or dentist about the possibility of fluoridation of their children's drinking water. 4 The Middlesex County Council Main Drainage Department has reported a number of unsatisfactory samples from surface water sewers and the presence of foam from detergents on the water courses. This led to a survey by the Public Health Inspectors of properties for the presence of sinks and lavatory basins connected so that their effluent discharged into the surface water system, and these were dealt with under Section 34 of the Public Health Act. Much of this surface water flows to the Welsh Harp which is being increasingly used for sailing. The routine work of the Department in the eradication of vermin continues, and during the year the tragic death of a Hendon resident, on holiday elsewhere, as a result of a wasp sting, serves to draw attention to the valuable work done in the Borough by the destruction of wasps nests. During the year 355 nests were destroyed. The pigeon has now joined the ranks of pests and the number of wild pigeons is increasing. They have established breeding places under several railway arches. A recent investigation reported in the medical press suggests that the pigeon can sometimes carry a disease known as ornithosis to human contacts. At the instigation of the Director of the Centra] Laboratory of the Public Health Laboratory Service an investigation was carried out to see if pet foods played a significant part in the spread of food poisoning. Most pet foods were found to be free from infection, but it is desirable that untinned pet meats should be prepared well apart from food intended for household consumption. The total number of road accidents showed a decrease, but more people were killed on Hendon roads. During the year the use of safety belts in cars increased considerably, and a new length of motorway was completed in the Borough. During the year considerable progress was made with the No.2 Smoke Control Area, which covers a substantial part of the Garden Suburb, with Finchley, Hornsey and Hampstead to form a very large Smoke Control Area with the Garden Suburb as its centre. I am indebted to the help given by the Hampstead Garden Fellowship for their patient explanation of the benefits of clean air to many of the older residents in the Suburb. I have included in my Report an extract from the report of the Hendon Old People's Housing Society and the report of the Chairman of the Borough of Hendon Old People's Welfare Committee. I would like to thank the members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement, and also the members of the staff for their loyal and conscientious service during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J.L.

This is 4,937 less than the Census figure for 1951. BIRTHS The number of live births recorded during the year increased by 152, 2,113 occurring compared with 1,961 in 1960, giving an increased corrected birth rate of 13.44 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 12.39 last year. The rate is less than that for the County of Middlesex which is 16.1 and less than that for England and Wales, which is 17.4 per 1,000 Home Population. The number of stillbirths decreased from 34 to 26, giving a stillbirth rate of 12.15 per 1,000 total births compared with 17.04 in 1960. The rate for the Borough of Hendon compares favourably with that for England and Wales, which is 18.7 per 1,000 total births. DEATHS There was an increase of 37 in the number of deaths. This gives a corrected death rate of 11,43 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.11 in 1960. This rate is slightly lower than that for the County of Middlesex which is 11.6 per 1,000 Home Population; the rate for England and Wales is 12.00 per 1,000 Home Population. As in previous years, heart and associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths, 504 people dying from these causes. Second in the principal causes was cancer. Deaths from motor vehicle and other accidents increased, 50 people dying from these causes compared with 45 in 1960. Nineteen people committed suicide, a decrease of 6 on the previous year. INFANTILE MORTALITY Thirty-six children died in the first year of life compared with 43 in 1960. giving an infantile mortality rate of 17.03 per 1,000 live births. 15 The rate for England and Wales is 21.4 per 1,000 related live births. The rate for the County of Middlesex is 20.4 per 1,000 live births. Of the 36 children, 27 died before reaching the age of 1 month, giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 12.77 per 1,000 live births compared with 15.5 for England and Wales. MATERNAL MORTALITY One woman died as a result of childbirth, giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.46 per 1,000 total (Live & Still) births. DEATHS PROM CANCER OP THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS During the year in Hendon 37 men and 5 women under 65 years of age died from this cause. 16 Borough of Hendon DEATHS PROM CANCER OP LUNG AND BRONCHUS DEATHS PROM RESPIRATORY TUBERCULOSIS 1951 - 1961 Number of Deaths 17 ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS The following tables show the road traffic accidents and casualties occurring within the Borough of Hendon during the year 1961 and the comparative figures for the years 1958, 1959 and 1960. It should be noted that the figures shown refer not only to Hendon residents but also to persons living in other areas who were involved in accidents within the Borough The figures for fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those shown in the list of causes of death supplied by the Registrar-General. The Registrar-General's figures refer to Hendon residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Hendon or outside the district.

The patient a girl aged 10 had been vaccinated in South Africa and was probably infected during a holiday in West Germany. PUERPERAL PYREXIA There was a decrease in the number of cases of Puerperal Pyrexia, 92 cases occurring compared with 105 in 1960. Of the 92 cases 50 only were Hendon residents, the remainder being women from other areas who entered the maternity hospital in the Borough for their confinement. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM No cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum were notified during the year. SCARLET FEVER There was a decrease in the number of cases notified, 59 cases occurring compared with 114 in 1960. MEASLES During the course of this year, 2,215 cases of Measles were notified compared with 78 in 1960. Measles tend to occur in epidemic form every two years. An epidemic can be expected about Spring 1963. WHOOPING COUGH There were 25 cases of Whooping Cough notified as compared with 153 in 1960. The condition is most dangerous in young babies, and protection should be provided before the child is six months old. SONNE DYSENTERY There was a decrease in the number of cases notified - 37 compared with 44 in 1960. The disease is usually mild in character and commonly affects children attending infant school. 24 TYPHOID FEVER There was one case of Typhoid Fever notified in Hendon. The patient was a school boy who had recently returned from a holiday in the West Country, The source of his infection was not discovered, but in retrospect the boy and members of his family thought that there had been sewage contamination at the bathing beach and inquiries confirmed that this may have been so. PARATYPHOID FEVER One case of this disease was notified. The patient was employed in a laboratory where research on this disease takes place. FOOD POISONING During the year 31 cases of food poisoning were notified compared with 14 in 1960. The following is a copy of a report made to the Ministry about the organisms responsible for the individual and family outbreaks.

Occasionally man is infected by a diseased bird. A suspected case of human psittacosis was reported in a man who had been bitten by a green Amazon parrot. The patient developed a virus pneumonia and made an uneventful recovery. The parrot subsequently died and a postmortem confirmed that the cause of death was psittacosis. A second human case, a contact of the same parrot, was reported from Essex and he, too, made an uneventful recovery. This disease has at times a 20% mortality rate and is especially dangerous to those who have to deal with a diseased bird. The disease has become relatively rare now that the importation of parrots is controlled by the Parrots and Miscellaneous Birds (Prohibition of Importation) Order, 1953, which restricts the importation of certain birds - including parrots - except under licence. 26 DIPHTHERIA No case of diphtheria was notified during the year. The following table shows the number of cases and the deaths from diphtheria since immunisation was introduced on a large scale in 1935.

Trenchard, Physician-in-Charge of the Edgware Chest Clinic, from whose Annual Report I have extracted the following information:- The pattern of staffing of Edgware Chest Clinic by officers of the hospital authority and officers of the Middlesex County Council has been described in earlier reports, and has in 1961 remained the same as in former years. The service is integrated with in-patient facilities for chest patients at Edgware General, Colindale and West Hendon hospitals, and the thoracic units at Clare Hall, Harefield and St. Charles Hospitals. Patients requiring radiotherapy are referred to the Middlesex and Mount Vernon Hospitals. TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis is no longer a problem as the outlook with treatment is now good. This is the result of the use of modern chemo-therapeutic and antibiotic drugs; but nevertheless treatment is still a prolonged matter taking years to complete. The number of new cases is about one half of that ten years ago, but still there is an average of nearly two newly discovered cases per week. Details are given in the Tables. CANCER OF THE LUNG The diagnosis of lung cancer is unfortunately a major activity of the chest clinic. As so many cases are related to cigarette smoking (usually heavy smoking), it is a condition which could be prevented. CHRONIC BRONCHITIS The scheme for sending bronchitis patients to hospitals outside London during the "smog" season- December to February- has again been used. Fortunately the recent winters have been relatively mild and there has been less fog and smog than in some former years. HYPNOTHERAPY A regular clinic is held when selected patients are seen by appointment. Results are encouraging, and although the long term results for any form of treatment of asthma are difficult to assess, to date, patients undergoing treatment continue to do well. RESEARCH AND TEACHING Co-operation with the Medical Research Council & British Tuberculosis Association on research into chronic bronchitis has continued and postgraduate instruction has been given to a number of doctors from overseas. 32 Publications I.

A person requiring a licence or renewal of a licence under this part of the Act must make application to the Local Authority giving certain information, such as age, nationality, technical qualifications and the nature of the establishment and the business conducted thereat. The Council considered and granted the following applications:- New Licences 3 Renewal of Licences 31 Certificates lodged under Section 363 by members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy 3 Licences Refused - NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Section 47 This section deals with securing the necessary care and attention by removal to hospital or other place of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. In no instance was it considered necessary to use the powers available under the Act, but nevertheless the Act is valuable in that the knowledge that the statutory power of removal exists often helps towards an effective decision. 35 13 cases however, where it was thought that the person might be in need of some attention, were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. Each person was considered individually and advised how best he or she could be helped by the existing voluntary and statutory services. In those cases where removal was essential, the old people concerned agreed to go into hospital or other accommodation voluntarily. In dealing with the problem the co-operation of Mr. R.R. Holland, the Area Welfare Officer, has been greatly appreciated. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 SECTION 50 - PUBLIC BURIALS Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is required to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area if in such case it appears to the Council that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. During the year two burials were carried out, both adults. GENERAL HOSPITAL FACILITIES Edgware General Hospital. Hendon District Hospital. The needs for mental treatment are served by Napsbury Hospital. INFECTIOUS DISEASES - HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION West Hendon Hospital. Neasden Isolation Hospital, Willesden. Any other Infectious Disease Hospital controlled by the North-Western Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT AND HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION Edgware General Hospital. Admissions are also arranged through the Regional Hospital Board to the Regional Chest Hospitals, particularly Clare Hall and Colindale. The Chest Clinic at Edgware serves primarily those living in the Borough of Hendon and the Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of Harrow and Wembley. 36 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL The following services are provided by the Middlesex County Council under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946:- * Care of mothers and young children (Section 22) * Midwives Service (Section 23) * Health Visiting (Section 24) * Home Nursing (Section 25) * Vaccination and Immunisation (Section 26) * Chiropody Service (Section 28) * Domestic Help (Section 29) School Health Services and Dental Services (Provided under Education Act, 1944, the Borough of Hendon being an Excepted District). * These services are administered on an area basis, Area 4 consisting of the Boroughs of Hendon and Finchley. The Area Health Committee acts as a Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the County Council and consists of representatives of the two Boroughs. Middlesex County Council, certain professional bodies and other persons with special knowledge of these services. MEDICAL PRACTITIONER SERVICE The Middlesex Executive Committee has classified the different wards of the Borough into two categories. (1) Intermediate Areas - Burnt Oak, Central, Childs Hill, Edgware, Mill Hill, Park and West Hendon. In these areas the number of patients on the average general practitioner's list is reasonable. New practices may be established in such areas but the initial practice allowance is not likely to be paid. (2) Restricted Areas - Garden Suburb and Golders Green. These are areas in which the numbers of doctors is adequate. Normally applications by doctors to start new practices is not granted. LABORATORY FACILITIES These are provided at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. Specimens may be sent direct to the Laboratory by medical practitioners or by special collection from the Public Health Department provided they are received not later than 3.30 p.m. Monday to Friday and 11.0 a.m. Saturday. 37 I would like to express my appreciation of the work carried out by the staff at the Laboratory who, during the course of the year, have given considerable advice and help to the Public Health Department. The number of samples taken in respect of milk, ice cream, domestic water supplies and swimming pools is shown elsewhere in the report. WELFARE OP OLD PEOPLE I am indebted to County Councillor Miss E.M. Weavers, B.A., P.R.S.A., Chairman of the Hendon Old People's Welfare Committee and to Mr. E.B. Pinder Davis, Hon. Secretary, for the Report for the year 1961-62. "VISITING. Probably one of the most important activities for an Old People's Welfare Committee is the visiting of elderly people in their homes. There are in Hendon about 10,000 people above the age of 70. Of these the great majority do not require help from us. But in dealing with figures of this magnitude it should be remembered that even 2½% 10,000 gives 250, and such a number would require a fairly numerous staff to keep in touch with regularly. Those who are on the waiting list for accommodation in hospitals or homes will be visited fairly frequently by one or other of the statutory officers concerned. It is, of course, appreciated that much valuable work involving personal visits is already being done in the Borough. For example, the W.V.S. have about 70 names on their "Meals on Wheels" list. Although these visits have to be somewhat fleeting they provide a valuable and regular link with the outside world for those who receive this valuable service. A similar number of housebound elderly people receive chiropody treatment in their homes under the Service provided by the Middlesex County Council which the Committee operates. This is also for us a valuable source of information. Further, each of the numerous organisations affiliated to the Old People's Welfare Committee does visiting among members of its own clubs and every endeavour is made not to lose sight of those who have fallen out of active membership of the clubs to which they may have belonged. Cases which are brought directly to the notice of the Committee are visited by the Hon. Secretary and,so far as facilities allow, arrangements are made for the allocation of a volunteer visitor. Since the beginning of 1961 about 150 home visits have been made from this office. The Committee are convinced that this branch of their activity could well be extended to meet the growing need and to obtain better co-ordination of the work done by the various organisations, churches and clubs. It is felt that for this service to function efficiently a whole time Supervisor is essential. The Committee's views have, therefore, been submitted to the Hendon Borough Council with a request that they give consideration to making such an appointment possible. Meanwhile, a Home Visiting Sub-Committee which includes Dr. Patton, Dr.Binks and Mr.Holland has been formed to decide upon the scope of this work. A group of volunteer visitors is being built up. More names will be welcome. 38 HOLIDAYS A party of 64 went for the customary week's holiday to the Hatherley Hotel, Cliftonville from May 19th to 26th. Red Cross Nurse O'Brien again accompanied the party. As usual her presence and practical help were of great value. We continue to give assistance with individual holidays when special needs are brought to our notice. Applications for grants are received from hospital almoners, doctors and others and each is given careful consideration. Last year we were able to give help in ten such cases. TRANSPORT Thanks to the efforts of the Hon. Treasurer a home for the coach "Polly" has at last been found. It will be used in the grounds of the Carshalton Children's Hospital. The Friends of Carshalton Hospital have very generously stated their intention of making a donation of £25 to our funds. The Committee are most grateful to the Borough Transport Department for their help while the coach was in service and for their forbearance in allowing it to occupy valuable space in their garage over a long period. HANDCRAFTS The Middlesex Old People's Welfare Committee organised a most successful Handcraft Exhibition in May at Wembley Town Hall. Hendon with 120 exhibits had the second largest display. Awards gained by exhibitors in the Borough were: First-5; Second-2; Third-7; with 16 Highly Commended. The Committee plan to hold their own second Exhibition on Tuesday, October 30th. By the courteous co-operation of the Education Officer, Dr. N.F.H. Butcher, M.A., B.Sc., Ph.D., and of the Headmaster, the assembly hall at Hendon County School, Golders Rise has been made available to us. Neighbouring boroughs will again be invited to take part. ANNUAL APPEAL This year the Appeal letter was again sent only to a short list of names most of whom have responded to previous Appeals. Donations amounted to £200. As the preparation of letters was all done in the office, expenses in connection with this appeal were kept to a minimum. INFORMATION FOLDER The local office of the National Assistance Board asked for a supply of the folder. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance have been giving a copy to each new old age pensioner since April 1961. 39 CLUBS The "Over 60's" Club continues to fill a need. But unfortunately only those elderly people who live in the central area are able to use it with any regularity. There seems to be no doubt that high 'bus fares and long waits at 'bus stops are an obstacle to many who would like to become members. With a weekly attendance of 110-120 for the five days on which the club is open it is felt that the rooms are not being used as much as might be expected. (This question is discussed again in a subsequent section). The "Third Thursday" Club for housebound and partially disabled people continues to fulfil its valuable purpose. In May and September afternoon outings were arranged to a country club in Hertfordshire. In November the Inner Wheel gave a celebration party at Station Road and the Committee held a New Year Party in January. So far no similar club has been started under the auspices of the Committee outside the central area. But we are informed that a group of ladies in Mill Hill entertain a group of 16 elderly housebound people in their homes at frequent intervals. This is probably the most practical way of extending this activity. The Committee would be most happy to give their support to any similar effort and to help financially if this is needed. They again offer their most grateful thanks to all those volunteer drivers, helpers and entertainers whose help and enthusiasm have made these valuable activities possible. CHIROPODY The service continues to be operated under the Middlesex County Council in the manner described in the previous Annual Report. As we have to keep within the quotas laid down in 1960 after the first six months' running of the extended service, the number of treatments given in private surgeries remains static. New patients are referred to the County Clinic nearest to their homes. We are, however, allowed a certain latitude with domiciliary treatments and the number of patients who are visited by Mrs MacCabe shows a small but steady increase. The County Council have made advance payments to us on account of our monthly outgoings and this has removed the financial anxieties from which we once suffered. CHESHIR HOUSE, NEW BRENT STREET ESTATE This two storey block on the new estate in the central area of the Borough is designed to house 43 elderly people in fully equipped single rooms. Tenants are not necessarily of pensionable age. A number of elderly people whom we have known for some years and who were previously unsuitably housed are now living there in comfort. The assistant to the organising secretary spends one afternoon each week visiting there. Although a letter was left with each of the tenants inviting them to join the "Over 60's" Club we have had no new members from among them. There is a comfortable clubroom which seats 100-120 and which can be hired by clubs and organisations. Application for its use should be made to the Borough Housing Officer. 40 158 STATION ROAD. N.W.4. In a previous section of this report attention has been drawn to the fact that the "Over 60's" Club is only of use to those who live in the central area of Hendon. Although 150 subscriptions have been paid since April 1961 the weekly attendance now averages no more than 110-120. Allowing for the "regulars" who come to the club several times each week, the total number of people using it in any one week appears to be not more than about 70. The club is also open on two evenings each week when a group of about 30 members make their own arrangements for entertainment. On Thursday afternoons the club has always been poorly attended and at present only two couples come with any regularity on that day. It was for this reason that Thursday was chosen for the monthly meetings of the club for the housebound and disabled. Attendances on week-day afternoons used to average about 130 a week. Although this drop in attendance is not very great, it was natural to suppose that active membership of the club would tend to rise each year. Various reasons might account for this position: Yearly rise in the average age of members. Increased 'bus fares and long waits for 'buses. The position of the club at one of the highest spots in the Borough, "involving a long drag uphill from whichever direction it is approached. Possible rise in the number of those having television at home. CONCLUSION Following the publication of the new ten year Hospital Plan for England and Wales, the Minister of Health, The Rt.Hon. J.Enoch Powell, presided recently at a conference at which the chief officers of six important voluntary organisations were present: National Council of Social Service. British Red Cross Society. National Old People's Welfare Council. Women's Voluntary Service. National League of Hospital Friends. St.John Ambulance Association and Brigade. The theme of the conference was "Voluntary Work in Hospital and Local Health and Welfare Services" and the aim was to reach general conclusions on the future scope for voluntary work as a necessary part of the complete plan. Particular emphasis was laid on the continuing need for full integration of voluntary effort with the statutory services, the voluntary worker being regarded not as a substitute for a full time paid worker but as a valued member of a team with a specific task to perform. It is made abundantly clear in the report on this meeting and in the directives recently published by the Ministry of Health that without the continued close co-operation of the voluntary services at both national and local level, the expansion envisaged would not be possible. The need is likely to be felt for a considerable expansion of voluntary work and local authorities are being urged to make the fullest use of services which voluntary 41 bodies are already providing. Much care and close co-ordination will be needed to avoid overlapping and waste of effort. For members of voluntary organisations and for all those who give their time and service in assisting the work of this Committee, the next few years should be a time of increasing activity and opportunity". HENDON OLD PEOPLE'S HOUSING SOCIETY I am indebted to the Honorary Secretary, Mr. A.E. Harvey of 36 Grampian Gardens, N.W.2. for the Annual Report for 1961 which describes the work of the Society at Church Walk House. The Report includes the following comments - "Flatlets Visibly no progress has been made. There have been many difficulties in connection with Town Planning permission, but we think that at last these difficulties have been overcome. A scheme is now being developed for 12 single flats and 2 double flatlets, with warden's accommodation, the approximate cost will be £21,000. We have in the region of £2,000 towards the scheme and it is hoped a mortgage will be arranged with the Hendon Borough Council, and that the Council will give a grant towards the scheme". STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year under review 99 new entrants or employees of the Hendon Borough Council were medically examined for superannuation purposes. Of this number 98 employees were passed as fit, and 1 was unfit. The number of examinations in respect of each department of the Council was as follows:- Town CIerks 14 Borough Treasurer's 10 Borough Engineer's 39 Borough Librarian's 31 Borough Housing Officer's 5 Medical Officer of Health's - 99 42 SECTION D: Sanitary Circumstances of the Area WATER SUPPLY The Borough has a dual source of supply. The northern part is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the central and southern portion by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Colne Valley water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk and before distribution to the consumers the water is under constant supervision of a chemical and bacteriological staff which carries out examinations in modern laboratories situated at the works. The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board is selected Thames water which has been subjected to purification by storage in which time it is freed of the bulk of organisms. It is filtered through rapid and then slow filters, attaining a degree of purity which compares favourably with the general supplies in Great Britain, but as a further safeguard terminal chlorination is applied which ensures a first class water in every respect. Samples of water are examined bacteriologically, chemically and for taste and other special purposes on every day. The supply to all areas was satisfactory in quality and quantity. Number of dwellinghouses supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to houses 44,700 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Number of population supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to houses 150,920 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Natural fluoride content of water supplies:- Colne Valley Water Company: Fluoride content - Nil Metropolitan Water Board: Fluoride content - 0.15 parts per million. The water supplied to Hendon is deficient in fluoride and dental decay is more prevalent here than in those areas where the element is present in optimum quantity. 43 HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Housing Officer for the following observations on the Council's building and development progress during the year and on the housing situation generally- "Council building and development in 1961 centred around the completion of the second and the commencement of the third phase of the New Brent Street Redevelopment Scheme. During the year a further 53 flats for families and 43 bed-sitting rooms for single persons were occupied at Lower Posters and Cheshir House, New Brent Street. The flats continue the trend of recent years in being multi-storey dwellings incorporating features of modern design. The bed-sitting rooms are located in a two-storey block with an accompanying community centre. This block is looked after by a resident caretaker and each bed-sitting room contains its own enclosed kitchen unit, it being an aim to permit residents to keep a suitable degree of independence and privacy whilst several units of accommodation are provided in an economical and agreeable form under one roof. An additional feature is a guest room for hire by residents to accommodate visitors overnight who could not conveniently share their own bed-sitting rooms. Redevelopment has also begun in Granville Road, Childs Hill and building is now going on of two point blocks of flats to give accommodation to 120 families during 1962. Elsewhere the acquisition of properties by the Council in areas needing redevelopment has resulted in many existing dwellings becoming available for housing purposes and forming a useful, if short term, addition to the pool of accommodation for the relief of overcrowding or other housing hardship. Movement of families from Hendon to the New and Expanded Towns proceeded steadily throughout 1961 and this Borough is now linked to thirteen outer housing authorities for the purpose of nominating suitable applicants from the Hendon area who can take up employment and settle with their families into permanent homes. Nearly one hundred applications were dealt with and given support during 1961. 486 applications were registered on the Housing Waiting List from families and a further 103 applications were recorded for Single Person's Accommodation throughout the year. As might be anticipated the largest groups of applicants comprised young married couples and persons of pensionable or approaching pensionable age. Cases of acute housing hardship at the time of application are relatively few but applicants frequently have in mind their need for improved accommodation at a later time and look to the Council as the foremost organisation to meet requirements in this respect. The Housing Waiting List at 31st December 1961 numbered 2808 married family 44 units and 352 unattached persons, a slight increase on the previous year's figures. Applicants assisted in the course of the year were as follows:- (a) Rehoused into permanent accommodation (pre-war) 36 (b) Rehoused into permanent accommodation (post-war) 65 (c) Tranferred to other accommodation so as to resolve cases of overcrowding or under-occupation of dwellings 201 PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION The following summary of the inspections, together with a report on the various duties performed by the Public Health Inspectors, has been submitted to me by Mr. F.H. Day, Chief Public Health Inspector. INSPECTIONS The following inspections were made during the year- General Public Health Inspections Number of Inspections Reinspections Dwelling-houses (in connection with defects or insanitary conditions) 2,887 5,030 Caravans 87 78 Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) 17 36 Drain Tests 376 - Drainage and Plumbing Works 529 2,237 Overcrowding 30 10 Pests 132 102 Vermin 130 45 Atmospheric Pollution Smoke Observations.

The institution of legal proceedings only became necessary in the following cases:- Charge Result Failure to pay cost of work carried out by The Defendant did not appear, and the the Council in clearing and repairing a drain Court made an order requiring him to pay in default, under Section 96, Hendon Urban the sum of £14.17.0 due plus £3.3.0 District Council Act, 1929. costs 47 Charge - continued Result - continued Failure to comply with Abatement Notice served The Magistrates agreed to the withdrawal under Section 93, Public Health Act, 1936 of the Summons as the nuisance had been (dampness of walls, rotted flooring etc.) abated by the time of the hearing.

HOUSING Inspection of dwelling houses during the year The following inspections were carried out- Total number of dwelling houses (not in Housing Areas) inspected at which defects were found requiring action under the Public Health or Housing Acts. 662 Number of dwelling houses inspected under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 - Number of houses surveyed in Housing Areas 824 48 Inspection of dwelling houses during the year'- continued Number of houses surveyed and reports submitted for use by District Valuer in connection with negotiations for acquisition by the Council 77 Total number of inspections and reinspections made 7,917 HOUSING ACT. 1957 Nine houses were dealt with under this Act, involving the making of 5 Demolition Orders and 4 Closing Orders. HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 Certificates of Unfitness were issued in respect of 35 houses in the Council's ownership. The acceptance of these Certificates by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government enables the Council to claim "slum clearance" subsidy in respect of houses or flats provided to rehouse the tenants of the houses. REHOUSING OP PERSONS FROM UNFIT HOUSES During the year 70 families comprising 166 persons vacated unfit properties, the majority being rehoused by the Council. UNFIT HOUSES MADE FIT AND HOUSES IN WHICH DEFECTS WERE REMEDIED The following houses were made fit or had defects remedied as a result of action taken:- After informal action 561 After formal action under (a) Public Health Acts 89 (b) Housing Act 1957 3 REDEVELOPMENT Surveys were carried out of the following areas and reports submitted as a result of which the areas have been declared by the Council to be "Housing Areas" scheduled for redevelopment within the next ten years. The majority of the dwellings in the areas were found to be unfit for human habitation or sub-standard 49 to an extent which rendered their improvement uneconomical. Area Number of Properties West Hendon, N.W.9. 439 Lichfield Road, N.W. 2. 43 Ridge Road, N.W.2. 22 The Hyde, N.W.9. 20 Church End, N.W.4. 129 SLUM CLEARANCE In 1956, local authorities were requested by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to resume slum clearance work, which work had ceased at the outbreak of war in 1939, and had not been recommenced in the post-war years because of the general shortage of houses. Since the work was resumed on 1st January, 1956 the following unfit houses or flats had been dealt with at 31st August, 1961. By Demolition Orders 62 By Closing Orders 89 By Certificates of Unfitness issued under the Housing Subsidies Act, 1956 or the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958 172 By acceptance of undertakings not to use for human habitation 6 TOTAL 329 A further survey carried out during the year showed that there remained (at 31st August, 1961) another 96 houses to be dealt with. It is estimated that the appropriate action in respect of these will have been completed by 31st March, 1963. It is unlikely, however, that this will be the end of slum clearance in the Borough. Properties continue to deteriorate and become obsolete and, as in pre-war years, their removal will be a continuing function of the Department. The worst housing conditions, however, now undoubtedly exist in houses let in multiple occupation and increasing attention must be given in the future to improving conditions in these houses. OVERCROWDING The following report on overcrowding for the year ended 31st December, 1961 50 was submitted to the Ministry of Health as required by the Public Health Officers Regulation, 1959. (a) Number of dwellings known to be overcrowded at end of year 11 Number of families dwelling therein 13 Number of persons dwelling therein 67 Equivalent number of persons dwelling therein (Section 77 Housing Act, 1957) 55½ (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during year 8 (c) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during year 6 Number of persons concerned 29 Equivalent number of persons concerned (Section 77, Housing Act, 1957) 24 (d) Cases in which dwelling-houses in respect of which Local Authority has taken steps for abatement of overcrowding and have again become overcrowded Nil It is very unlikely that the above represent the entire extent of the overcrowding in the Borough but they are the only cases known to the Department. These cases were brought to the Department's notice either by the tenants seeking to improve their "points" position on the Council's housing application list, by Hospital Authorities, or by owners endeavouring to secure possession of their properties on the grounds that they were overcrowded. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. RENT ACT, 1957 The following figures show the number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair and Revocation received and the action taken during the year. Application for Certificates of Disrepair. No. of applications for certificates 7 No. of decisions not to issue certificates 1 No. of decisions to issue certificates 4 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 2 (b) in respect of all defects 2 51 No. of applications outstanding at end of year 2 No. of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 3 No. of undertakings refused by Local Authority - No. of certificates issued 1 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates No. of applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 1 No. of objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates - No. of decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections - No. of certificates cancelled by Local Authority 2 (One certificate was in response to an application received in the previous year.) DRAIN TESTS The following tests of drainage systems and examinations of sanitary fitments etc. were carried out and reports thereon submitted during the year:- (a) for prospective purchasers of properties 9 (b) in connection with applications for advances for the purchase of properties under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. 283 TOTAL 292 For this service a fee, usually £2.2.0 is charged. This is no longer an economic charge and its increase is under consideration. In addition, 84 tests of drainage systems were carried out in connection with the investigation of nuisances. As a result of the above sanitary surveys the following works were carried out under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. 52 Main drains relaid or repaired 66 Branch drains relaid or repaired 210 Manholes reconstructed or repaired 234 Soil or ventilating pipes renewed or repaired 193 Fresh-air inlets renewed, repaired or removed 68 Sanitary fitments renewed 58 Gutters or rainwater pipes renewed or repaired 75 CLEARANCE OP CHOKED DRAINS The Council continued to operate its service for clearing drains at private premises, on request by owners or occupiers. The revised (1982) charges for this work are as follows:- During normal working hours 15.0. Evenings - Monday to Friday £1.10.0. Weekends £3. 0.0. During the year no less than 1,127 drains were cleared by the department's drainage operative in response to requests received. The use made of this service by householders continues to grow each year. In those instances where the drain cannot be cleared by rodding, the owner is advised to call in his own builder to open up and clear the drain or alternatively a notice is served under a local Act and the work carried out by the Borough Engineer & Surveyor's Department, the expenses being recovered from the owner. CESSPOOLS There are 142 cesspools or septic tank sewage disposal installations in the Borough, the majority being in the more rural areas. 276 requests for the emptying of the cesspools or septic tanks were complied with. Except in very few instances, the work was carried out free of charge. At the close of the year, consideration was being given to laying new soil sewers to serve the Burton Hole Lane, N.W.7. area. When completed such a scheme 53 would result in a reduction of 32 cesspools in the Borough, assuming that all the property owners agreed to connect their drainage to the new sewers. Cesspools can be, and are, at times, a serious nuisance and any steps taken to reduce their number are of benefit to the maintenance of the health of the public. CARAVANS CARAVAN SITES AND CONTROL OP DEVELOPMENT ACT, 1960 Caravans and caravan sites were dealt with during the year as follows:- Brent Terrace, N.W.2. Two caravans on unlicensed sites were removed by the owners as a result of informal action. Site, Parnell Close, One caravan took up position on this site. The Edgware occupier applied for Town Planning consent to remain on the site. The application was disapproved and after further representations to the occupier regarding his use of the site without a licence, the caravan was removed. Site, Brockley Hill, A site licence was granted for one caravan, subject Stanmore to conditions relating to the execution of works which were to be complied with within a period of six months. The conditions were not all complied with but the caravan ceased to be used for domestic purposes before the expiry of that time. Site, Brent Park Road, A site licence was granted for seven caravans N.W.9. ject to conditions relating to the provision of amenities and the execution of works, which conditions were to be complied with within a period of 18 months. The occupier has, however "run-down" the site so that it is now only occupied as winter quarters by members of the Showman's Guild of Great Britain, and so is exempt from the provisions of the Act relating to site licences. Site, The Broadway, This site was principally used by members of the West Hendon, N.W.9. Showman's Guild but also housed caravans of some who were not members or who remained permanently on the site throughout the year.The site was accordingly required to be licensed under the Act. The owner was met at the site and details of the works which would have to be carried out and the amenities provided before a licence could be granted explained to her.She intimated that she had been considering disposing of the site, and later its sale took place. The caravans vacated the site which was then closed down. Occasionally caravans pull on to the verges of trunk roads in the Borough but these are moved on without recourse to statutory action. 54 LOCAL LAND CHARGES ENQUIRIES During the year enquiries were received from the Town Clerk in respect of 3,379 properties. These related to action being taken under the Public Health, Housing or Rent Acts, inclusion in Smoke Control Areas or in Housing Areas. The necessary searches were made and the information supplied POLLUTION OP WATERCOURSES As a result of unsatisfactory samples taken by the Middlesex County Council Main Drainage Department from the outlets of surface water sewers discharging into watercourses, and of complaints regarding the presence of detergents on the water in the watercourses, a general survey was made during the year of properties in the Borough for the presence of sink and lavatory basins the waste pipes from which had incorrectly been made to discharge into surface water drainage systems. 294 such contraventions of the Public Health Act, 1936 were found and appropriate action taken to have the waste-pipes diverted so as to discharge into the soil drainage systems or, alternatively, to have the waste-pipes and fitments removed. PEST AND VERMIN ERADICATION Each year sees an increasing number of requests being received from householders for advice on the best means of eradicating a wide range of insect pests from their homes. The public health inspector of 20 - 30 years ago found himself dealing almost daily with bug and flea infestations but to-day, due to improved standards of domestic living, such infestations are infrequently met with. Not only would the modern housewife not tolerate their presence but she now seeks advice and assistance in eradicating any form of insect life she finds in her home. During the year requests were received for advice on (a) the identification and (b) the best means of eradicating ants, autumn flies, bees, book-lice, bugs, carpet beetles, clover-mite, cockroaches, fleas, flies, furniture mites, larder beetles, mosquitoes, moths, silverfish, wasps, wood boring beetles, and wood lice. Where bug or flea infestations are found, assistance is given to the householder, spraying with a suitable insecticide being carried out by the Council's operative. Wasps nests are also destroyed free of charge, a service which is very much in demand during the months of August and September. The work is carried out by one of the Council's rodent operatives. 55 In all other cases suitable advice on how to deal with the infestation is given by the Public Health Inspectors. The furniture, bedding and accommodation of families who are to take up occupation of Council houses or flats, or who are to be transferred to other Council-owned accommodation, is also inspected by the Public Health Inspectors prior to removal to ensure that they are vermin-free. During the year the following were dealt with- Wasps nests destroyed 355 Bug infestations eradicated 4 Plea infestations eradicated 3 Inspections prior to removal to Council accommodation 292 409 visits were paid to premises by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with the above. The Public Health Act, 1961 gave the Council new powers to take steps to abate or mitigate nuisances caused by pigeons, and at the close of the year steps were being taken to remove pigeons from the girders and buttresses of railway bridges where they were roosting and causing nuisances to passers-by. PREVENTION OP DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 RODENT CONTROL Rodent control at dwelling houses and business premises is carried out by a foreman, three whole-time and one part-time operatives working under the supervision of the District Public Health Inspectors and in accordance with recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food. The foreman and operatives attend refresher courses arranged by the Ministry from time to time to ensure that they are properly aware of the latest methods, and poisons, etc. in use. Treatment of sewers is carried out by the Borough Engineer & Surveyor's Department. In the case of dwelling-houses, treatment is undertaken by the Council free of charge. In the case of business premises, a charge based upon time, cost of materials and overhead expenses, is made. An estimate of the cost is prepared and submitted to the occupier of the business premises and it is open to him to either accept it, engage a private specialist firm or undertake the work himself. Almost invariably the Council's estimate is accepted. Should an occupier elect to do the work himself, the District Public Health Inspector ensures that the treatment is successfully carried out. 56 In a number of cases it was necessary to take steps to have removed accumulations of rubbish which had been harbouring rats, to have gardens or land cleared of excessive growth, or buildings made rat-proof. In one case only did the service of a statutory notice under the Act become necessary, all other work being carried out as a result of representations made by the Public Health Inspectors to the occupiers. Legal action did not become necessary in the case referred to. All of the rat infestations were by the common (brown) rat. Ship (black) rats have not been found in the Borough for several years. Details of the work carried out during the year, in the form required by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Pood is given in the following table. An infestation is considered to be "major" when more than 20 bodies are picked up after treatment. 57 TABLE XVI Prevention of damage by Pests Act, 1949 Twelve months ended 31st December, 1961 TYPE OP PROPERTY Non-Agricultural Agricultural (5) Local Authority (1) Dwelling houses (including Council houses) (2) All other (including business premises) (3) Total of 1, 2 and 3 (4) 1.

Bedding and clothing are disinfected at the disinfecting station at West Hendon Hospital by arrangement with the Regional Hospital Board. Library books at houses where cases of certain notifiable infectious diseases occur, are removed and disinfected before return to the library. Disinfection is also occasionally carried out at other premises to meet the wishes of an occupier. In such cases a charge is made for the service. Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad are disinfected on request and an appropriate accompanying certificate issued. During the year the following were dealt with:- Rooms 74 Bedding and/or clothing 179 Library books 118 Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad 45 DOMICILIARY LAUNDRY SERVICE A problem which arises in the case of aged and sick persons in their own homes, is the cleansing and laundering of soiled linen and clothing. Where such persons have no relative living with them who is able to deal with the articles, assistance is given under Section 84, Public Health Act, 1936 as amended by Section 42, Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. These Sections give the Council the necessary authority to have the articles collected and cleansed (laundered). During the year 12,734 articles were collected from the houses of 45 such incontinent persons. The articles are collected twice weekly and returned to them after laundering. The scheme frequently enables these people to remain in their homes instead of having to occupy beds in hospital which can therefore be put to more urgent and better use. 59 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937-1959 At the request of the Ministry of Health the tables showing the work carried out in the administration of the health provisions of the Factories Acts are given in the prescribed form as an annex to the report. The occupiers of factories are required to supply the Local Authority twice yearly with lists of the names and addresses of persons employed by them as outworkers, i.e. carrying out work in their own homes. These lists are submitted in February and August. The homes are then inspected by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that conditions there are suitable. 22 lists were received from employers in the Borough giving details of 91 outworkers. Of these 69 did not reside in the Borough and the appropriate details were forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned. In turn, notifications were received from other Local Authorities of 115 outworkers residing in Hendon but employed in factories elsewhere. The homes of all the outworkers were inspected and in only one instance were conditions found to be unsatisfactory, the workroom being in need of cleansing and redecoration. A notice was served and the necessary work carried out. PREMISES LICENSED FOR PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT In accordance with the usual annual procedure, inspections were made at the request of the Middlesex County Council of the sanitary conveniences, kitchens, etc., at hotels, church halls, cinemas, restaurants, etc., licensed for public entertainment. 47 premises were inspected. At 19 premises works of redecoration, cleansing or minor repairs were found to be necessary. The licensees were notified of these and by the end of the year all of the necessary works had been completed. Reports were submitted to the County Council on the conditions found. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS Inspections were completed of the 127 hairdressers' or barbers' establishments in the Borough. At 74 establishments conditions were found to be satisfactory. At 53 establishments matters were found requiring attention. 60 These included- Redecoration required 31 Floors or floor covering in need of repair or renewal 11 Repairs to premises required 9 Inadequate sanitary accommodation provided 2 Improved lighting or ventilation required 4 Refuse bins requiring renewal 5 Accumulations of rubbish requiring removal or general cleansing necessary 15 Chairs or equipment requiring repair or renewal 8 Instruments not being properly cleansed 2 Most of these matters were in hand by the end of the year. To comply with Section 282, Middlesex County Council Act, 1944 a copy of the Council's Byelaws has to be exhibited at the premises. These were printed in suitable form by the Council and distributed to the establishments for exhibition. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER PILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 The Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations 1981 came into operation on the 1st August 1961. They prescribed new standards or cleanliness for each kind of filling material used, and the form in which records are to be kept by occupiers of premises registered under the Act of the filling materials used by them. Four premises are registered under the Act. They were all inspected during the year and found to be conforming to the Act and Regulations. SWIMMING BATHS There are two municipal-owned and one privately-owned open air swimming baths in the Borough which are open to the public, and one school teaching swimming pool. Samples of the swimming bath water were taken from all during the summer months and submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination. 61 The following are the results of these samples- No.taken Results Mill Hill Swimming Bath 12 All satisfactory. West Hendon Swimming Bath 15 All satisfactory. Hendon Hall Hotel Swimming Bath 17 All satisfactory. Broadfields Junior School Swimming Bath 9 3 satisfactory. 6 unsatisfactory. Although the bacterial counts in the unsatisfactory samples were not unduly high, some further attention to the regulation of the chlorine input to this bath appears desirable. The following figures show the attendances at the two Municipal-owned baths during the opening season- West Hendon Mill Hill Adults 7,870 20,171 Children 21,096 62,972 Season Tickets 3,946 8,901 Schools- Middlesex County Council 7,077 14,159 Private 66 1,722 Hendon Swimming Club 1,921 Youth Club Tickets 42 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Nine applications were received for licences to keep pet shops. To ensure that suitable fire fighting equipment and adequate fire precaution arrangements existed at the premises the Public Health Inspectors were accompanied on their inspections by the Fire Prevention Officer, Middlesex County Council Fire Brigade, who made recommendations in some instances for the provision of more suitable equipment and provided "calling" cards for display at the premises giving precise instructions for calling the Fire Brigade in case of emergency. The recommendations were all adopted and, the premises being otherwise satisfactory, all licences were issued. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939 The riding establishments are inspected biannually by the Council's Veterinary Officer. One establishment closed down during the year leaving four other establishments having a total of 29 ponies and 3 donkeys. 62 All of the animals were found to be in good condition but the Veterinary Officer expressed concern at the conditions under which ponies and donkeys were kept at Ebenezer Mews, N.W.2. These stables are, however, to be pulled down in the very near future in connection with the redevelopment of the area, and new stables erected. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1956 Inspections were made during the year of all farms and other agricultural or horticultural premises in the Borough to ensure that the requirements of the Act relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for the use of workers, were being complied with. There are 13 such premises and at 11 conditions were found to be satisfactory. At the other two premises cleansing and minor repairs were found to be necessary and these later received attention. As a result of inspections in previous years all of the premises now have adequate and reasonably accessible sanitary conveniences for the workers. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACTS Foot-and-Mouth Disease No cases of foot-and-mouth disease occurred in or near the Borough during the year and no movement licence was issued. Swine Fever No cases of swine fever occurred in or near the Borough and no movement licence was issued. Fowl Pest One outbreak of fowl pest occurred at premises in the Borough on Christmas Eve. The entire poultry stock (approximately 1,000 birds) had to be slaughtered and the premises cleansed and disinfected under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Further minor outbreaks occurred in the same district early in 1962. The Movement of Animals (Records) Order, 1960 The Movement of Animals (Records) Amendment Order, 1961 came into operation on 9th August, 1961. It simplified the records to be kept when animals are moved from a stockholder's 63 premises direct to a slaughterhouse. In all other cases detailed records have to be kept and retained for a period of three years in the case of bovine animals and one year in the case of sheep, goats and pigs. These records are very useful when dealing with outbreaks of foot-and-mouth or other infectious diseases. All stockholders' premises were visited during the year to ensure that the proper records were being kept. Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order, 1957 During the year the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food drew attention to the fact that there was increasing evidence that outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever and fowl pest were being caused by animals and poultry being allowed access, either to raw waste foodstuffs or to waste which had not been properly boiled in accordance with the Order. The Order prohibits the feeding of unboiled waste food to certain animals and poultry and requires that all such food shall be boiled for at least one hour in plant licensed by the Local Authority. Ten licences have been granted to pig-keepers to operate plant under the order and inspections were accordingly made from time to time to ensure that the licence conditions were being complied with. No infringements were noted. Inspections can, however, only be infrequent and one wonders whether in view of the vast sums spent on compensation for animals slaughtered in foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, and poultry in fowl pest outbreaks, the time has not arrived for legislation to require swill and waste food to be collected and treated at central processing plants and delivered to the stockholders' premises only after processing. During the year, two licences were revoked, the businesses having closed down, and one licence was transferred to a new owner. Importation of Dogs and Cats Order, 1928 There is an establishment at Mill Hill licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and used for the detention and isolation of imported dogs undergoing quarantine. The establishment is run by veterinary surgeons and is licensed for the detention of 35 dogs at any one time. During the year, 74 dogs were received at the premises after being authorised to land in this country. The dogs are kept strictly isolated from all other dogs during the six months period of quarantine. 64 The premises are kept under observation by the Police and the Council's Diseases of Animals Inspector to check on the presence and isolation of the dogs. As a result of careful and strict observance of the Importation Order, no rabies has been confirmed in this country since 1922. 65 SECTION E FOOD ADMINISTRATION INSPECTION OP POOD PREMISES FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 The following table classifies the various premises in the Borough at which food is manufactured, prepared or sold, and shows the number of inspections and reinspections made. Premises Inspections Reinspections Bakehouses 23 45 34 Bakers and Confectioners 55 40 18 Butchers 95 249 158 Caterers Production Kitchen 1 7 - Confectioners (Sweets) 138 61 24 Dairies & Milk Distributors 51 47 4 Fishmongers 31 51 34 Greengrocers & Fruiterers 61 85 147 Grocers & Provisions Merchants 194 225 139 Hawkers' Storage Premises 18 64 11 Hotels, Restaurants & Cafes 124 181 183 Ice Cream -Premises registered for manufacture or sale 183 233 177 Licensed Premises 44 44 123 Preserved Foods -Premises registered for preparation of (a) Preparation of Sausages 5 (b) Brining of meat 34 37 18 (c) Frying of fish 9 School Meals Kitchens 21 21 9 School Meals Centres 29 29 - Works Canteens 49 35 13 66 MATTERS POUND REQUIRING ATTENTION During the course of the above inspections the following were found requiring attention. These were brought to the notice of the occupiers of the premises and in all cases the necessary works or improvements were carried out or were in hand at the end of the year without recourse to legal action. Cleansing and redecoration of walls or ceilings required 65 General repairs required 23 Choked or defective drains 14 Sanitary conveniences not properly maintained 41 Unsatisfactory washing arrangements for use of persons handling food 36 Refrigerators requiring repair 3 Unsatisfactory arrangements for storage of refuse 43 Inadequate facilities for washing food and equipment 11 Unsuitable equipment used in connection with handling or preparation of food 8 Dirty conditions 4 Adequate first-aid materials not provided 3 Suitable accommodation for employees' outdoor clothing not provided 10 Suitable notices not displayed requiring washing of hands after using sanitary conveniences 26 Persons engaged in handling of food smoking whilst so engaged 1 Pood not properly protected from risk of contamination 21 Adequate lighting of food preparation rooms not provided 8 Insufficient ventilation to store rooms or lobbies 7 NEW PREMISES An arrangement exists whereby all plans deposited with the Borough Engineer & Surveyor for new food premises or for alterations to existing premises are passed to the Chief Public Health Inspector for his observations in connection with the enactments which will apply when the premises become occupied. 67 This co-operation has resulted in many improvements in design, lay-out and equipment being incorporated in the work so raising the general standard of hygiene at the premises and avoiding the possible necessity of the Public Health Inspector having to ask for additional works or the provision of additional equipment etc., when the premises have come into use and subject to the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. The arrangement is welcomed by shop-keepers and their Architects, the Public Health Inspectors as a result of their experience in dealing with the different types of food premises, often being in a position to make recommendations which not only improve the standard of hygiene but also give better working conditions at the premises. COMPLAINTS OP FOREIGN BODIES IN POODS Eight complaints were made to the Department during the year and below are details of the action taken. Complaint Action Selling two packets of dried fruit Legal proceedings taken against mixture containing larvae and retailer under Section 2, Food excreta of currant moth and Drugs Act 1955. Defendant pleaded guilty and Magistrates imposed fine of £15 and awarded the Council £3.3.0. costs. Selling chocolate cake containing fly Legal proceedings taken against manufacturers under Sections 2 and 113, Food and Drugs Act 1955. Defendants pleaded guilty and Magistrates imposed fine of £20 and awarded the Council £3.3.0 costs. Selling packet of Matzo Meal containing Legal proceedings taken against Mediterranean Flour Moth manufacturers under Sections 2 and 113,Food and Drugs Act,1955. Defendants pleaded guilty and Magistrates imposed fine of £5 and awarded the Council £5.5.0 costs. Selling bridge rolls later found to As amount of mould was contain spots of mould tively slight and as there was difficulty in assessing responsibility between baker and retailer, warning letters were sent to both. 68 Complaint Action Selling sausage containing "piece of As the "string" was established as string" being type of cotton thread used by the manufacturers in the machines for the production of sausages and appeated to be sterile, it was decided not to institute legal proceedings but to send warning letter to manufacturer. Selling loaf of bread containing As it was established that the portion of string ence of the string from a bag of flour was due to a temporary mechanical breakdown in the plant at the bakery, legal proceedings were not instituted but a warning letter was sent to the bakers. Selling jar of jam containing insect As the jam was prepared and packed in Hungary and as the retailer could not have known of the presence of the insect in the jam, legal proceedings were not instituted but warning letters were sent both to the importers and the retailer. Selling loaf of bread contained Tests showed that the needle was needle not present in the loaf at the time of baking and as the evidence in the case was uncertain, it was decided to take no further act ion. CONDEMNED POODS The following shows the amounts of foodstuffs condemned during the year as unfit for human consumption. It is rarely nowadays that an Inspector finds unsound food displayed or intended for sale. All of the food detailed below was condemned as a result of requests received from retailers to inspect the food which had become unfit from such causes as breakdown of refrigerators at weekends or delay or damage in transit. Condemned foods are disposed of by incineration at the Council's Refuse Disposal Works. 69 LIST OP FOODSTUFFS CONDEMNED DURING 1961 Meat 3826 lbs (including Beef,Chicken,Duck, Lamb, Offal,Pork,Rabbit, Sausages,Bacon,Ham and Turkey) 2 pkts Sausages Fish 3 stones Kippers Tinned Food Fish 19 Fruit 292 Fruit Juice 18 Ham 32 (328 lbs 4 ozs) Jam 5 Meat 118 Milk 25 Paste 1 Pudding 2 Soup 3 Vegetables 142 Frozen Foods Cakes 54 Fish 502 pkts Fishcakes 65 ” Fruit 76 ” Ice Cream- prepacked -various 159 " Meat 528 " Mousse 173 " Pasties 7 " Pastry 94 " Pies 10 " Potatoes 33 " Sausages 22 " Trifles 13 " Vegetables 945 " Waffles 18 " Yorkshire Pudding 143 ” 70 Miscellaneous Goods Beetroot 2 jars Biscuits 16 pkts Butter Beans 1 pkt Calves Foot Jelly 1 jar Caviar Type 1403 jars Cheese 32¾ lbs Coconut 11 lbs Coffee 1 jar Fish 2 jars Flour 18 lbs Jam 112 jars Marshmallows 313 pkts 1620 in cartons 274¼ lbs loose Pearl Barley 1 pkt Pickles 31 jars Rice 2 tins 5 lbs loose Yoghurt 24 cartons FOOD POISONING -SAMPLES The following samples were taken, either in connection with the investigation of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning outbreaks or as routine sampling of foods found in the past to have been associated with such outbreaks. Dessicated Coconut 18 Satisfactory 17 Containing food poisoning organisms 1 The stock of coconut from which the unsatisfactory sample was taken, was removed from the Bakehouse and destroyed and the matter taken up with the suppliers. Most of the dried coconut imported into this country comes from Ceylon, and is used widely in making sweets, biscuits, cakes and pastries and is often used in the raw state to decorate cakes, custards, trifles and jellies. Although the number of organisms present in the coconut may be small, there is a danger that when they come into contact with other foods under warm, moist conditions their growth may be extensively promoted, and food poisoning in the consumer result. It is essential, therefore, that supplies should be of high bacterial 71 standard and, in order to achieve this, much stricter bacteriological control of imports of coconut is now undertaken at the ports of entry, and Ceylonese producers have been advised by the Ceylon Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research on methods to prevent the contamination of the product there. Heat treatment of the coconut in this country before use is now also being undertaken. Marshmallows 44 As a result of a report that food poisoning organisms had been found in dessicated coconut used in the manufacture of a batch of marshmallows held by a well-known firm of retailers, all stocks at branches in the Borough were withdrawn from sale and samples taken for bacteriological examination. When it was ascertained that two samples contained food poisoning organisms, all stocks were collected and destroyed. When new stocks were delivered these were sampled and found to be satisfactory. Chinese Whole Egg and Egg Albumin 2 These were both found to be free from food poisoning organisms. These commodities, which are supplied in tins, have been found in the past to be contaminated with food poisoning organisms. Peanut Butter 1 Marzipan 1 These samples were taken from houses where suspected food poisoning had occurred. No food poisoning organisms were found in the samples. Swabs from uneviscerated poultry in shops 533 Minced beef, sausages, sweetbreads, offal etc. 145 These swabs and samples were taken in connection with a survey being carried out by the Central Public Health Laboratory Service to determine the proportion of poultry on retail sale infected with food poisoning organisms and the extent of the risk of cross-contamination to other foodstuffs. The survey was conducted in Hendon and Finchley. In all, 1046 cloacal swabs from chickens were taken and examined and the infection rate found to be low (0.3 per cent). Swabs from 12 turkeys were negative and 5 (25 per cent) of 20 from ducks were found to be infected with salmonella. The risk of cross-contamination to other foods from chickens and turkeys is therefore very small, but as it appeared that ducks eviscerated in retail shops may be an important source of salmonella, it was arranged that in 1962 an investigation of these on a larger scale should be carried out. 72 MILK & DAIRIES (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1959 The large milk bottling establishment at Claremont Road, N.W.2. was frequently inspected during the year and 120 bottles were taken at random from the bottlewashing machines after having been subjected to the washing and sterilizing processes. These bottles were subjected to bacteriological examination with the following results:- Satisfactory 119 Unsatisfactory 1 The unsatisfactory sample was taken from a new machine put into use very shortly before the sample was taken. Subsequent samples from the same machine were satisfactory. The 10 depots from which milk is distributed by roundsmen and the 40 shop premises from which milk is retailed were all inspected during the year. All are registered with the Council under the Regulations. Although only bottled milk is sold from the shops, other foods are retailed and complete inspections under the Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, were made. At 39 premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. At 11 premises works were found to be necessary to deal with the following:- Provision of proper washing facilities for use by members of staff handling food 5 Provision of sink for washing of equipment 1 Provision of "Wash Your Hands" notice in watercloset 1 General repairs 6 Redecoration 4 Improved ventilation 1 Lack of cleanliness 1 Six samples of milk were taken from vending machines, four in connection with a complaint that a machine was delivering sour milk. Although the samples taken were all sound, it was ascertained that the machine was not being serviced correctly by the retailer with the result that some cartons were being kept unduly long in the machine. The matter was taken up with both the suppliers and the retailer. The servicing of the machine was undertaken by the suppliers, all 73 unsold being removed daily and replaced by fresh cartons. No difficulties were experienced with the other milk vending machines in the Borough. During the year five new premises were registered, and seven removed from the register, the sale of milk therefrom having ceased. ICE CREAM At the end of the year there were 183 premises registered for the sale or manufacture of ice cream, 36 new registrations having been made during the year. In addition ice cream is sold at several hotels, restaurants and cinemas. These premises are not subject to registration. 336 samples of ice cream were taken and submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory Service for bacteriological examination and grading according to the Ministry of Health's Provisional Grading Scheme, with the following results: - Grades 1 and 2 are satisfactory. Grade 3 calls for investigation of the methods of production and/or handling. Grade 4 is unsatisfactory. No.of Samples taken Results Prepacked 120 Grade 1 11 2 - 3 - 4 Semi-wrapped 5 1 1 3 Loose 106 1 33 2 28 3 32 4 336 336 The results show that prepacked ice cream is of excellent bacteriological standard, but experience has shown that constant supervision needs to be exercised over the majority of premises and mobile vans from which loose ice cream is sold in order to maintain satisfactory standards. 74 LICENSED PREMISES Inspections were carried out of the 44 licensed premises in the Borough, and reports submitted to the Licensing Justices on the conditions found. These reports are considered by the Justices at the Brewster Sessions when applications for renewal of existing, or for new licences, are dealt with. This is an annual procedure. Twenty of the premises were found to be satisfactory. At the other 24 premises, works were found to be necessary which related principally to Redecoration of bars or dining rooms 10 Repairs, cleansing or redecoration of sanitary conveniences 13 Cleansing or redecoration of cellars 5 Cleansing, redecoration or repairs to kitchens or provision or renewal of equipment therein 10 Improvement of personal washing facilities for members of staff 3 General repairs 8 Subsequent visits are paid by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the necessary works are carried out, and the Clerk to the Justices is notified when they are completed. PREMISES REGISTERED FOR PREPARATION OR MANUFACTURE OF SAUSAGES OR POTTED, PRESSED, PICKLED OR PRESERVED FOOD INTENDED FOR SALE At the end of the year 48 premises were registered for the following purposes:- Roasting of Chickens 6 Preparation of Sausages &c. 5 Brining of Meat 34 Cooking of Meat 10 Frying of Fish 9 Curing of Fish 4 (Some premises are registered for more than one purpose). Five new premises were registered, and 20 premises which were found to have ceased to be used for the purpose for which they were registered, were removed from the register. One registration was transferred to a new occupier. 75 All of the premises were inspected during the year. At 16 various matters were found requiring attention, i.e. repairs, redecoration, new refuse receptacles required, personal washing facilities for staff inadequate, sanitary accommodation not clean, and food not properly protected against contamination. Particular attention was paid to the brining of meat. Five premises were found to be using galvanised iron brine containers with the consequent risk of zinc poisoning. These were changed to rigid polythene containers. At four others the brine was found not to be of sufficient strength to avoid survival and growth of pathogenic organisms. All shopkeepers where brining is carried out are advised to have salometers so that weekly checks can be made of the brine to ensure that its salt content does not drop too low. No statutory action had to be taken in connection with these premises during the year. HAWKERS Eighteen premises used by hawkers for the storage of food are registered with the Council. These were inspected and generally found to be maintained in a satisfactory condition. The register of hawkers was revised during the year and 23 names were removed after it had been ascertained that the hawkers were no longer trading in the Borough. Eight new hawkers were registered, the total on the register at the end of the year being 45. These are classified as follows:- Fruit and Vegetables 35 Fish 5 Fried fish and chips 1 Shellfish 2 Ice cream 1 Dairy produce 1 45 SCHOOL MEALS KITCHENS AND CANTEENS Swabs from utensils and crockery after washing Samples of washing and rinse waters To check on the efficiency of methods of washing and sterilising crockery 76 and utensils at school canteens, finished articles can be swabbed with sterile swabs and these examined in the laboratory and their bacterial content determined. The sterile cotton wool swabs, on wooden applicators, are wiped over the surface of the articles. It is usual to swab five of each type of article and for the average results to be taken. No bacteriological standards have been laid down in this Country for the examination of canteen and restaurant crockery and cutlery but the United States Public Health Service, which has carried out considerable research work in this field and whose Inspectors carry out regular routine tests at restaurants, cafes, etc. (which are registered) consider that the washing and sterilising methods are satisfactory if the number of organisms recovered per article does not exceed 100. This is generally considered in this Country to be a very high standard. Samples are also taken of the washing and sterilising waters in use and these are considered satisfactory if the total colony count does not exceed 500 colonies per 1 ml and the presumptive coliform test is negative. 24 school meals kitchen or centres were visited during the year and from each were taken swabs from five dinner plates, five spoons and five forks after washing and sterilising, and samples of the washing water and rinse waters in use. At five schools it was found that sterilising sinks had not yet been installed. Where these are available, the articles, after being washing in water at a temperature of 110° - 120°P (43° - 49°C) to which a suitable detergent/steriliser has been added, are placed in racks or trays in a second sink containing water at a temperature of about 180°P(82°C). This not only destroys any bacteria remaining on the articles but also raises the articles to a temperature which renders subsequent cloth-drying, with its risk of re-contamination, unnecessary. Of the 87 batches of crockery or cutlery swabbed, 77 conformed to the standard but 10 results called for investigation of, and improvement in the methods adopted. In these cases it was stressed that (a) as much waste food as is reasonably possible should be scraped from plates etc., before they are placed in the washing water. If undue quantities are allowed to enter the water the action of the steriliser is expended in dealing with the bacterial content of these instead of acting on the utensils, (b) washing water should not be allowed to remain in use too long before changing and it should be kept at a suitable temperature, (c) the correct quantity of detergent/steriliser should be added, (d) the articles should be allowed to remain immersed for a sufficient length of time in the sterilising sink and the temperature of the water in that sink retained at approximately 180°F (82°C). After these matters had been given attention, five schools were re-visited and further swabs taken. All showed a considerable improvement on the first swabbing. It is hoped to extend this work to privately-run hotels, restaurants, etc., but this is governed by the extent to which the Central Public Health Laboratory is able to co-operate, as the Laboratory supplies the necessary equipment for the tests and carries out the bacteriological examinations. 77 THE MEAT (STAINING AND STERILISATION) REGULATIONS, 1960 Inspections were carried out at all pet food stores to ensure that any unfit meat from slaughterhouses or meat from Knackers' yards on sale had been sterilised, or stained with an approved green dye in accordance with the Regulations. In each case it was found, however, that the fresh meat on sale was either horseflesh fit for human consumption coming from slaughterhouses where the carcases had been properly inspected and passed as fit for human consumption by a Public Health Inspector, or frozen horseflesh imported from abroad and accompanied by a Veterinary Certificate approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Pood. 26 samples of sterilised dehydrated meat were taken for bacteriological examination. 24 were satisfactory but 2 were found to contain food poisoning organisms, to which the attention of the Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which the dehydrated meat was prepared was drawn. The introduction of contaminated pet food can easily lead to an outbreak of food poisoning in a household. The housewife frequently handles the pet meat, and utensils and knives contaminated by the pet meat may later be used to prepare human food. Preparation is also often carried out in the kitchen where the sink or the draining board may become contaminated and pet foods have also been found stored in a household refrigerator alongside human food. Owners of pets would be well-advised to keep pet meat, whether fresh or dehydrated, separate from human food at all times, prepare it with utensils kept for that purpose in a place where domestic food does not enter, and to wash their hands thoroughly afterwards. I am indebted to Mr. John O' Keefe, O.B.E., Chief Officer, Public Control Department, Middlesex County Council for the following report on the work carried out by his Department in the Borough of Hendon in the sampling of food and drugs and in the administration of the Merchanidse Marks Acts, 1887 - 1953 and the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. POOD AND DRUGS SAMPLING "Samples procured in the Borough of Hendon during the year 1961 - Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 111 1 Butter 44 - Cheese 6 1 Cream 28 - Drugs 38 2 Fish and Fish Products 10 - Fruit (Fresh and Canned) 22 5 Fruit (Dried) 13 - Ice cream 22 - Liver 6 - Margarine 16 - 78 Continued Meat & Meat Products 115 4 Preserves 4 - Sausages 6 - Soft Drinks and Fruit Drinks 10 3 Spirits 14 - Sweets 4 - Vegetables 9 - Vinegar and N.B.C. 62 - Miscellaneous 19 1 TOTALS 559 17 With regard to those samples noted in the table as unsatisfactory I have the following comments:- MILK A cafe proprietor sold in glasses of milk not cows' milk but a compounded article made from dried skimmed milk which whilst suitable for use in a beverage such as tea or coffee cannot be sold as "milk". An official caution was sent to the seller. DRUGS One of the unsatisfactory drug samples was of tablets containing fluoride procured at your request. You will recall that the tablets contained less sodium fluoride than was claimed on the label and that the deficiency was due to the use by the manufacturer of raw material of insufficiently high purity. An official caution was sent to the manufacturer. The other unsatisfactory drug sample was of "reducing perles" in respect of which a false claim was made as to slimming properties. The manufacturer withdrew the product when he was challenged as to its efficiency as a slimming aid. CHEESE A sample of soft cream cheese was found to be deficient in milk fat. The manufacturers were sent a letter of caution. FRUIT Two samples of Clementines and three of grapefuit which in each case were claimed to be "seedless" on examination were all found to contain substantial numbers of seeds. Official cautions were sent to the sellers. MEAT Pour samples of minced beef from three different butchers were found to 79 contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative substance not permitted in meat. In each case the sellers were prosecuted and fines totalling £50 were imposed, and the defendants were ordered to pay a total of £27.4.0d. in costs. SOFT DRINKS Three samples of imported vitaminised apple Juice were found to be seriously deficient of the amount of vitamin 'C' claimed for them. The importer was sent a letter of caution. MISCELLANEOUS A sample of potato crisps were described on the label as "starch reduced". A comparative analysis was made with another brand of potato crisps. The analyses showed a reduction in carbohydrates from 50% to 48%, a quite insignificant reduction. A letter of caution was sent to the manufacturers and to the sellers. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS. 1887-1953 Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication or origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 216 premises and a total of 678 displays were examined. Minor breaches of the Orders were dealt with by verba] warnings. There was one infringement where a retailer had exposed for sale a solution of acetic acid correctly so labelled but on the bottle of which the words "genuine malt vinegar" were embossed. A letter of caution was sent to the manufacturer. SAFE MILK Five samples of raw milk were procured in your borough and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. Prom the 1st January, 1961 the County Council became the licensing authority for the issue of licences to dealers with premises within its area and 56 such licences were issued in respect of the sale of milk to which the special designations "pasteurised", "sterilised", and "tuberculin tested" could be applied. The period for which these licences were granted has been extended from one year to five years. Fifty-three samples of milk were obtained to test that heat treatment and subsequent storage were properly carried out. One sample was unsatisfactory by reason of its failure on the "methylene blue test". Subsequent investigation showed that the sample was of raw milk produced on a farm in Hendon which had not been sold in rotation but had been kept for 24 hours longer than it should have been. The prescribed notice under section 44(2) was sent to the seller. 80 The County Council continue to license those premises at which milk is processed, 1 being issued for plants in your borough. Twenty-nine inspections of premises were made to ensure proper compliance with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. THE LABELLING OP POOD ORDER, 1953 The Labelling of Food Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. In the Borough of Hendon a total of 201 premises were visited and 620 items of food were examined for compliance with the Order. Two infringements were disclosed. One of these was a case in which "Corn Oil" was displayed for sale in a bottle on which the label did not disclose a sufficient address. A letter of caution was sent to the manufacturer. The other concerned a tin of sterilised cream which was described as "cream" without the modifying word "sterilised". A letter of caution was sent to the importers. LABELLING & ADVERTISING INFRINGEMENTS In addition to the detail given above, a considerable volume of work was done in the period under review, which did not arise from samples procured in the Borough of Hendon, but which had the effect of protecting the residents in each county district. The matters dealt with were in respect of nationally retailed articles of food. Several manufacturers were required to designate the ingredients on labels of Instant Coffee. As a result of a complaint of the taste of a soft drink, investigations made in my Department showed that there was phenolic contamination which arose from a chemical reaction between chlorinated water and the phenol formaldehyde stopper. The manufacturer has modified the ingredients of this product to prevent the chemical reaction. The manufacturer of a non-alcoholic wine was challenged on the ground that the description was a contradiction in terms, and the label was amended to 'nonalcoholic beverage'. The importer of a slimming food was challenged on claims made In advertising literature as to the Vitamin concentration, and the literature was corrected. The slimming claims made for a lemon juice in a television advertisement were modified after the manufacturer had been challenged as to the efficiency of the product as a slimming agent. 81 Modifications to the labels of several brands of canned chicken were secured, where it was not apparent from the label that the contents of the cans were not solely chicken in jelly or broth." 82 SECTION F Atmospheric Pollution SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Work proceeded steadily throughout the year in connection with the formation of Smoke Control Areas under the Clean Air Act, 1956. The position at the end of the year regarding these Areas was as follows:- Area No.l (Elstree and parts of Edgware) The Order controlling this area came into operation on 1st September, 1960, but works of adaptation to fireplaces were still taking place in 1961. Of the 658 properties in the area, adaptations to or conversion of fireplaces were necessary at 122. Despite repeated letters and visits by the Public Health Inspectors very few occupiers of the houses concerned had submitted schemes for approval by the date of the coming into operation of the Order. To enable those who delayed in submitting their proposals still to claim grant towards the costs of the works, the Council, as this was the first area in the Borough, agreed to the service of Statutory Notices under the Act. This was continued until 30th June, 1961 by which time the Council thought that every reasonable opportunity had been given to occupiers to deal with any necessary adaptations. Even so, by this date out of a possible 192 adaptations at 122 premises, only 71 at 48 premises were carried out and claims for grants made. At the remaining 74 premises the position is as follows:- Work carried out but householder did not bother to claim grant 6 Work carried out but no grant paid as conditions of grant were not fulfilled e.g. work not up to required standard 4 Householders burning "premium" smokeless fuels in existing unapproved appliances 15 Portable gas, electric or oil heaters being used instead of fireplaces 25 Central heating installed 14 Premises to be demolished 10 Those relying on the fact that "premium" smokeless fuels can easily be burned in ordinary stool bottom grates may, if supplies of these fuels become not so readily available due to the increase in the numbers of smoke control areas, find themselves in difficulty if they are at times only able to obtain coke, which will not burn readily in these grates. On no occasion, however, has any contravention of the provisions of the Act relating to the emission of smoke from chimneys been noticed in the area. 83 Smoke Control Area No. 2 (Hampstead Garden Suburb) The Order controlling this area was submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year and was confirmed on 18th January, 1962. The Order is to come into operation on the 1st October, 1962. The area, which is 446 acres in extent, contains 2,554 dwellings and 90 other premises. Adaptations to fireplaces were found to be necessary at 1,273 dwellings. Apart from the usual notices in the local press, on notice-boards posted in the area, notices accompanying rate demands, every householder where adaptations were necessary was written to, outlining the steps to be taken to claim grant, and supplied with the necessary forms. Arrangements were also made for a visit over a period of one week to various positions in the area of the mobile exhibition unit of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. This unit demonstrates various types of appliances actually in use, and is staffed by technical specialists who are available to give advice on any problems relating to the use of solid smokeless fuel. Arrangements were also made for talks to be given to local organisations. It is hoped by these means to obtain a much better response by way of adaptation of fireplaces than in Area No. 1. Smoke Control Area No.3 (Claremont Road Estate) The Order controlling this area was submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year and confirmed by him on 9th March, 1962. The Order is to come into operation on 1st October, 1962. This is a smaller area covering 125 acres, made principally to cover the Council's Housing Estate at Claremont Road. In all, 194 adaptations of fireplaces are required. Arrangements have also been made for the mobile exhibition unit to visit this area so that the tenants may receive instruction and advice in the use of solid smokeless fuels. Surveys of Areas No.4 (West Hendon and The Hyde), No.5 (Clitterhouse Estate) and No.6 (Granville Road and Cloister Road Estates) were in progress at the end of the year. INDUSTRIAL PREMISES 494 observations were made by the Public Health Inspectors of the chimneys of industrial or commercial premises during the year. The number of emissions of smoke noted which contravened the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956 was relatively small and all were satisfactorily dealt with without recourse to statutory action. 84 MEASURMENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Measurements of the smoke and sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere are taken by most local authorities at various sites in their areas in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Readings of the instruments are taken daily and the reports submitted monthly to the Department. Published lists of the readings are then issued. By this means, not only can a local authority note the progress it is making in its efforts to produce a cleaner atmosphere but it can also make comparisons with local authorities of all types throughout the country. The relationship between air pollution and the incidence of respiratory and other diseases in an area can also be considered. The dust and grit which is sometimes emitted from industrial chimneys, whilst it may be a serious nuisance to the occupiers of premises on which it falls, is of no great significance to public health as the particles are too coarse to reach the human lung. The smoke, however, which is extracted from the atmosphere and measured in the smoke-measuring apparatus consists of very small particles, small enough to remain airborne indefinitely and capable of passing the natural defence mechanisms of the nose and throat and reaching the lungs. These particles come principally from the smoke of domestic chimneys burning bituminous fuel. For a period of 24 hours, air containing this smoke is drawn through a filter in the measuring apparatus upon which the particles are collected. The darkness of the stain on the filter pad is them measured in a reflectometer and from this reading is calculated the concentration of smoke in the air. Sulphur dioxide, which is derived from the sulphur present in coal and in fuel oils, is an important gaseous pollutant and its measurement is recorded as, combined with smoke particles, it can seriously injure buildings and fabrics. There is, as yet, no known economical method available of removing sulphur from fuel or from flue gases. This Council operates three smoke measuring stations at sites approved by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research i.e. at Golders Green, Mill Hill and Edgware Branch Libraries. The Director of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research advised a change in the method of recording the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide in order that an international standard of comparison could be obtained, and the daily averages of smoke and sulphur dioxide are now recorded in microgrammes per cubic metre. In this report the records for the years 1957 to 1960 have been converted to these new standards and the tables show the gradual change that has occurred since smoke and sulphur dioxide measurements were first made in Hendon in 1957. 85 The rate of improvement in the cleanliness of the air cannot be constant as it must always be related to several variable factors - more fuel will be used in very cold weather, the air will be dirtier in periods of calm - however when looked at over a period of several years the pattern of improvement is encouraging. 86 TABLE DAILY AVERAGE OP SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE AT EDGWARE MILL HILL AND GOLDERS GREEN MEASURING STATIONS (Microgrammes per cubic metre) Jan.
