Members of Committees 5 3. Staff of Public Health Department 6 iii 2 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Erith. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting my first report, I have to thank you for the very real help which you have given me during my first year of office. It is always a difficult one and I found many problems which were successfully solved by the confidence you placed in me. Two important additions to the health services were introduced with your encouragement. Firstly, the appointment of two part-time obstetricians, Drs. Carrie and Daly, to the Medical Staff of Hainault Maternity Home, and the adjustment of fees to include medical attention to those who had no doctor or were unable to afford it. I considered it unsatisfactory that a home like Hainault should be run without expert medical assistance within immediate call. It was a great worry to the Matron that she might not obtain a doctor in an emergency were he out on his rounds. The whole-time medical staff were fully occupied in the clinics and not always instantly available. Now Matron has always one doctor who will be instantly available, at any time of the day or night. The arrangement is working very satisfactorily and I feel we are very lucky to have the expert services of two such first class medical men. Erith and district has always been notorious for its mosquito menace during the summer, and your introduction of the Pest Control Service to control all domestic pests is praiseworthy. The results have been beyond expectations, mosquitos being almost exterminated from the borough and rats down to 50 per cent. of the former population. The infectious disease incidence was average, showing no great variation. The epidemic of poliomyelitis and encephalitis, which reached such alarming proportions in the rest of the country hardly effected Erith. Only six cases of poliomyelitis and one of encephalitis were notified and received treatment. Of these seven cases, five were under five years of age. It is difficult to arrive at the reasons for the comparative immunity obtaining here. Many factors must be at work, but general good health and therefore good immunity must 3 be at least half responsible. One cannot pretend that the population of Erith has better health than any other community, nor can one say that the infecting agent and the media of infection were any less. Perhaps our vigorous attack on flies which showed an abnormal increase in numbers was a contributory factor. There is another explanation of the comparative absence of the paralytic type and that is the number of occult or mild cases which were diagnosed as flu', cold, tonsilitis, etc., which never progressed to the paralytic stage to come under observation as Poliomyelitis. Although measures were taken to combat infection in the shape of closing the paddling pool, communal cup drinking fountains, banning Tonsilectomy and other sanitary procedures, we can feel relieved that Erith was not stricken as elsewhere. As mentioned later in the report, Smallpox advanced very near in that we had six close contacts with the Bilston, Staffs. outbreak. Here again we escaped when all the facts pointed to a certainty that cases might be expected. The Maternity and Child Welfare Services are as popular as ever. We, unfortunately, lost the services of Mr. O'Sullivan our Consulting Gynaecologist, who has been helping us for many years. We were fortunate, however, to secure the services of Mr. Fouracre Barns of Queen Mary's Hospital, Stratford and the ante-natal clinics continued as before, without interruption. In view of the continued high incidence of prematurity, the health visitors, at my instigation, have been seeing the new mothers more often in their own homes by extra visits. This was to find evidence to support a view I have held that a deep-seated psychological factor may be present. Much development has taken place in psychosomatic medicine in recent years, accelerated no doubt by the needs of war and I think that a mother carrying her first child in these post war years of economic recovery is more unstable emotionally, due to war experience, than her pre-war counterpart. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the advent of a child to such a mother raises many fears and thoughts of a private character that would cause her physical state to deteriorate and influence the development of the child or the course of her pregnancy. The health visitors get much private information at a mother's home that would not be divulged in a clinic. They are able then to dispel many prepositions, fears and fancies in a mother's mind that arrive 4 there, not only from wrong thinking but put there by meddling outsiders who, because they have had children, feel fully qualified to give this often damaging advice. Unfortunately, results, if any, that we get cannot be assessed scientifically but they might encourage us to go on. This is the last year I will be able to report upon the Maternity and Child Welfare Services because, by the time this report is in print, the services will have been handed over to the Kent County Council as the new Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. It is indeed a sad blow to all of you who have been so long responsible for the Services, and have taken endless pains in their development and improvement. An authority that can boast that 80 per cent. of the children born within its boundaries attend the welfare clinics has something to be proud of. We sincerely hope that the standard of efficiency and the personal and intimate contact between the people and the welfare centre staff will continue, although one always has a fear that the community spirit that makes a service a success will disappear in the chill atmosphere of a large central administration. I have the honour to be the Council's Obedient Servant, C. G. K. THOMPSON, Medical Officer of Health. 5 H (2). MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES. Health Committee. Chairman—Councillor G. Farquhar.

MATERNITY SERVICES. B(5)a. Maternity Home—Hainault. The Council provides a maternity home, the accommodation of which this year has been a total of 22 beds, including one isolation bed. The staff consists of a Sisterin-Charge, a Junior Sister, a Staff Nurse midwife, two midwives and two assistant nurses. Institutional treatment for normal cases is provided.

Smallpox. On 8th April, 1947, notification of 6 Smallpox contacts who had come into Erith was received from the Medical Officer of Health, Bilston, Staffs. It was a family who had been on holiday at Bilston, consisting of father, mother and four children. All were vaccinated within six days of exposure. All precautions were taken, including strict day to day surveillance by the Sanitary Inspectors and Health Visitors and avoidance of contact with other persons for 16 days. A shadow vaccination scheme was prepared for bulk vaccination should any big demand for protection arise. I am happy to say no case arose from this contact although two of the children slept in the same room with the case in the invasion stage at Bilston. Mass vaccination is not considered as a satisfactory epidemiological procedure but it had to be envisaged and prepared for. 24 An arrangement exists between the London County Council and the Erith Borough Council for accommodation of cases occurring within the district. C (5). Disinfection of Premises after Infectious Disease. Following the removal of cases of infectious disease, tuberculosis, etc., 52 premises were disinfected, whilst enquiries to obtain particulars regarding 77 cases of tuberculosis were undertaken. The Council have a steam disinfector at the Isolation Hospital, at which clothing, bedding, etc. are disinfected, in addition to the disinfections carried out for the hospital itself. C(6). Laboratory Facilities. Examination of pathological specimens, and other laboratory work, for the district, are undertaken by the Kent County Laboratory, Sessions House, Maidstone. 651 specimens were dealt with during the year. C (7). TUBERCULOSIS. C(7)a. Treatment and Hospital Accommodation. The Kent County Council are responsible for cases of Tuberculosis occurring within the district, and also for Sanatorium treatment and hospital accommodation for Erith residents. A dispensary is held weekly at 65 Bexley Road, Erith, by a whole-time Tuberculosis Officer.

The method of storage is by means of sanitary dust-bins, and some 13,800 are emptied weekly. The dust-bins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local act—the Erith Improvement Act, 1920. Disposal is effected by barging under contract, and these arrangements are still working very satisfactorily. E(l)a. Costs. £ s. d.

General Sanitation. Many requests were received from owners and occupiers in respect of clearing of drains, destruction of wasps and ants nests and eradication of vermin, etc. In each case the necessary service was provided with much beneficial result to the applicant. The charges made in connection with the above services amounted to £23 1s. Od. E(5)e. Offensive Trades. In addition to the statutory offensive trades which are specified in Section 107 Public Health Act 1936, fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade on 17th March, 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly. Within the Borough, there are no offensive trades other than fish frying premises, of which there are 14 in operation. E(5)f. Closet Accommodation and Cesspools. The whole of the closet accommodation both in the older parts of the town and the immediately pre-war areas are on the main drainage system, there being only 27 known premises which are drained into cesspools. During the year the Corporation sewer was extended in Ruskin Road, and 9 houses were connected to the main sewerage system. Cesspools are emptied once a month free of charge by machines belonging to the Borough Council, and the contents thereof are discharged into the nearest Council sewer. The cesspools which require the service are scattered throughout the district, and, in the majority of cases necessitate the covering of considerable distances both for pumping out and conveying to the point of discharge. During the year 1947, cesspools were emptied on 26 occasions by the Council's plant. E(5)g. Smoke Abatement. No smoke nuisances have come to the notice of the department during the year. E(5)h. Swimming Baths and Pools. (1) The Council's open air swimming bath is situated in Walnut Tree Road and comprises one swimming pool of some 70,000 gallons capacity. There is a slipper establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Water in the pool is warmed to a temperature of 70 degrees F. by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the Chloramine process, i.e. addition of ammonia in conjunction with chlorine. 31 (2) Subsequent to sporadic cases of Poliomyelitis, the freshwater paddling pool at the Belvedere Recreation Ground was drained so as to discourage congregations of young children at this site. This water reservoir should be regularly treated with Chlorine. E (5) i. Camping Sites. There are no summer camping sites within the Borough. There are, however, 4 sites which have been occupied by vans which are owned by Householders for a number of years. Frequent inspections have been made with a view to the application of Bye-law requirements. One licence has been granted by the Local Authority during the year under Section 269 Public Health Act, 1936. E (5) j. Hop Pickers. There are no hop fields within, the Borough. E(5)k. Rag Flock Act. No premises exist within the Borough in which rag flock is manufactured or sold. E(5)l. Eradication of Vermin. During the year 1947, dwellinghouses as follows were found to be infested, and subsequently disinfested:— Privately owned houses 22 Corporation houses 11 With regard to privately owned houses, presence of vermin is usually located by Sanitary Inspectors during their inspections, but owners and occupiers are encouraged to notify infestations in which case the services of an out-door operative may be promptly obtained. During the year, 11 Corporation houses were treated, following visits by Sanitary Inspectors or a request from the Housing Department. Spraying solutions of 5 per cent. D.D.T. and Pyrethrum have been found very effective. E(5)m. Cleansing of Verminous Persons. The cleansing station at the first aid post operates in connection with the above and all persons suffering from scabies are directed to this site. E(5)n. Pest Control Services. This was introduced in May and proved a big success. In view of the large amount of surface water in the borough and the hundreds of water tanks which provide breeding facilities for culicine and anopheline mosquitoes, mosquito control with Malariol and D.D.T. was carried out every ten days from May to October of this very hot summer, with a result beyond expectation. Hitherto mosquitoes have constituted a major nuisance in preventing sleep and keeping 32 residents indoors in the evenings. This year there was a negligible nuisance even in the worst areas near Bostall and Lessness Abbey Woods. An anti-fly campaign was also instituted. Dust bins, dust carts, food bins and animal sheds and various premises were treated with 5 per cent. D.D.T. in Kerosene. Cockroaches were eradicated principally by Gammexane dust as some species are resistant to D.D.T. Bugs were dealt with by D.D.T. spray which never fails if properly applied. Three men and an overseer were carefully practised in the technique of using residual spray, so that inefficiency from waste, mess or inadequacy were avoided. This time spent in training has been valuable, as judged from the absence of recurrence of pests. Rats and mice take up about 60 per cent. of the men's time, dealing with sewers under the Ministry of Food Circulars N.S. 11 and N.S. 12. The methods advocated by the Ministry of Food were used exclusively and with good results. There is a considerable infestation of black rat owing to Erith's riparian position. A summary of the year's work is given below. (a) Mosquitoes. The following sites were treated during the year:— Allotment Tanks 392 Pools 16 Ditches 7 Wells 15 Bomb Craters 2 432 On initial spraying it was found that mosquito larvae existed at densities varying from 12 to 900 per square foot. Routine and systematic spraying reduced except 2 to negative, and these 2 (i.e. a well and a tank) showed 36 to 120 per square foot respectively and were consequently treated again. (b) Flies. 275 Food Salvage bins in the streets were sprayed monthly with D.D.T. solution from May to September. The Corporation piggery was likewise treated during the Summer months. 70 D.D.T. impregnated sheets were made up and delivered to Nurseries and Borough Maternity Home. 33 (c) Wasps and Ants. 2 Corporation footpaths and the Cemetery were treated. E(5)o. Rodent Control. (a) In accordance with the requirements of Circular N.S.11, a second and third maintenance treatment of Council's Sewers was carried out in March and September, when a total of 449 manholes were baited for Sewer Rats. (b) Circular N.S.12 Private dwelling scheme.

Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1939. The provisions regarding extortionate rents are admisistered by the Senior Sanitary Inspector and during the year 1947, 79 applicants who have sought advice and assistance have been dealt with. The maximum rent of houses brought under control by this act is the rent payable at 2nd September, 1939, subject to certain permitted increases which are provided for by the act. There is however no provision allowing for decontrol on vacant possession by the landlord. Appended below is a summary of the improvements effected:— (a) Rent reduced by owner from 13/- to 6/3, this latter figure being the standard rent. (b) Rent reduced by owner from £1 7s. 6d. to £1 Os. Od. and £8 12s. 6d. returned to tenant. (c) Several applications were referred to the Furnished Lettings Tribunal.

Shops Act 1912—1938. With regard to the statutory hours of closing, it was necessary to issue 5 warnings to shopkeepers upon the noncompliance with the statute. No police court proceedings were instituted during the year. Infringements of Section 10 of the Shops Act 1934 relating to health and comfort of shop assistants were located in the following instances, and the necessary improvement being subsequently effected:— Shops cleansed and re-decorated 5 Floors renewed 1 New W.C.s provided 6 Heating provided 1 Washing accommodation provided 4 On 11th March, 1947, the Erith Hairdressers and Barbers' Shops Closing Order (made under Shops Act 1912) came into operation. Under this Order, Hairdressing Establishments close at 7 p.m. on the several days of the week, and nothing in the Order effects the obligation of every occupier to close his shop at 1 p.m. on one day in each week in accordance with Section 4 of the Shops Act 1912. E(7)c. Offices. In 2 instances it was necessary to take action under Section 46 Public Health Act 1936, in respect to sanitary accommodation at offices. Subsequent action resulted in the construction of 4 new closets for males, and 3 for females. E(8). Legislation in Force. Tents, Vans and Sheds 28th Feb., 1928.
