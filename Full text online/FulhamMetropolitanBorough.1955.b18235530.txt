To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham Mr, Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my report on the state of the public health in Fulham for the year 1955, together with that of your Public Analyst, Mr. T. McLachlan, A.C.G.P.C., F.R.I.C. VITAL STATISTICS Population The Registrar General's estimated 1955 mid-year population was 118,600, Compared with his 1954 figure, this shows a decrease of 2, 100 - the largest post-war decrease. Birth Rate The number of births per 1,000 population in the Borough was 14.34, which is 0.28 higher than the figure for 1954 Death Rate The number of deaths per 1,000 population was 11,0. This is lower than the death rate for the County of London (12.8) (11.4 in 1954). In 1954 the figure was 10.2 - the lowest recorded death rate for the Borough. Coronary and other heart diseases combined take the heaviest toll, followed by cancer. Pneumonia, bronchitis and other diseases of the respiratory system were third. Deaths from motor and other accidents, as well as suicides, are practically the same as in 1954. Infant Mortality Rate The rate for 1955 was 27.0, an increase of 8.0 over the figure for 1954 The largest number of deaths occurred during the first month of life and were therefore due to neo- natal causes such as prematurity, immaturity and causes operative during birth Maternal Mortality Rate It is with regret that I record the death of two mothers during the year, due to con ditions associated with child birth a rate of 1.1 per 1,000 births (The rate for the County of London was 0.77 and for England and Wales 0.64), Infections Diseases With the exception of the anticipated increase of measles notifications during the year (1,728), there was no serious epidemic of any infectious disease in the Borough Although the number of measles cases was large, the nature of the disease was mild Whooping Cough notifications showed a slight increase. 5 Tuberculosis The tuberculosis death rate of all forms of tubercle was 22., 7 per 100,000 of the population - compared with 24-0 for last year. The greatest number of deaths occurred in men over 45 years of age. The notification rate has also decreased from 115.1 to 91.0 per 100,000. In another part of this report I quote freely from the Annual Report of Dr. H. C. Price, Chest Physician, Fulham Chest Clinic. Diphtheria Two cases of diphtheria occurred during the year - the first since 1949. Both were adults and neither was immunised. There has been no death from diphtheria in the Borough since 1948. Poliomyelitis There were 19 cases of poliomyelitis amongst Fulham residents during the year, This is the largest number of cases since the epidemic of 1947. In 1954 only one case of poliomyelitis occurred. This year the disease was not epidemic, reaching a peak period rather was it endemic in form, the incidence of cases being spread over the year. No deaths occurred I include a report by Dr. W. H. Kelleher, Physician Superintendent, Western Hospital, on "Poliomyelitis in the Western Hospital during 1955." Typhoid One case of typhoid fever occurred during the year, which was related to a small outbreak in a nearby Borough All necessary precautions and investigations were undertaken. The patient recovered completely. Dysentery It is gratifying to report a marked decrease in the amount of dysentery occurring during the year. SANITARY INSPECTORS The sanitary inspectorate is still below establishment in Pulham and London generally. This means that certain duties of the inspectors cannot be carried out and the house-tohouse inspection initiated in 1954, had to be abandoned temporarily But for the Council's foresight in initiating a scheme for the training of student sanitary inspectors (two of whom have now qualified and are members of the Council's staff), the shortage would have been more acute. One other student sanitary inspector was in training during the year and the Council has now decided to train three student sanitary inspectors instead of two in future. HOUSING A slight improvement in the number of sanitary inspectors during the year has enabled the house-to-house inspection to be re-started This inspection,, although limited, has been of value in bringing to light streets where the property is not really bad but where the accumulation of minor defects, if not attended to, would sooner or later result in serious deterioration Attention to these defects has improved the property and prevented further deterioration. This house-to house inspection repeatedly confirms the housing problems constantly recurring in Fulham, viz. There are many properties in the Borough a century or more old, which really require extensive and expensive repairs- There are also a number of properties with leases about to expire, held by "men of straw" who will not do the necessary repairs. Underground rooms exist which, owing to the shortage of houses, or for other reasons, cannot receive radical treatment. Housing Rent and Repairs Act, 1954 Part I The Housing Rent and Repairs Act has now been in operation since August 1954 Part I requires that the Council consider in conjunction with the London County Council their proposed slum clearance programme This agreed programme on slum clearance for 1956/60 has been submitted jointly to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, I am glad to report that the Council's 1951/55 slum clearance programme has been carried out, in accordance with the availability of housing accommodation, with the exception of three areas, in the case of one of which the representation will be undertaken by the London County Council The slum clearance programme in Pulham is not such as to warrant taking advantage of the arrangements made under Part I of the Act for "Deferred demolition." The new standards of fitness of houses, laid down in the Act, has not affected successful representation of unfit houses. Regarding houses let in lodgings, the new standards of Section 11, which give the owner the alternative of possession or carrying out requirements, are operated with extreme circumspection in these days of severe housing shortage. The Public Health Committee has agreed certain standards as a guide in these cases and also for the operation of Section 12 of the Act, which deals with the abatement of over-crowding of houses let in lodgings. Part II Pew owners of houses let on a weekly basis have chosen to avail themselves of the provisions of Sections 23-49 regarding improvement grants. When the necessary steps have been taken, housing standards have been improved Finally experience of working the Act,, in relation to applications for certificates of disrepair, indicates that while there was an initial rush of applications these have steadily fallen off and this fall has been maintained It may be stated that as a measure of effectiveness to raise the standards of existing housing accommodation, in Fulham this Act has fallen short of the hopes of its sponsors. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Following the report of the Beaver Committee on Atmospheric Pollution, it is now the intention of the Government to take immediate legislative action on the recommendations contained in the Report. These have been incorporated in the Clean Air Bill of 1956, The Atmospheric Pollution Stations set up by the Council in relation to the grit Problem have continued to function during the year. The analyses of the recordings taken at these stations show an improvement in the situation The results of the analyses from the Cbuncil's SO2 Recording Stations remain the same OLD PEOPLE The work of the Old People s Welfare Comittee of the Borough, which is a very active Committee, continues to expand, In the Autumn, a Rehabilitation Unit, to include geriatric Patients, was opened at the Western Hospital. Dr. W.H. Kelleher, Physician Superintendent Western Hospital has given a detailed account of this in another part of the report. Statutory visiting by the Council's Lady Sanitary Inspector regarding assessment under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act continued, with an increased number of visits being made. 7 FOOD HYGIENE From Ist January, 1956 the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, with the Food Hygiene Regulations relating thereto, will come into operation. Certain works requirements of the Regulations will not become operative until July, 1956, With this Act in operation, Local Authorities will have a powerful weapon and ally in their policy in relation to vigorously pressing for clean food, clean food handlers and clean food premises - from the collection of the food to its presentation in cafe or store. I acknowledge again with thanks the co-operation and assistance continually given by Dr. Violet Russell, the London County Council Divisional Medical Officer, and her staff throughout the year - she has kindly supplied the facts and figures on the L. C. C. Services; to Dr. W. H. Kelleher, Physician Superintendent, Western Hospital, for his very interesting article on Poliomyelitis in the Western Hospital and on the Rehabilitation Unit at the Western Hospital to Dr. H. C. Price, Chest Physician Fulham Chest Clinic, for permission to quote from his interesting report and studies in relation to tuberculosis. I am grateful to members of the Council and especially the Public Health Committee and Chairman, for their consistent support and consideration in public health problems and to my fellow Chief Officers and their staffs for their helpful co-operation and assistance and finally, to the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal and efficient service as a team, which has again made this report possible. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant. 8 PHYSICAL FEATURES OF BOROUGH AND EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1955 The Borough of Fulham lies in a loop of the River Thames which forms the whole of its southern boundary and gives Fulham the longest riverside frontage of all the Metropolitan Boroughs. Its other boundaries are formed by the Boroughs of Hammersmith in the west. Chelsea in the east, and the Royal Borough of Kensington in the north* It is very flat and low lying being only 12-23 ft. above sea level. The subsoil is of flood plain gravel overlying London clay 20 to 40 feet below. Subsoil water is rarely met within 15 feet of the ground surface. Most of the houses in the Borough were built between 1890 and 1910 a time when speculative building was rampant. It is principally a dormitory Borough with a fringe of heavy industrial undertakings mainly on the riverside and is well served with open spaces and parks which have been added to by post war development. Every opportunity is also taken by the Council to construct and maintain small gardens on suitable sites where they will provide resting places and pleasure for the passers by. The slum clearance and redevelopment programmes are also having the effect of both improving the standard of housing and the appearance of the Borough.

Three family contacts were found to be food handlers and they were excluded from work until proved clear of the infection There were also other minor outbreaks one in an Occupation Centre involving 9 children and another in a Day Nursery involving 5 children. Prompt exclusion of the children affected in each of these instances prevented a more widespread infection. 16 TUBERCULOSIS Return for Year Ending 31st December, 1955 PULMONARY NON-PULMONARY Men Women Children Total Men Women Children Total Notified cases on Register at 1st January, 1955 677 45 1,208 45 63 28 136 496 Add:- I I I I I I I I I I I I Notifications 13 50 5 96 8 2 41 3 Transfers from other areas 23 1 - - - 60 84 - Children transferred to adults 1 2 - 3 2 3 - 5 Returned to Fulham - - - - - - - - Deduct:- i I I I I I I I I I I I I Deaths (all causes) 28 - 1 - 1 23 5 - 1 - Left the Borough 58 38 5 101 3 4 23 - - Recovered 7 30 1 1 2 Children transferred to adults 3 3 - 5 5 - - - 9 Other reasons 5 - 14 - - - - Notified cases on Register at 31st December, 1955 491 43 48 69 25 142 681 1,215 For the purposes of this Return children are recognised as adults upon attaining the age of 15 years. T.B. Death Rate: 22.7 per 100,000 Population which compares favourably with 24.0 in 1954. The Notification Rate has decreased from 115.1 in 1954 to 91.0 in 1955. WINTER EPIDEMICS The Ministry of Health has been anxious to extend the present knowledge of respiratory infections of presumed virus aetiology and all Medical Officers of Health were asked to cooperate in the scheme during the winter of 1954/55. All the general practitioners, chemists and industrial organisations in Pulham were circularised and askedto co operate in furnishing information regarding cases of influenzal like character occurring during the winter months and a number of favourable replies were received. Once this point was reached a small Winter Epidemic Bureau was set up and a number of general practitioners were approached to act as spotters and asked to telephone the Bureau giving notice of (a) the very earliest cases, (b) the epidemic when it arrived and (c) any unusual symptoms evident which may be of interest. In addition, chemists were asked to notify the Bureau of any abnormal rise in prescriptions for this type of illness and industrial concerns asked to notify any abnormal rise in absenteeism due to illness of influenzal like character. The scheme was again resumed at the beginning of last winter and I am pleased to report that there was no evidence from any of these sources of any epidemic occurring during 1955 in the Borough. 17 AUTHENTICATION OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION CERTIFICATES In several parts of the world certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a Medical Officer in the Government or Municipal Service of the country of issue. The form of authentication which appears to be most readily accepted by Health Authorities abroad is that given by Public Health Authorities, and identified by a rubber stamp impression placed by them on the certificate* The Minister of Health therefore has asked Local Authorities to make arrangements under which any person who desires to have a certificate of vaccination or inoculation for the purpose of travel abroad may have it stamped accordingly at the office of the Health Department. The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those Health Authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner Authenticators are not required to certify that the vaccination or inoculation has been properly carried out or, indeed, that it has been carried out at all; the for issuing the certificate remains with the Doctor signing it, i This does not imply any suggestion that a certificate of vaccination or inoculation issued by a registered Medical Practitioner requires any official supervision or control in order to be of adequate medical value, i Authentication is not a requirement of Her Majesty's Government but the proposal is designed as a remedy for difficulties which have in practice been met by persons from this country travelling abroad. During the year a total of 395 certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation were authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The following bacteriological examinations were carried out for the Council on speci mens submitted by general practitioners and the Public Health Department during the year Nose and Throat Swabs .. 68 Faeces .. .. . . 1,233 Urines .. .. 38 Miscellaneous .. .. 20 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 138 medical examinations were carried out. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service and also the examination of both officers and employees referred for special examination or superannuation purposes 18 EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF DR. H. C. PRICE, CHEST PHYSICIAN, FULHAM CHEST CLINIC, 1955 "The routine work of the clinic continued unabated during the year, there being a slight increase in the number of new patients seen, 441 compared with 417 in the previous year. This increase was reflected in a rise in the total attendances from 6,848 to 7,711. Changes in Methods of Treatment If these figures are broken down further however it will be observed that certain changes have taken place in the character of the work compared with previous years. It will be seen that as a result of the better use of drug therapy and the continuing reluctance to use minor collapse therapy the total attendances at the refill clinics fell from 2,878 to 2,172 Case Finding During the summer the Hospital Management Committee carried out certain minor structural alterations to the clinic, enabling the Mobile X-ray Unit to attend for one or two day sessions at fairly regular intervals with the co-operation of Dr. Nash, the Director of the Mass X-ray Unit. At these sessions it has been possible to x-ray expectant mothers, patients referred by local general practitioners, those school leavers who were found to have a positive mantoux on examination, and similar special groups of the population at risk. Now that the mass X-ray Unit is based at the Western Hospital this service can continue either at the clinic or at the hospital. The fall in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis is making it increasingly difficult to discover new cases and it will be necessary in the future to step up rather than slow down our case finding activities if we are to complete the eradication of tuberculosis from the community. Treatment Facilities The tendency for more patients to be treated in hospital rather than in their own homes, noted in the report for 1954, has continued during the year. The easing of the bed situation makes it so that in most instances it is possible to admit patients of either sex with the least possible delay to a hospital bed, either to the Western Hospital in Seagrave Road, or King George V Chest Hospital, Godalming. This situation has had an excellent effect on the morale both of the patients and the staff. After Care and Rehabilitation The scheme for domiciliary diversional therapy started in 1954 has continued and proved to be extremely satisfactory. Whilst it is true that there are now fewer patients receiving treatment at home there are still a large number of patients on full or partial bed rest who are not receiving active chemotherapy for these the regular visit of the diversional therapist, greatly assists in their rapid rehabilitation The L. C, C. Hostel at Hurlingham Lodge for chronic sputum positive homeless men con - tinued to do an excellent job of work, although the number of places is still inadequate to cover the need. There is also a need for a similar hostel for young females particularly for those who have migrated to London from the provinces, Eire, and the Colonies and have no relatives in London ...... Preliminary Survey of Chronic Bronchi tics In an attempt to discover methods of neutralizing the adverse effects of sulphur dioxide pollution, a pilot survey was carried out at the chest clinic during the winter of 1955-56 in which patients known to be suffering from chronic bronchitis were maintained in an atmosphere of approximately one part per million of ammonia vapour. Considerable relief was obtained, especially from bronchospasm. This trial will be continued as a full scale research project during the winter of 1956-57 and further studies will be carried out into the causation and development of chronic bronchitis. 19 It is hoped that as the problem of tuberculosis of the lungs gradually decreases in severity and the disease comes under control, that the clinic services and hospital beds thus freed will be utilised and expanded for the eradication of this other grave social disease."

Their visit was divided into sections as follows: - 24th to 27th January ) Visit by mobile van to firms, shops and offices. 31st January to 2nd February) 3rd to 4th February Mobile van stationed outside Wandsworth Bridge Road Methodist Church. 7th to 8th February Mobile van visited L.C.C. Clinic, Burne Jones House, North End Road. 8th to 9th February Mobile van visited Twynholm Church Hall, Lillie Road Mobile van visited a factory. 9th to 10th February 14th February to 11th March Static Centre operating at Cobb's Hall. The results of the visit were as follows:- A total of 6,436 people were examined. 33 Examinees had radiologically significant lesions, probably tuberculous, and were referred to the Chest Clinic through their general practitioners. 8 Examinees had chest lesions probably not tuberculous of sufficient seriousness to merit investigation at a chest hospital. 11 Examinees were to be followed up by the Mass X-Ray Service 1 Examinee was referred to a Cardiologist. 2 Examinees required further investigation. The Cobb's Hall Centre was a particularly successful one and of the 5,173 persons X-rayed there, 2,127 had never been X-rayed before; in view of this remarkably high proportion it is hoped to use this as a Centre again when the Service next visit the Borough in 1956. A special visit was made to the District Offices of the London Electricity Board, Fulham Broadway, from the Ist to 7th April, when 195 persons were examined. The results of this visit were as follows:- 3 Examinees had radiologically significant lesions, probably tuberculous, and were referred to the Chest Clinic through their general practitioners. 2 Examinees were to be followed up by the Mass X-Ray Service. 22 HOSPITALS IN THE BOROUGH OF FULHAM DETAILS SUPPLIED BY COURTESY OF THE FULHAM AND KENSINGTON HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (1) Fulham Hospital St. Dunstan's Road, W. 6.

"POLIOMYELITIS IN THE western HOSPITAL DURING 1955" The number of cases of poliomyelitis occurring throughout the country during 1955 has shown a considerable increase over the preceding year and this has been reflected in the admissions to the special unit at the Western Hospital. It may not be generally known, however, that this unit receives cases not alone from local districts but from areas much further afield, such as the South coast towns and even from abroad . This has largely arisen from the designation at the Western Hospital of a unit for the treatment of the dangerous respiratory complications, which is planned to serve a large part of the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board area, The impact of the disease on the local Boroughs has fortunately been relatively slight, although many cases of suspected poliomyelitis have been admitted for observation and diagnosis. The fear and anxiety exhibited by the public reaction to illness which may simulate poliomyelitis is well reflected in the rate of medical certification of patients in whom poliomyelitis is diagnosed or suspected. This suspect group forms a substantial proportion of admissions and, where accommodation allows, there is much to be said in favour of such admissions where, with separate room isolation, an expert eye can be kept on the development of an illness and steps taken to initiate specialized treatment at the very earliest stage. The use to which these facilities have been allowed may be gauged by the figures of admissions of suspected or diagnosed cases of poliomyelitis to the Western Hospital, which amounted to 424 during 1955, Less than one half (189) of the 424 admissions could be confirmed as suffering from the disease, to the great relief no doubt of the patients and their relatives where the illness finally diagnosed was of a less serious character, At the same time almost exactly one third of the diagnosed cases of poliomyelitis were in the category "non-paralytic" and were restored to full health in a few weeks. There were were 123 cases with paralysis, some slight but indeed many with considerable damage. Danger to life in poliomyelitis is almost invariably connected with complications created through the failure of the muscles concerned with breathing and swallowing, and in certain classes and age groups, especially in the past, the mortality has been very considerable, especially where a combination of defects has occurred: indeed some hospitals on the continent have recorded a death rate as high as 80-90 per cent in the severely affected groups. The selection of the complicated case for admission to the Western Hospital has resulted in a disproportionately high percentage of admissions with respiratory paralysis, This is reflected in the figure of 66 patients (forming more than half of the paralytic cases), requiring specialised treatment in "iron lungs" or other equipment devised for correction of the suffocative disorders complicating the attack. The impact of such selection has called for special organisation, one element of which has been the equipping of an ambulance containing all the necessary instruments with which an expert team travels to the place (hospital or home) from which the case is to be collected. The team has to be prepared to provide the necessary help to sustain the patient's breathing during the journey This has indeed provided an invaluable adjunct to the organisation and has been very successfully used. In addition, a good deal of expensive equipment has had to be provided for the special ward. The care and maintenance of equipment is a most responsible and time consuming task for the hospital engineer and his staff and is indeed fraught with no inconsiderable anxiety to these technicians who must occasionally show their worth in acute emergencies where mechanical defects supervene. The nursing and medical staffing of the unit calls for considerable augmentation. A cubicle has had to be provided in the ward annexe as sleeping accommodation for the doctor 24 on duty. The load on nursing organisation has been, and continues to be, extraordinarily heavy, for as many as 16 patients have simultaneously required to be given artificial respiration continuously in special machines, each calling for the utmost vigilance and care It says much for those nurses who accept this very great responsibility that they have carried and continue to carry out their very heavy work with great energy and unremitting care and concentration, and many patients owe their survival and comfort to their unselfish and uncomplaining devotion. The physiotherapy staff of the hospital has had to be augmented. This is not done solely for the care of affected limb or trunk muscles but also for the specialised work entailed in the prevention and treatment of lung complications which may arise when breathing muscle paralysis or swallowing difficulties are present. The regularity of the physiotherapy rota of duty has had to be considerably altered. No longer can it be planned on a system in which the team ceases to function in the late afternoon and early on Saturday; but arrangements have had to be made to provide a shift system to cover late hours and even night work and of course the week ends and public holidays. This onerous duty has been accepted with great enthusiasm and efficiency by the physiotherapy staff, without whose efforts it would indeed have been impossible to reach the satisfactory results achieved, The hospital's special wards and theatres have been supplied for some years with a system of emergency lighting and power which provides a standby in the event of electricity cuts or breakdown, with immediate automatic operation. This is an essential service in places where so much depends on uninterrupted electric power which is required to operate the special breathing pumps, one of which is necessary for each seriously complicated case with suffocative symptoms. There are still 22 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis in hospital, many with respiratory muscle paralysis. A number of these have not yet reached the level of recovery where their transfer to long stay orthopaedic hospitals can be safely carried out, but some are likely to achieve that grading in the near future. w.Howlett Kelleher Physician Superintendent 25th January 1956 25 REHABILITATION UNIT, WESTERN HOSPITAL INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY DR.W. H.KELLEHER, PHYSICIAN SUPERINTENDENT In October the Fulham and Kensington Hospital Management Committee opened a Rehabilitation Ward in Western Hospital. At the present time only adult, female, cases can be admitted, there being 17 beds, Patients from hospitals in the Group suffering from physical handicaps such as those which are the after effects of poliomyelitis, strokes and fractures are given intensive physical treatment in ideal circumstances, Efforts are directed not so much to the treat ment of the disease as to developing the good that remains to enable the patients to live an independent existence, in spite of their disabilities, on returning home, Treatment consists in physiotherapy suited to the individual case, and in ward games and exercises of a remedial nature. There are no interruptions or distractions such as occur necessarily in general wards of hospitals where operations, accident cases and cases of serious illness commonly demand the immediate and exclusive attention of the Nursing Staff, The facilities provided are almost unique apart from a few very specialised hospitals and will prove undoubtedly advantageous to the Borough, 26 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL - PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The Maternity and Child Welfare Services since July 1948 are the responsibility of the London County Council, Division I of the London County Council consists of the Metropolitan Boroughs of Chelsea, Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington, The Divisional Medical Officer is assisted in each of the four Boroughs in the day to day administration of the Maternity and Child Welfare Services by the respective Borough Medical Officer, Dr. Violet I, Russell, the Divisional Medical Officer, has kindly supplied the following information regarding these services for the years 1954 and 1955.

It is estimated that by 1977 one person in 5 of the population will be over 65 years of age, The welfare of the elderly is therefore an increasing and extending social service, Facilities available There are many voluntary societies and bodies, as well as private individuals, actively working for the care of the aged The Fulham Old People's Welfare Committee co ordinates all their splendid efforts and has representatives from the Borough Council and other official bodies, In 1955 the Borough Council made a grant of $1,610 towards the Fulham Old Peoples Welfare Committee Of the many facilities available through the Old People's Welfare Committee, only a few are mentioned, eg. Chiropody Two Clinics administer chiropody treatment weekly at the British Red Cross and at Bishop Creighton House, These facilities are greatly in demand and there is a waiting list. Heals Services for Old People The following details regarding Meals Services for Old People are supplied by courtesy of the Fulham Old People s Welfare Committee and are taken from their Eighth Annual Report 1955/1956 "Meals on Wheels" "The arrangements whereby the South London Catering Company supplies meals under contract to Fulham and Wandsworth Old People s Welfare Committee for the W.V.S. "Meals on Wheels" Services and Luncheon Clubs continues to work satisfactorily, We are pleased to report that our efforts to reach the guaranteed figure of 700 meals per week (400 Fulham and 300 Wandsworth) have now been realised., When the position was reviewed in January last., we launched a campaign to give greater publicity to the meals service which has undoubtedly met with some success. One marked improvement was revealed in the case of the Brunswick Luncheon Club run hy the Red Cross During the year consultations have taken place with the caterers on the question of variety and quality of the meals and on the delivery arrangements We feel that there is room for improvement in the delivery arrangements and in the method of keeping the meals hot, These matters are being studied and we hope in the near future to provide some up to date equipment which will ensure that the meals when delivered will be in no worse condition that when they were prepared, Invalid Meals for London The Committee has again increased its grant to Invalid Meals for London For the Present year it is raised from £600 to £800 This organisation continues to provide an essential service in the regular delivery of meals to housebound pensioners needing invalid diets. In consideration of the increased grant the charge to the pensioners will not be increased due to rising costs but will remain at 10d per meal, Two vans are in use in the Borough and the weekly average number supplied during the period May 1955 to April, 1956 was 374 the average number of recipients on the register was 92, 32 Luncheon Clubs During the year, owing to lack of sufficient demand, the Shamrock Luncheon Club run by the W.V. S. was closed. The other W. V.S. Club at Cobb's Hall, however, continues to flourish and the Red Cross Luncheon Club at the Brunswick Boys' Club premises has lately reached record figures- Efforts are being made to open another w, V, S Luncheon Club after enquiries have been made as to the most suitable area and as to the availability of suitable premises. The Committee were pleased to make a grant from the Lord Mayor's National Air Raid Distress Fund during the year to enable additional lunch club equipment to be purchased for the Red Cross Club- The Committee take the opportunity once again of expressing their gratitude to the Warden and boys of this Club for their sympathetic interest and support of the work". Holidays A holiday scheme has been in existence in Fulham for several years, whereby old age pensioners save up to enjoy a holiday by the sea of one or two weeks in May or September at very moderate charges, Coach travel is arranged to the destination. 1 In May 120 elderly folk went on holiday and in September 128 participated, Old People s Clubs The work in this field continues to grow. In various parts of the Borough there are now 14 clubs whose weekly meetings provide recreation and companionship for the members Home for Old People Fulham is fortunate in having its own Home for elderly people who find themselves solitary or for whom the difficulty of housekeeping or running their own home has become too heavy a burden Like other similar Homes,"Royston", 55 Putney Hill, S. W, 15 is run rather like a residential club where household responsibilities or cares are removed but personal freedom remains Residents go out and visit friends and relatives whenever they like and restrictions are reduced to a minimum. There are 35 residents.' Christmas Dinner His Worship the Mayor gave over £100 from his Charity Fund, which is supported by local contributions, to meet the cost of arranging a Christmas Party for 200 old people which was organised on similar lines as previous parties invitations being allocated to the various local organisations The party was again an outstanding success, to which thanks are mainly due to the Mayor the local voluntary organisations, the Boys' Brigade, the North Thames Gas Board (for the loan and installation of a large gas cooker), Methodist Church Hall,Fulham Road SW 6 , and to the local business people and residents who most generously gave donations both in cash and goods. Visiting of the sick and housebound The visiting by local voluntary organisations is a much needed service undertaken hy members of such bodies as the Family Welfare Association, the British Red Cross Society the St. John's Ambulance Brigade,, Bishop Creighton House W. V, S etc, It is of real value to and very much appreciated by the elderly. 33 BATHING FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY Public Baths Old people may obtain without charge, a hot bath at the Fulham Baths on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 am and 12 noon and 2 p.m. and 4 p. m I am informed by the Baths Superintendent that approximately 25 persons a week take advantage of these facilities, Home Bathing This service was commenced in April, 1954. It has proved immensely popular and not unduly costly Provision has been made for the extension of the service as soon as a suitable male attendant becomes available. Number of baths given during 1955 .. .. 1306 Number of persons receiving baths .. .. 72 Number of persons on waiting list at end of 1955 8 s.O.S. CARD SCHEME The S O S Card Scheme was started in August, 1953, with the object of getting help quickly to elderly people in emergency Total cards issued since scheme started .. 78 Tbtal cards issued during 1955 .. .. .. 9 OLD PEOPLE S LAUNDRY (Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936) Service for Incontinent Persons A scheme under the provisions of this Section to cleanse the linen and bedding of aged and incontinent persons was commenced in March, 1952, and is proving of real benefit to sufferers The work is carried out at the Disinfecting Station where modern equipment is enabling the staff to deal quickly and efficiently with the work which is steadily increasing in volume. 1 Following an application from the Chelsea Borough Council it was agreed by the Public Health Committee in September that the Chelsea Old People' s laundry should be dealt with at our Disinfecting Station at a charge of 7d per lb. dry weight, Chelsea to provide the transport and laundry bags and the charge to be revised if the estimated capacity of 400 lbs of laundry per week was exceeded and it then became necessary to engage additional staff- The service commenced on the Ist November and has operated without any trouble and to every one s satisfaction . • The following 10, 403 articles were cleansed during the year:- Sheets 2900 Pillow Cases 1476 Towels 2017 Underwear 2780 Mattress Covers 94 "Pieces" 973 Blankets 163 31 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Statutory visiting of old people who come under the above Acts is carried out by the Public Health Department. There were no compulsory removals under these Acts during 1955. The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number, although fluctuating, is on the increase. Number of primary visits for investigation in 1955 350 New cases recorded for supervision in 1955 188 Number of deaths recorded in 1955 60 Number of old people admitted to Hospitals, Homes and Institutions permanently 51 Re-visits to known cases 1,138 Total number of cases under supervision at end of year 268 Total number of cases recorded in Department 769 Number of cases referred to other Authorities and Organisations, or miscellaneous 36 CHRONIC SICK The aged and chronic sick are often solitary without dependants or relatives, and it is important that they should be visited periodically. It is regretted that there is still all over the Country an acute shortage of beds for the chronic sick, In Fulham, in order to ensure that available beds are allocated to the most urgent cases, the Medical Superintendent of Fulham Hospital (Dr, wyman) sends weekly to the Medical Officer of Health the waiting list of chronic sick for assessment of social and home conditions. These are visited by the Council's Lady Sanitary Inspector, and reported to the Medical Superintendent, Recently it has been arranged for this officer also to call to give verbal reports or to discuss a visit and report in cases of emergency The Medical Superintendent has also kindly agreed to arrange for surgical chiropody at Fulham Hospital for some bedridden old people. 35 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, Section 50 Burial or Cremation of the Dead 14 funerals were arranged under the provisions of this Section of the Act. Details of the cost of the burials are as follows:- £ s. d. *14 Funerals as per contract 147 1 0 Less amount recovered from estate of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives traced .. 87 4 10 Balance being cost to Council £59 16 2 * The cost of the funerals varies slightly, the average cost of an adult being approximately £12 Os. Od. MORTUARY The following cases were dealt with during the year:- Number of post mortems carried out by order of the Coroner 223 Number of convenience cases 76 Total 299 36 PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are seven Public conveniences in all which have been constructed at various times between 1900 and 1939. Increase in Free Lavatory Accommodation A proposal to increase the number of Free W.Cs. in the Public Conveniences was put into force in April of this year and 12 Paid W.Cs. were converted to Free W.Cs., thus providing a minimum of two Free W.Cs. in each convenience. In one male and one female convenience, this number was increased to three. It is felt that many members of the public prefer to pay when using a toilet in a public convenience and for that reason the toilets have not all been converted to free use. Replacement - West Kensington It is proposed to replace the old underground convenience at Gibbs Green with a modern convenience as soon as possible, and a suitable site near the existing convenience has been found. Unfortunately, there are still some obstacles to be overcome and it is likely to be some considerable time before building can commence. New Site - Wandsworth Bridge Road Efforts to reach a settlement regarding a possible site for a new public convenience in this area have not yet proved successful. 37 HEALTH EDUCATION The year has been another busy one in the field of Health Education. As usual the organisations in the Borough were circularised in September and asked to submit requests for Talks, Discussion Groups and Film Shows to the Department and the response was quite good. A new venture was the holding of an Influenza, Coughs and Colds Campaign for the month of November. Details of this and the other activities during the year were as follows:- Discussion Groups Given with the aid of sound film strips produced by the Central Council of Health Education on a variety of present day problems. Five Discussion Groups were held, total attendance 94 - average attendance 19. Talks Given by various members of the Department, usually on some particular aspect of the Department's work. Eight Talks were given, total attendances 147 - average attendance 18. Film Shows Nine of these were given at the Central Library and five at Church Halls. Three of the Library shows were for Adults Only and were accompanied by Talks on Atmospheric Pollution, Health Education in the Home and Home Safety. The total attendances at the fourteen shows were 1,442 persons. Average attendance 103. Influenza Coughs and Colds Campaign This campaign was carried out for the whole of the month of November and had as its theme, the prevention of spread of infection, based on the poster "Knocked Flat by a Sneeze*. Details of the campaign are as follows:- Press A Press statement was sent to the following papers:- "The Fulham Chronicle"; "The Fulham Gazette"; "The Fulham and Hammersmith Advertiser", and "The West London Observer". outlining the purpose and methods of pursuing the campaign and was published in these papers on the 28th October, 1955. Four articles entitled "Cold Conversations" were also supplied to them with the request that they publish one each week during November. Film - "How to Catch a Cold This film was given six showings during the month to an average audience of 48 persons. Publications Copies of the poster "Knocked Flat by a Sneeze" were distributed throughout the Borough and were on show in all Council offices. Doctors, dentists, chemists, opticians and chiropodists were also given a copy and asked to display the poster in their surgeries and shops. 24 Double Crown posters were exhibited on public sites in addition to the 15 on Council sites. The London Electricity Board devoted the whole of one of their windows at their Fulham Broadway Branch to a very fine model reproduction of the poster. In addition to displaying posters, Council Departments gave out copies of a pamphlet giving some tips on Influenza, Coughs and Colds, and the Libraries also distributed a 38 cut-out handkerchief leaflet in the form of a book-mark. Suitable outgoing correspondence from the Council during the month carried a sticker stamp advertising the campaign and carrying health hints. Window Displays 3 Working models were constructed in the Department to form central exhibits for shop window displays. Nine shops in the Borough, mostly chemists and drapers, chosen to give as wide a coverage as possible, agreed to co-operate and some fine window displays resulted. Although it was impossible to assess the results of the month's activities, the interest caused proved that the campaign had fulfilled its objective in drawing the public's attention to the need for common sense methods of prevention of spread of infection of these common winter ailments, which are responsible for so much ill-health and time lost from work. (A Sickness in Population Survey 1944-47 showed that 17% of colds caused loss of work or visit to a doctor and that colds are responsible for about 10% of time lost from defined diseases. It also showed that one in twenty medical consultations concerned colds). Exhibitions A small exhibition on Atmospheric Pollution was held in the foyer of the Central Library for one week 21st - 26th February. The Librarian estimated that some 4,000 people used the Library during the week and the vast majority looked at the Exhibition, which was of great interest to members of the public. The usual leaflet and poster propaganda continued to be carried out, the majority of the leaflets being purchased from the Central Council of Health Education. 39 ACTS OF PARLIAMENT, STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS and CIRCULARS ISSUED RY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS RELATING TO THE PURLIC HEALTH SERVICES during 1955 Acts of Parliament The Pood and Drugs Act, 1955.

Little change was noticeable from the previous year's experience regarding the readiness to comply with sanitary notices. Whilst the majority of statutory requests met with a fairly quick response, there still remained a hard core of recalcitrant property owners who delayed carrying out works until the last possible moment. That so many ineffectual visits were paid is mainly due to the extending practice of women going out to work.

In 179 of the 208 premises concerned, it was found that they were still either not used, or were being used strictly in accordance with the 'permitted use' granted at the time of closing or subsequently by the Council. The remaining 29 cases were made up as follows: - (i) It was found in 13 cases that the part of the premises subject to a closing order were being used in connection with business or industrial concerns. The Council granted 'permitted use' on the lines of the existing user. (ii) In 9 cases it was discovered that the premises no longer existed, having been demolished, and the records were amended accordingly. (iii) The necessary works had been carried out in one premises to render the closed portion fit for human habitation, and the Council approved that the Closing Order be determined, (iv) In 3 cases the premises were still occupied, the tenants awaiting rehousing. (v) It was discovered that 3 premises were being used in contravention of the closing Orders made. In one instance it was decided to take no action, and, in the other two cases, after re-arrangement by occupiers of the remaining available accommodation, satisfactory conclusions were reached without the necessity of legal proceedings. 42 SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMME 1951-55 During the year steps were taken to implement the Slum Clearance Programme already agreed between the Borough Council and the County Council 1951-55:- The Fulham Borough Council (Farm Lane) (No. 1) Clearance Order, 1955 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 10 premises in Farm Lane to be a clearance area. The Fulham Borough Council (Cambria Street) (No. 1) Clearance Order, 1955 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 5 premises in Cambria Street to be a clearance area. The Fulham Borough Council (Cambria Street) (No., 2) Clearance Order, 1955 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 3 premises in Cambria Street to be a clearance area. The Fulham Borough Council (Estcourt Road) (No 1) Clearance Order, 1955 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 6 premises Estcourt Road to be a clearance area. The Fulham Borough Council (Michael Road) (No, 1) Clearance Order, 1955 Under the above Order, the Fulham Borough Council declared 2 premises in Michael Road and 1 premises in Edith Row to be a clearance area. Although a small part of the 1951-55 Programme still remains to be implemented - for action cannot go in advance of the availability of rehousing potentials - a large part of the Programme has been carried out by the Borough Council and the County Council within the time originally estimated. Slum Clearance Programme 1956-60 As required by Part I of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 and following upon the surveys carried out in 1954 mentioned in my last Report, a programme covering the five years 1956-60 was drawn up jointly with the London County Council in respect of dwellings in the Borough considered unfit for human habitation, and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The programme involves 15 Areas comprising a total of 126 dwellings and housing 391 persons. Of these 15 areas, it has been agreed that 6 areas comprising a total of 54 dwellings and housing 151 persons shall be dealt with by the Fulham Borough Council and 9 Areas comprising a total of 72 dwellings and housing 240 persons, by the London County Council. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954 This Act was passed with the stated intention of making, amongst other things, a contribution to preventing property capable of repair from deteriorating to the stage when it becomes unfit for human habitation. In certain circumstances the bait of increased rent was offered provided premises were put into good repair and maintained in that state. Relatively few property owners decided that it was to their advantage to set in motion the complicated machinery laid down. Where it was followed, and tenants exercised their 43 right to apply for a certificate of disrepair, certificates were granted when the premises were considered to be below a standard - a relatively high standard - of "good repair". No appeals followed the action of the Council in these cases, and no real friction occurred in the day to day administration, despite the fact that the provisions were complicated, new in many respects, and largely concerned with matters of opinion, Applications for Certificates of Disrepair .. .. .. 142 Certificates of Disrepair issued .. .. .. .. .. 109 Applications refused .. .. .. .. .. .. 33 Applications for Revocation Certificates .. .. .. .. 137 Revocation Certificates issued .. .. .. .. .. 112 Applications refused .. .. .. .. .. .. 25 Houses in Multiple Occupation (Sections 11 and 12) The Act contains new provisions which replace the power to make bye-laws for houses let in lodgings and hostels by a general power to require in any houses which are in multi occupation an adequate provision for the following services and amenities:- Natural lighting. Ventilation. Water supply. Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences. Facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food, and for the disposal of waste water. Where, in the opinion of the Council, premises are found to be so defective in the above-mentioned matters as not to be reasonably suitable for the number of persons or households in occupation, they may serve a notice on the person in control specifying the works required. The Act, however, goes on to give a person in receipt of such a notice an alternative of taking steps reasonably open to him (including, if necessary, the taking of legal proceedings) for securing a reduction of the number of persons accommodated or the number of households, or both, as specified in the notice. A similar alternative is given if the council serves a notice regarding this type of house requesting abatement of overcrowding. It is too soon to conment on these changes in legislation, but first impressions are that the indiscriminate implementation of these provisions would cause grave rehousing difficulties and hardship. Improvement Grants (Housing Act 1949 - Section 20) as amended by Section 16 of the Housing Rent and Repairs Act 1954 I am indebted to the Borough Architect and Director of Housing for the following figures:- Number of applications received .. .. .. .. .. 23 Number referred to Public Health Department for comment .. 18 Number of grants approved .. .. .. .• .. .. 4 Despite the many explanatory pamphlets issued by the Ministry, owners of property do not appear to be taking advantage of grants. The chief difficulty appears to be the insistence by the Minister that in cases where conversion into flats is proposed, complete selfcontaining must be achieved, The Borough contains many houses of a type which would be considerably improved by adding the amenities of a fixed bath, additional water-closet, and constant hot water supply, but quite apart from questions of extra cost, complete self-containing is virtually impossible. 44 RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS, 1920-1939 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 7 Certificates of Disrepair issued 7 Applications refused - Applications for Revocation Certificates 4 Revocation Certificates issued 3 Applications refused 1 HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 During the year 59 certificates were issued in respect of newly erected and rebuilt premises in the Borough compared with 62 in 1954. REHOUSING OF FULHAM RESIDENTS During the year 137 families were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors at the request of the London County Council and the Borough Architect and Director of Housing, Fulham Borough Council, in connection with applications for alternativem accoirmodation. Of this number 70 cases applied on the grounds of overcrowding and the remaining 67 on medical grounds and the insanitary condition of their living accommodation. 33 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions, and reports were sent to the Director of Housing, London County Council, recommending them for alternative accommodation on the L,C,C Housing Estates. 475 families were known to have been rehoused during the year, compared with 448 in 1954. Details as follows:- By Fulham Borough Council Families Rehoused from Housing Register 54 " " Redevelopment Areas 91 " " Slum Clearance Areas 1 " Individual Unfit Houses 5 151 By London County Council Rehoused from Housing Register 209 " " Slum Clearance Areas 115 324 Total 475 There is close co-operation between the Housing and Public Health Departments on all matters relating to housing. 45 DWELLINGS COMPLETED BY THE COUNCIL between Ist January and 31st December, 1955 Information supplied by the courtesy of The Borough Architect and Director of Housing Site No. of Flats Number of Rooms per Flat Total Rooms (1) (2) (3) (4) Alice Gilliatt Court (Star Road) 39 - 5 28 6 118 8 4 - 4 - 16 26-28, Auriol Road Totals 47 4 5 32 6 134 DRAINAGE OF NEW BUILDINGS and RECONSTRUCTION OF DRAINAGE Addition to existing buildings or additional sanitary accommodation 50 Reconstruction of drainage systems 2 Rebuilding of premises demolished by enemy action 4 New buildings 27 Total applications for approval of plans 83 46 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 RODENT CONTROL With the maintenance of a full staff of 4 operatives during the year the policy of inspection and investigation of business and industrial premises was continued. These inspections were in addition to those made necessary by receipt of complaints from occipiers. A total of 853 inspections were made and in 64 cases minor infestation by rats was discovered and in 77 cases, mice infestation were found, all of which were successfully treated The Central Electricity Authority invited the Council's Rodent Service to tender for a contract to service the Fulham Power Station for rodents and this was accepted and treatments were commenced in November. Complete co-operation by owners of premises has been experienced and in this connection it is significant to note that on no occasion did the necessity arise for the service of a notice, either for treatment or for structural works. The usual two sewer treatments were carried out with the co-operation of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, as required by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Results showed the same marked consistency of the past years. The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Rodent Operatives during the year: - TYPE OF PROPERTY Local Authority Dwelling Houses Business and Industrial Premises Total 1.

The Poisons List, which has been prepared by the Poisons Board and confirmed by the Home Secretary, prescribes two Lists of Poisons - Part I and Part II. The sale of poisons included in Part I is restricted to registered pharmacists whilst those included in Part II may be sold to the general public not only by registered pharmacists, but also (subject to certain conditions) by ordinary traders whose names are entered on a List of Persons entitled to sell such poisons, kept by the local authority. The Acts and Rules lay down certain requirements regarding type of container, labelling, storage, transport and sale of poisons, penalties being prescribed for non compliance, Pees are payable to the local authority by persons whose names are entered on the List At the end of 1955 there were 147 names on the Council's List and the following changes took place in the Register during the year Number of listed sellers on Council's register at 1.1.55 165 Number added during the year 6 171 Number who transferred their business or discontinued the sale of poisons 24 147 Number on register at 31.12.55 308 visits of inspection were made during the year under review and 12 samples of Part II Poisons were submitted for analysis all of which were reported to be satisfactory 48 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The Atmospheric Pollution Measurement Stations set up within the Borough record the rise and fall of the weight of deposited solids and the percentages of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere During 1955 there has been a considerable decrease in the amounts recorded to the lowest since the measurement stations came into operation in August 1953. This is due to the repairs to grit arrestors, more care exercised in the handling of coal and coke when grabs are in operation, the direction of the wind and a reduction in spillage from lorries operating within the Borough Nevertheless, despite the considerable decrease shown within the Borough, the weights recorded are still higher than any other London Borough. The measurements of sulphur dioxide show a distinct rise during the cold spells which clearly indicates most of the sulphur dioxide prevalent in the Borough from street to roof level is due to the burning of bituminous coal in residential properties.

In windy conditions these solids were whipped up and created a false impression of the actual circumstances, The Public Health Committee, in conjunction with the Works and Highways Committee, decided that there should be a special week, a "Grit Removal Week - 20th to 25th June" in which local residents and industrialists should be asked to clear the deposits as much as they possibly could. Letters were sent to all industrial undertakings in the area and 5,000 leaflets were distributed to residents by local Boy Scout Troops Forty-one shopkeepers and traders displayed posters and the local press gave excellent publicity. The co operation of all concerned was splendid; many instances were seen of residents sweeping up grit and washing down walls of front porches, sills and windows. Although no attempt was made to assess the value of the week in terms of the amount of grit removed by this special drive, every effort made which alleviates, even to the smallest extent, the living conditions of the residents in this area is considered to be worthwhile The following special visits were made in connection with this week Traders .. .. 41 Industrial Premises.. 9 Streets .. .. 22 Yards and Forecourts, 48 50 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 - PART I SECTION 8 Inspections of factories have resulted in extensive works being carried out still further to improve sanitary conditions and canteen facilities.

Changes become evident in the district. New sounds are heard which, while mixing not unreasonably with the sounds of traffic, radio and household work during daylight hours, can be very disturbing to the immediate residents if carried on late during the evening or throughout the night. Complaints were received from individual residents and sometimes from a body of affected residents, Night observations were made, checking the intensity of the sounds which may vary from a dull thud - to a high pitched whine of a fan. Managements when informed have proved co-operative andhave taken steps, often involving carrying out extensive and expensive works, to cut out or at least to reduce noises to a minimum. Number of complaints received 9 Number of complaints remedied 8 Number of re-inspections made 81 These inspections often involve very early morning or late visits. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act, which came into operation on Ist April, 1952, regulates the sale of pet animals and empowers a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) to grant licences to keep a pet shop on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings During 1955, 11 licences were renewed and two new licences issued, appropriate conditions being applied to each. No contraventions of the Act were found during 34 routine inspections. 52 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under this Act it is unlawful in the course of business to use filling materials to which the Act applies in any form of upholstery, the stuffing or lining of toys, baby carriages or of articles of such other kinds as may be prescribed except on premises registered by a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough Council). Six sets of premises are registered in Fulham, During 1955 the following samples of filling materials were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of the Act:- Horse Hair 3 Rag Flock 7 Coir Fibre 7 Kapok 1 Cotton Felt 1 "Fluffy Down" 2 21 With one exception all samples of filling materials submitted for examination were reported to be satisfactory. In this instance, a sample of Rag Flock, the chlorine content was reported to be 32 parts per 100,000 parts of Flock, i.e. 2 parts in excess of the permitted maximum. The result of the analysis was communicated to the wholesale suppliers. SWIMMING BATH WATER SAMPLES During the year 12 samples of swimming bath water were taken for bacteriological examination and chemical analyses, all of which were satisfactory. 53 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD SLAUGHTERMEN' S LICENCES Slaughter of Aninals Act, 1933 During the year 1955, one such licence was issued to a slaughterman resident in Fulham. There are no slaughterhouses in the Borough. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938. SECTION 10 Examination of Food and Seizure of Unsound Food Certain articles of food which are liable to be adulterated are controlled by sampling and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst, but foods which deteriorate in quality and become unfit for human consumption are supervised by inspection and seizure with subsequent condemnation by a Justice of the Peace and destruction. No action was necessary under this section during 1955. Voluntary Surrender of Food In practice, shopkeepers make very little attempt to sell to the public any foodstuff which is unfit for human consumption and it is customary for retailers who find food they have purchased from wholesalers to be unsound at the time they receive it or to have become unfit after storage on their premises to notify the local authority, and request an inspection by the district sanitary inspector who will, if satisfied after examination that the food is unfit, issue a certificate to that effect and arrange for its removal to, and destruction at, the Council's Refuse Destructor. During 1955, 1,296 Certificates of Condemnation were issued by the sanitary inspectors relating to the under mentioned voluntarily surrendered foods Tinned Packeted and Bottled Food 17,278 items.

In no case was it necessary to institute legal proceedings. 55 Details of the more important improvements which have been effected in food premises during the year are given below:- Wash-hand basins 2 Water heaters 10 New sinks provided 5 New W. C' s. provided 3 W. C' s. repaired and cleansed 8 Kitchens, preparation rooms etc. redecorated 78 Floors renewed or repaired 12 Shops fronts repaired or redecorated 7 New dustbins 20 Counter cases for the protection of food 8 New windows 3 Improvements to ventilation 5 Counter refrigerators 6 Gas stoves repaired or renewed 7 New refrigerators 6 New counters 4 Premises re- designed 5 Yards cleaned and repaired 16 Refuse removed 11 Under the provisions of Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, premises used for the preparation of certain specified articles of food must be registered with the local authority. At the end of 1955. there were 75 premises on the Register concerned in the preparation of preserved foods and 229 premises on the Register relating to the manufacture or sale and storage of ice cream, as follows:- Premises registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream 3 Premises registered for storage and sale of ice cream 226 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF "CREAM" FILLED CONFECTIONERY During 1955, 182 samples of synthetic and "butter" cream used as a filling in eclairs, doughnuts, slices etc, were purchased for bacteriological examination In addition 22 samples of egg albumen and similar products used in the preparation of icing, meringues, etc., were taken in various bakeries in the Borough. The importance of scrupulous cleanliness and care by persons handling this type of confectionery cannot be over emphasized when one remembers that the cream filling is an excellent medium for the growth of bacteria, and is not subject to any form of heat treatment before consumption. The following is a summary of the examination of the 182 samples Free from bacillus coliform 62 Bacillus coliform (non faecal) present in 78 Bacillus coliform (faecal) present in 19 Staphylococcus Aureus present in 19 Staphylococcus Aureus and Bacillus coliform (faecal) present in 4 The 42 specimens in which undesirable organisms were reported to be present may be summarised as follows 56 Produced in Organism Fulham Bakeries Bakeries outside Fulham. 15 Bacillus Coli (faecal) 4 Staphylococcus Aureus 16 3 Staphylococcus Aureus and Bacillus ColiforM (faecal) 4 - 7 35 The seven unsatisfactory samples, although produced in bakeries outside the Borough, were sold in local shops or cafes and it is difficult to be certain where the contamination occurs. In such cases, in addition to visiting the local shop and giving advice to the staff on food hygiene, the facts are communicated to the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the bakery is situated for his information and appropriate action. The Fulham bakeries, particularly those from which a large number of unsatisfactory samples were procured, received very special attention and many visits when the management and staff were given advice. REGISTRATION OF PURVEYORS OF MILK There are in Fulham two large bottled milk distributing depots, and the occupiers of 146 retail shops (mostly grocers) are registered to sell milk in the properly closed and unopened receptacles in which it is delivered to their premises. Of these twenty- six make daily deliveries to their customers' houses, whilst the remainder merely sell bottled milk in their shops. Number of Inspections of milk shops 185 Number of Inspections of Dairies 42 SALE OF MILK REGULATIONS, 1939 The following table gives the monthly average composition of all samples of milk examined in Fulham, and it will be seen that the quality of the milk distributed in the Borough is well maintained and compares very favourably with the legal standards laid down in the above Sale of Milk Regulations.

Of these 12 were taken at the early morning delivery to the hospitals in the Borough, 26 were taken at schools under the control of the London County Council, and 60 were taken in the streets of the Borough during the early morning delivery. The milk now retailed in Fulham is either the product of "tuberculin tested" herds or has been "pasteurised" or "sterilised" in accordance with the provisions of the above Regulations The use of these special designations is only permissible by persons duly licensed by the local authority. Licences issued under these Regulations are renewable annually on the Ist January, principal licences being granted to retailers occupying premises within the Borough, whilst supplementary licences are issued to purveyors who distribute milk in Fulham from premises situated outside. The following are details of licences granted for the year 1955:- Number of licences to retail Tuberculin Tested milk 84 Number of supplementary licences to retail Tuberculin Tested milk 11 Number of licences to Pasteurise milk 2 Number of licences to retail Pasteurised milk 119 Number of supplementary licences to retail Pasteurised milk 10 Number of licences to retail Sterilised milk 129 Number of supplementary licences to retail Sterilised milk 11 ICE CREAM (HEAT TREATMENT) REGULATIONS, 1947-1952 These Regulations control the preparation and subsequent treatment of ice cream. Ice Cream must be kept at a temperature of not more than 28°F and should the temperature rise. 58 above 28°F, the ice cream must be subject to further heat treatment and again kept at a temperature not exceeding 28'F The Methylene blue test is recommended as a guide for ascertaining the bacteriological cleanliness of ice cream, the time taken to decolourise Methylene blue being recorded and the samples graded as follows:- Provisional Grade Time taken to reduce Methylene Blue. 1 4½ hours or more. 2 2½ to 4 hours. 3 ½ to 2 hours. 4 Less than ½ hour. During 1955, 69 samples of ice cream were examined and graded as follows:- Grade Wrapped Taken from Bulk Total 1 23 33 56 2 2 2 - 3 10 1 11 4 - - 36 - 33 69 Totals In addition to the above 34 iced lollies were examined, 33 of which satisfied Grade I and one Grade 2. Samples falling within Grades 1 and 2 are regarded as satisfactory, whilst Grades 3 and 4 indicate carelessness in hygiene at some stage in the manufacture, handling or storage of the ice cream. It is the practice in Fulham to investigate fully when samples fall within the latter grades. It is satisfactory to note that no samples fell below Grade 3. THE FOOD STANDARDS (ICE CREAM) ORDER, 1953 This Order lays down the following standards for Ice cream:- Fat 5% Sugar 10% Milk solids other than fat 7.5% During 1955, 27 samples of ice cream were purchased for chemical analysis by the Public Analyst all of which were reported to be genuine, a summary of the results being:- Percentage of fat No. of Samples Less than 5% - 5% - 7½% 9 10% 14 Over 10% 4 The average fat content of all samples was 8.72 per cent. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938-1950 During the year under review, 800 samples of food and drugs purchased by the Sampling Officer were submitted to the Council's Public Analyst for chemical analysis. The samples were taken under the various Acts, Orders and Regulations relating to foodstuffs. The Public Analyst reported adversely on 33 of the samples examined, representing 4.1% of samples examined. One sample of pork sausages (No 14) was reported to be 14 per cent deficient in meat, the meat content being 56 per cent against the accepted standard of 65 per cent Legal Proceedings were instituted and the two partners in the firm by whom the sausages were manufactured were each fined thirty shillings. 59 Action taken on recommendation of the Public Health Committee in connection with the other articles of food which were reported to be not in accordance with accepted standards is as follows:- Sample No. Article Result of Analysis.

The number adulterated was 33. The incidence of adulteration may be classified as follows:- Number of samples examined Number of samples adulterated 149 2 Milk 644 31 Other foods Drugs 7 - This number of adulterated samples is very similar to last year, when 35 samples were reported adulterated, During the year only two samples of milk were found to be adulterated according to the sale of Milk Regulations, 1939, One sample contained 8,33 per cent of solids not fat and was therefore 2 per cent deficient in solids not fat. The freezing point 0.527°C, indicated the addition of 2.4 per cent of added water The other sample contained 8,44 per cent of solids not fat and therefore contained not less than 0,7 per cent of added water A cream cheese contained total solid matter 27.2 per cent, including fat 16.6 per cent, Cream cheese must, in the opinion of your analysts, contain not less than 52 per cent of fat unless it is sold as a soft cream cheese, when it must contain not more than 55 per cent of water and not less than 30 per cent of milk fat Some pork sausages contained only 56 per cent of total meat and were therefore 14 per cent deficient in meat Public analysts maintain that pork sausages must contain not less than 65 per cent of meat and as a result of cases which have been heard in the Appeal Court it is probable that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will now be drawing up standards for sausages. Several samples of Dressed Crab were examined, One was submitted as a complaint because it contained white spots which were found to be due to pieces of white meat, but crab and lobster always contain both white and coloured meat, generally the white meat is preferred to the coloured meat Exception was taken to the product, however, on the ground that the label admitted the presence of 5 per cent rusk, and 6 per cent was found to be present. It is unnecessary to add more than 3 per cent of rusk. A second tin of crab was stated to contain 95 per cent of crab meat, but actually contained only about 90 to 92 per cent whilst a third contained added cereal matter fat, and salt, none of which had been declared on the label. A complaint sample of sugar was examined and found to contain 2 parts per million of minute pieces of fibre derived from sacking. Sacking fibres are now generally absent from sugar., because it is the custom to fill it directly into cartons, If sugar has been stored in sacks it is impossible to prevent traces of fibre from the sacking contaminating the sugar, and the complaint appeared to be rather frivolous. Three samples of cut peel were all deficient in sugar, One contained 56.9 per cent of sugar, another 57 per cent, and the third 55,6 per cent of sugar and 1.3 per cent of salt. An agreement was reached some years ago with manufacturers that all cut peel should contain 60 per cent of sugar, In certain cases there is a tendency not to remove all the salt fror the salted peel used with the result that less sugar is required. Housewives generally believe cut peel to be merely the old fashioned candied peel cut up, though there is a tendency for candied peel to reappear on the market. Two samples of currants each contained a maggot, but were otherwise satisfactory These samples came from entirely different sources. 62 One sample of prunes also contained maggots, and a second one was rather badly attacked by yeasts and therefore reported as inferior. A so-called Banana Curd was quite a satisfactory preparation, but theoretically it contravened the Preserves Order because any fruit curd must contain either orange or lemon oil and these ruin the flavour of banana curd Some salad cream was stale and unfit for consumption,, The oil at the surface of the jar had a harsh taste, and the free fatty acids, calculated as oleic acid, on the fat at the top of the jar was 15 per cent whilst the oil in the lower portion contained 13.2 per cent of free fatty acids. Two samples of vinegar were deficient in acetic acid. One contained only 2 per cent and the other 3.6 per cento Vinegar must contain not less than 4 per cent of acetic acid. A sample of Non-Brewed Condiment contained only 3.7 per cent of acetic acid. This must also contain not less than 4 per cent of acetic acid and was therefore 7.5 per cent deficient. A further sample, submitted as Vinegar, consisted of artificial vinegar which had been matured in a wine or genuine cask. The labels of a Non-alcoholic Ginger Wine and a Non-alcoholic Orange Wine were considered incorrect in view of the High Court decision that there is no such thing as a nonbrewed vinegar. The term "Non alcoholic Wine" must similarly be a contradiction in terms. This latter description is no longer included in the Soft Drinks Order and the products must therefore be called by some other name. If, however, the manufacturing industry can produce evidence that the term "Non-alcoholic Wine" was used before the introduction of the Merchandise Marks Act the position will become different. The situation is anomalous because the High Court would here appear to have overruled Parliament inasmuch as the Preservatives, etc. in Pood Regulations which had been approved by Parliament allow for the presence of preservative in "non-alcoholic wines". A complaint was received that some ground almonds possessed a bitter flavour, Ground almonds become rancid fairly quickly and the oil extracted from these almonds was found to contain 2.4 per cent of free fatty acids. The product was probably satisfactory when delivered by the wholesaler to the retailer, but if it had been in the shop for some time the rancidity would have developed in the shop. Some Marjoram was reported as adulterated as it contained not less than 15 per cent of cistus leaf. A sample labelled "Flake Tapioca" was lump tapioca and should not be sold as Flake Tapioca,, Another of Flaked Rice was received owing to a complaint that it was dirty in appearance. Apart from being dirty it contained 26. 2 per cent of powder and 0.2 per cent of foreign mineral matter so that the complaint was fully justified. Some sago contained a soft foreign body which was thought to be mouse excrement, although it did not have the appearance of normal mouse excrement. A sample of whisky was reported as inferior as it contained only 63.9 per cent of proof spirit and another of Rum contained only 63.4 per cent of proof spirit. The Food and Drugs Act requires spirits to be not less than 65° Proof, Confectionery labelled "Butter Snips" contained only 3.3 per cent of butter fat. In accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Food and confectionery manufacturers butter toffees must contain not less than 4 per cent of butter fat. Some chocolate toffees were examined as they were thought to have made children sick. The sweets were wrapped with paper with a loose film of copper alloy leaf, and the copper and lead calculated on the paper were 4 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively. Your analyst considers that any metallic wrappers covering a sweet must be such that it cannot badly contaminate either the sweets or the fingers of the consumer, Complaints were received about three samples of milk. Whilst one was of poor quality the freezing point was genuine and all three samples were reported as satisfactory. There 63 is a tendency for the public to make an increasing number of complaints about samples of food and apart from the three samples of milk mentioned above and also the sample of sugar a sample of butter was submitted because it was claimed that it was margarine whereas it consisted of genuine butter A complaint was made that a sample of ice cream was rancid but no sign of rancidity could be detected. A cake was also submitted for analysis because it was thought to be rancid but your analyst was of the opinion that it was due to the type of spice employed in flavouring the cake. Some cream filled biscuits likewise submitted for rancidity contained a so-called cream filling which was very rich in fat mixed with icing sugar and the large quantity of fat combined with the sugar created a feeling of nausea if several biscuits were eaten but the fat itself was not rancid A sample of cream was submitted with the complaint that it contained a piece of wire but examination of the so-called wire showed that it came from the tinned iron plate of the container and that it had been cut in this fashion by the tin opener when complainant opened the tin„ Food and Drug Legislation during 1955 There has been little actual increase in the amount of food and drug legislation during the year, though much has been introduced, including the Food and Drugs Act 1955 and the Hygiene Regulations, 1955. The Food and Drugs Act is a Consolidation Act which came into operation in 1956, and it will not be discussed in this report, since the principal implica tions were mentioned in last year's report Similarly the Hygiene Regulations only came into force in 1956 and it remains to be seen how some of its articles are to be interpreted from the public analyst's standpoint, The Food Standards (Butter and Margarine) Regulations 1955, and the Labelling of Food (Amendment) Order 1955,, also came into force in 1956, The Food Standards Committee issued a Supplementary Report on Colouring Matters in Foods- This list proposes the inclusion of titanium oxide and ultramarine as permitted dyes and also the deletion of one "coal-tar* dye, Baking Brown AW, and the addition of Black PN to the List previously proposed, The earlier Report proposed that the addition of added colours to foods should be declared to the purchaser, but this Supplementary Report recog nises that there are cases where this would be inadvisable. It is suggested that the presence of added colour to fish should be declared,, but that it should not be declared in the case of bread flour confectionery, butter cheese, margarine, sugar confectionery ice cream and other frozen products,, It is pointed out in the Report that the identification of colours in foods will not be straightforward but it is hoped that with the introduction of modern techniques it may be possible for analysts to develop methods for their identification Reports of this type taken with those on the addition of anti oxidants to foods, and limits for lead arsenic copper. zinc„ and tin illustrate the increasing complexity of food analysis, when it is remembered that these are only one facet of the work involved Thomas McLachlan 64 FULHAM ANNUAL REPORT 1955 Article Number examined.
