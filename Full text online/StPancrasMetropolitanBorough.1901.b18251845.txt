To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I-—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Forty-sixth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the Parish and Parliamentary and Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. The two maps prefacing the Report show the areas of the Registration SubDistricts, the one previous to 1901, the other at the Census of 1901. The statistics of population, births, deaths, and diseases, relating to the SubDistricts, refer to the areas shown upon the map dated 1901. Although the new areas were not adopted by the Registrar-General until the end of the first quarter, immediately before the taking of the Census, the statistics for the first quarter have been retrospectively extracted and corrected from the commencement of the year 1901. THE CENSUS, 1901. ST. PANCRAS. Area. The boundary of the Parish of St. Pancras was described in detail in the Annual Report for 1899. The boundary of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras was described in similar detail in the Annual Report for 1900. It now remains to describe the changes made in 1901 in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts contained within the boundary of the Borough, which is also that of the Registration District.

In 1901 it was moved northwards, and now runs along Haverstock Hill, Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town Road, and Leighton Road. To this boundary line the SubDistricts of Regent's Park and Camden Town were advanced, the division line between these two Sub-Districts being extended along the Kentish Town Road from Hawley Crescent to Prince of Wales Road. So that the SubDistricts of Regent's Park and Camden Town have been increased, and the Kentish Town Sub-District decreased in area, and the past statistics of all of these Sub-Districts are no longer individually comparable with present or future statistics. In 1902 the same will apply to the Sub-Districts of Tottenham Court and Gray's Inn Lane, the division line of which will be moved westward from Burton Crescent to Upper Woburn Place, and the only Sub-District that will then remain comparable with its past will be that of Somers Town. It is much to be regretted that the alteration of the areas of the two southern SubDistricts did not take place sooner, if at all, as, except during 1901, the Census Returns for these two Sub-Districts as printed and circulated will be incorrect, and must be altered to correspond, respectively, with Wards 7 and 8, as shown further on in the Table headed " Registration District and SubDistricts, with their constituent Civil Parish, Area, Houses, and Population." The following tables give the results of the Census Enumeration of 1901, and the comparative figures of that of 1891, so far as they are available, the earlier enumeration having been less extensive. 12 CENSUS 1901.

In Table 8, in a similar manner, the deaths from the non-notifiable "principal zymotic diseases" will be found set out. From these two Tables the mortality of the respective diseases, and of each of the groups, have been obtained, as shown in Tables Nos. 9 A and B, and Tables Nos. 10 A and B, and as compared as follows:— 31 Phthisis.—This disease, the type of the tubercular group of diseases, was the cause of 445 deaths, compared to 477 in 1900, 481 in 1899, and 484 in the year previous to that. The incidence of this disease in the Sub-Districts was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per cent. of Total Deaths.

Throwing the Birth and Death Rates of the foregoing tables into one we obtain this result:— Sub-Districts. Birth Rate. Total Death Rate from all causes. Death Rates from Death Rates per 1000 Births.

The lowest death rates are in the Camden Town and Kentish Town SubDistricts, both being 11.5 per 1000 below their respective birth rates. The death rates of Regent's Park and Somers Town are both 8.2 per 1000 below their respective birth rates, but Somers Town has the highest death rate as well as the highest birth rate of all the Sub-Districts. Gray's Inn Lane comes second highest in death rate and lowest but one in birth rate, the former rate being 5 3 below the latter. Tottenham Court attracts special attention on account of the fact that its death rate equals its birth rate, the former being the third highest and the latter lowest of all the Sub-Districts. The equality of rates is probably due to the age constitution of the population, a lesser proportion of infants, of children and of fertile adults, and a correspondingly greater proportion of unmarried persons. This is borne out by the proportion that the deaths under one year bear to the deaths at all ages, namely, 17.6 per cent, in Tottenham Court, the lowest percentage of the Sub-Districts, and 26.6 per cent, in Somers Town, the highest. Also by the proportion of deaths under five years to those at all ages, namely, 26.2 per cent, in Tottenham Court, the lowest, and 41.9 in Somers Town, the highest. The proportion also of deaths between the ages 15 to 65 years compared to those at all ages is from 10 to 14 per cent, higher than in any other Sub-District. Turning to the causes of deaths, Tottenham Court, in proportion to the total deaths from all causes, has the highest percentage from phthisis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy, and the lowest percentage from the principal zymotic diseases, which include, amongst others, measles, whooping cough, and diarrhoea, essentially children's diseases. 34 It will be seen that the highest infantile death rates are in the same order as the general death rates, namely, Somers Town, Gray's Inn Lane, and Tottenham Court, and the death rate under one year per 1000 births is usually regarded as an accurate test indicating the comparative health conditions of a district. But, if the number of infants is proportionately small and the number of adults large, and those adults are under conditions of close confinement necessitated by their mode of work or living, the test no longer remains so much with the infant population as with the adult population and particular diseases, especially respiratory diseases, and more especially phthisis.

In Paris Small-pox was prevalent throughout 1900 and 1901. In London in 1901, in January, a patient developed the disease on arriving from Paris. In February a steward from an infected ship developed the disease after arrival. In March and April no Small-pox was notified in London. In May another traveller developed the disease. In the second week of June a child of Russian Jews at the East End fell ill with the disease. At the commencement of June a young gentleman arrived at a large hotel in Central London from Paris. He is said to have developed influenza and then Chicken-pox, and was moved into Marylebone to be nursed. The nurse who had attended him sickened, and rapidly died of a malignant form of Small-pox. At the beginning of June also a person suffered and died from an obscure illness in Wandsworth. A visiting friend who returned to the provinces developed Chicken-pox, a relative in the same house developed Small-pox, the dirty linen was sent to a particular laundry, and at that laundry Small-pox developed in a female sorter and a female fellow-worker. Again, in June, in Hackney a male collector of dirty linen for a particular laundry fell ill with Small-pox, a female fellow-worker, the daughter of the collector, the stepson of the collector, a sister of the stepson, another sister, a young male person living in the same house, and a brother of a young woman living next door to three of the young women attacked. At the beginning of July a servant went from Limehouse, in the neighbourhood of the docks, to a house in Paddington, stayed there a few days, and went away ill to Marylebone, where she was found suffering from Small-pox, and was removed to hospital on the 9th July, having given the disease to the housekeeper in Paddington, and to another woman who visited the house. On the 16th July a girl, seventeen years of age, a sorter of dirty linen at a laundry, receiving from hotels and boarding-houses in the W.C. District, fell ill at work, came to her home in St. Pancras and developed measles and mild chickenpox for which she was quietly nursed at home. About a fortnight afterward?, her two sisters were sent from a general hospital to the ships suffering from Small-pox. A child next door, that they were seen to fondle, developed chicken-pox, was nursed at home, and at the end of a week died of Small-pox. Six other members of this child's family living in other parts went to hospital suffering from Small-pox, in addition to seven other persons in the same house, and about twenty other persons in the same street. At the same time in the adjoining Borough of Marylebone a number of cases were occurring not apparently infected from the same source. The local outbreak was promptly got under control, and the number of cases was sensibly diminished, but the number of points of infection and the number of susceptible persons in London, continued week by week to furnish cases spread over considerable areas.

Some because they were regarded as of no consequence and medical advice was not sought, others because the relatives formed their own opinions that the person was only suffering from a harmless eruption and did not require medical treatment, others again, because when advice was sought they were regarded by some medical practitioners as suffering from Chicken-pox. In these circumstances your Borough Council adopted the notification of Chicken-pox on the 25th September, the Order coming into force on the 12th October, with the object of impressing upon the public the danger of lightly regarding skin eruptions at such a time, of providing a penalty for the wilful concealment of Chicken-pox, of inciting medical attendants to exercise additional caution and circumspection in the diagnosis of certain symptoms and eruptions occurring in persons not vaccinated within ten years, and of requiring all medical practitioners to certify, 41 and so bringing all cases to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health. The following were the results of the notification:— Cases of Chicken-pox certified each week since the beginning of October, 1901, in St. Pancras, at all ages, and at separate ages. No. of Week.

In order to test this statement the following table was compiled during the first six weeks of 1902:— No. of Week. St. Pancras. Week ending. Informations received from head teachers of exclusion of children from school on account of Chicken-pox. Notifications received from parents and guardians without medical certificates.

Of those 45 informations, in 16 cases medical certificates had been previously received, and in 29 cases no medical certificates had been received. When no proper notification or medical certificate is received the following letter is sent to the person in charge, and the effect has been to produce a medical certificate in each case. 42 ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department. Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. 190 . To the person in charge of suffering from an infectious disease Sir or Madam, It has been reported to me that the above is suffering from Chicken-pox, I have received no notice from you as required by the Act of Parliament, and beg to inform you that you are liable to a fine of forty shillings for not giving notice of Chicken-pox, and that in not obtaining medical opinion of the rash when Small-pox is prevalent you are exposing your family and neighbours to grave risk. I am, Sir or Madam, Your obedient Servant, John F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. At the commencement of the outbreak it soon became apparent that modified Small-pox was most difficult to diagnose, and that Chicken-pox was not the only disease for which it could readily be mistaken, that no bacteriological examination was available to assist diagnosis and that clinical examination could only be adopted. In accordance with a resolution of your Borough Council of the 25th September, in October a Medical Referee was appointed for each of the eight Wards, to consult in doubtful cases of Small-pox or suspicious eruptions or symptoms and to certify his diagnosis.

Attention must be called to the fact that clinical examination precedes certification, and it follows that the more careful and correct the clinical examination the fewer will be the number of cases of Small-pox diagnosed as Chicken-pox. When a certificate of Chicken-pox is received a copy of the certificate is sent to the vaccination officer with a slip attached stating that "the Medical Officer of Health desires to know whether this patient, under 10 years of age, has been vaccinated, and when and with what result," or to the medical attendant with a slip stating that "the Medical Officer of Health desires to know whether this patient, over 10 years of age, has been re-vaccinated, and if so, when and with what result." As only about eight per cent. of Chicken-pox cases occur at ages over 10 years, about eleven, out of every twelve cases are referred to the vaccination officer. These preliminary measures are important in the discovery and recognition of the disease, as it is well known that one unrecognised case of Small-pox will often spread the disease directly and indirectly to ten, twenty, thirty or more persons. Each case of Small-pox costs many pounds, whereas these preliminary measures for preventing the spread of the disease do not cost as many shillings. As soon as a case of Small-pox is diagnosed, further measures are promptly taken. The medical practitioner forthwith sends the notification certificate to the Medical Officer of Health, who immediately puts the preventive machinery into motion. A copy of the certificate is left at the house for the ambulance nurse, and a message is sent to the hospital for the immediate removal of the patient. Notices are sent to the person in charge of the patient as to the mode of procedure, and as to the law in reference to exposure, removal to hospital, disinfection, &c., as this prepares the way with suitable information, and much facilitates the work oi nurse, inspector, and disinfector. Copies of the ceitificate are sent to the public vaccinator and vaccination officer, and they must, in accordance with the special instructions oi the Local Government Board, re-issued March, 1901, clause 3, make inquiries as to vaccination from room to room and house to house. The Sanitary Inspector proceeds to the house with an inquiry form, and obtains information as to the occupation of the patient, and the school (including Sunday school), workplace, or office attended, the dates of lust attendance, of falling ill, of appearance of rash, and of removal to hospital, and the laundry used. Also the names of all the schools (including Sunday schools) attended by all the children in the house, the occupations of all the adults, and addresses of the workplaces or offices attended. He prohibits any linen of the patient or of the family being sent to the wash before disinfection, also the cleaning, repairing, or making of any clothing or furniture materials in the house, and gives instruction for any in process to be disinfected. He also forthwith prohibits all children in the house from attending school. Members of the family and persons in the house are dealt with as contacts. 44 The disinfection speedily follows, and the bedding, clothing, and other contents of the infected rooms, together with any other infected clothing or materials, are removed for disinfection by high-pressure steam, or for destruction; the infected rooms are sealed up and fumigated, and when re-opened the cleansers strip the walls of paper and burn it, and thoroughly wash and cleanse all the surfaces, including the ceiling, walls, paint-work, wood-work, furniture, and floor, and the disinfected articles are returned. The disinfection and cleansing require to be very thoroughly done, and the Sanitary Inspector assures himself that the disinfectors and cleansers do their work thoroughly and completely. The staff and attendants must have been re-vaccinated, especially the medical men, nurses, inspectors, disinfectors, and cleansers, or a break down of the machinery may occur at a critical moment—as occurred a fortnight after the beginning of this outbreak, when the inspector and disinfector who dealt with the first recognised case in St. Pancras themselves fell ill with the disease. Several of the cleansers engaged in stripping and cleansing infected rooms were also stricken. From the inspector's inquiry forms are carefully extracted the schools attended by the patient (if a child), and by all the children in the house, and copies of the medical certificate are sent to the head teachers. Also carefully extracted are the workplaces and offices attended by the patient (if an adult), and by all the adults in the house, and the names and addresses with contact notices are sent to the employers, or, if they are situated outside the Borough, to the Medical Officer of Health of the place where the workplace or office is situated. Similarly, from other medical officers of health are received the names and addresses of persons residing or working in St. Pancras who resort to infected houses or workplaces in their Boroughs or Districts. All these persons are treated as contacts, and contact notices or handbills are sent to them, and at infected houses the inspector delivers a copy of the notice or handbill to the inmates of every room, and conveys the contacts to the disinfecting station. The handbill notice is in the following form:— ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Hbalth Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. SMALL-POX. notice To Persons in contact with Small-Pox. This is to warn you that, Small-pox having broken out in your house, or that you, having come into contact with the disease, are dangerous to yourself and to others. You are advised forthwith to take a warm bath, with plenty of soap, carefully cleansing the hair and the nails, to have the clothing you are wearing disinfected by steam, and to be re-vaccinated, and to obtain certificates that you have undergone personal cleansing, disinfection and re-vaccination, in 45 order that you may continue your occupation practically without risk to others, provided that you do not omit to seek medical advice if indisposed. The St. Pancras Borough Council have provided a Station for personal cleansing and disinfection of personal clothing at Cambridge Street Disinfecting Station, St. Pancras Gardens, N. W.; and the St. Pancras Guardians a Publio Vaccination Station at 209, Hampstead Road, N.W. (opposite Ampthill Square). The Superintending Inspector will convey you to the Personal Cleansing and Disinfecting Station, where after undergoing the process free of charge, you will be supplied with the Certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, and may proceed to the Public Vaccinator. John F. J. Sykes, January, 1902. Medical Officer of Health. Notices of Small-pox contacts together with copies of the handbill are also sent to the employers of St. Pancras, that tboy may bo made acquainted with the facilities offered to prevent the spread of disease in factories, workshops and officcs. When the contacts have undergone the process of personal cleansing and disinfection, they are each supplied with a copy of the following certificate duly filled in with name and address:— ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department, Pancras Road, N.W. No. Date 190 . SMALL-POX CONTACT. Certificate of Personal Cleansing and Disinfecting, and Re-vaccination. This is to Certify that aged of (1), has undergone personal cleansing (including hair and nails) in a warm bath at the Cleansing and Disinfecting Station, Cambridge Street, St. Pancras Gardens, N.W., and (2), that the personal clothing of the above has undergone disinfection in the steam chamber. John F. J. Sykes, m.d., Medical Officer of Health. (3). This is to certify that the above has been efficiently vaccinated or re-vaccinated. Date Vaccinator. Notice.—Having taken the above certified measures, if the above person remain in good health, or if indisposed immediately seek medical advice, all practical precautions will have been taken against the spread of the disease, and any occupation or employment may be followed with comparative safety. 46 A most difficult class of persons to deal with are those who have no fixed abode—the vagrants who pass through casual wards, and the dossers who frequent common lodging-houses. The Guardians of the Poor were advised not to close the casual wards, but to cause the casuals every evening before admission to be medically examined, to take a warm bath for personal cleansing, especially of the hair and nails, to have their clothing disinfected by steam, and to be revaccinated. The common lodging houses, under the control of the London County Council, have been careful in the admission of new inmates, and when the disease has broken out have more or less quarantined the inmates for a fortnight by the inducement of free board and lodging. The workhouse and infirmnry have protected themselves by stopping the admission of visitors, and by segregating new arrivals. At a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils at the offices of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board on Friday, 7th February, 1902, to consider measures for the prevention of Small-pox in London, resolutions to the following effect were adopted:— A.— With regard to the removal of Small-pox patients. 1.—That it is advisable that application be made to the Metropolitan Asylums Board to send out to every Medical Officer in London daily lists of Small-pox case?, with ages and addresses of patients, as is done weekly in the cases of all infectious diseases and daily in the cases of Small-pox discharged from hospital. B.— With regard to inquiries at infected houses. 2.—That it should be declared an offence, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to refuse or withhold information or give false information with respect to persons living in a house in which Small-pox has broken out, with regard to the names, employment or occupation, schools attended by their children, or as to any persons not living in such house but employed therein. C.— With regard to disinfection. 3.—That the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with regard to the prevention of infectious diseases, require amendment by shortening the period of 24 hours allowed by section 60, for a master of the house to decide whether he will undertake the disinfection or allow the Sanitary Authorits to do so. 4.—That all disinfection should be carried out to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Authority. 5.—That the provisions of section 63 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, be extended to the taking of any house, or part of a house, by a person suffering from an infectious disease, or who has been exposed to infection. D.— With regard to contacts. 6.—That the Local Government Board be informed that it is desirable to amend the law providing that when a person inhabits any part of a house in which there has been a case of Small-pox, and 47 knowingly associates with other persons, and without having his own person and clothes cleansed and disinfected to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Authority he should be liable to a penalty. E.— With regard to Vaccination. 7.—That the Local Government Board be requested to undertake to supply lymph to any registered medical practitioner who may apply for the same, instead of to public vaccinators only. 8.—That an amendment of the law is necessary, to ensure compulsory vaccination and re-vaccination of all persons (who have not been re-vaccinaled within five years), in a dwelling-house wherein Small-pox has broken out. 9.—That the powers and duties at present vested in Guardians of the Poor with regard to vaccination and re-vaccination, should be transferred to, and enforced by Borough Councils. Re-vaccination.—On the 25th September, your Council resolved that in future no candidate for an appointment, or applicant for a situation, the duties of which may bring him into contact with Small-pox, be appointed or engaged, unless he undertake to efficiently protect himself by vaccination or revaccination as the case may require; the requirement to apply to women as well as men. CHICKEN-POX. On the 25th September, your Council, as a matter of urgency, made an Order under section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that Chicken-pox be included in the notifiable infectious diseases referred to in section 55, for a period of six months, the Order to come into force on the 12th October. The Order was approved by the Local Government Board on the 2nd of October. The notification of Chicken-pox was also adopted in the following Metropolitan Boroughs:— 4th Quarter of 1901. 5th Oct. 12th Oct. 19th Oct. 26th Oct. 2nd Nov. 9 th Nov. 16th Nov. 23rd Nov. 30 th Nov. 7th Dec. 14th Dec. 21st Dec. 28th Dec.

A aeries of some thirty cases of scarlet fever occurred in Regent's Park Barracks daring April and May amongst the troopers and their children. Careful enquiry was made into the milk supply, but no infection from this source was discovered. The course of the outbreak pointed more to personal infection or through the clothing or the washing, which was done in the Barracks. Half of the cases occurred amongst the troopers, and half amongst the children. Prompt measures were taken from the first; the outbreak spread itself over some eight weeks, possibly through some slight unrecognised case without apparent symptoms, although careful medical examination was made of the troopers and children. A small outbreak also occurred in one class of a private school from which seven cases were notified in May. Under the advice of the Medical Attendant the school was temporarily closed. In May also, in the neighbourhood of Brecknock Road, some eight cases occuried, probably due to a dairy that derived its supply from a suspected dealer in milk in Bloomsbury. This supply was promptly discontinued. TUBERCULOSIS. In the fourth week of Julythe British Congress on Tuberculosis was held, and passed the following resolutions: — 1.—That tuberculous sputum is the main agent for the conveyance of the virus of tuberculosis from man to man, and that indiscriminate spitting should, therefore, be suppressed. 2.—That it is the opinion of this Congress that all public hospitals and dispensaries should present every patient suffering from phthisis with a leaflet containing instructions with regard to the prevention of consumption, and should supply and insist on a proper use of a pocket spittoon. 8.—That the voluntary notification of cases of phthisis attended with tuberculous expectoration, and the increased preventive action which it has rendered practicable, has been attended by a promising measure of success, and that the extension of notification should be encouraged in all districts in which efficient sanitary administration renders it possible to adopt the consequential measures. 4.—That the provision of sanatoria is an indispensable part of the measures necessary for the diminution of tuberculosis. 49 5.—That, in the opinion of this Congress, and in the light of the work that has been presented at its sittings, medical officers of health should continue to use all the powers at their disposal, and relax 110 effort to prevent the spread of tuberculosis by milk and meat. 6.—That, in view of the doubts thrown on the identity of human and bovina tuberculosis, it is expedient that the Government be approached and requested to institute an immediate inquiry into this question, which is of vital importance to the public health, and of great consequence to the agricultural industry. 7.—That the educational work of the great national societies for the prevention of tuberculosis is deserving of every encouragement and support. It is through their agency that a rational public opinion may be formed, the duties of public health officers made easier of performance, and such local state legislation as may be requisite called into existence. 8.—That this Congress is of opinion that a permanent international committee should be appointed (a) to collect evidence and report on the measures that have been adopted for the prevention of tuberculosis in different countries; (b) to publish a popular statement of these measures; (c) to keep and publish periodically a record of scientific research in relation to tuberculosis ; (d) to consider and recommend measures of prevention. This Congress is further of opinion that all international and great national societies whose object is the prevention of tuberculosis, should be invited to co-operate. 9.—That in the opioion of this Congress, overcrowding, defective ventilation, damp, and general insanitary conditions in the houses of the working classes diminish the chance of curing comsumption, and aid in predisposing to, and spreading the disease. 10.—That the following question be submitted for the consideration of the next Congress on Tuberculosis: The constitutional conditions cf the individual which predisposed to Tuberculosis and the means by which they may be modified. 11.—That, while recognising the great importance of sanatoria in combatting tuberculosis in all countries, the attention of the Government should be directed to informing charitable and philanthropic individuals and societies of the necessity for anti-tubercular dispensaries as the best means of checking tubercular disease among the industrial and indigent classes. Your Delegates recommended upon the preceding resolutions as follows: — 1.—That placards and handbills be fixed in public conveyances, halls, and other public interiors cilling the attention of the public to the fact that tuberculous sputum is the main agent for the conveyance of the virus of tuberculosis from person to person, and that spitting in inhabited interiors is dangerous. 2.—That agreement be expressed with this resolution. 50 3.—That this resolution be approved. 4.—That this resolution be approved, with the addition of the words "especially amongst the poor." 5.—Tnat this resolution, which is in accordance with the circular instructions of the Local Government Board since issued, in regard to tuberculous milk and meat, be also approved. 6.—That this resolution be received; a Royal Commission having been already appointed to inquire into the identity of human and bovine tuberculosis. 7.—That this resolution be received and approved. 8.—That this resolution be received. 9.—That this resolution be received and approved, and be referred to the Housing Sub-Committee for consideration. 10.—That this resolution be received. 11.—That this resolution also be received. On the 6th November your Council resolved that the Report be received. § 2.-ISOLATION.

But there is also another difference between these protective fluids in that the above-mentioned sera are organic products extracted from the blood and free from microbes, and that thev act chemically, whereas vaccine lymph contains the presumptive microorganism of small-pox, passed through the calf and thus deprived of the power of transmitting infection aerially. A person inoculated with diphtheria or tetanus antitoxin does not acquire either of those diseases, but a person inoculated with vaccine lymph acquires a non-infectious form of small-pox in an extremely mild degree, known as vaccinia.

House-to-House Inspections.—The 31 houses inspected from house to house represents the houses so inspected by District Inspectors, but the number of tenement houses visited from house to house by the Tenement House Inspectors is much greater. Tenement Houses.—The method adopted for the inspection of this class of houses has been to select the streets in which the houses are known to be sublet in separate dwellings, for convenience termed Tenement Streets. From house to house in these Tenement Streets inquiries have been made as to the mode of occupation, that is, as to the number of dwellings or families in each house and the number of rooms occupied by each family. When the View Sub-Committee of the Public Health Committee has been called together lists have been placed before them of those streets in which the houses have been ascertained to contain over 50 one and two room dwellings in every 100 of the total number of dwellings in the street, that is to say, over 50 per cent. of one and two room dwellings. The View Sub-Committee after viewing 61 the streets and houses has then decided what houses should be registered, and so recommended the Public Health Committee, and your Council has registered them accordingly. The rooms have then been enumerated and measured, and other details required for registration have been obtained in each house, and the necessary entries made in the Register. The Registered Tenement Houses have then been primarily inspected for sanitary purposes, and any necessary notices under the By-laws have been served and the requisite work has been done. Six months later the half-yearly periodical inspection is made. During the year 409 house-to-house inquiries were made as to the occupation of houses, and 832 houses were measured and entered in the Register. At the end of the year there were 1006 Registered Tenement Houses, at all of which inspections were made, and 1673 re-inspections after the service of notices Underground Dwellings.—Those closed number 36 in the Register, and 26 of thes3 were visited during the year. Since then a large number of underground dwellings have been inspected and full details recorded of their structural conditions; these will in due course be dealt with. Registered Common Lodging Houses.—These houses are set out in List II. in the Appendix and are supervised by the County Council. Canal Boat Dwellings.—There are 31 wharves on the Register, and to these 424 visits were made to inspect canal boats. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. PART I. Area No. 1, Somers Town. 1 (a)—Churchway Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report upon this subject, the London County Council have erected one block of dwellings upon the west side of Churchway, upon the site of Wellesley Street; the roadway of Churchway has been widened and relaid to a proper gradient as far as the rear of the premises Nos. 146 to 150 (even numbers), Euston Road, and a new sewer constructed beneath the roadway ; on the east side of Churchway two other blocks of dwellings are in course of erection and nearing completion. Your Borough Council is in negotiation for the purpose of acquiring the houses Nos. 146 to 150 (even), Euston Road, the freehold having been already acquired, for the purpose of opening the new thoroughfare into Euston Road. The effect of carrying out this scheme will soon be apparent in the vast improvement made in the heart of Somers Town. 62 PART II. Area No. 1, Somers Town—continued. 1 (b).—Part of area west of Chalton Street and north of Drummond Street, no scheme, houses dealt with individually some years since. 1 (c).—Part of area east of Chalton Street. 1 (c i).—Chapel Grove Scheme. In continuation (from 20th March) of the previous Annual Report upon this part of the Somers Town area, and in reference to the proposed re-amended scheme, and the acquisition of Nos. 13, 15, and 17, Chapel Street, your Council resolved on 5th June that these buildings are prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants and of the neighbouring buildings, and that demolition and re-arrangement are necessary, and directed an amended scheme to be prepared. 1 (cii).—Eastnor Place Scheme.—On the 26th June your Council resolved to address a communication to the Local Government Board, asking them to amend the Eastnor Place Scheme sealed bv the late Vestry on 7th September,. 1898, on the same lines as the Chapel Grove Scheme, by acquiring Nos. 10, 14, 16, and 18, Phoenix Street, and constructing a block of dwellings down the centre of the cleared area, and also a communication to the County Council, asking them to agree to the suggested modification. The Local Government Board and County Council agreed to the modification, and on the 4th September instructions were given for a valuation of the additional premises to be made, for the necessary drawings to be prepared, and for the modified Scheme to be drafted. On the 6th November your Council resolved that the buildings above-mentioned are prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants and of the neighbouring buildings, and that demolition and re-arrangement are necessary, and directed an amended scheme to be prepared. Areas No. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Branlome Place Schemes.—In continuation of the previous Annual Report in reference to these areas, on 20th March, 1901, your Council resolved—that dwellings for the working classes be erected on the Great College Street, Brantome Place and North Crescent Mews, Prospect Terrace and Lerry Street sites, when cleared, under Part II of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. Instructions were given to complete the necessary reports, plans, sections, and elevations for the erection of the dwellings and to prepare the necessary copies for the approval of the Borough Council, County Council, and Local Government Board. Application was made to the Local Government Board for sanction to erect the dwellings and for power to hold them in perpetuity. A letter from the County Council, dated 28th June was considered on the 17th July, the letter stating that the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the County Council would be prepared to recommend the Countv Courcil to agree to contribute one-half of the net cost ot carrying the demolition Schemes into effect, including the extra land, on the understanding that, in the event of the Auditor disallowing the charge the Borough Council would refund the amount, and your Council agreed to the terms without prejudice to any action with reference to surcharge. On the same date the seal was authorised to be affixed to the 63 supplemental and to the modified Schemes. Revised Estimates as to the cost of the land, the erection of the dwellings, and the probable income and expenditure for the Brantome Place and Prospect. Terrace Sites were approved and adopted. Revised plans for the buildings on these sites were also approved and adopted, and instructions given to prepare the necessary plans, sections, and elevations for their erection. The plans, &c., for each of these two Sites were approved and adopted on the 6th November and forwarded for approval to the Local Government Board and County Council. Great College Street Site (Supplemental Scheme)—On the 26th June it was reported to your Council that the value of the Great College Street Site free from any restriction as to the class of building to be erected was estimated to be £7700, and when restricted to the erection of working class dwelling £3850. A revised estimate of cost, income, and expenditure in reference to the proposed dwellings was approved and adopted. The plans, sections, and elevations for the erection of the dwellings were approved and adopted, and forwarded for the approval of the County Council and Local Government Board. It was reported to your Council on the 4th September, that the Local Government Board and County Council having approved of the plans of the proposed buildings to be erected on the vacant site in Great College Street, the Supplemental Improvement Scheme had been sealed and forwarded to those bodies. The modified and supplemental schemes relating to the three above-named sites were reported to your Council on the 27th November as having been embodied in one Order of the Local Government Board for sanctioning Schemes for Re-construction under Part II. of the Housing of the "Working Classes Act, 1890, embracing the Brantome Place Improvement Scheme, 1896, the Prospect Terrace Improvement Scheme, 1896, and also the Great College Street Supplemental Scheme, together with conditions attached. The Order was sealed by the Local Government Board on the 7th of December, 1901. PART III. This part of the Act was formally a dopted by your Borough Council on the 6th February. On the 28th June a Conference of Representatives of the Metropolitan Boroughs was held at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, to consider the Housing of the Working Classes Act, when the following resolutions were adopted:— 1.—That it is desirable, with a view to avoiding dual control and overlapping expenditure, that no scheme for the housing of the working classes in any Metropolitan Borough should be promoted by either the London County Council or the Council of any Metropolitan Borough, pursuant to Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except after due consultation between the two Councils, (a) as to the desirableness of the scheme, and (6) in order that the cost of such scheme may be fairly apportioned between the County and the particular Borough. 2.—That in order to ascertain the immediate responsibility and requirements of each Borough Council a simultaneous special inquiry be made by each Council as to the number of the working class that it 64 may be necessary, by the conditions and circumstances of their employment, to house within the area of each Borough. 3.—That reasonable modifications of the existing Building Laws and Regulations are essential in order to facilitate the further erection of industrial dwellings. Statistical Inquiries. In reference to the second of the above resolutions, on the 11th July a letter was received from the Statistical Department of the London County Council, instructed by the Housing of the Wor.cing Classes Committee, quoting the above resolution and suggesting that the scope of the proposed inquiry be somewhat enlarged and all the Authorities concerned proceed on uniform lines, so that the results may be co-ordinate and made available for London as a whole, and enclosing copy of a form of register for such inquiry The Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council desired to learn (a) whether it was probable that the Borough Council would undertake the inquiry in their area—(b) if so, whether they would be prepared to work on the lines of the enclosed form, or of some uniform plan to be agreed upon, and (c) whether the Borough Council had any information previously compiled relating to the subject, and if it could be supplied to the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council, and the letter finished with a reminder that the London County Council would not be precluded from extending its inquiry in other respects if so desired. A further letter, dated 5th November, stated that the Housing Committee of the London County Council had received definite replies from the majority of the Borough Councils, and were anxious to receive a report from this Council. Later a letter was received from the Council of the City of Westminster, stating that on the recommendation of their Housing Committee, they decided to at once undertake the suggested statistical inquiry, and enclosing copies of draft forms approved and adopted, and further asking to be informed what steps this Borough Council were taking in the matter. The draft forms enclosed referred, the first to dwelling houses and the second to business houses. The temporary staff required for such an inquiry for St. Pancras would have to he considerable if it were to be completed within a reasonable time, and so it was advisable firstly to fully understand what information would be required to ascertain the facts, and secondly, bow this information could be economically and promptly obtained. The interpretation of the resolution of the Conference appeared to be funda- • mentally that each Borough Council should inquire as to the number and condition of the Working Class for whose housing it may be considered responsible. This implied a limit of wage, a limit of dwelling, and a limit of rental, in order to consider which is the class for whose housing the Borongh Council is responsible. Now St. Pancras contains an enormous number of small dwellings, a large proportion of the occupiers of which work in other Boroughs, or more central parts of London. Is it the duty of one Borough to house the workers in other Boroughs, and is it the duty of one Borough to house persons displaced by another Borough ? It has been pointed out on a 65 number of occasions that by the extension of offices, workshops, public buildings, street improvements, and other modes of displacement of the resident population, the occupants of more central parts have been driven into St. Pancras; furthermore, the number of casual workers in the markets and business premises who are employed by the hour and the day in the more central parts of London is very large, and a considerable proportion of this class live in St. Pancras; these casual workers, who would not be returned as employed by any particular firm, would not appear in an inquiry at business houses, and even by inquiry at dwelling houses in St. Pancras it is doubtful whether they could give any one business or locality in which they were engaged as workers. The late Woman Inspector, who dealt with outworkers in stores, workshops, and factories, stated that the outworkers in the tailoring trade live principally outside St. Pancras, and mostly in the East End, but in the dressmaking trade the large majority live inside St. Pancras, and are employed in the West End, mostly in Westminster, some in Marylebone, and some also in the City. The number of outworkers employed by dressmakers is very much larger than that employed by tailors, and the question is further complicated by the fact that outworkers usually work for several firms. Generally speaking, the lower down in the scale of skill a worker's employment lies, the nearer he or she must live to the work; also, the more irregular the work the nearer must the dwelling be. Again, the more of an odd-jobbing nature the work is, the nearer must the house lie; so that piece-workers, repairers, and those who have early and late hours, must live close to their work. Few of the casual street traders and hawkers, costers, odd-jobbers, &c., live in central London, they live mostly in the middle zone, and a part of St. Pancras is in that zone, and it is a very serious question whether St. Pancras is to house this class at the expense of the rates. In answer to the question whether your Council would at once undertake the inquiry in the Borough, I reported that the Small-pox outbreak should require all our efforts, and that it would be extremely inopportune to start an elaborate inquiry of this kind. § 4.—SCHOOLS. In accordance with the resolution adopted by the late Vestry on the 17th February, 1897, "that Infants' and Girls' Schools should be inspected from time to time by the Woman Inspector, 118 such inspections and 2 re-inspections were made at the 68 grant, receiving schools on the register. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS, Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.—This Act was passed in August, 1901, to come into force on l6t January, 1902, and the Extracts of the Act in Fart IV. (Legislation) of this Report show the additional responsibilities placed upon Sanitary Authorities. Bakehouses.—When the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, was passed on 17th August, section 101 came into force forthwith, although the Act as a whole did not come into force until the 1st January, 1902, This Section 101 provides that an underground bakehouse not in use as a bakehouse at the passing of the Act shall not again be used as a bakehouse and no new 66 ground bakehouse can be opened after that date. Accordingly the Inspector of Workshops was instructed to inspect the bakehouses and revise the list and the measurements, and he prepared a diagram which has been redrawn upon the stone and printed below. Reports of Inpectors.—The following are the Reports made to me by the Sanitary Inspectors of Workshops:— Public Health Department, Town Hall, St. Pancras, N.W. April, 1902. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report that during the year 1901 the following work has been done:— Bakehouse.s.—There are 182 bakehouses on the Register and three bakehouses which are non-textile factories, motive power being employed in the process of manufacture. These have been inspected regularly in April and October, a second visit being necessary in most cases; 36 notices for cleansing, &c., were served. The sanitary condition was generally satisfactory. I have again prepared a chart showing the bakehouses in the Borough; 22 per cent. only are within the legal definition of local bakehouses. Factories.—250 factories are entered in the Register; several of these have been inspected during the year, some upon complaint and for drainage works, and notices served as found necessary. The factories visited were generally in a satisfactory condition. Workshops.—481 workshops are entered in the Register (a small part only of the workshops and workplaces in the Borough) ; several have been inspected and found satisfactory, others have been inspected as to drainage or upon complaint, and notices served where found necessary for the abatement of nuisances. Smoke Shafts.—There are 102 chimney shafts entered in the Register; 125 complaints of black smoke were received and attended to; 206 separate observations of from one to two hours' duration each were made; 21 notices for the abatement of nuisances arising from black smoke served; and one summons issued resulting in an abatement and prohibition Order against the defendants. Effluvia Businesses.—Two on the Register which have been inspected and found satisfactory. One summons was taken out against a public carrier for conveying putrid and offensive fat through the public streets of the Borough during prohibited hours, and the defendants were convicted and fined. Generally.—I have investigated cases of infectious disease during the absence of District Inspector, and made special inquiry as to same; prepared several plans of combined drainage as occasion required, superintended drainage works in factories and workshops, and been engaged in Office entering particulars in the various Registers kept.

Complaints • • 16 • • • • Schools 68 117 2 2 Factories 87 174 16 11 Workshops 341 1338 103 36 Shops (for Out-workers Lists) • • 10 • • • • Domestic Workshops 62 69 4 3 Laundries 94 328 99 29 Railway Stations (Ladies' Lavatories) • • 13 • • • • Refreshment Rooms (Ladies' Lavatories) • • 97 • • 1 2162 224 82 68 The year has been marked by a depression in trade, and the number of premises under inspection shows a very small increase. The number of workshops opened during the year is 57, those closed being 51, a net increase of only 6, as against 44 for the preceding year. The tendency has been to dismiss employes, and there have been very few cases of overcrowding. Laundries continue to be the most troublesome class of premises visited, and require constant attention. Those laundries which do not come under the operation of the Factory and "Workshop Act, 1901, i.e., in which less than three persons dwelling elsewhere are employed, specially need inspection. The premises are often dirty and dilapidated, and the work is carried on in the living rooms; a condition of things highly undesirable in view of the extremely dirty state of the clothes usually sent to this class of laundry. At the beginning of the outbreak of small-pox in St. Pancras, I made a special inspection of laundries and of workplaces where clothing is made. The inspection of ladies' lavatories in railway stations and in refreshment rooms has been added to the list of duties undertaken by the Woman Sanitary Inspector during the past year. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, A. J. Safford, Sanitary Inspector Workshops (Women). § 6.—WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The condition of the water supplied by the New River Company and the West Middlesex Water Works was reported in the Monthly Reports as extracted from the Report of the Analyst of the Local Government Board and of the Chemists to the Water Companies. Regulations of the Water Companies.—At the beginning of the year the Water Companies deposited new Regulations to amend the Regulations made in 1872, under the Metropolis Water Act of 1871. A Public Inquiry into these proposed new Regulations was held by the Local Government Board in February, at which your Borough Council was represented, and I duly attended the Inquiry from day to day, and supplied evidence for Counsel. On the 2Sth February, Counsel, on behalf of the Water Companies, made the following statement:— Mr. Cripps : "I have to make a statement, Sir, which I think I will make at once for the convenience of all parties. These amended regulations were, as explained, brought forward to carry out the duty imposed on the Companies by the Act of 1871, to prevent the waste or abuse of water and its undue consumption or contamination, in reference to which duty the Royal Commission reported that the Companies had been remiss. As a matter of public convenience it was thought better to have one code, which involved some alterations in the existing regulations made in 1872. The proposed new regulations related especially to improved fittings, which in the practice of the New River Company had been found to work satisfactorily in the interests both of the consumers and the Company. The question which has excited 69 most controversy is that of cisterns, these having been advised in the report of Colonel Ducat and Dr. Barry, appointed by the Local Government Board in 1895, to hold an inquiry into the scarcity of water in the East London District, and emphatically recommended in the report of the Royal Commission, and the proposed regulations were framed to give effect to these recommendations. In face, however, of the opposition which the proposals have aroused from the various Local Authorities, owing, as the Companies think, in great part to a misapprehension of the objects sought to be obtained, the Companies propose to ask the Local Government Board not to further proceed with the present Inquiry. I make that statement at the outset to you and your colleagues, Sir." § DRAINAGE.

A series of such by-laws were approved by the Local Government Board on the 14th June, and presented to your Council on the 17th July. § 8.—REFUSE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL. Deposit of Refuse.—Deposits of refuse in the Borough of St. Pancras take place in the Destructor Yard, Georgiana Street, Great College Street, N.W., and in certain yards or wharves of the Railway Companies, namely, the Midland Railway Company's Goods and Cattle Sidings, Kentish Town Road, N.W.; the Great Northern Railway Company's Goods and Cattle Sidings, York Road, N.W.; and the London and Northern Railway Company's Goods and Cattle Sidings, Maiden Lane, N.W. No refuse is manipulated in any of these yards or wharves. Neither the refuse nor any organic constituent of the refuse remains more than 21 hours in the yard or on the wharf. At the Destructor, the metal objects having been first removed, the whole of the combustible portion of the refuse is burnt in the furnaces, and the resulting clinker utilised. § 9—NUISANCES. The Sanitary Aspects of Road-paving.—The surface of a roadway should be impervious, hard, and smooth. From a sanitary point of view imperviousness is the most important characteristic, from the point of view of durability of wear hardness is the most important, and for convenience and comfort of rolling traffic and conveyance smoothness is much sought after. Unfortunately the greater the smoothness for passengers' comfort the less the foothold for equine safety. Hence the compromise of running passenger conveyances upon rails for smoothness, and horses upon sets of wood, or blocks of stone for roughness and good foothold, as in the case of horse tramcars. One of the great difficulties is the endeavour to reconcile the opposite requirements of passengers and of horses, smoothness and roughness. With the advent of electric tramcars and of motor road cars consideration for the horse will be thrown more and more into the back ground, and main roads will be of smoother and smoother surface until it will be unnecessary to lay special rails, and only hardness and imperviousness will remain to be considered in laying main roads. Taking the four kinds of road-paving, namely—asphalt, granite sets, macadam, and wood blocks, the first is the healthiest, because it is impervious, smooth, and homogeneous, and, therefore, does not absorb, and is easily and 71 thoroughly cleansable; the last kind is the least healthy, because it is the most absorbent, and the most friable; the other two occupy intermediate positions. The more dense and impervious the wood blocks used for road-paving, and the more watertight the jointing, the less unhealthy such a road becomes. The three disadvantages to be corrected are leakage between the blocks and absorbability and friability of the wood. § 10.—SUMMONSES.

For the first year since the London Government Act, 1899, came into force near the end of 1900, the duties enforcing within the Borough the by-laws and regulations with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughterhouses, knackers' yards, and offensive trades, have been fully carried out. The licensed slaughter-houses, offensive trades, and cowsheds, and the registered dairies, have been inspected periodically. Places where food is manufactured and where food is sold have been regularly visited. The markets and marketing streets have been kept under frequent observation, and also visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Milkshops.—It is acknowledged to be very objectionable to keep milk intended for sale in a room habitually used for sleeping or living purposes. There are a considerable number of milkshops in direct communication with a room at the back used as a bedroom, and in the cold half of the year the shop door is kept closed and the bedroom door leading into the shop open. Sometimes, in addition to communication by a door, there is also a window opening into the shop from the bedroom, and occasionally the separation between the room and the shop is still less defined. It ought to be provided that there should be no direct aerial communication between a room used for sleeping purposes and a milkshop. This would not prevent the use of a fixed glazed window looking into the shop, if necessary, and would allow both the bedroom door and the shop inner door to open into a side passage ventilated into the open air by the front door of the house. §2—UNFIT FOOD.

On the 29th January, 1900, the Board of Agriculture by Minute appointed a Departmental Committee to enquire and report as to what regulations, if any, might with advantage be made by the Board under Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, for determining what deficiency in any of the normal constituents of genuine milk or cream, or what addition of extraneous matter or proportion of water, in any sample of milk (including condensed milk) or cream, shall for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, raise a presumption, until the contrary is proved, that the milk or cream is not genuine and the Departmental Committee of the Board of Agriculture reported on the 16th January, 1901. Since then the Board have issued the following Regulations with regard to the composition of milk:— Board of Agriculture Rules (Dated 5th August, 1901). Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901. The Board of Agriculture, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by sec. 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, do hereby make the following regulations:— (1) Where a sample of milk (not being milk sold as skimmed, or separated, or condensed milk) contains less than 3 per cent. of milkfat it shall be presumed, for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milkfat or the addition thereto of water. (2) Where a sample of milk (not being milk sold as skimmed, or separated, or condensed milk) contains less than 8.5 per cent. of milk-solids other than milk-fat it shall be presumed, for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milk-solids other than milk-fat or the addition thereto of water. (3) Where a sample of skimmed or separated milk (not being condensed milk) contains less than 9 per cent. of milk-solids it shall be presumed, for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milk-solids other than milk-fat or the addition thereto of water. (4) These regulations shall extend to Great Britain. (5) These regulations shall come into operation on September 1, 1901. (6) These regulations may be cited as the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901.

FOOD INSPECTORS' REPORTS. Borough of St. Pancras, Town Hall. 1902. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year ending December 31st, 1901. The market streets, stalls, barrows, provisions, greengrocers, and fish shops have been inspected by me daily. On 14 occasions I have found it necessary to take foodstuffs, which were diseased or unsound, and unfit for human food, all of which have been dealt with in accordance with the law. Food Manufacture. There are 11 places in my district where polonies and sausages are made on an extensive scale; I have made 148 inspections of these places. The premises for the most part are kept in a fairly clean condition, and the ingredients used were sound and free from disease; at no time have I found anything unwholesome or unfit for food. Food and Drugs Acts. I have obtained 242 samples of food under the above Acts, and submitted the same to the Public Analyst for analysis. 81 Licensed Slaughter-houses. There are 12 licensed slaughter-houses in my divisions. I have made 275 inspections; found the Regulations properly observed, the premises kept in a cleanly and sanitary condition, and at no time have I found any animal carcase or organs showing any signs of disease or unsoundness. Licensed Cowhouses. There are seven licensed cowhouses in my district, 127 inspections were made by me, the premises have been kept in accordance with the Regulations and in a sanitary condition, and the animals were healthy and free from any contagious disease. Dailies and Milkshops. 394 inspections were made of these registered places throughout the year. Only on one occasion did I find it necessary to report as to any infringement of the regulations, viz., dirty measure. The Committee directed a caution to be sent. The premises as a rule were well kept and in accordance with the Regulations. I am, Sir, Yours, &c., J. Osborne. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report upon my duties as Food Inspector for the North and East Divisions of the Borough from January to October, 1901:— Slaughterhouses.—I made 264 visits to the 8 Licensed Slaughterhouses, and found them to be maintained in a clean condition, and this is again borne out by the fact that no complaint of a nuisance has been received in respect of these premises. In the course of my inspection I saw killed and examined the carcases of the following animals before leaving the slaughterhouses :— Bulls. Cows. Oxen. Heifers. Calves. Sheep. Lambs. Pigs. Total. _ _ 134 _ 15 451 43 150 793 The following were surrendered in writing by the owner and destroyed as trade refuse :— The carcasc and organs of a pig affected with generalised tuberculosis; Three ox livers affected with abscesses. Market Inspections.—1,407 visits were made to the market streets. The costermongers having been removed from High Street, Camden Town, a number of them have taken up stands at the west end of King Street, thus adding to the number of market streets which require daily inspection. 82 The following food stuff was surrendered in writing by the owners, and was destroyed as trade refuse :— 120 boxes of Tomatoes. 34 Frozen Rabbits. 400 Herrings. 201bs. of Beef. 2¾ sacks of Peas. 1 box of Smoked Haddocks. 27 tins of Tomatoes. 1 „ Pears. 5 „ Apricots. 1 „ Ham. 70 „ Condensed Milk. I visited various premises where tinned food is kept for sale, and found it is the custom that when tins become “blown” they are put on one side to be returned to the wholesale dealer and an allowance is made by him to the retailer. It would be interesting to trace the ultimate destination of these blown tins after being returned to the wholesale firm. I experienced great difficulty in examining tinned food, owing to the absence of any indication on the outside of the tin of the length of time such food had been tinned. As the blowing of the tin is only evidence of the generation of decomposing gases, and as fungoid growths sometimes take place which can only be detected upon opening the tin, a large amount of at least to say suspicious tinned food must find its way to the public, for if an inspector opened apparently sound tins the vendor could demand payment, and thus make the examination of tinned food somewhat expensive, there being little or no sale for opened tins. I also found some difficulty in inspecting the "offal" in tripe-dresser shops, where human food is sold side by side with the food of lower animals, because there is no means of distinguishing that which is intended for man and that which is intended by the vendor for dogs' and cats' food. The following food was seized and destroyed by the order of a magistrate :— 1 Pig's head. 501bs. of Beef and Pork and 161bs. of Fat in course of preparation for sausages. One carcase of tuberculous Pork The vendor said he did not know the pork was diseased, for when I visited the shop one Saturday evening I found the carcase, which weighed 8 stone, had been cut up and was hanging in various parts of the shop with sound meat, and some joints were in pickle, and it was only by carefully examining the lymphatic glands, pleura, and peritoneum that I was able to pick out the diseased pork. The whole of the carcase, with the exception of about 41b., which had been sold before my visit, was destroyed. This was Dutch pork, and had been purchased in the open market. Proceedings were taken against the owner who was fined £10 and 2s. costs. 83 3 fowls, 1 pair of tuberculous ox lungs, 9 lbs. pears, 1 Tuberculous, frozen, pigs liver (American), 30 blown tins of condensed milk. Four summonses were taken under Section 47, Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Cowsheds.—I paid 177 visits to the nine Licensed Cowsheds. Proceedings were taken against a licensed cowkeeper for a breach of the Borough Council's By-law, by failing to remove the manure at proper intervals, for which he was fined £5, and 2s. costs. In other respects the Regulations relating to Cowsheds have been complied with ; but although the carrying out of these Regulations was transferred to the Borough Council by the London Government Act of 1899, the Officers of the London County Council still inspect the cowsheds. Milkshops and Dairies.—285 inspections were made of the milkshops and dairies in my district. Proceedings were taken against a purveyor of milk for allowing a milkshop to be used for the purpose of sleeping, for which he was fined 10s. and 2s. costs. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—167 samples were taken under the above Acts including 44 samples of milk, taken upon complaint, in course of delivery at the Railway Stations. No samples were taken under the Margarine Act. I append a summary showing the samples taken. Number of Articles. Article. Number Genuine. Not Genuine. Police Court proceedings taken. No proceedings taken. 5 Marmalade 5 – – 63 Milk 45 11 7 44 Station Milk 33 5 6 10 Demerara Sugar 2 – 8 16 Butter 11 5 – 5 Cheese 5 – – 10 Arrowroot 10 – – 1 Bread and Butter Doubtful – – 5 Pepper 5 – – 3 Mustard 2 – 1 5 Coffee 4 1 – 167 124 21 22 84 Offensive Trades.—There is only one offensive trade premises in my district, to which I paid seven visits, and found the premises in a clean condition and the By-laws relating to Tripe Boiling complied with. At the end of October these duties were taken over by Inspector Child, and I was appointed temporary Superintending Inspector. I am, Yours obediently, Walter George Auger. Inspectors' Office, Town Hall, St. Pancras, April mh, 1902. To Dr. J. F. J. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I beg to report on the duties performed by me during the past year. After leaving the District work on August 19th I carried out the Special duties in connection with cases of Small-pox until October the 30th, when I was transferred to the North and East divisions as Inspector of Meat and other foods, and I submit observations on the inspections made from this date to the end of the year (December 28th, 1901). Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. I obtained 79 samples of different articles for analysis by the Public Analyst. Licensed Slaughter-houses. I made 44 inspections of the eight private slaughter-houses in the divisions, and saw 118 animals killed and dressed, and such organs as, on examination, were found to be diseased the owners surrendered to me. I have not seen any breach of the London County Council By-laws during these visits. Licensed Cowhouses. I visited the nine licensed cowsheds 38 times and found them fairly satisfactory. Owing to an intimation that a cow at one of these cowsheds was suffering with a diseased udder I attended and obtained a sample of milk from this cow in the shed for Bacteriological examination, the result of which the owner was cautioned by the Public Health Committee that the milk was unfit for food. Milkshops. I inspected 39 milkshops and with few exceptions found premises generally satisfactory. Marketing Places. I inspected the various market places 236 times, and on four occasions found articles of food unsound and unfit for food of man. I made application to the magistrates in each of these cases and obtained condemnation orders for destruction. On three occasions proceedings were taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and penalties inflicted. I am, &c., Harry Robt. Child. 85 VI.—LEGISLATION. During the year the following Acts of sanitary and administrative importance to the public health were passed:— The Isolation Hospitals Act, 1901 (1 Ed. VII., Ch. 8); an Act to amend the Isolation Hospitals Act, 1893. The Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1901 (1 Ed. VII., Ch. 26); an Act to amend the law (1836 to 1874) with respect to Districts for registration purposes and the appointment of Superintendent Registrars of Births and Deaths in certain Unions. The Intoxicating Liquors (Sale to Children) Act, 1901 (1 Ed. VII, Ch. 27) ; an Act to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to children. The Factory and Workshops Act, 1901 (1 Ed. VII., Ch. 22); an Act to consolidate with amendments the Factory and Workshop Acts. The Isolation Hospitals Act, 1901. This Act amends and supplements the Isolation Hospitals Act of 1893, and provides for the transfer by a local authority of hospitals for use as isolation hospitals, tor the contribution to hospitals provided by a local authority, for the power of a hospital committee to contract for hospital accommodation, for the rate of interest, for amendment as to appeals to the Local Government Board, for the amendment of the definition of local authority, for copies of orders of County Councils to be sent to the Local Government Board, and for representatives of the County Councils on hospital committees. The Act does not apply to the Metropolis. The Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1901. This Act amends the sections of the Births and Deaths Registration Acts 1836 to 1874, relating to the appointment of Superintendent Registrars of temporary districts. The Intoxicating Liquors (Sale to Children) Act, 1901. This Act makes the purchase and sale of liquors in uncorked or unsealed vessels to children under 14 years of age illegal, and provides penalties for the offence. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. This Act casts heavy additional responsibilities upon the Medical Officer of Health, and requires him to report each year specifically upon the administration of the Act, and to send a copy of his report to the Secretary of State. In dealing with employers and employed in various directions the Act will call for the display of a large measure of tactful resource for its smooth administration. 86 In the following summary of the provisions, the abbreviations "F. & W. A." means Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, and "P. H. L. A." means Public Health (London) Act, 1891. General Powers. Under F. & W. A. Section 155.—"The powers conferred by this Act on district councils shall he in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other powers which they may possess." Powers of Entry. (A) Under P. H. L. A. Section 10 (a) authorizes the council to enter from time to time any premises for the purpose of examining as to the existence thereon of any nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act, at any hour by day (i.e., from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.), or in the case of a nuisance arising in respect of any business, then at any hour when that business is in progress or is usually carried on. Section 26 (2) specifically extends the powers under Section 10 for the inspection of bakehouses, provides a fine for refusal or obstruction, and gives a right to enter independently of any inquiry as to the existence of a nuisance. Powers of entry are given under Section 40 for the examination of sanitary fittings, water supply, pipes, course of drains, &c., and (under Section 82 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855) of drains. Factories come under the definition of " premises" and may be so entered. (B) Under F. & W. A. Section 125.—"For the purpose of their duties with respect to workshops and workplaces under this Act, and under the law relating to publio health, the district council and their officers shall, without prejudice to their other powers, have all such powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings, or otherwise, as an inspector under this Act." The powers of an "inspector under this Act," which are given to the officers of district councils, are by Section 119:— (1) (a) "To enter, inspect, and examine at all reasonable times, by day and night, a factory and a workshop, and every part thereof, when he has reasonable cause to believe that any person is employed therein, and to enter by day any place which he has reasonable cause to believe to be a factory or workshop; and (b) "To take with him in either case a constable into a factory or workshop in which he has reasonable cause to apprehend any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty ; and (c) "To require the production of the registers, certificates, notices, and documents kept in pursuance ot this Act, and to inspect, examine, and copy the same; and 87 (d) "To make such examination and inquiry as may be necessary to ascertain whether the enactments for the time being in force relating to public health and the enactments of the factory Act are complied with so far as respects the factory or workshop, and the persons employed therein ; and (g) "To exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying this Act into effect. (2) "The occupier of every factory and workshop, his agents and servants, shall furnish the means required by an inspector as necessary for an inspection or the exercise of his powers under this Act in relation to that factory or workshop." Where entry is refused, a metropolitan council may either proceed under Sections 115 and 116 of the P. H. L. A. or take proceedings to recover the penalties provided by Section 119 of the F. & W. A. An officer seeking to enter any factory, workshop, or workplace must be provided with a properly authenticated document, to be produced on demand, showing that he is duly authorised to make an inspection. Part I.—Health and Safety. (i) Health (Secs. 1—9.) Section 2 is, in the Metropolis, replaced by Section 2 (1) (g) of the P. H. L. A. The latter enacts that:— "Any factory, workshop, or workplace which is not a factory subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, relating to cleanliness, ventilation, and overcrowding, and (i) is not kept in a cleanly state and free from effluvia arising from any drain water-closet, urinal, or other nuisance, or (ii) is not ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless as far as practicable any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the work carried on therein that are a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, or (iii) is so overcrowded while work is carried on as to be injurious or dangerous to the health of those employed therein, shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act." P. H. L. A. Section 25 also enables a borough council to order any factory (not subject to the provisions of the Factory Act), workshop (not being a bakehouse) or workplace, or part thereof, to be limewashed, cleansed, or purified, when certified by the medical officer of health to be necessary for the health of the persons employed therein. Section 3 re-enacts the standard of 250 cubic feet of space for ordinary working hours and of 400 for overtime. The Secretary of State is empowered to make Special Orders increasing the allowance of cubic space— (a) where artificial light, other than electric, is employed during any period of the working time; 88 (b) for special processes of manufacture; and (c) in any workshop or workplace, not a domestic workshop, which is used for work during the day and for sleeping at night. [Note.—An Order has already been made under (c) substituting 400 cubic feet for 250 cubic feet for ordinary working hours.] A notice is to be put up in every factory and workshop indicating the number of workers who may be employed in each room. Section 4 gives the Secretary of State power to direct one of the factory inspectors to take action where any council makes default in enforcing the provisions of the F. & W. A. and P. H. A. with regard to workshops and workplaces. An inspector so authorised has all the powers under both Acts which are possessed by the council, and may recover expenses from the council, The London County Council under Sections 100 and 101 of the P. H. L. A. also possess the power of acting in default. Section 5 re-enacts the provisions directing factory inspectors to make complaints to the district council of offences in a factory or workshop which are remediable only under the P. H. L. A. If the council neglect to have such offences attended to within one month from the receipt of the complaint, the inspector may take steps to remedy the nuisance complained of, and to recover expenses from the council. Section 6 requires "a reasonable temperature"to be maintained in each room of a factory or workshop, "but the measures taken must not interfere with the purity of the air of any room in which any person is employed." The Secretary of State may by Special Order require a thermometer to be provided and kept in order in each room in any class of factory or workshop. This is intended to prevent the neglect to provide fires or other means of warming, and the use of gas ironing stoves for this purpose. It is not clear whether the council or the Home Office will enforce this section in workshops. From the wording of the third subsection of this section and of the next two sections it would appear that the latter will do so. Section 7 requires that adequate means of ventilation shall be provided and used in every room of a factory or workshop, the district council being specially directed to see that this is done in workshops. The Secretary of State is empowered to issue a Special Order prescribing what is "sufficient ventilation " for any class of factories, etc. Where structural alterations are required to provide the requisite ventilation, the occupier of the factory or workshop may make complaint to a court of summary jurisdiction, and the court may apportion the expenses between the owner and occupier of the pemises "as appears to the court to be just and equitable under the circumstances of the case, regard being had to the terms of any contract between the parties." This section would include "workplaces" under Section 2 (1) (g) of the P. H. L. A. 89 Section 8. —Where water habitually accumulates on the floor of a factory or workshop, drainage is to be provided to carry off such water. In a workshop the want of such drainage (or, rather, the accumulation of water) is to be a "nuisance" remediable under the P. II. L. A., and presumably a "workplace" can be similarly dealt with under the nuisance section. Section 9 deals with the provision of sufficient sanitary conveniences in factories and workshops. In the Metropolis this is provided by Section 38 of the P. H. L. A. The Secretary of State is authorized to fix the standard of closet accommodation required. "Workplaces" are not included in the F. & W. A., they are included in the P. H. L. A. [Section 157 of the F. & W. A. exempts "men's workshops" - i.e., workshops where women, young persons, and children are not employed —from the provisions relating to " temperature, thermometers, means of ventilation, drainage of floors. sanitary conveniences " but ventilation and the provision of sanitary conveniences can be dealt with under the P. H. L. A., Sections 2 and 38.] (II) Safety (Secs. 10—18). Section 18.— (1) A court of summary jurisdiction may, on complaint by a factory inspector, and on being satisfied that any place used as a factory or workshop, or as part of a factory or workshop, is in such a condition that any manufacturing process or handicraft carried on therein cannot be so carried on without danger to health, or to life or limb, by order, prohibit the use of that place for the purpose of that process or handicraft, until such works have been executed as are in the opinion of the court necessary to remove the danger. (2) Provided that proceedings shall not be taken under this section in cases where proceedings might be taken by or at the instance of any district council under the provision of the law relating to public health, unless the factory inspector is authorised, under Section 4. Part II. Employment (Secs. 23 — 67). Section 61 prohibits the occupier of a factory or workshop from "knowingly" allowing a woman to be employed in or on his premises within one month after her confinement. Section 62 prohibits the employment of children under the age of twelve years. The district council has no power, except by complaint to the factory inspector, to take any action when it becomes aware of an infringement of Sections 61 or 62. Part IV. Dangerous and Unhealthy Industries (Secs. 73—86). Section 73.—Medical practitioners attending any patients suffering from lead, phosphorus, arsenical, or mercurial poisoning, or anthrax "contracted in any factory or workshop," are required to notify such cases to the Chief Inspector of Factories. The occupier of the factory or workshop is to report every such case to the factory inspector and certifying surgeon for the district where the factory or workshop is situated. The Secretary of State may by Special Order add other diseases to the list for notification. The Chief Inspector of Factories will probably send notifications to medical officers of health. 90 Part V. (iii). Bakehouses (Secs. 97 — 102). Section 97 prohibits the occupation of any place as a bakehouse unless the following conditions are complied with : (a) There must be no water-closet in direct communication with or within the bakehouse; (b) Every cistern supplying water to the bakehouse must be separate from any cistern supplying water-closets ; and (c) There must be no drain-opening within the bakehouse. Section 98.—A court of summary jurisdiction may on complaint by a factory inspector or a district council fine the occupier of the bakehouse if it is in the opinion of the court "in such a state on sanitary grounds" as to be unfit for such use The court may in addition to or in lieu of the fine direct such works to be carried out as are, in the opinion of the court, necessary to remedy the conditions complained of. Section 99 requires the walls, ceilings, and all passages and staircases of a bakehouse to be either painted and varnished or limewhitened. If painted, they are to be washed once in every six months, and repainted once at least in every seven years. If limewhitened, the limewash must be renewed once at least in every six months. Section 100.—Any place on a level with the bakehouse may not be used for sleeping purposes unless the following conditions are complied with : (a) It must be shut off from the bakehouse by a partition extending from floor to ceiling ; (b) It must have a window communicating with the external air of at least nine square feet, of which at least four and a half square feet must be made to open. Section 101.—An underground bakehouse not in use as a bakehouse at the passing of the F. & W. A. (August 17, 1901) shall not be used again as a bakehouse, and no new bakehouse can be opened after that date. After January 1, 1901, no underground bakehouse may be used "unless certified by the district council to he suitable " for such use. "An underground bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the district council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects." In the event of a council refusing to certify, the occupier may appeal " within twenty-one days from the refusal" to a court of summary jurisdiction, when "if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the bakehouse is suitable for use," as regards construction, light, etc., the court may grant a certificate. Where structural alterations are required to obtain the certificate, the occupier may recover part of the costs from the owner in the manner set out under Section 7 of the Act. Section 102 directs the district council to enforce the provisions of Sections 97 to 101, but in London this section is replaced by Section 26 of the P. H. L. A. 91 While Section 102 limits the powers of the district council to “retail bakehouses Section 28 of P. H. L. A. read with Section 141 of the same Act, gives the metropolitan borough councils jurisdiction over all bakehouses, i.e., wholesale and retail, which are not “factories.” Part V. (iv.). Laundries (Sec. 103). Section 103.—Laundries are neither factories nor workshops, but as to sanitary requirements they are to be dealt with as if in either one or the other category, according to the presence or absence of mechanical power, except laundries where the only persons employed are— “(a) inmates of any prison, reformatory, or industrial school, or other institution for the time being subject to inspection under any Act other than this Act; or “(b) inmates of an institution conducted in good faith for religious or charitable purposes; or “(c) members of the same family dwelling there, or in which not more than two persons dwelling elsewhere are employed.” Where no mechanical power is used laundries are treated as “workshops,” and are therefore under the supervision of the local authority. In the Metropolis, having regard to Section 155 of the Factory Act, the district councils retain control over laundries under the provisions of the P. H. L. A. Part VI.—Home Work (Sec. 107-115). Section 107.—This section is to be applied to such trades as the Secretary of State may by Special Order direct. Occupiers of factories and workshops and contractors employed by such occupiers are to keep lists of the people working for them “outside the factory or workshop,” together with the addresses of the places where such people work. Copies of such lists are to be sent to the council of the district where the factory or workshop concerned is situated “on or before” the 1st days of February or August in each year. The council of each district is required to analyze the lists and to distribute the names and addresses of those persons not actually working in the district to the councils of the districts where the work is actually carried on. The council is also to keep a record of the lists and of the addresses distributed, and such records are to be open to inspection by the factory inspector. The lists kept by the occupier of the factory or workshop are to be open to inspection by any duly authorized officer of the district council. Section 103.—The application of this section is by Special Order of the Secretary of State. If the district council is of opinion that any place where work is carried on outside a factory or workshop “is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein,” and give notice thereof to the occupier of the factory or workshop for whom such work is done, then, if such occupier continue, after the expiration of one month from the date of the 92 notice, to give out work to be done in such unhealthy place, he will be liable, on complaint to a court of summary jurisdiction, to a fine not exceeding £10. A contractor giving out work is under the same restriction as the occupier of a factory or workshop. Section 109.—An occupier of a factory or workshop, or any contractor employed by such occupier, who knowingly causes or allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned, or repaired in any dwelling-house or building connected therewith when any inmate of such dwelling-house is suffering from small-pcx or scarlet fever, will be liable to a fine not exceeding £10, “unless he proves that he was not aware of the existence of the illness in the dwelling-house, and could not reasonably have been expected to become aware of it.” Section 110.—This section applies to “the making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel, and any work incidental thereto, and such other classes of work as may be specified by Special Order of the Secretary of State.” The diseases referred to in this section are those included in the schedule for notification as from time to time varied or altered. A district council may forbid work to be given out to any person living or working in any dwelling-house where any infectious disease occurs. The order may be served on the occupier of the factory or workshop whence the work is given out, or on the contractor employed by such occupier. The order may apply to the whole of the house or to any part thereof, and may be made even if the patient has been removed from the house. The order is to either specify a definite period, or to be subject to the condition of disinfection to the satisfaction of the medical officer of health of that part of the house which is liable to be infected, or to “other reasonable precautions “being adopted. The order may “in any case of urgency” be issued on the authority of any two or more members of the council acting on the advice of the medical officer of health. Contravention of any order issued under this section entails a penalty not exceeding £10. Home Work Order. In pursuance of the powers conferred by the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, the Home Secretary has made the following Order, which may be cited as the Home Work Order, 1901, (11th December) and which came into force on January 1st, 1902. I. Section 107 of the Act (relating to lists of outworkers) and Section 108 (relating to employment in unwholesome premises) shall apply to the following classes of work: The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto; the making, ornamenting, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets; cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work; the making of electro-plate; the making of files; and fur-pulling. II. Section 110 (relating to the prohibition of home work in places where there is an infectious disease) shall apply to the following classes of work: The making, cleaning, washing altering, ornamenting, finishing, and 93 repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto (as in the said section specified); the making, ornamenting, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets; upholstery work; and fur-pulling. The lists of out-workers required to be kept by Section 107 and the copies thereof are to be kept and made in the form and manner and with the particulars shown in the schedule annexed to the Order. The Order of March 23, 1898, relating to lists of out-workers is revoked. Section 111.—Domestic factories and workshops are exempt from the requirements of the F. & W. A. as to means of ventilation, drainage of floors, and thermometers. (See also next section.) Section 112 annuls the exemption granted by the preceding section in domestic factories and workshops where any manufacture or process is carried on which has been certified by the Secretary of State to be “dangerous.” Section 113 empowers the Secretary of State to give notice as to the provisions of the Act which are to be enforced in domestic factories and workshops. Section 114.—Straw-plaiting, pillow-lace-making, glove-making, and any other light handicraft specially added to the list by the Secretary of State, when carried on for profit in any private house or room, are not to constitute such house or room a workshop. Any house or room where work is carried on by the occupants of such house or room at irregular intervals, or where such work does not furnish the whole or principal means of living of the family, is to be similarly exempt. Such places will still come within the P. II. L. A. Part VIII.—Administration (Secs. 118—134). Section 127.—Notice of the opening of a new factory or workshop is to be given by the occupier thereof to the district factory inspector within one month of the day of commencing to occupy such place. The inspector is to inform the council of the district in which any new workshop is situated of such opening. Section 129 requires the occupier of every factory and workshop to keep a “general register,” in which are to be entered particulars of children and young persons employed therein; of the periodical limewashing; and of other matters. “Where any entry is required by this Act to be made in the general register, the entry made by the occupier shall, as against him, be admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, and the failure to make any entry so required with respect to the observance of any provision of this Act shall be evidence that that provision has not been observed.” It is not clear whether the district council has the power to demand the production of the register, except possibly as regards limewashing of bakehouses under Section 26 of the Health Act. The words “or otherwise” in Section 125 of the Factory Act are, however, so comprehensive 94 that it may be well to assume such power until the contrary has been decided by the court. The provision of this section does not apply to “men's workshops.” Section 131. — “Every district council shall keep a register of all workshops situate within their district.” The Home Office will afford facilities to district councils to compile their first registers. Section 132.— “The medical officer of health of every district council shall, in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subiect, to the Secretary of State.” Section 133 requires the medical officer of health to notify the district factory inspector of the employment of women, young persons and children in those factories, workshops, etc., where the abstracts required under the F. & W. A. to be affixed are not displayed. Definitions. “Child”—Anyone under the age of fourteen years, who is thirteen years old, but has not obtained the school certificate of proficiency or attendance (F. & W. A., Sec. 156). “Young person”—One who has ceased to be a child, but is under the age of eighteen years ” (F. & W. A., Sec. 156). “Woman”—A female of the age of eighteen years and upwards (F. & W. A., Sec. 156). “District Council”—As regards the Metropolis outside the City, the council of a metropolitan borough (F. & W.A., Sec. 153). “Factory”—(a) Any place where steam, water, or other mechanical power is used in connection with any trade process (F. & W. A., Sec. 149). (b) All places where the industries mentioned in Part I. of Schedule VI. are carried on, whether mechanical power be or be not used. “ Workshop” - (a) Any place, which is not a factory, where manual labour is exercised by way of trade (F. & W. A., Sec. 149). (b) The places specified in Part II. of Schedule VI., when mechanical power is not used therein. Schedule VI, Part II., contains a list of “non-textile factories and workshops.” They include hat works, rope works (rope walks), bakehouses, lace warehouses, shipbuilding yards, quarries (not being mines), drycleaning, carpet-beating, and bottle-washing works. “Tenement workshop”—A workshop jointly occupied by independent workers (F. & W. A., Sec. 149). 95 “Domestic factory,” “Domestic workshop”—A private room or dwelling where a trade process is carried on by the members of the family residing therein (F. & "W. A., Sec. 115). “Workplace”— “A place or premises shall not be excluded from the definition of a factory or workshop by reason only that the place or premises is or are in the open air” (F. & W. A., Sec. 149). In Bennett v. Harding (1900, 2 Q.B 397) it was held that the term “workplace” was not to be limited to places where manufacturing processes were carried on, but should include any “place where work is done permanently and where people assemble together to do work permanently of some kind or other.” “Bakehouse”—Any place in which are baked bread, biscuits, or confectionery, from the baking or selling of which a profit is derived (P. H. L. A., Sec. 141). “Underground bakehouse”—A bakehouse any baking room of which is so situate that the floor is three or more feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room (F. & W. A., Sec. 101). . “Baking room”—Any room used for baking or for. any process incidental thereto (F. & W. A., Sec. 101). DEFINITION OF UNDERGROUND ROOM AND UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSE. The following is the opinion given by Messrs. Cunliffes and Davenport on the 9th November, 1901, upon a report made by me upon this subject. Underground rooms. The definition of an underground room is now entirely derived from the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 96. By sub-section (9) of that Section an underground room includes any room of a house, the surface of the floor of which room is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. By sub-section (C) every underground room has to be provided with an open area as therein prescribed, upwards from six inches below the level of the floor. The ground “adjoining or nearest to the room” must, we think, mean grouud other than such area, and would include back garden, or back yard, or any other neighbouring surface other than such area. The result is that in our opinion unless the floor of a back room is more than three feet below the surface of the adjoining ground as above defined, it is not an underground room. 96 Underground Bakehouses. An underground bakehouse to come within Section 101 of the factory and Workshop Act, 1901, after the 4th January, 1901, must be a room so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. There is no provision for an adjoining area for a bakehouse, and we can only suppose that the surface from which the three feet must be measured where the footway of the adjoining street is not applicable, must be that of the ground physically nearest to the room, on whatever side of it. There seems likely to be uncertainty as to this, but each case will, we think, have to be decided on its own merits. Weatheritt v. Cantlay. Houses let in Lodgings. This case was decided in the King's Bench Divisional Court on May 13th, 1901. The late Vestry of St. George-the-Martyr, by their Sanitary Inspector Weatheritt, summoned the Defendant Cantlay for non-compliance with an Order of the Vestry to furnish information to enable the Authority to register a block of artisan's dwellings as a lodging house, and on the hearing before Mr. Slade, the Police Magistrate, the summons was dismissed. On the application of the Vestry a case was stated for the decision of the High Court and came before two Judges, who referred it to the tribunal above-mentioned. After hearing the arguments, the Lord Chief Justice in giving Judgment said: “I think, now this case has been argued out, that there is really no difficulty in it. I do not think that any of the cases on the meaning of the word ‘house’ for the purpose of particular Statutes help us. I think we have really to look to see what the object of this legislation was, and then construe the words with reference to the object of the legislation. By Sub-section A of Section 91 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891: 'Every Sanitary Authority shall make and enforce such Bye-laws as are requisite for the following matters —that is to say: (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house wbhch is let in lodgings.' I think the object of this legislation was to control the number of people who should occupy a tenement which may fairly be described as a separate house, and that is shown by the words ' part of a house which is let in lodgings.' Speaking for myself, I do not draw any distinction between the words 'let in lodgings' or occupied by members of more than one family,' except that one state of facts may bring it within one set of words, and another state of facts may bring it within the other, but whether the lodgings are furnished or unfurnished for the purpose of this Section seems to me to make no difference. I think I must find, in order to bring it within the Section, either a house which is itself let in lodgings or a part of a house which is let in lodgings. It is said, when you come to deal with the facts of this case that you are to look at the whole structure and regard the whole building of bricks and mortar as one house, and then, if you find it sub-divided inside, it is a house which is, or a part of which is, let in lodgings. I do not call attention to the extraordinary result of that argument except for the purpose of trying to see why the Legislature should have put in those limiting words, but one cannot help seeing that if Mr. Macmorran's view is right there might be some very large structure of absolutely separate resident al flats, and if any one of them was let in lodgings the whole of them, 97 must come in for the purpose of this. Further than that, I cannot help thinking1 that there is a good deal in the view that, although the Legislature might have imposed a limit to the value in every case, either lodgings let at a certain rent or houses occupied by members of more than one family or a house that is to say a separate tenement let at a certain rent; yet, still, when you find them applicable to a given subject matter, and not to a subject matter limited by some pecuniary standard. I think when you look at the facts of this case this building is a collection of houses for the purpose of this Section. There is no front door.* There is a common passage and common staircases. On those common passages and common staircases open a number of front doors which may be locked, and are separately occupied by the tenants of those. If any one of those is let in lodgings, or if a room is occupied by members of more than one family then the particular landlord of that particular house would come within the terms of the Section. In my opinion it is going too far to say that the whole structure of bricks and mortar is a house, or part of a house let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, simply because there are separate tenements and separate occupations under the circumstances stated in this case. I think, therefore, the judgment of the Magistrate was quite right." The other Justices concurred, and the appeal of the Vestry—now merged in the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark—was dismissed with costs. Hedley v. Webb. Combined Drainage of Semi-detached Houses. The word "drain" means any drain of and used for the drainage of one building only, or premises within the same curtilage, and made merely for the purpose of communicating therefrom with a cesspool or other like receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into which the drainage of two or more buildings or premises occupied by different persons is conveyed. "Sewer" includes sewers and drains of every description, except drains to which the word "drain" interpreted as aforesaid applies. In this case it was decided in the Chancery Division by Mr. Justice CozensHardy on 26th March, 1901, that the term "one building" was not equivalent to the term "one house," that a pair of semi-detached houses only constituted one building, and that a pipe constructed to carry away the drainage of two semi-detached houses to the main sewer is a drain used for the drainage of one building only and does not rest with the Local Authority.
