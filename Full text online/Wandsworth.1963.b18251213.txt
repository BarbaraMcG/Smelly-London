Ac. 4388 Library II WAN 100 Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1963 by J. TUDOR LEWIS, M.D., D.P.H. together with the Report of the Public Analyst REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1963 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to you the Annual Report on the health and sanitary conditions in the Borough for the year 1963, which follows the general form of previous Reports. The publication of the 1961 Census showed the population of Wandsworth as nearly 8,000 more than the estimate for 1960; the Registrar General's estimate of the mid-year population in 1963 was 348,450 which is 640 more than 1962. The crude birth rate was 18.3 per thousand persons living, a very slight increase over the previous year. After taking into account the area comparability figure, the adjusted rate works out at 17.5 as against 17.4 for last year, a barely perceptible change. The rate for England and Wales as a whole was 18.2 and for London 20.1. The crude death rate for the year was 14.9 per thousand compared with 14.4 for 1962 and the adjusted rate 11.08 as against 11.2, the changes again being minimum. The corresponding figures for England and Wales and London were 12.1 and 12.4. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 126 which was 4 more than the previous year and this gives an infant mortality rate of 19.6 per thousand live births, as compared with 19.3 for 1962. There were 3 deaths from puerperal causes in 1963 compared with 2 for 1962, a maternal mortality rate of 0.46 per thousand births. The incidence of infectious diseases did not present any particular features except for the expected increase in the number of measles cases, since 1963 was a measles year; there were in fact 3,427 as against 691 for 1962. I reported last year a comparatively low figure for whooping cough cases, namely, 54; there was an increase in 1963 to 337 cases. The majority of these cases, however, were mild and in some at least the diagnosis may have been 2 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 in doubt due to immunisation against this disease which is now practised. There were no deaths from whooping cough or measles. Two cases of typhoid fever arose in the Borough but these were cases where the disease was contracted abroad and not in this country. No confirmed case of poliomyelitis occurred during the year. Last year the number of cases of tuberculosis coming to our notice did not vary very much from 1961, but this year I am happy to report there was a marked reduction in the number of cases of which we became aware, namely, 293 as compared with 320. Since the transfers from other authorities and those un-notifiable until death, remained identical with 1962, the reduction to the number of 27 was in respect of new notifications, namely, 165 as compared with 192 in the previous year. There was also a small reduction in the number of deaths from the various forms of tuberculosis, namely, 25 compared with 27 in 1962 and 30 in 1961. These are very gratifying reductions in a disease which is less of a scourge than was the case in the not so distant past, yet still remains a considerable public health problem. The winter of 1962/63 was one of the most severe in living memory and the cold weather extended into March. During the period the Health Department was asked to help with a number of problems, notably in relation to burst pipes and the difficulties of some old people were accentuated during the cold weather. Nevertheless, there was no obvious deterioration in the general health of the Borough so far as one was able to judge. This, in general, is confirmed by the statistics for the year although there were one or two features which might be related to the severe winter. For instance, although, owing to the increase in population, the adjusted death rate did not differ very much from 1962, the total number of deaths, in fact, was greater in 1963 than in 1962 by 212. Looking at the different causes of death, there were, as is inevitable, some variations between 1962 and 1963 but for two causes of death, namely, pneumonia and bronchitis, there were distinctive increases. For instance, for pneumonia, there were 414 deaths against 312 in 1962, an increase of 102 and in the case of bronchitis, there were 377 deaths as against 271 in 1962, an increase of 106. Deaths from pneumonia include broncho-pneumonia which is not notifiable as such. There were as many deaths from these two causes in the first quarter of the year as in the rest of the year and predominantly in old people. It is difficult to be absolutely certain of the cause and effect in conditions such as these but it is possible that the increase in the mortality from pneumonia and bronchitis in 1963 was related to the severe weather in the early part of the year. I reported last year in some detail on the work undertaken by the public health inspectors in connection with houses in multiple occupation. This work continued in 1963 and included in the body of this Report is a table showing the work accomplished so far. This work can be arduous for it is not merely a matter of making REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 3 one visit and serving a notice with follow-up to see how the work is progressing. Each property presents its own separate problem in terms of the number of families in the premises and the facilities and amenities existing. Many properties are in different ownerships with owners having different ideas on what they are prepared or able to do. Sometimes it is difficult to make contact with tenants or to gain access to the properties and evening visits may be required. When the condition of the property has been assessed and the owners interviewed, it is then necessary to explain what is required and to advise how it can be done and this may in itself entail several interviews with the owners. Although progress is being made, this work requires constant review. A full report was made to the Committee towards the end of the year. The provisions of the Housing Bill, 1963, which has not yet become law, will cover many houses let in multiple occupation and it seems clear that these two separate, but related, pieces of legislation, will need to be dealt with side by side. The whole problem of houses in multiple occupation and the improvement of existing houses as envisaged in the Housing Bill, 1963. will need careful study and review. The work under the Clean Air Act, 1956, continued in 1963 and during the year the General Purposes Committee of the Council, as a matter of policy, decided that the whole area of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth should be converted into a Smoke Control area by 1970. During the year, the Council's fifth area was confirmed and the sixth Order made by the Council has been submitted to the Minister for approval. Preliminary work is continuing in area No. 7 and is now nearing completion. The plan on page 43 shows pictorially the progress achieved and proposed. I should like again to thank the many people who have contributed to the work of the Health Department, particularly the Committees and their Chairmen with whom I have been mainly concerned. I should like especially to thank Councillor Miss Joan Lestor, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, for her help and guidance during the year and to express my appreciation to the members of my own staff and the Chief Officers and staff of other Departments of the Council. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STAFF OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT Medical Officer of Health J.

It has an area of 9,109 acres which includes a number of open spaces, with an approximate combined area of 1,200 acres. The population is a varied one, as the Borough contains residential neighbourhoods which have rapidly been added to by the development of new housing estates by the Borough Council and London County Council. The chief industries carried on are the manufacture of gas, electricity and motor accessories, laundries and general engineering.

The number for 1962 was 6,312. The crude birth-rate was 18.3 per 1,000 persons living compared with 18.1 for 1962. The adjusted rate works out at 17.5 after taking into account the area comparability factor supplied by the RegistrarGeneral. The birth-rate for England and Wales as a whole was 18.2 and for London 20.1. Seven hundred and eighty-five illegitimate births took place in the Borough compared with 725 in 1962.

The corrected number of deaths for the Borough, after allowing for these factors, was 5,222 of whom 2,422 were males and 2,800 females. The crude death-rate for the year was 14.9 compared with 14.4 for 1962, but after taking into account the area comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General, the adjusted rate works out at 11.8. The death-rate for England and Wales as a whole was 12.1 and for London 12.4. Table II shows the total number of registered deaths and the death-rates for each division based on the approximate population in each division. 10 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 TABLE II Corrected Deaths Death Males Females Total ###] Putney 565 587 1,152 10.8 Central 890 1,083 1,973 21.7 Clapham 531 636 1,167 14.5 Streatham 436 494 930 12.9 Whole Borough 2,422 2,800 5,222 14.9 Table III is the general mortality table for the whole Borough and shows the number of deaths from each cause divided into sexes, age groups and sub-districts. The larger number of deaths shown in the Central Division as compared with the other Parliamentary Divisions is due mainly to the fact that in that area are located a number of hospitals for the mentally disordered. Such hospitals are classified by the RegistrarGeneral for the purpose of deaths statistics as non-transferable and consequently, deaths occurring in these Institutions are allocated to this area.

This is equivalent to a rate of 0.46 per 1,000 live and still-births. 13 3 INFECTIVE DISEASES The number of deaths from all notifiable infectious diseases was 74. This included 25 from all forms of tuberculosis and 48 from the notifiable forms of pneumonia. There was one death from meningococcal meningitis. From all notifiable infective diseases the death-rate was 0.21 per 1,000. Table I shows the number of cases of the notifiable diseases reported, arranged in age groups, and Table II shows the same figures arranged in the sub-district in which they occurred. Smallpox No case occurred during the year. Notification is received from Port and Local Authorities of persons coming into the Borough who may have been in contact with smallpox. Observation for the necessary period is kept on these persons by members of the staff of the Public Health Department. Additional work in connection with smallpox now devolves on the public health staff by reason of the fact that, under the Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations, 1952-63, persons arriving in this country by air, who are not in possession of valid international certificates of vaccination against smallpox, must be placed under surveillance for up to 14 days. It is now the prevailing practice of the Airport Health Control Units to inform local authorities of any persons arriving by air who are proceeding to addresses in their areas, in order that those authorities may arrange the necessary surveillance. With the ever increasing flow of air travel, more and more people come to this country to stay, permanently or otherwise, and consequently, many notifications are received by the Health Department from Airport Authorities in accordance with the Regulations. Diphtheria Several suspected cases were reported and investigated but in no case was the diagnosis confirmed. Whooping Cough Three hundred and thirty-seven cases were notified during the year.

Poliomyelitis Six cases of this disease were reported and investigated during the year, compared with 12 in the previous year, but all were subsequently not confirmed. The figures of poliomyelitis from 1947 to 1963, the period during which the incidence of the disease in this country has been high, is shown in the following table: No. of cases reported as suspected poliomyelitis and investigated No. of cases confirmed: Deaths 1947 119 78 4 1948 31 15 6 1949 89 58 4 1950 71 40 7 (a) (b) paralytic non-paralytic 1951 29 4 7 â€” 1952 73 23 16 5 1953 73 19 8 2 1954 41 5 2 â€” 1955 104 22 27 1 1956 85 24 15 2 1957 147 43 28 4 1958 65 11 9 1 1959 73 13 4 1 1960 31 1 4 â€” 1961 33 2 1 1 1962 12 2 â€” â€” 1963 6 â€” â€” â€” Meningococcal Infection Six confirmed cases were notified, one of which proved fatal. Forty-one other cases were investigated but these were subsequently not confirmed. In 1962 there were six confirmed cases with one death. Acute Encephalitis No cases occurred during the year. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever Two confirmed cases of typhoid fever were notified early in March in the persons of a man and his wife who had been on holiday in Zermatt, Switzerland, where a major outbreak of typhoid had occurred, affecting, among others, many holiday makers from this country. INFECTIVE DISEASES 17 In addition to the surveillance of contacts of the two cases notified to the department, it was also necessary to keep under surveillance a number of other persons who had been in contact with confirmed cases resident in other areas. Scarlet Fever Eighty-nine cases were notified compared with 109 in 1962 and 107 in 1961. No deaths occurred. Puerperal Pyrexia During the year 35 cases were notified, of which 29 occurred in hospital and six at home. Seven of the hospital notifications referred to patients whose home addresses were outside the Borough. Information was also received of 11 cases, referring to Wandsworth residents whose confinements took place in hospitals located in other Metropolitan boroughs. Sonne Dysentery Investigation and systematic follow-up of all cases of dysentery, in which general practitioners co-operated fully with the Health Department, continued throughout the year and where it was considered necessary, stool specimens were obtained from family contacts for bacteriological examination. Approximately one half of the total cases for the year were single unrelated cases and the remaining cases were made up of minor outbreaks which occurred at four day nurseries and one hospital in the borough. Details of these minor outbreaks are given below: Date Outbreak No. of cases No. of faecal specimens examined from cases and contacts Jan./Feb. Day Nursery 13 65 Jan./Feb. â€ž â€ž 35 152 June/July â€ž â€ž 5 93 June/Aug. â€ž â€ž 21 201 Nov./Dec. Hospital 19 Taken by Hospital The figure of 247 cases finally arrived at for the year does not reflect fully the amount of work involved on visiting and following up. Many other cases reported as dysentery were investigated. Most of these proved negative on bacteriological examination. In 1962, there were 175 cases. 18 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 Influenza, Acute Influenzal Pneumonia and Acute Primary Pneumonia Acute influenzal pneumonia and acute primary pneumonia are the notifiable forms of pneumonia, and in 1963, 43 of the former and 97 of the latter were notified, as compared with 25 and 118 respectively for the previous year. Deaths attributable to acute influenzal pneumonia were 13; this figure is classified under influenza in the death table on page 11. Acute primary pneumonia accounted for 35 deaths. There were 414 deaths from all forms of pneumonia compared with 312 in 1962. Deaths in 1962 from acute influenzal pneumonia and acute primary pneumonia were respectively 6 and 34. Malaria No cases were reported. Erysipelas Twenty-four cases were notified. Other Infective Diseases Twelve deaths occurred from syphilis. Scabies Fourteen notifications were received. Sixteen treatments were given at the Council's Disinfecting Station during the year. At the Battersea Cleansing Station, a total of 59 treatments for scabies and verminous conditions was given to women residents (and children under school age) of Wandsworth in accordance with arrangements made by this Council with the Battersea Borough Council in 1955. Food Poisoning Investigations were made in 95 notified or otherwise reported cases during the year. Fifty-one of these were deemed to be not food poisoning after laboratory examination of faecal specimens from those affected. Of the remaining notifications, 38 were single unrelated cases and two involved two or more persons. Most of the single cases were only slightly affected. As a result of bacteriological examination carried out, causative agents were found in 18 cases. The organisms isolated were Salmonellae typhimurium (10), heidelberg (2), brandenburg (2), and one each of anatum, bredeney, irumu and johanesberg. INFECTIVE DISEASES 19 Diseases Reported from Schools A total of 3,732 infective diseases was reported from schools in the Borough throughout the year. The numbers of each disease were: Scarlet Fever 72 Measles 1,370 German Measles 277 Meningococcal Infection 5 Chicken Pox 778 Scabies 4 Whooping Cough 107 Mumps 679 Dysentery 81 Other Complaints 359 Disinfection During the year 153 rooms were disinfected after infectious and other disease, 248 rooms disinfested for vermin, and 43 rooms for miscellaneous conditions. Bacteriological Examinations All bacteriological examinations are carried out at the Public Health Laboratory at County Hall under its Director, Dr. A. J. H. Tomlinson, to whom I would like to express thanks for the help and assistance that he and his staff have given to my Department during the year. The following is a summary of examinations made during the year: Nose and throat swabs 1,058 Faeces and urine for the typhoid and dysentery groups 2,987 Miscellaneous specimens 3 Total 4,048 Contacts of Infectious Diseaseâ€”Exclusion from work It is sometimes considered necessary, in order to prevent the spread of infection, to exclude from work for a period certain contacts of infectious disease. This applies particularly to persons engaged in food handling and the requisite authority for the Medical Officer of Health to exclude such persons from work is given under regulations made under the National Insurance Act, 1946, and the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1953. In connection with such exclusions from work, it should be noted that since the inclusion of Section 26 in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, it is now possible, if the borough council sees fit, to compensate persons for any loss occasioned by their compliance with the request of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year, no case arose that necessitated action under this Act but two contacts of infectious disease who were excluded from work were issued with certificates enabling them to draw National Health sickness benefit. 20 TUBERCULOSIS Notifications The total number of new cases which came to the notice of the Department during 1963 was 293 compared with 320 in 1962. The sources of information regarding the new cases were as follows: Primary notifications on Form A 165 Unnotified at death 2 Transfers from other sanitary authorities 26 Total 93 Deaths The number of deaths certified as due to various forms of tuberculosis was 25. Particulars of the new cases and deaths during the year, classified by sexes and age-groups, are given in the following table : Age Periods New Cases Deaths Pulmonary NonPulmonary Pulmonary NonPulmonary M.

The death rate was 2.60 per 1,000. The number of deaths in 1963 was 11 less than in the previous year. Deaths from disease of the heart and circulatory system were 2,098 compared with 2,079 in 1962. Of these deaths 1,732 were of persons of 65 years of age and above. There were 861 deaths from diseases of the respiratory system compared with 638 in 1962. The number of deaths from bronchitis was 377 compared with 271 in 1962, and from pneumonia (all forms) 414 compared with 312 in 1962. One hundred and ninety-five deaths were due to violence, 46 of them due to motor accidents, 57 to suicide and 92 to other forms of violence. CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION Two thousand, six hundred and sixty-five requests were received from residents in the Borough for a certificate of vaccination or inoculation to be authenticated for the purpose of travel abroad. The signature of the person issuing the certificate was verified in each case as that of a registered medical practitioner practising in Wandsworth and the certificate endorsed accordingly. As referred to in last year's Report, the risk of importation of smallpox to countries by travellers from smallpox endemic areas has caused a tightening up by most countries of their regulations in regard to vaccination, and in consequence, many more requests than was previously the case are now made to Health Departments for the authentication of international certificates. Occasional requests were also received by the Medical Officer of Health for a certificate to the effect that no recent cases of smallpox have occurred in the area. Such requests are made by persons proceeding to the U.S.A. who do not wish to be vaccinated. STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS At the request of the Committees and Chief Officers concerned, arrangements were made during the year for three members of the Council's staff to undergo special medical examinations. The purpose of the examination was to determine the employee's future fitness for his occupation, following serious illness, and in one case it was found necessary to recommend superannuation. Sixty-one shorter reports on members of the staff who were sick were obtained from doctors at the request of the departments concerned. 22 4 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE BOROUGH Work of the Public Health Inspectors A summary of the inspections carried out by the Inspectors is given in Table I.

In 56 premises the water supply was cut off for non-payment of rates, and 316 premises because of defects in the service. 24 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 Dustbin Accommodationâ€”Section 105, Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and Section 12, London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 Action was taken under the above-mentioned Acts in respect of 27 premises and during this period 37 dustbins were provided. Dustbins were also provided at 17 premises without the necessity of action under the Acts. Rodent Control One thousand, four hundred and ninety-five rat and mice complaints were received during the year. Following is a summary of the work of the rodent operatives: Number of operatives' visits to premises 8,457 â€ž â€ž premises treated with "Warfarin" 1,332 â€ž â€ž premises "Warfarin" laid and found not troubled 33 â€ž â€ž premises investigated and found not troubled 81 â€ž â€ž "Warfarin" baits laid 4,892 â€ž â€ž drains tested by Public Health Inspector 155 â€ž â€ž drains found defective 107 â€ž â€ž rats estimated killed 2,064 At the close of the year there were five rodent operatives and one clerk engaged on rodent control duties. Public Swimming Baths The position remains much the same as described in my Report last year. There are in the Borough the following public swimming baths : Four indoor swimming baths owned by the Borough Council. One open air swimming bath owned by the Borough Council. One open air swimming bath owned by the London County Council. The source of water for one of the Borough Council's baths is from an artesian well and for the other baths, including that owned by the London County Council, from the Metropolitan Water Board's supply. All the public swimming baths in the Borough now operate a modern process of continuous circulation through a filtration plant with chlorination of the water. The same process operates in the case of the London County Council open air swimming bath. During the year, bacteriological samples were taken from the Borough Council baths; slight deviations from normal were found initially in a few samples but subsequent tests all proved satisfactory. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE BOROUGH 25 In addition to the public swimming baths, there are four private swimming baths in the Borough, to one of which the public may be admitted. These all have continuous filtration plants but continuous chlorination operates in two only. In the two baths remaining, chlorine is added by hand. Samples of water taken from these baths during the year all proved satisfactory on bacteriological examination. Welfare of Old People Once again, it is a pleasure to record that firm links have been established between the Health Department and Wandsworth Old People's Welfare Council. With Councillor Mrs. O. Haines as Chairman and Mr. A. N. Bransom as General Secretary, progress continues. Alderman Mrs. A. E. Bush, J.P., is Chairman of the Welfare Council's Finance and Meals Committee and Mrs. M. Nutting, O.B.E., has the responsibility for the detailed arrangements relating to the Meals on Wheels service of approximately 1,200 meals per week. There are six Luncheon Clubs and in this context, the Catering Organiser, Miss M. E. V. Hood, supervises an organisation which serves approximately 3,000 meals every week. Mrs. E. Peacock, M.B.E., J.P., Chairman of the Clubs' Committee, maintains an active interest in the Wandsworth clubs for old people which now number 46 and Miss L. S. Reid, B.A., Chairman of the Visiting Committee, reports that more than 900 old people have been visited by nearly 250 visitors, all of whom work entirely on a voluntary basis. Mrs. M. Lumley was the pioneer for the voluntary visiting of old people residing in Streatham and the Visiting Organiser, Mr. G. Locke, shows every intention of extending this service throughout the Borough. More than 100 patients attend the six chiropody clinics every week. In addition, 120 domiciliary visits have been made. As for holidays, the Wandsworth Old Folks Trust enabled nearly 400 old people to enjoy a holiday at the seaside. Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, the Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply for an Order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or being aged, infirm, or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, unable to devote to themselves and not receiving from others proper care and attention. Although compulsory removal is sometimes 26 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 unavoidable, it is a step which is taken with the greatest reluctance, for the element of compulsion in itself may exert an adverse effect upon the patient. The aim is always to help aged persons in every way possible by virtue of the day-to-day services of the voluntary and statutory organisations. In almost every case, these services provide aged persons with sufficient care and attention to avoid the need for resorting to legal action. In January, however, during one of the worst winters in living memory, compulsory removal to hospital was required in two cases. The first was a bed-ridden old lady aged 87, residing alone in distressing circumstances in the basement of a house scheduled for demolition. After her admission to hospital, investigation revealed that the patient was suffering from cancer from which she later died. The second patient, an old lady aged 81, bed-ridden and also suspected of suffering from cancer, had consistently refused hospital treatment despite the fact that her condition was deteriorating. In this case, the patient succumbed to her illness two weeks after her admission to hospital. Bathing Attendance A part-time woman bathing attendant is employed to visit the homes of frail old people who require and would like assistance with bathing in their own homes. This service continued to be greatly appreciated by all those old persons who received help during the year. Thirty-eight such persons were visited, mostly at weekly intervals, by the attendant. Cleansing of Soiled Linen of Aged and Infirm The demand for assistance under this service continued to increase throughout the year, the soiled bed linen or clothing of ninety-six separate elderly and infirm persons being dealt with, involving the collection, cleansing and return of 2,449 lots of linen during the year. This constitutes an increase of 70% over 1962 figures. Eradication of Bed Bugs The methods employed for freeing infested houses include the stripping of all paper from the walls, the removal of wooden mouldings and skirtings and application of a blow lamp to the room surfaces. Spraying of rooms by the disinfecting staff of the Council is carried out, proprietary insecticides being used and infested bedding is removed to the Disinfecting Station and treated by steam. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE BOROUGH 27 During the year 75 houses were found to be infested with bed bugs and disinfestation was carried out in all cases. Special steps are taken to ensure that the furniture and clothing of families about to be accommodated in the Council's houses or flats are freed from vermin. Hydrogen cyanide gas is used for the disinfestation of the furniture, which is placed in special vans constructed for the purpose, the process being carried out by a contractor. The furniture of one family was dealt with during the year. Bedding is not subjected to hydrogen cyanide but is disinfested by steam at the Council's Disinfecting Station. Mortuary Reference was made in last year's Report to the Council's decision to close and demolish its mortuary in York Road, it having been, for some years, retained solely as a reserve mortuary in case of emergency. In conformity, therefore, with the Council's decision, the mortuary, which was built in 1920, was duly demolished during the year under review and the site is now being developed for housing purposes. The existing arrangements with Battersea Borough Council for the use of their mortuary for the reception of bodies of Wandsworth residents continued to work most satisfactorily and in 1963, 846 bodies of persons who died in Wandsworth were received in the Battersea mortuary. Crematorium Under the Crematorium Regulations, 1930, 1,672 cremations were authorized during 1963, compared with 1,490 in 1962. Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the responsibility of the Council to arrange for the burial of persons who die or are found dead in the Borough, and for whom no suitable burial arrangements are made or are being made. The number of persons buried under the provisions of the Act during 1963 was 36. Sewerage The arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the district are reasonably adequate although occasional flooding has occurred in the Borough due to surcharging of sewers following periods of heavy rain. 28 5 HOUSING STATISTICS RELATING TO HOUSES Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Number of houses inspected on account of complaints or illness 7,349 Re-inspections 15,908 Number of statutory notices served : Intimation notices 1,407 Nuisance notices 371 Number of houses in which nuisances were abated 1,408 The number of cases referred to the Solicitor for legal action during 1963 was 74 The following is a summary of Police Court Proceedings: Number of summonses served 31 â€ž â€ž â€ž withdrawn 17 â€ž â€ž â€ž adjourned 5 â€ž â€ž Orders made for abatement of nuisances 9 Housing Acts, 1936 and 1957 Clearance of Unfit Houses: Number of houses included in representations under Section 157 of the Housing Act, 1957 6 Number of houses included in declared Clearance Areas under Section 42 of the Housing Act, 1957 63 Number of houses demolished following action under Section 42 of the Housing Act, 1957 14 Number of houses demolished following action under Section 43(2) of the Housing Act, 1957 Nil Demolition Orders: Number of Demolition Orders made under Section 17(1) of the Housing Act, 1957 Nil Number of houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 17(1) of the ing Act, 1957 Nil Closing Orders: Number of Closing Orders made on houses under Section 17(1) of the Housing Act, 1957 3 Number of houses closed in pursuance of an undertaking given by the owner under Section 16(4) of the Housing Act, 1957 Nil Number of Closing Orders made on parts of buildings under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957 7 Number of undertakings given by owners to close parts of buildings under Section 16(4) of the Housing Act, 1957 1 Number of Closing Orders determined under Section 27 of the Housing Act, 1957 9 HOUSING 29 New Accommodation The following table shows the number of new dwellings built by the Wandsworth Borough Council, the London County Council and private persons over the past 10 years.

Thirty-five applications were received for Certificates of Disrepair and were dealt with as follows : (a) In five cases it was decided not to issue Certificates of Disrepair as the premises were not in disrepair by reason of defect. (b) In thirty cases it was decided to serve notices on landlords proposing to issue Certificates of Disrepair unless undertakings to do repairs were given. (c) Fourteen undertakings were received from landlords to remedy defects proposed to be included in Certificates of Disrepair. (d) Nine Certificates of Disrepair were issued. Applications for Cancellation of Certificates. (a) Twelve applications were received from landlords for the cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair. (b) Three objections were received from tenants for cancellation of Certificates. (c) In one case it was considered that the tenant's objections were not justified and the Certificate was cancelled. (d) Ten Certificates of Disrepair were cancelled. Housing Accommodationâ€”Medical Priority During the year 987 of the applications made to the Council for rehousing were referred to me for consideration of additional points on health grounds in accordance with the Council's Points Scheme. I also made 237 recommendations for transfer on health grounds in respect of applications received from tenants of the Council's properties for the provision of more suitable alternative accommodation. 32 6 FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES With the object of ensuring that food businesses are supervised systematically, a register of all premises where a food business is carried on has been compiled and is kept up to date. This Register includes not only those premises which are subject to some form of legal control, but also all other premises in which a food business of any description is carried on. The total number of food premises on the register in the Borough is 2,601 and during 1963 they were visited on 10,344 occasions. Table I has been drawn up to show the number of visits to various food premises in different parts of the Borough. Supervision of the food supply is carried out by four senior Inspectors who each procure samples of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst and the Public Health Laboratory. They also supervise premises where food is sold, stored, manufactured or prepared for sale and carry out the duties required under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. District inspectors holding the additional certificate of Inspectors for Food and Drugs carry out the day-to-day supervision of the catering establishments in their respective areas. Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 Work in connection with food hygiene continued throughout the year, and as has been generally found to be the case, since the Food Hygiene Regulations of 1955 came into operation, occupiers of food premises were co-operative and receptive to suggestions made by the inspectors for necessary improvements to their premises. A Court Summons was taken out by the Council against a trader for the presence of foreign matter in food and a fine of Â£5 and costs of Â£3 3s. Od. were awarded by the Court.

During the year 21 applications were received from persons to be registered as distributors of milk. In each case the certificate of registration was granted. Eighteen notices of cancellation of registration were received. At the end of the year there were 242 persons on the register. There were two dairies on the register at the end of the year. The bulk of the milk sold by retail within the Borough is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies and its quality is good. Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Two hundred and twenty-one samples of milk were submitted for analysis. Of these 33 were samples of Channel Island and South Devon milks with an average fat content of 4.55 per cent. The remaining 188 samples had an average fat content of 3.70 per cent. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 These Regulations which came into force on 1st October, 1960, provide for the issue of Dealer's (Prepacked Milk) Licences for the sale of milk under any of the following designations : " Pasteurized " " Sterilized " " Tuberculin Tested " where milk is obtained by the dealer in the container in which it is to be supplied to the consumer or is pasteurized or sterilized by the dealer. The following licences for the sale of milk under these designations and which will be valid for a period of five years, were granted during the year: Dealer's (Prepacked Milk) Licence " Pasteurized " 29 " Sterilized " 17 " Tuberculin Tested " 20 Total 66 A person who holds a "Tuberculin Tested" licence and a " Pasteurized " or " Sterilized " licence may use the designations " Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised)" or " Tuberculin Tested (Sterilized) " as the case may be. FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES 35 Meat There are 193 butchers' shops in the Borough. The majority are registered under Section 16 (1) (b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, preserved, pickled or pressed foods. There were 804 visits made to these shops during the year. Slaughter of Animals There are no private slaughterhouses in the Borough. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 Section 3 of this Act provides that no animals shall be slaughtered or stunned in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by a local authority and in force under this section. During the year no applications from persons desirous of acting as slaughtermen were received by the Council. Unsound Food Fifty-two varieties of foodstuff suspected to be unsound were examined at the request of the owners and afterwards either destroyed or released for animal feeding. The owners were granted a certificate to this effect. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 These Acts provide for the listing with the local authority of all persons dealing in poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. The number of persons on the Council's list at the end of 1963 was 297, and 528 visits were made to the premises of the listed persons by the Food Inspectors. The principal business conducted on the premises of these applicants is shown in Table II. The majority of the listed sellers are also Durvevors of food. TABLE H PART 11 OF POISONS LIST Principal Business Number of Premises Number of Visits Domestic stores, ironmongers, etc 79 84 Drug stores 19 19 Grocers 187 413 Hairdressers 7 7 Nurserymen and florists 5 5 Total 297 528 36 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1963 Bakehouses There are 50 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 10 are in basements and subject to the provisions of Section 70 of the Factories Act, 1961. Three hundred and eighty-eight visits by the Food Inspectors were made to these premises during the year. Certificates of suitability under the Factories Act, 1961 were granted in respect of 9 underground bakehouses. It was decided not to issue a certificate of suitability in respect of one underground bakehouse until certain work had been carried out to bring it up to the required standard. Water Supply The bulk of the water supply in the Borough is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board and this has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. The water to the whole of the area is piped by the Metropolitan Water Board. It is known that this large undertaking carries out bacteriological and chemical tests of raw water and after treatment. No specific action has been necessary in respect of contamination of the water supply but in the case of individual premises, following inspection by public health inspectors, close liaison is maintained with the Metropolitan Water Board whenever necessary. All dwelling houses, approximately 97,000, and the population of 348,450 in the Borough are supplied from water piped direct to houses. It is not known if any standpipes are still in existence. Registration of Premises The Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Section 16(1) of the above Act provides that no premises shall be used for : (a) the sale, or manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice-cream or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale; or (b) the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale, unless they are registered under this section for that purpose with a local authority. During the year 76 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 16(l)(a) and 19 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 16(l)(b) were submitted to the Council. In all cases the premises were found to be satisfactory and the registration granted.
