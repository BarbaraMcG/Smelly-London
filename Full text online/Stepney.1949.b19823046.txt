Woollon - 2 - METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY Public Health Department, 43, White Horse Road, STEPNEY, E.l. To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Report for the year 1949• The population of the Borough according to the RegistrarGeneral's estimate shows some increase and is now 100,550. The total Births decreased from 2,171 in 1948 to 1,872 this year, the live birth-rates being 21.2 and 18.19 per 1000 respectively. The Maternal Mortality rate was 0.53 per 1,000 total births. The Infant Mortality rate, after last year's low record, rose somewhat from 28.3 to 32.2. This year the incidence of infectious disease again remained low. Of 13 notified cases of Diphtheria the diagnosis was confirmed in only 3 cases none of which was fatal. . There were 16 cases of Poliomyelitis in the Borough with one death in a child aged 6 months. I have to report a decrease in the number of primary notifications of Tuberculosis which were 19 less than last year's figure of 189. The deaths from the disease were, however, the same as last year, namely 71. The National Health Services Act has now been in force some 18 months, the maternity and child welfare service now being the responsibility of the London County Council. All the infant welfare centres and day nurseries continue as formerly and have been well attended though there have not been any notable changes in the scheme since its transference from the Borough Council. One new voluntary day nursery was opened during the year at Thirza Street under the Sisters of Mercy. - 3 - The former Tuberculosis Dispensary, now known as the Chest Clinic , which was transferred from the Borough Council to the Regional Hospital Board had a successful year but there has been no alteration in the scheme since the transfer. It is with regret that I have to report that Mr. W.F. Lellow, the Assistant Administrative Officer, retired after 48 years in the Council's service, thirty of which were spent as chief clerk and assistant administrative officer in the Public Health Department. Mr.Lellow's long period of office extended over the regime of all four Medical Officers of Health since the Borough was founded and he witnessed great progress in the health and hygiene of Stepney. He gave of his best to the health service, and through his enthusiasm and interest contributed in no small measure to its success. In presenting my Annual Report I should like once more to express my gratitude to the Chairmen and Members of the Committees for their help and interest throughout the year and to acknowledge most gratefully the willing co-operation of the Staff of the Health Department. I have the honour to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. R. O'SHIEL, Medical Officer of Health. - 4 - STAFF OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT at 31st December, 1949.

UNEMPLOYMENT AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE. (a) The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied me with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough registered as unemployed at the end of the year:- Men Boys Women Girls Total 1976 18 191 11 - 2196 (b) The National Assistance Board has kindly provided the following information of the number of cases on their books At 1st January, 1949 •• 4195 At 31st December, 1949 •• 4402 - 7 - STEPNEY BOROUGH COUNCIL INFORMATION SERVICE. The work of the Information Service under the Borough Librarian has continued successfully throughout the past year and the Information Centre, situated at 671a, Commercial Road, E.14, has been increasingly used by citizens of Stepney who seek guidance or who require some information. Many persons are unaware of the legislation that exists for their protection and it is a distinct advantage to them to have one place in the Borough where they can be guided and have their rights and duties simply explained. The recent Social Legislation has caused many enquiries on the personal application of the Acts and during the past year a total of 2,468 enquiries were dealt with on the Social Services alone. This number formed part of the grand total of 9,8l6 enquiries received during the year and which covered a very extensive field. The scarcity of housing accommodation and the numerous problems arising from this also resulted in many seekers for advice at the Information Centre and the staff was able to alleviate much worry. Another feature of the work of the Information Service is the assistance rendered to old persons in their pension and other problems and by putting them in contact with suitable welfare organisations and clubs in the Borough. WELFARE OF AGED PERSONS. The problem of the aged sick and infirm still gives much cause for anxiety. During the year one person was removed under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association was formed towards the end of 1948 following a representative conference convened by the Stepney Borough Council in March 1948. It has representatives of the Borough Council, London County Council and all local statutory and voluntary interests. Grants are made to the voluntary associations by the Borough Council under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. There are now eleven clubs, all affiliated to the association. Luncheons are provided at the W.V.S. club, the Toynbee Veterans Club and the St.George's Club. The "Meals on Wheels" service is run by the W.V.S. from the Londoner's Meals Service and the Invalid Kitchens. A chiropody service for the aged was started by the St.Katharine's Club for Pensioners and is also now available at four other clubs. Home Helps are provided by the London County Council and Home Nursing by the East-London Nursing Society. All these services for the aged are rapidly expanding. A full account of progress is given in the Annual Report of the Association which can be obtained from the Secretary (Miss D.B. Halsall) at Butcher Row, Ratcliffe, E.14 (The Royal Foundation of St.Katharine). - 8 - II. GENERAL PROVISIONS OF HEALTH SERVICES STAFF.

A film trailer on "Burning and Scalding Accidents" was screened at the cinemas.

Publicity was given to the handling of food, protection against diarrhoea, whooping cough, tuberculosis, influenza, venereal diseases, measles, scabies etc. In all, approximately 20,000 leaflets and posters were utilised for health propaganda purposes. TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTED. During the year the Tuberculosis Care Committee has continued its useful work amongst tuberculosis patients and their families on the same lines as before. 95 cases have been assisted - with clothing, removal expenses, pocket money, insurance arrears, lino and curtains for new homes, wireless repairs and licences, extra nourishments, Christmas gifts, etc. The Committee acknowledge with gratitude the help again given by local firms and friends by the purchase of the Christmas seals. From the sale this year £332 was raised, practically as large an amount as last year, and a sum which will enable the Committee to consider favourably the often very sad cases brought to their notice. They also thank the London County Council for arranging the continuance of the grant from the Sunday Cinema performances, the National Assistance Board, the Jewish Board of Guardians, and the British Red Cross Society for their help and co-operation, and the several members of the Committee who have during the year brought very welcome gifts of clothing for patients . - 10 - PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS. 1925. These regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary to take action under the regulations during the year. MASS MINIATURE RADIOGRAPHY. Arrangements were made with the London County Council and the North Eastern Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board for obtaining volunteers from commercial, industrial and other undertakings in the Borough, for X-ray examinations under the Mass Miniature Radiography System. A circular letter was sent by the Stepney Public Health Department to firms in the Borough employing more than 25 people. Over 450 such firms were circulated.

A total of 626 overcrowded families were rehoused during the year - 199 by the London County Council and 427 by the Borough Council. During the year the Government of Cyprus, before issuing . visas, asked for inspections to be made of accommodation alleged to be available here for immigrants from Cyprus, in order to prevent infringement of the Housing Act, 1936. This is a welcome innovation which I should like to see followed by other countries . Preferential Housing on the grounds of health. 129 cases were investigated : 37 cases were referred to the London County Council for rehousing and 30 to the Stepney Borough-Council Rehousing Department. Underground Rooms There are approximately 4,000 underground rooms which do not comply with the Housing Act and the Regulations made thereunder.

Of the requisitioned properties inspected, 17 were recommended to the Housing Manager for de-requisition for various reasons. V. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The work of the Food Section has increased during the year, which will be seen from a perusal of this-report. In particular, the number of legal proceedings has increased to 70 as compared with 3? in the previous year and the amount of unsound food condemned on.the.wharves is.260 tons as against 90 tons in 1948. Whenever possible, foodstuff condemned by the Food Inspectors is diverted for use as animal food. Efforts have been made during the year to improve conditions under which food is prepared, sold and stored. Although there has been some measure of success in this direction, the difficulty of carrying out substantial improvements in old and worn out property in the borough must always present a problem. When improvement schemes visualised are carried forward to completion, real progress will be made. 30 Summary-of inspections, etc. by the specialist inspectors engaged in the supervision and inspection of food.

Unsatisfactory Bacteriological examination Examined. Unsatisfactory Schools 6 - 6 - Hospitals & LCC Homes 23 - - Day Nurseries 3 - - - Milk (Special Designations) (Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) & (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, These Regulations came into operation on 1st October, 1949) and included the new designation "Sterilised." The regulations are an' attempt to encourage the sale and consumption of ' safe ' milk and it is anticipated that eventually only persons holding licences under these regulations will sell milk. Provision is made for licences to be granted free of charge. As a result, there.has been an increase in' the number of licences issued, i.e. 340 as against 39 issuedduring the previous year . This has caused a considerable increase of work to the Food Inspectors and clerical staff. Details of the licences issued are as follows:- if Dealer 1s Licences Supplementary Licences.

In addition, talks were given to the employees on the care and handling of foodstuffs. Further samples taken proved satisfactory. Ice Cream 155 (Bee special report on ice cream.) Ice Cream. ■ ■ ■ 1 ■ ■ The total number of premises registered in the bOrough is 215, of which 41 are registered for manufacture, 169. for sale, and 5 for storage only. Systematic inspection of all these premises is carried out by the Food Inspectors. 489' inspections were made during the year and 56 Notices, were served for cleansing and other requirements. 33 155 samples of ice cream were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination with the following results: No. made in Borough No. made outside Borough Grade 1 41 (34) 21 20 Grade 2 44 (29) 11 33 Grade 3 42 (44) 21 21 Grade 4 28 (55) 15 13 The numbers in parenthesis show the figures for 1948. The steady improvement in the bacteriological standard of ice cream has been maintained. The percentage of grades 3 and 4 samples of those examined, was 78.5 in 1947, 6l.l in 1948 and 45.1 in 1949. 122 samples were submitted for chemical analysis, showing a fat content varying from 0.39 to 17.03 per cent, with an average of 7.87 per cent. 33 of the samples contained over 10 per cent of fat, 63 between 5 and 10 per cent of fat, and 26 less than 5 per cent of fat. Butchers' Shops and Stalls . 323 inspections were made during the year and 38 Notices served. Bakehouses and Bakers 'Shops. 338 inspections were made and 11 Notices served. 139 cleansings were carried out to the 69 bakehouses in the Borough During the year, the quinquennial survey of basement bakehouses took place and, as a result of this survey, only 9 of the 20 existing basement bakehouses in the borough were regarded as suitable for the continuance,of the licences originally issued in 1903 under the provisions of the Factory Act, 1901. Notice was given to the owners of the remaining 11 basement bakehouses under the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937? that their premises were not suitable and that the licences would be withdrawn. Having regard to the difficult circumstances existing at the present timey 3 ye'ars notice of closure was given to the owners to enable them to fin3 premises at ground or above ground level. In one case, notice of appeal was givenwithin the statutory time and as a Writ was issued in the High Court disputing that the premises were a "basement" bakehouse, the matter remained in abeyance at the; end of 1949* 34 Butter and Margarine Factories .

Kosher meat is delivered from Islington Cattle Market and non-kosher meat from Smithfield Market. There are two main contractors,and. vans conveying meat into the Borough are inspected regularly. No contravention of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924-1948, was found and the vans inspected were generally satisfactory although some are of out of date construction. Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937. In January, a consignment of 800 cases of French Pork Brawn was landed at a wharf in the Borough unaccompanied by the official certificate as required by the Public Health (Imported. Food) Regulations, 1937 • A detention Notice was served and the importers communicated with. Within twO days they had. obtained, the official certificate by air-mail from France and -the brawn, after inspection, was released. 35 Canned Australian Barracouta Fish- In August, samples of canned Australian Barracouta fish were taken,for examination for metallic contamination, from three lots' (approx, 7,000 cases) landed at two wharves in the borough. These samples showed the presence of lead in amounts varying from 4 to 10 parts per million and the three consignments were placed under detention, The Ministry of Food were informed and an undertaking has been received that the fish will be re-exported and its reimportation prohibited. Samples were taken in December from a further consignment landed-at one of the wharves and these showed the-presence of lead varying from 4 to 10 parts per million. The whole consignment (7,604 cases) was placed under detention and notification sent to the Ministry of Food. Date Juice. In March, quantities of date juice arrived from Basra at one of the wharves in the borough. This juice was contained in 4-gallon petrol cans and 50-gallon oil drums , and samples were taken to determine whether petrol and cresols were contaminating the date juice. 11 samples were taken at one wharf, care being taken to obtain the samples from different levels in the drums; in addition, 2 bulk samples were taken. Analyses showed that in all the samples there was an absence of petrol and cresols and that the lead content was less than 1 part per million, Eventually the date juice was released for manufacturing purposes. Arsenical Contamination of Italian Pears . ;During the examination of 17 trucks of Italian pears which arrived at Bishopsgate Goods Station ex ZeebruggeHarwich Train Ferry on 2nd August, it was observed that several of the trucks contained pears which were contaminated by what appeared to be arsenical insecticide. Three of the trucks most heavily contaminated were detained, and samples were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst. In his report, the Public Analyst stated that the samples contained only 1/2000, 1/700 and 1/3200 grains of arsenic (as grains arsenious oxide) per pound of fruit as compared with the accepted limit of 1/100 grains per pound.. The pears were subsequently released on .condition that they would be cleaned before sale to the public . From that date, all Italian pears were detained pending full examination and where evidence of Serious contamination was visible, were released only on condition that cleansing was carried out before sale. 36 Further samples were taken from time to time and all were well below the accepted limit of 1/100 grain per pound. During the period 2nd to 31st August, 192 trucks of Italian pears were examined and of these, 26 were released conditionally upon cleansing before sale. Consignments of the pears were also received at Spitalfields Market during the same period and these were dealt with similarly.

Infectious Disease Contacts. . Where persons are precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier, or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946_, are only paid..on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer, of Health. It was not found. . necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. Authentication of Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Circular 60/48 of the Ministry of Health relates to the difficulties in some countries by travellers from the United Kingdom who are required to prove that the certificates of vaccination or inoculation carried by them are genuine. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless endorsed by a medical officer in the government or municipal service-in which they are issued. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Arrangements were made to have the signatures authenticated by endorsement of the certificates, and during the year 53 such signatures were authenticated by me. Smallpox. No cases of smallpox were notified during the year and it was not necessary for me to take action under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917* - 39 - Verminous Persons .
