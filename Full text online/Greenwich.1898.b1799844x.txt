The above-mentioned notices were, in most cases, complied with, but proceedings were taken against the owners of four houses, all in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, for neglecting to execute such works and do such things as were necessary for the purpose of abating the nuisances arising upon such premises, and resulted in the magistrate making orders for the abatement of the nuisances. Proceedings were also taken against the owner of a piece of land and premises in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, for neglecting to execute the required works for abating the nuisance arising upon those premises, and the magistrate made an abatement order. Proceedings were also taken against the owner of premises in the Parish of Greenwich, for neglecting to execute such works and do such things as were necessary for the purpose of abating the nuisance arising in a mews at the rear of that house, and the magistrate made an order for the abatement of the nuisance, and prohibiting such owner from allowing the recurrence of such or a like nuisance. Proceedings were also taken against the occupier of a shed in the Parish of Greenwich, for neglecting to execute the required works for abating the nuisance arising at such shed, and the magistrate made an order, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prohibiting the use of such shed for human habitation. Proceedings were also taken against the occupier of a tent upon certain land in the Parish of Greenwich, for using such tent for human habitation in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, and the magistrate made an order prohibiting such occupier from allowing the recurrence of the said or a like nuisance. Proceedings were also taken against the owner of a house in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, for neglecting to provide a sufficient ash-pit to such house, and he was fined 5s., and 4s. costs. Proceedings were also taken against the occupiers of two pieces of land in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, upon which was carried on the manufacture and burning of bricks causing effluvia, and which manufacture had been certified to the Sanitary Authority by one of its Medical Officers of Health to be a nuisance and dangerous to the health ol the inhabitants residing in the vicinity of such brickfields. The summonses came on for hearing in the first place before one of the magistrates not regularly sitting at the Greenwich Police Court, but he said that they would occupy several sittings of the Court and he could not hear them. They were accordingly adjourned until a date when a newly-appointed magistrate for that Court would be sitting. On their coming on before him he pointed out that such cases were more expeditiously and economically heard in the High Court, but on being told this course would not be agreeable to the parties he proceeded to hear the summonses, which, after some evidence had been given, were further adjourned. On the appointed day the hearing was further proceeded with, and at the conclusion of that sitting the magistrate adjourned the summonses sine die, leaving Counsel to make arrangements for proceeding with them after the legal Long Vacation had terminated. When that period arrived, however, the last mentioned magistrate had been transferred from the Greenwich to the Southwark and North London Police Courts. He was applied to, to proceed with the summonses but said he could not go back to Greenwich to hear them, and would have to hear them at Southwark, but the Chief Clerk there pointed out that all the time of that Court was absorbed for some months to come. It was therefore obvious that if the summonses were heard at all they could only be heard in such scraps of time as could from time to time be given to them at Southwark. To conduct business in this way was obviously impracticable in consequence of the delay and expense which would have been involved, and consequently it was agreed with the Solicitors of the defendants that no further proceedings should be taken on those summonses, but, at the same time, it was pointed out to the defendants' Solicitors that if further certificates were given, certifying those manufactories to be a nuisance, or dangerous to the health of any of the inhabitants of the district, the Board would have no option but to commence proceedings de novo. Proceedings were also taken against the owner of two newlyerected houses in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, for permitting those houses to be occupied- as dwelling houses without it having been certified by the Sanitary Authority that such houses had a proper and sufficient supply of water, and the magistrate ordered the defendant to pay a penalty of £5, and 2s. costs, in respect of each of such two houses. Proceedings were also taken against the occupier of certain premises in the Parish of Greenwich, used as a dairy and cowsheds, for making default in complying with the requisition of a notice served upon such occupier by the Sanitary Authority, requiring such occupier to do what was necessary for preventing the recurrence of a nuisance arising from an accumulation or deposit of manure upon such premises, and the magistrate fined such occupier £5, and 2s. costs. Proceedings were also taken against the occupier of a bakehouse in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, for using such bakehouse when it was in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use, and such occupier was fined £2, and £2 2s. costs. Proceedings were also taken against a person residing in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, for wilfully obstructing an officer of the Sanitary Authority duly employed in the execution of his duties under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the obstruction being that such person persistently refused to allow the house refuse to be taken away from the house in which such person resided, and the magistrate fined such person £2, and 2s. costs. Proceedings were also taken against the occupier of certain Electric Light Works in the Parish of Saint Nicholas, Deptford, for allowing a chimney at those Works to send forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance. Summonses were issued in respect of two days, and on their being heard, the magistrate imposed a fine of £10, and 2s. costs for each offence, making together, £20 4s. The defendant, however, gave notice of appeal to the Quarter Sessions against such convictions, but such appeals were ultimately withdrawn. The same defendant was also proceeded against for similar offences on two subsequent occasions, and was fined £10, and £3 3s. costs, in the one case, and £10, and £5 ss. costs, in the other. Proceedings were also taken against the occupiers of two factories in the Parish of Greenwich, respectively, for similar offences, and they were each fined £10, and 2s. costs. Proceedings were also taken against two persons for unlawfully throwing or laying rubbish in certain thoroughfares in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, and they were each fined 5s., and 2s. costs. During the year, 671 newly-erected houses in the district, viz. : —284 in Greenwich, and 387 in Saint Paul, Deptford, were inspected for the purpose of ascertaining if they were provided with a proper and sufficient supply of water, and such being found to be the case, the Sanitary Authority granted a certificate to that effect in respect of each of such houses. During the same period, 1,127 rooms and the following articles were disinfected after cases of infectious disease, namely : 8 15 beds, 1,657 pillows, 614 bolsters, 229 palliasses, 286 mattresses, 609 sheets, 886 blankets, and 4,169 odd articles, making 9,295 articles in all. It was found necessary during the same period to destroy 7 beds, 14 palliasses, 1 pillow, 1 bolster, 6 cushions, and 25 odd articles, making together 54 articles, which had become infected. During the same period 5 class rooms of a school in the district were disinfected, in consequence of there having been an epidemic of measles among the children attending that school. During the year the premises in East Street, Greenwich, acquired by the Board for the purpose of providing shelter and accommodation for the temporary use of such inhabitants of the district as might be compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, were not required to be so used. During the year the Board registered eleven houses in the Parish of Greenwich, and eighteen in the Parish of Saint Paul, Deptford, as Lodging Houses, under the Bye-laws made by the Board, under the provisions of Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. During the year the Board acquired certain land in Greenwich Marshes for the purposes of the Parish of Greenwich, and notice was given to the tenants of such land to terminate their tenancy. The new street, from Evelyn Street to Creek Road, formed by the London County Council under the provisions of the London Council (General Powers) Act, 1891, having been completed, was, under the powers of that Act, placed under the care, management, control and jurisdiction of the Board. During the year the Board carried out an improvement by opening up the northern end of Watson Street, Deptford, and carrying through that street as a public thoroughfare into Douglas Street, thereby forming a new line for vehicular traffic, running parallel with High Street and connecting the New Cross Road with Douglas Street. Another improvement in connection with the one before mentioned, by widening the passage leading from High Street to Watson Street, is now in progress. During the year the Board took over from the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association the whole of the fountains and troughs previously maintained by that Associa- tion, in the Board's district, and they are now under the control and management of the Board. At the suggestion of the London County Council, each of the street lamp-posts in close proximity to the fire alarms in the Board's districts has been painted a bright red colour, and a tablet bearing the words " Fire Alarm" has been fixed on it. Consent was given to the Post Office Authorities to erect and maintain a line of telegraph, to be carried by ornamental iron poles, along Pepys Road, from Arbuthnot Road to the New Cross Road, in connection with the New Cross Fire Alarm System. During the year the Board erected, after obtaining permission from the owner of the property to do so, a ventilating shaft from the sewer in Windmill Lane, Deptford, against a house in that street. An order was also issued for the erection of a 9-inch ornamental steel shaft, thirty feet in height, to be fixed over or near one of the sewers in Greenwich Marshes, and the base fitted with an exhaust fan to be driven by water power, for the purpose of ventilating the sewers in that locality. The attention of the London County Council was called to a complaint received by the Board of the nuisance arising from the open ventilator, opposite the northern end of Florence Road, in connection with the Council's sewer in the New Cross Road ; and again to serious complaints received by the Board of the nuisance arising from the Council's main sewers in the Parish of Greenwich, especially as to that arising from the side entrances to the Council's sewer in proximity to Nos. 134 and 167, Greenwich Road, and in each case the Council was requested to take the necessary steps for abating such nuisances. During the year the Sanitary Inspectors collected, and the Public Analyst analysed, 199 samples, consisting of the following articles, viz. :— Butter 73 Milk 70 Separated Milk 2 Skim Milk 1 Coffee 23 Mustard 9 Lard 8 Pepper 7 Arrowroot 4 Cayenne Pepper 2 199 Proceedings were taken against the sellers of eight samples of butter, one of which was certified to be admixed with 95, one with 75, three with 70, two with 55, and one with 40 per cent, of margarine, respectively, and fines were inflicted amounting together to £17. Proceedings were also taken against the sellers of six samples of milk, one of which was certified to be admixed with 17, one with 14, one with 12, and one with 10 per cent, of added water, respectively, and two were certified to be deficient, one to the extent of 56, and the other to the extent of 27 per cent., of the fat proper to genuine milk, and fines were inflicted amounting together to £13 5s. During the year there were 24 Ordinary and Special Meetings of the Board, and the undermentioned Committees and Sub Committees held meetings as follows : — Finance Committee 26 Saint Paul Deptford Committee 23 Greenwich Committee 23 Saint Nicholas Deptford Committee 12 District Committee 4 Works and General Purposes Sub-Committee 33 Saint Paul Deptford Sanitary Sub-Committee 24 Greenwich Yard Sub-Committee 25 Greenwich Viewing Sub-Committee 3 Greenwich Quarterly Accounts Sub-Committee 8 Special Sub-Committee of the Saint Paul Deptford Committee 1 Making a total of 206 meetings during the year. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR DEPTFOBD. To the Greenwich. District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Work for the Registration Year, 1898, 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1898. POPULATION. The population of Saint Paul's Parish, as estimated according to the Registrar-General's method, for 1898, amounted to 109,982, and that for Saint Nicholas Parish is estimated at 8,122, making a total estimated population for the two Parishes of 118,104. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year 1898 was 3,715 (1,814 males and 1,901 females), being an increase from the previous year of 29 only, and equivalent to an annual rate of 31.7 per 1,000 persons living. The Birth Rate for London during the same period was 29.5, and for the thirty-two great towns 30.9. There were 3,463 births registered in the Parish of Saint Paul (1,688 males and 1,775 females), and 252 in Saint Nicholas Parish (126 males and 126 females). DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in Saint Paul's Parish was 1,499 (724 males and 775 females), in Saint Nicholas Parish, 137 (55 males and 82 females), in the South Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital, 226, and in outlying public institutions, 492, making a total of 2,354. Of the 226 deaths registered as occurring in the South-Eastern Hospital, only 18 were parishioners of Deptford, therefore, if these deaths, 208, are deducted from the gross number occurring in my district, it makes the number of deaths of parishioners only—including those dying in outlying Public Institutions—2,146, equivalent to an annual Death Rate of 18.1 per 1,000 persons living. The Death Rate in the thirty-two great provincial towns during the year was 19.3 per 1,000 persons living. Whilst the Death Rate for the Metropolis was 187 per 1,000; that for Saint Paul's Parish, including all parishioners, whether dying in or out of the parish was 17.7, and for Saint Nicholas Parish, 23.6. Full details will be found in Tabular Forms Nos. 1 and 2, and Table No. 2 gives the statistics of the births and deaths in the two parishes during the year, showing the number of deaths which occurred at the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital, including non-parishioners, and at the outlying public institutions. Table No. 3 shows the Death Rate in the two parishes during the last 10 years. Table No. 4 shows the excess of births over deaths in the two parishes of Saint Paul's and Saint Nicholas, Deptford. MORTALITY AT GROUPS OF AGES. The 2,354 deaths recorded during the year included 1,097 children under five years of age. The deaths of 671 children occurred under one year of age, and 426 deaths were registered between 1 and 5 years, 90 between the ages of 5 and 10; 177 between the ages of 10 and 30; 746 of persons between 30 and 70, and 244 were of persons aged upwards of 70. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Infantile mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year of age to births registered was equal to 180 per 1,000; whilst in the Metropolis as a whole, it was 178, and in the thirty-two great provincial towns it was 185 per 1,000. Out of a total of 2,354 deaths registered in the two parishes during the year, there were no less than 671 infants under one year of age. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The average Death Rate from the principal Zymotic diseases in the two parishes was 2.51, as against 2.78 for London generally, and 2.87 for the thirty-two provincial towns. The number of deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases registered as occurring at the houses of the parishioners was 297. Whilst in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital, 201 were registered, of these only 18 were parishioners of Deptford. The number of notifications of infectious diseases received under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 1,178, as compared with 1,416 and 1,478 for the two preceding years respectively. There was a marked decrease in all the diseases notified. A full detailed account of the deaths from all the Zymotic diseases which occurred in the two parishes, as well as in the Hospital, will be found in Tables Nos. 5 and 6, and a full account of the infectious diseases which have been notified during the year in Deptford, will be found in Table No. 7. Table No. 8 gives the analysis of the vital and mortal statistics of thirty-three of the largest English towns during the year 1898, showing among other particulars the statistics of the deaths from Zymotic diseases. Table No. 9 gives the Meteorological Statistics for London for the year 1898. Small Pox. There was not a single case of Small Pox reported in the district, and only one death was registered in London. Scarlet Fever. Of this disease 510 certificates of notification were received under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of these 6 were notified twice, and 6 were returned from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital as not being Scarlet Fever, and 6 cases were contracted in the Hospital by patients sent from other parts of the Metropolis. For the years 1897 and 1896, the number of cases notified were respectively 632 and 759. Three deaths were registered in private dwellings and 51 in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital. During the year 1897 eight deaths were registered in private dwellings, and 69 in the Hospital. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. There were 386 notification certificates received, of these 3 had been notified twice, and 6 were returned by the Hospital Authorities as not Diphtheria. For the previous year, 1897, 473 cases were notified. Of the deaths from Diphtheria 13 were registered as occurring in private houses, and 117 in the Hospital; whilst for the year 1897, 25 deaths occurred in private houses, and 123 in the Hospital, and for the year 1896, no less than 44 deaths occurred in private houses, and 146 in the Hospital. Fever. —This term includes Typhoid or Enteric, Typhus, Simple or Continued, and ill-defined forms of Fever to which 41 deaths were attributed : 7 occurring in outlying Institutions, 6 in private dwellings in the District, and 28 in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital. Certificates of Notification were received to the number of 105; of these 102 were Typhoid or Enteric Fever; of them 4 cases were notified twice, and 3 were reported by the Hospital Authorities as not Typhoid. A case of Typhus was reported as occurring in the Hospital, the patient being a resident Nurse ; and 2 cases of Continued Fever were reported. For the year 1897, 114 cases were notified, and 47 deaths were registered. Erysipelas.—154 cases were reported, 1 was noted three times, and 4 were notified twice. Puerperal Fever.—During the year 8 notifications were received under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. One case was certified twice, so that there were but 7 cases, as against 10 and 18 for the two previous years, and only two deaths were registered during the year, whilst 6 deaths were recorded during the year 1897. Measles is not a notifiable disease under the Public Health (London), Act, 1891, therefore it is impossible to ascertain the number of cases which occurred in the District. An epidemic broke out in the District in the early part of the year, in the month of February there were no less than 155 children out of 323 absent from the Infants' department of the Mantle Road Board School; and on February 19th, I reported the circumstance to the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, the Medical Officer ot the London County Council, and the Medical Officer of the London School Board, and, in accordance with Rule 88 of the Code of Regulations for Day Schools, the following notice was served on the Managers : — " As members of the Sanitary Authority, acting on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, and with a view to prevent the spread of Measles, we give notice to the Authorities to close the Infants Department of the Mantle Road Board School for a period of 14 days. (Signed) ALEX. ANDERSON, Chairman of Sanitary Sub-Committee. SAMUEL LEWES (Knt.)." I am pleased to say that through the courtesy of Professor Smith, the Medical Officer of the London School Board, the matter was expedited. A similar communication was sent to the Managers of St. James', Hatcham, National Schools, and these Schools were also closed. I gave instructions that the rooms were to he properly disinfected ; that the desks, benches and forms, as well as the floors and walls should be washed, and the windows and doors to be kept open as much as possible for ventilation. It is not surprising therefore that the death rate was high for the year, for 74 deaths were registered as occurring in private dwellings and four in hospital, whilst for the previous year 1897, only 18 deaths were registered in the district and 5 in the hospital. The year 1896 however showed 120 deaths in private houses and 11 in hospital. Whooping Cough caused 74 deaths; there were 72 deaths in the two parishes and 2 in outlying Institutions, as against 28 for the previous year, and 78 for 1896. Diarrhcea was the assigned cause of 138 deaths, of these 130 occurred in the district, and 8 in outlying Institutions, as against 135 for the previous year. Respiratory Diseases.—Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Pleurisy ; 318 deaths were registered in the district, and 96 as occurring in outlying Institutions; or a total of 414, as against 379 for the previous year. Phthisis, Pulmonary Consumption or Tuberculosis was the cause of a total of 177 deaths as against 154 for the previous year; of these 177 deaths, 130 were registered in the district, and 47 in outlying Institutions. This disease is now proved c 26 beyond all doubt to be a communicable disease from man to man, and also by taking infected food, as meat and milk. All meat, therefore, should be well cooked, and milk boiled before using : this latter being most important, especially where infants and invalids are fed almost entirely on milk diet. GENERAL REMARKS. The Sanitary work done in the district during the past year has been of a very satisfactory character. From the returns furnished by the Sanitary Inspectors it will be seen that, the number of complaints received was 346, whereas the number of complaints for the two previous years was 520 and 903 respectively, thus showing the permanent good results of the work done during the past few years. The number of premises inspected was 3,529, that of re-inspections, calls, service of notices, &c, 17,846. One house was closed (voluntarily) as unfit for habitation, and 7 underground rooms were abolished as dwelling rooms, and notices to abate overcrowding were served in 54 cases. The Disinfector had 677 rooms to disinfect; full details will be found in Table No. 10. The temporary shelter or house accommodation which was provided according to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for members of any family who were compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, was not required for use during the year, nor the year previous. The Inspectors, acting under instructions, made frequent examinations of articles of food submitted for sale, and in consequence of these inspections a quantity of articles were voluntarily destroyed by the persons exposing them for sale. Constant supervision was exercised over the manufacture and storeage of Ice Cream, with very satisfactory results. Dr. Hamer, Assistant Medical Officer of the London County Council, visited the district and inspected the different places where food is prepared, in company with one of my Inspectors, and was very satisfied with what he saw, and the supervision given to the matter by the Inspectors. Bakehouses have received frequent and careful inspection, and when found necessary, orders were served for cleansing and lime washing. In only one case was it necessary to take proceedings against the occupier of a bakehouse in the parish, and he was fined. The Cow-sheds have been regularly inspected, and all were found to be kept in a clean condition, and well ventilated. The Slaughter-houses were inspected, and found in good condition. Workshops, Factories, and Laundries have received constant supervision, with the object of preventing overcrowding, and enforcing cleanliness, limewashing, ventilation, and sanitary accommodation for the different sexes. Systematic inspection of houses has gone on regularly throughout the year, and Registered Houses let in lodgings have received more than usual attention, thereby avoiding overcrowding, and ensuring cleanliness and proper ventilation. The Sanitary Sub-Committee are to be congratulated on their devotion to the duties they have undertaken —to watch over the health of the inhabitants of the Parish, with a due regard to the interests of the Ratepayers, and I am greatly indebted to them for the support they always accord me. I desire to express my entire satisfaction of the zeal and energy with which the Sanitary Inspectors have discharged their duties during the year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY WILLIAM ROBERTS, Medical Officer of Health, Depttord. TABLE No.1. BIRTHS. DEATHS. AGES AT TIME OF DEATH. CAUSES. M. F. Total. M.

F REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR GREENWICH. To the Greenwich District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my sixteenth Annual Report, for the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1898. I have to report that 1,907 Births (948 Males and 959 Females) were registered in the Greenwich District, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 1. The number of Deaths was 1,621 (909 Males and 712 Females) equivalent to an annual rate of 25.9 per 1,000 persons living (including the Greenwich Union and Infirmary, the Seamen's, Miller and Cottage Hospitals, the Royal Naval College, and Greenwich Hospital Schools, and the outlying Public Institutions), and 13.8 excluding these Public Institutions, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 2. The number of Deaths from the principal Zymotic class was 205, equivalent to an annual rate of 3 .2 per 1,000 persons living, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 3. The Births were 1907, being 286 in excess of the number of Deaths, equivalent to an annual rate of 30.5 per 1,000 persons living, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. -1. Table No. 5 will show the comparative Death Rate per 1,000 (excluding Hospitals and Schools,) for the past 15 years. Table No. 6 will show the comparative Death Rate per 1,000 from Diseases of a Zymotic type for the last 15 years. Table No. 7 will show the Population and Births and Deaths, in Registration Districts, during the 52 weeks of 1898. Table No. 8 will show the number of cases of Infectious Disease reported to me under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the 52 weeks ending 1898. Table No. 9 will show the number of cases of Infectious Disease and Deaths notified to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by the several Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1898. Table No. 10 will show the number of Articles and Rooms disinfected from March 25th, 1898, to March 25th, 1899. Table No. 11 will show the number of articles destroyed during the same period. Table No. 12 will show the number of Houses inspected, with inquiries in connection with Infectious Diseases, from March 25th, 1898, to March 25th, 1899. Table No. 13 will show the work of inspection from March 25th, 1898, to March 25th, 1899. Table No. 14 will show the Improvements effected during the same period. INFLUENZA. I regret to state that Influenza has been present during the greater part of the present year (1898). It would be impossible for me to estimate the number of cases that have occurred (as this disease is not one of those which has to be notified under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891), but from personal knowledge, and from information given to me by the different Medical Practitioners in the town, it would appear to have been most prevalent during the first, second, and fourth quarters of the year. In all there were forty-two deaths from Influenza (as a first cause) registered during the year as compared with twenty-two in 1897, and in addition a considerable increase in the number of deaths from diseases of the Respiratory and Circulatory organs (viz.: Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Heart failure), which proves there is an influence at work which has the power of making those diseases more fatal than at ordinary times. Reference to Table No. 1 will show the number of deaths from Influenza, and also from diseases of the Respiratory and Circulatory organs. It may be interesting to the Members of the Board to be reminded that the first outbreak of Epidemic Influenza (since 1847) occurred in the latter part of December, 1889, and has occurred from time to time ever since, and it would now appear to have become general. The following account is copied from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary:- "The deaths referred to Influenza during 1898 numbered 1283 against 2117, 491, and 679 in the three preceding years. Although the deaths from Influenza in 1898 were nearly double those in 1897, they were below the average for the eight preceding years.'' The cause of Influenza is yet unknown to us, though the result of bacteriological investigation now being carried on may go far towards elucidating the question. The question as to the mode of spread of Influenza is one that has most important bearings on the cause of the disease. The most striking feature of this fever, and the feature in which it differs from other specific fevers, has ever been the fact that enormous numbers of people (spread over a vast extent of country) may be affected simultaneously. This has been noticed from the earliest records to the latest. Thus, in 1557, the whole population of Spain was attacked on the same day. In 1782, in St. Petersburg, 40,000 persons were seized in a single day. In 1847 it was said to have spread in one day over every part of London, and affected upwards of 500,000 persons. These facts seem to admit only of one explanation that (at least in the early period of an Epidemic) the cause of the disease is carried by the air, and that the primary mode of spread of the disease is through the atmosphere. It is believed by a large majority of medical men that the disease is of an infectious character, and the best means of suppressing it is by isolation. The following figures show the number of deaths that have been registered from influenza in the Greenwich District since 1890:— 1890 4 1894 11 1891 44 1895 51 1892 33 1896 13 1893 28 1897 22 1898 42 CHOLERA. I am happy to state that during the year 1898 there was not a case of Cholera reported as having occurred in this district. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. I stated in my Annual Report of 1888-9, that it was customary to regard the absence or prevalence of disease of a Zymotic type as a test of the Sanitary condition of a district, and I was justified in congratulating the Board upon the satisfactory state of the Parish of Greenwich, as the Death Rate amounted to only 1.6 per 1,000 from that class of disease. This year, the Death Rate amounts to 3.2 per 1,000 as against 2 .3 of last year. The increase being largely due to Infantile Diarrhoea during the months of July, August and September. There has been an increase in the number of Notifiable Diseases during the year in the Parish of Greenwich. Scarlet Fever. This year there has been a diminution in the number of Scarlet Fever cases. Last year there were 178 cases notified, and five deaths, and this year 155 cases and four deaths, one of which occurred in the outlying districts. The following may be of interest: — 1893 417 Notified Cases 12 Deaths 1894 270 11 „ „ „ 1895 256 6 „ „ „ 1896 394 21 „ „ „ 1897 178 5 „ „ „ 1898 155 4 „ „ „ Enteric or Typhoid Fever. Last year there were 35 cases of Enteric Fever reported, and eight deaths. This year the number is 85, the fatal cases being 21. In common with other parts of the Metropolis during the months of September and October, there was a large increase in the number of Enteric Fever Cases. In Company with your Inspector Wilson), I visited a great many of the houses, and found that the Sanitary condition in most cases was good. The majority of cases were those of children of school age Others were between 16 and 30. In the case of the children, many of them had partaken of ice creams, and it was thought possible that they were made in places where the sanitary arrangements were bad. Inquiry was made, and the houses of the vendors inspected, with the result that nothing was found that could connect the disease with the ice creams. In the case of the adults it was found that a great number were employed by the River Thames, and some acknowledged to having bathed there. Considering the stench that arose from the foreshore of the River Thames during the very hot weather in August and September, it is not surprising that under such conditions, Enteric Fever was prevalent. Erysipelas shows a slight increase, compared with that of last year. 1893—140 cases. 1894-96. 1895-65. 1896—61. 1897—56. 1898—70. Measles. This disease used to be looked upon as one of the most simple of the Zymotic class, but of late years the complications (principally of the Respiratory organs) arising therefrom have been so numerous as to suggest that it is more fatal than Scarlet Fever. In this district there were 31 deaths from Measles and its complications in 1898, against ten last year. 1893—27. 1894—38. 1895—25. 1896—57. 1897 — 10. 1898 -31. During the month of February, Measles were so prevalent at the Blackwall Board School that 1 recommended that the School be closed, and it was closed accordingly. In the opinion of many Medical Officers of Health, Measles should be reported under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the place of Erysipelas. I believe it to be simply a matter of expense. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. The Notifications received of Diphtheria cases have increased slightly this year. [See Table A, page 49.] The deaths from that disease are much smaller in proportion than formerly, the decrease being due, to the best of my belief, to its earlier recognition, and subsequent treatment by means of injection with anti-toxin. The following table will show the number of notifications of Diphtheria that have been received by me since 1890, and also the number of deaths that have occurred from that disease during each year since:— TABLE A. Deaths from Diphtheria. Notified cases of Diphtheria. 53 1890 1890 26 48 1891 21 1891 43 1892 1892 9 170 1893 1893 51 1894 189 1894 38 1895 215 41 1895 400 1896 1896 59 1897 1897 128 16 1898 154 1898 12 In both England and London the mortality from Diphtheria was less in the decade 1871-80 than in 1861-70, but in the decade 1881-90 it was greater than in the second, and in London had increased to a higher ratio even than in the first decade. Comparing London to England, in the first decade the ratio of mortality was about 5 per cent, lower than that of England, in the second decade about equal, and in the third about 6 per cent, higher. It is strange that whilst formerly it was more prevalent in the rural districts it now appears to affect the urban most. In the Greenwich District most of the cases were confined to young children of school age. Some years ago this disease used to be confined to the eastern part of the Parish, especially in the Marsh district, but this year it has visited every part. I believe that owing to the highly infectious character of this disease, it is largely spread in Schools. Sir Thome Thome (Medical Officer to the Local Government Board), in his Milroy Lectures on Diphtheria in 1891, showed that since 1871, whereas the annual Death Rates from all causes from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, and from Enteric Fever, have been steadily falling in England and Wales, in large towns and in London the annual Death Rates from Diphtheria have been rising slightly in England and Wales, more markedly in the large towns, and most markedly in London. Whilst the mortality of Diphtheria is still steadily rising, that of Enteric Fever is equally steadily falling pari passu with improved sanitation, and the mortality of Scarlet Fever is also lulling pari passu with increased Hospital isolation; so that whereas the improvement of sanitation markedly decreases the mortality of Enteric Fever, it appears to have no effect on Diphtheria. To what cause may this increase of Diphtheria be due ? Many have been suggested. 1. School influence. 2. Sewer ventilation and unsanitary conditions. 3. Alteration in classification (particularly with regard to Membranous Croup), now being classified with Diphtheria. 4. Connection with other throat affections. School Influence. In 1870 the Elementary Education Act was passed for the establishment of School Boards and Elementary Schools. Now, whereas during the decade 1861-70, the number of deaths from Diphtheria decreased annually, during that of 1871-80 they increased annually. Sir Thome Thorne lias so fully and so carefully entered into this subject of "School Influence," that his conclusion that increased school attendance has had a material influence in increasing the spread of Diphtheria is irresistible. Although I am of opinion that "School Influence" has been a potent cause in the spread of Diphtheria, I cannot charge "School Influence" with being the sole cause of the great increase that has occurred since the year 1893. I would rather surest that the great increase is primarily due to one of those peculiar waves that come over us in the form of an epidemic, the cause of which is unknown at the present time. I have no doubt but that in the course of time much useful knowledge on the means of spread will be discovered both by the chemist and the bacteriologist. Whilst such men as the late Sir William lenner and Dr. Wilkes on the one side believe that the disease is in the main independent of sanitary conditions or hygienic circumstances, and whilst Sir George Johnson is diametrically opposed to their particular views, it behoves us to look further afield for the cause. I am inclined to think that our main drainage is faulty. The main drainage system was laid in 1863, and the engineer (the late Sir Joseph Bazalgette) made a statement at the time of its completion that it would last for 25 years, and at the end of that time (with the rapidly increasing population) it would be necessary to inquire closely whether it could not be capable of improvement. ANTI-TOXIC SERUM TREATMENT FOR DIPHTHERIA. It is gratifying to know that the mortality from Diphtheria is much lower since the use of the "Anti-toxic Serum." The deaths from that disease have considerably diminished since its introduction and subsequent application. A very exhaustive report on the subject has been published by the Medical Superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, the summary of which I append:— "The improved results in the Diphtheria cases treated during the year 1896, which are indicated by the foregoing statistics and clinical observations, are— (i.) A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first and second day of illness. (ii.) The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. (iii.) The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. (iv.) The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate Hospital. (v.) The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. "We have had, in fact, somewhat better results to record for 1896 than we had for 1595 ; and in view of the extended experience gained during the past year, together with the additional facts concerning the post scarlatinal cases for 1896, we feel that we are fully justified in the favourable opinion we expressed last year on the value of anti-toxin in the treatment of Diphtheria. "We would repeal what we stated last year as to the paramount importance of commencing the treatment early—if possible, not later than the second day of the disease. From this time onward the chance of a successful issue will diminish in proportion to the length of time which has elapsed before the treatment is commenced. This though true of other methods, is of still greater moment in the case of treatment by anti-toxin. "We have already drawn attention to the trivial nature of the secondary effects that not infrequently arise as a direct result of the injection of anti-toxic serum, and we think that neither these effects nor the increased incidence of some of the usual complications are worthy of being considered practical deterrents when the beneficial results of the treatment are remembered. "We have only to add that we still hold to the opinion that in the anti-toxic serum we possess a remedy of distinctly—we would not say much- -greater value in the treatment of Diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted." The Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board state in their Annual Report, 1897, that the same improvement has occurred in the Diphtheria cases treated by anti-toxin. Whooping Cough. Reference to Table No. 3 will show that 45 children died from this disease in the district, being an increase of 26 over last year. Whooping Cough is a disease peculiar to young children, and it is difficult to suggest any particular Sanitary measures which, in the absence of isolation, would tend to lessen its spread. Diarrhoea. There were 85 deaths from this disease (including Infantile Diarrhoea) being an increase of three over last year, and higher than in any of the last ten years. The disease is particularly fatal amongst young children during the months of July, August, and September, and more especially during the period of Teething. It is accelerated by the administration of improper food. Had it not been for the large number of deaths from this disease the Zymotic Death Rate of Greenwich would have been 1.9 per 1,000. Small Pox. Not a single case of Small Pox was reported to me during 1898. In case of Small Pox occurring I notify every case to the Board of Guardians through their Vaccination Officer. The necessary Sanitary precautions are observed in every case by Inspection, Disinfection, Destruction of Bed, Bedding, &c., and the serving of Notices to abate Nuisances. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the following diseases are scheduled: — Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Small Pox, Cholera, Erysipelas; and Puerperal, Typhus, Enteric, and Relapsing Fevers. Under this Act it is compulsory for the Medical Attendant and the householder (in which the case occurs) to notify to the Medical Officer of Health of the District immediately upon the outbreak of any of the above diseases. Reference to Table No. 8 will show the number of cases reported during the year 1898. Phthisis or Consumption or Tuberculosis.—Since the report of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis was published very great interest has been taken in the subject, and quite recently an Association has been formed for the prevention of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis, the objects of which were staled at a meeting held at Marlborough House, at which H.R.H. the Prince of Wales presided, to be: — (i.) To educate the public as to the best means of preventing the spread of Consumption from those already suffering from it. (ii.) To extinguish Tuberculosis in cattle. (iii.) To promote the erection of Sanatoria for the open air treatment of Tuberculosis. During the past year 196 persons died from various forms of Tuberculosis in the Parish of Greenwich, and in 1897 the number of deaths were 161. The conditions most favourable to the spread of this disease are poverty, dirt, and intemperance, and the existence of diseases which lower the general health. Insanitary conditions, e.g., dampness, overcrowding, and insufficiently ventilated rooms and work-places, also favor its spread. As Consumption is an infectious disease, a great amount of good can be done by isolation and disinfection, especially of the expectoration, which abounds with poisonous microbes and if allowed to dry are carried in the atmosphere and taken into the air-passages. In case of death from Consumption I would strongly recommend that the Board should offer free of expense to fumigate the room or rooms, and to disinfect the bed, bedding, etc., in the same manner as in cases of Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria. GENERAL REMARKS. Overcrowding.—I regret to state that during the past year a great number of cases of overcrowding have come to my knowledge, principally from want of house accommodation. Since the opening of the Blackwall Tunnel there has been a large influx of the artisan and laboring classes into Greenwich without a corresponding increase in the number of houses, hence it is impossible to obtain proper house accommodation at a reasonable rental. There are some open spaces which have been cleared of insanitary houses lying idle and if built upon would be a boon to those requiring house accommodation. Overcrowding is one of the principal factors in Phthisis or Consumption, and it has been proved that the mortality or death rate from that disease is greater where the people have an insufficiency of air space. Sewer Ventilators. During the past year I have received complaints from all parts of the Parish respecting the smell that arises from the Sewer Ventilators. I have forwarded these complaints to the Medical Officer of the London County Council. In order to abate the nuisance there should be more ventilators erected, and they should be carried up to a considerable height, instead of being at ground level. In one case this has been done, viz., in the Trafalgar Road, near Christ Church, with considerable benefit to that locality. The following houses have been either closed or demolished during the year, owing to their being unfit for human habitation: — Heath Bank, Hyde Vale Closed with the owner's consent. Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, Park Cottages, King George Street. Houses previously closed and afterwards demolished by owner after service of notices. Oak House, East Street. Under Section 60, Sub-section 4, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 : "The Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accominodation, with any necessary attendants, for the members G of any family, in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority." The above house was purchased by the Board for the use of the Greenwich District (which includes the Parish of Deptford), and a caretaker was engaged to take charge. The house has been repaired, cleansed, limewashed, and purified during the year. It is only partly furnished. There have been no admissions coming from infected houses during 1898 either from Greenwich or Deptford. The number of deaths of infants under one year during 1898 was 37 2. Last year, 1897, there were 293. Ninety-five deaths of persons aged 80 and upwards were registered during the year, being the same number as last year. During the year I visited the Slaughter-houses and Cowsheds, and found them in a satisfactory condition. The Bakehouses were also inspected, and those that were in an unsatisfactory condition reported to the Board. I have much pleasure in stating that your Sanitary Inspectors (Messrs. Wilson and Fisher) have been of great assistance to me. They have discharged their onerous duties with zeal, intelligence and success. The appointment of a Sanitary Inspector to carry out the duties in connection with the notification of Infectious Disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, has been of much service, and I have pleasure in stating that Mr. Bache has conducted the work to my entire satisfaction. In conclusion, I desire to thank the Members of the Board for their uniform courtesy, and their willingness at all times to assist me by adopting any suggestions that I have made tending to improve the sanitary condition of the district. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, CHARLES HENRY HARTT, Medical Officer of Health. H TABLE No. 1. 1898. BIRTHS. DEATHS. CAUSES. AGES AT TIME OF DEATH. M. Total F. M. F.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my fourth Annual Report of works and matters connected with my department for the year ending 25th March, 1899. SEWERS. During the year the following applications with plans and sections of proposed sewers have been submitted to and approved by the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council, viz. :— Greenwich. St. Paul, Deptford. Lombard Road Cottesbrook Street During the year the following brick and pipe sewers were constructed :— 270 feet of 12" pipes and 160 feet of 9" pipes, in Milton Road. 420 feet of 9" pipes in Ashburnham Road 61 feet of 4' 0" x 2' 8" and 36 feet of 3' x 2' brick sewer in Woodpecker Road, to form the outlet for Whitcher Street, &c. 325 feet of 12" pipes in Cottesbrook Street. This sewer passes through a bed of peat and is supported on piers of concrete carried up from the gravel. 88 feet of 15" pipes and 864 feet of 12" pipes in Hatcham Park Road. This sewer was reconstructed by contract for the Board, including the construction of six manholes, one gully, and numerous house connections, at a cost of £450 Is. 10d. Negociations with the London County Council are now in progress for their consent to the construction of brick and pipe sewers on the land of the Haberdasher and Hogarth Estates, situate between the Brighton Railway and Nunhead. The following works have been carried out by your flushing staff on private property, owing to recent decisions of the Courts in matters of sewers versus drains. Removing stoppages and reinstating drains at Greenwich. Azof Street King George Street Royal Hill East Street Ferry Place Charlton Road Greenwich Road Billingsgate Street Wood Wharf Sun-in-the-Sands Lane Brand Street Bellot Street Selcroft Road Frobisher Street Horseferry Road Aldeburgh Street St. Paul, Deptford. Besson Street North Road Malpas Road New Cross Road Tyrwhitt Road Oareboro' Road Kenwood Avenue Kender Place Bestwood Street Besson Mews Hales Street Boscawen Street Pomeroy Street Brockley Road Bingley Place Tanners Hill Wickham Road Hatcham Park Road Achilles Street FLUSHING SEWERS. This district contains about 90 miles, 2,407 feet of brick and pipe sewers. The brick sewers are cleansed by manual labour, the pipe sewers being cleansed by periodical flushing with water, through inlets provided on the banks of the River Thames and Grand Surrey Canal. Where the above means cannot be adopted, water vans are used, and dam boards provided, to obtain a sufficient head of water to remove the deposit on the sewer inverts. Where the deposit is of a heavy and glutinous character, dredging has to be resorted to; many of the pipe sewers have been dredged during the past year. The road gullies, about 3,870 in number, have been periodically emptied and flushed out with diluted carbolic disinfecting liquid, and during the dry summer weather these gullies were flushed by men constantly employed on that work. SEWER VENTILATION. The question of sewer ventilation has, during the past year, been under careful consideration and investigation, with a view of dealing, in a practical and satisfactory manner, with the gases emitted from the sewage matter in our large sewers, and which emissions have for some years past caused much annoyance and inconvenience, apart from the injurious effect upon the public health. As a result of past investigations, lam glad to say that an apparatus has now been devised which I have every hope will deal with this matter in an efficient manner; the same will shortly be in full work in your Blackwall Lane sewer, and I hope next year to be in a position to report fully on its merits and efficiency for dealing with this very important question. Local sewers have been ventilated by means of ventilating pipes fixed against adjoining property at — Greenwich St. Paul, Deptford. Lower East Street Besson Street Maidenstone Terrace Pomeroy Street St. Donatt's Road Windmill Lane Hatcham Park Road DRAINAGE. Notices and plans have been received for the building and drainage of various premises in the district, and have been submitted to, and approved of by the Board. Every drain is now tested with smoke or water, in the presence of the Inspector. This work involves a large amount of labour, and absorbs a great deal of the time of your Staff; especially so has this been the case during the past year, for, in addition to an increase in the ordinary building operations, two vast estates, —one at Deptford Park, and one at Ivy Farm Estate, Greenwich, —have been rapidly developed. Every endeavour is made to meet the convenience of builders, and to facilitate the execution of the work. During the year, 92 new connections have been made with the Board's sewers and those of the London County Council, for the drainage of premises, entailing a cost to the applicants of £496 4s. 9d. Forty-one new gullies have been constructed in various parts of the district during the past twelve months, and their trapped outlets connected with the adjacent sewers. REPAIRS ON THE RIVER WALL. The river bank, extending from the western end of Holhck's Cement Works to the eastern end of the Telegraph Works, was Stripped, the ragstone facing relaid, and grouted in with fine concrete, being an area of about 2,411 super yards. New footings were also provided along this length, 165 cubic yards of concrete being used for this purpose. The amount expended on this work, for labour and material, was £380 12s. 7d. GENERALLY. In addition to the clerical work of this Department, surveys ami plans for contracts and improvements, and plans for apportion- merit of the expenses of forming and paving works, have been prepared for the following roads and streets : — Greenwich. St. Paul, Deptford. Dinsdale Road Scawen Road Fergus Street Alloa Road Glenforth Street Crooke Road (No. 2) Dentford Street Trundleys Road (No. 3) Gibson Street (No. 2) Arbuthnot Road (No. 3) Hicks Street Kezia Street Copies of these plans were also supplied to your Clerk's and Road Surveyor's Departments, for Contract and other purposes. Numerous plans and surveys for street improvements, new roads and sewers, have also been prepared. In addition to the foregoing, I append tabulated statements of various matters dealt with by the Department during the past year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant ERNEST J.
