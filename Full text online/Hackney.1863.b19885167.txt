In addition to the places just enumerated, 83 cowhouses, 69 slaughter-houses, and 90 bakehouses have been inspected by myself and Mr. Valentine during the year. As the bakehouse inspections were performed at a different part of the year to those of the slaughter and cow-houses, and as they are scattered all over the district, considerable time and labour were bestowed on them. The bakehouses were generally in good condition as regards ventilation and drainage: in no instance did any person sleep in the bakehouse, or was employed therein in contravention to the Act of Parliament. Where bed-rooms are provided for the men they are generally comfortable and well ventilated, but it was necessary to serve notices to repair and ventilate the bed-rooms in a few instances. The majority of the bakehouses also required cleansing and whitewashing, and notices were served on the owners to do the necessary works. At one bakehouse there was a large cesspool immediately under the bakehouse floor, which smelt offensively, and at a few others the drainage was sufficiently imperfect to require cleansing, trapping, or re-construction of the drains. The inspections of the cow-houses, slaughter-houses, and bakehouses have all been performed in conformity 9 with Acts of Parliament passed since the Metropolis Local Management Act came into operation, and will assist in maintaining the public health in a good state when the district shall become a comparatively crowded one. The year 1863 comprises in the Registrar General's Reports a period of 53 instead of 52 weeks as usual; but I have in my mortality tables included only 52 weeks, so as to compare the deaths of this year with those of other years. The corrected death-rate for the whole of London was above the average of the last 24 years, having been so high as 2.481 per cent. against the mean of 2.452 per cent. This excessive mortality has been caused chiefly through the unusual prevalence and fatality of fever and scarlet fever, 2892 deaths having been recorded from the former, and 5075 deaths from the latter disease; and in addition, 724 deaths from diphtheriaâ€”a large proportion of which were, doubtless, caused by scarlet fever. As I pointed out in a former report, and in essays published separately, scarlet fever is a disease which appears to depend less as to its spread on the sanitary state of the neighbourhood than other eruptive diseases. Thus, it is well known that its intensity depends chiefly on the constitution or diathesis of the person attacked: as one member of a family will have it in its severest form, and another very lightly. There cannot, however, be any doubt, that a depressed state of health induced by want of fresh air, the 10 ing of air tainted with gases resulting from decompositon, and especially from overcrowding and dirt, is a very frequent cause of a severe instead of a mild attack. The first quarter of 1863 was remarkably mild and very unhealthy; but although the mortality was unusually high, the amount of sickness was not so great as usual, in consequence of the prevalent diseases being very severe, and death resulting after an unusually short illness. The month of March was an extremely fatal one, through a great and sudden fall of temperature. In the second quarter of the year (April, May, and June), the death-rate was 2.313 per cent. of the population for the whole of London, which was greater than that of any quarter since 1853. In the third quarter it was again excessive, having been 2.325 per cent. of the population; whilst in the last quarter it was 2.236 per cent., or 0.058 per cent. above the average for the quarter. The births throughout the Metropolis have been decidedly on the increase, and especially in the Hackney District: 3,075 births having been registered in 1863 against 2,768 in 1862. I shall now proceed to a consideration of the Sanitary state of the Hackney District during this year. The first table to which I shall direct your attention is one showing the number of births in each quarter, and in each Sub-District. We learn by it, that of the 3075 11 births registered in 52 weeks, 189 took place in Stoke Newington Sub-District, 165 in Stamford-hill, 802 in West Hackney, 1193 in Hackney, and 726 in South Hackney. That the largest number was registered in the second quarter in Stoke Newington, in the first and second in Stamford-hill, in the first in West Hackney, in the first in Hackney and South Hackney. Also, that 842 births were registered in the whole district in the first quarter against 788 in the second, 722 in the third, and 723 in the fourth. The table also shows that in proportion to the population in 1861 the birth rate was largest in South Hackney, and smallest in Stoke Newington. Table 1. 1863.â€”Births in each Sub-District. Quarters.

The rate of births 12 in Stoke Newington has varied but little, the highest number having been 69 in each 1000 for the whole district, and the lowest 58. In Stamford-hill the rate has varied between 46 per 1000 and 62 per 1000, the rate in this district having decreased considerably since 1857. In West Hackney the rate varied between 261 per 1000 and 329, having also decreased very considerably since 1857-58. In Hackney the rate has been comparatively stationary, the highest proportion having been 397, and the lowest 367, whilst in South Hackney the highest has been 236, and the lowest 170. This variation in the birth-rate arises chiefly from variations in the number of inhabitants residing within the district, and the varying rates they bear to one another in different years. The rate in Hackney and South Hackney will increase; and in the others retrograde, in consequence of the greatly increased number of houses which have been lately built, or are being erected in these sub-districts.

By the corrected numbers, I mean the deaths which take place in each sub-district, with a proper correction for deaths in the East London Union, German Hospital, and Union Workhouse. The total deaths registered in the Hackney sub-district were 867. Of these, 149 deaths occurred in the East London Union and German Hospital, which, in accordance with the usual custom, have been excluded from the totals. The deaths in the Hackney Workhouse amounting to 81 are also in the corrected numbers distributed amongst the sub-districts in proportion to their population.

After excluding the deaths in the East London Union and the German Hospital, and distributing, proportionately, those in the Workhouse, we find the corrected numbers to be 134 for Stoke Newington; 107 for Stamford-hill; 474 for West Hackney; 668 for Hackney; and 400 for South Hackney;â€”making a total of 1783. Of the total number of deaths, 1932, 546 were registered in the first quarter, 485 in the second, 474 in the third, and 427 in the fourth. These departures from the mean for the year were far greater than occurred in London generally, arising chiefly from the small mortality in Hackney during the last quarter of the year, when the mortality is ordinarily nearly as great as in the first quarter. The correspondence between the population in 1861 and the deaths for 1863 is moderately close in Stoke Newington, Stamford-hill, and Hackney sub-districts, but varies considerably in West Hackney and South Hackney, the death-rate having been smaller than the proportion of population in West Hackney, and larger than the proportion in South Hackney. The birth-rate, however, as already stated, as well as the next table, show that the population of South Hackney has increased since 1861 at a greater rate than in the other sub-districts. The next table (No. 4.) shows the ratio which the 15 number of deaths registered in each sub-district (corrected for deaths as before mentioned), bears to the total corrected deaths for the whole district. That is to say, that during the year 7'5 per cent. of all the deaths registered in the district belonged to Stoke Newington; 6.0 per cent. to Stamford-hill; 26.6 per cent. to West Hackney; 37.5 per cent. to Hackney; and 22.4 per cent. to South Hackney. It will be seen that whilst the proportionate death-rate has decreased since 1857 in Stoke Newington, Stamford-hill, and West Hackney, it has increased in Hackney and South Hackney.

In the year 1863, no less than 457 deaths were caused by epidemic or zymotic diseases. This class as will be seen in reference to the last table, includes small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, croup, diarrhoea, influenza, all kinds of fever, syphilis, and rheumatic fever. The number of deaths in this 16 class was considerably in excess, chiefly from the immense increase in the number of deaths from smallpox, scarlet fever, and diphtheria. Class 2, or diseases of uncertain seat were below the average, 85 only having been registered. In class 3, which includes consumption and strumous diseases generally, viz: water in the head and mesenteric disease. 299 deaths were registered, which was a smaller number than usual, having been only 15.5. In the next class, which embraces inflammation of the brain and spinal cord and their coverings, apoplexy, paralysis, St. Vitus's dance, epilepsy, insanity, and nervous diseases generally. An excess of mortality is again decidedly marked, 255 deaths, or 13.2 per cent. of the whole having been registered. This is, with two exceptions, the largest rate of death from these diseases in any year since my appointment, and would of course have been larger still if the mortality from epidemic diseases had been of its usual amount. Diseases of the heart and vessels show a diminution, as 4.3 per cent. only was registered. Affections of the lungs caused death in 283 persons, or at the rate of l4.6 per cent. of the whole: this was a low rate. The deaths from the diseases included in classes 1, 3, 4, and 6, were no less than 1294 or 67.0 of the deaths from all causes. This was in excess of 18G2, when they were 64.5 per cent.; and of 1861, when they were 65.6 per cent. Diseases of the digestive organs were fatal to 112 persons; old age, to 119 persons, or 6.2 per cent; and 70 deaths from accidents and 17 violence, or 3.7 per cent. The proportion of sudden deaths, or deaths from violence and accidents varies but little; thus, in 1857 it was 4.4 per cent.; in 1858, 4.5 per cent.; in 1859, 4.0 per cent.; in 1860, 5.3 per cent.; in 1861, only 3.2 per cent.; in 1862, 3.4 per cent.; and ' in 1863, 4.6 per cent. of the total deaths.

It will be seen that Hackney has participated in the small.pox epidemic of 1863, in common with the rest of the metropolis, but not to so great an extent; for 18 whilst the mortality in. Hackney was 41, in the whole of London it was 2012, or at the rate of 48 deaths in 100,000 inhabitants for Hackney, and of 79 deaths in each 100,000 inhabitants for all London. The deaths from measles were about an average, viz: 37; from scarlet fever and diphtheria enormously large, 125 deaths having been registered from scarlet fever, and 34 from diphtheria. The mortality from whoopingcough, diarrhoea, and fever, was less than usual. I would especially point out the small number of deaths, 49, from fever, which, after making allowance for increase of population, is, with the exception of the cold rainy year 1860, the smallest number which has been registered since the introduction of the Metropolis Local Management Act.

Thus, in 1857 277 per 1000 of the total mortality for the year was registered in the first quarter; 277 per 1000 in the first quarter of 1858; 244 in that of 1859; 318 in that of 1860; 292 in that of 1861; 271 in that of 1862; and 283 in that of 1863; proving, that with one exception the first or winter quarter was the most unhealthy during the years 18571863. I have, in former occasions, pointed out the great increase in the number of deaths when cold weather set in, an increase greater than obtains for the whole of London, and the necessity, therefore, of protecting especially the young, weakly and old from extreme atmospheric changes.

The per.centage of deaths of children under 1 year old was greater than that of any year since 1858 ; but the large proportion of deaths at this age from diarrhoea, mesenteric disease, water on the brain, and convulsions partially account for this. There was also an excess of deaths between the ages of 1 and 20 arising from no less than 111 deaths from scarlet fever at these ages. On the other hand the rate of death was unusually small for the ages 20.40 years, 40.60 years, and 60.80 years. The proportion of deaths of those who were above 80 years old was the same as for last year, but was less than that of former years. Table VIII.

The northern, which include Marylebone, Hampstead, Paneras, Islington, and Hackney, have suffered far more from disease and death than most of the other metropolitan districts; for instead of having the smallest mortality, they have had a larger death-rate than the west and south districts. Hackney, however, has not had so large a mortality as the other northern districts, or so large as for the whole of London; for if we allow the population on the 1st of July to have been 90,740, and the corrected number of deaths 1783, we shall have a death-rate of 10 in each 509 inhabitants, or 19Â½ in each 1000 living. As I have excluded the deaths in the German Hospital, I must add the proportion of death to the population for London generally, which was about 16 per 10,000, making the total only 212 in each 10,000 living, or 26 in 10,000 below the average for the whole of the northern districts. The last table shows the ages at death and the causes of death in fuller detail than table 5. The large proportion of deaths from small-pox amongst young persons, and the very large proportion of deaths from fever, of persons under 20 years of age, are very remarkable. Also the great number of deaths from cancer is worthy of notice, as this disease appears to be considerably on the increase in Hackney: 22 The number of nuisances removed by Mr. Valentine during the year is larger than for any year since 1858. The numerous house to house visitations which I have made in company with him, the inspection of the slaughter-houses, cow-houses, and bakehouses to a great extent account for the excess; but it also arises partially from choking of the drains through the careless habits of the poor, and the mischievousness of their children. The total number was 1696 against 1435 in 1862, 1417 in 1861, 1267 in 1860, 1224 in 1859, 2512 in 1858, 1789 in 1857, and 1567 in 1856. The amount of work necessary to remove so large a number of nuisances has been in excess of that required for any other year, the nuisances have been more scattered than formerly, and more urgent. Privies emptied, filled up, and drained into the Sewer 330 Privies and Cesspools emptied 17 Stable, Pig, Cow-dung, and other refuse removed 200 Premises repaired and lime-washed 367 Gulleys trapped, Roads cleansed, &c 33 Pigs removed, and Pigsties repaired and cleansed 95 Choked Drains cleansed, repaired, and re-constructed 359 Ditches, Urinals, and other offensive places cleansed 60 Other nuisances 235 Total 1696 To obtain the removal of this large number of nuisances, only 8 owners of property were summonsed before the magistrates, but 77 have been required to attend before the Board previously to a summons being issued. This plan of giving persons an opportunity of 23 appealing to the Board against the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health and the Inspector, previously to a summons being applied for at the Police Court, is not adopted, so far as I am aware, by any other Board, and is most valuable. It has been adopted to supersede the functions usually exercised by a Sanitary Committee, and acts as a safeguard against any excess of zeal or error of judgment by the Officers of the Board. It also in many instances, saves the expense and loss of time which would otherwise result from appearing at the Police Courts, to obtain a Magistrate's order for the removal of the nuisances. 24 Table 9.
