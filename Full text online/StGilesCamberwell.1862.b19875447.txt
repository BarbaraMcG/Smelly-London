CAM 66 1862-3. ST. GILES, CAMBER WELL, SURREY. Seventh Annual Report OF THE VESTRY OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120. london: HUNTED BY ORDER OF THE VE8TRY, BY E BILLING & SON, BERMONDSBY STREET. 1863. SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camber well. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them, And an Account of their Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending the 25th March, 1863. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camber well. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the Annual statement of Works executed under your direction during the past financial year, ending 25th March last. GENERAL PURPOSES. HIGHWAYS. In this department I have nothing special to report upon, the usual repairs to the Roads and Footpaths under the control of the Vestry have received the ordinary attention, and which (with the manifest improvement now being produced by the Kirbing works in progress) are, I may venture to say, in a satisfactory condition. 4 In the last Report I referred to the increased traffic and consequent additional wear and tear on our Parochial Roads, caused by the Sewers and Railway works now in execution in this Parish, this has continued during the past year, but to a more limited extent; nevertheless, these causes, added to the traffic so visibly increasing on our suburban Roads, necessitates a larger amount of material and labour beyond that which would fairly be due to the local traffic only. THE NEW KIRBING, Which I have just referred to, has been fairly distributed throughout the several Wards of the Parish, and as stated (in anticipation) in my last year's Report, upwards of eight miles of Kirbing has been laid down, and the last vote of the Vestry on this item of expenditure, will still further increase this quantity by about four miles in length. NEW ROADS. One additional Road, viz., Sydenham Rise, leading from Lapse Lane to Sydenham Hill, has been dedicated to the public, being in length about 350 yards. The above Road was adopted by the Vestry as a Road of public utility, at the desire of the Governors of Dulwich College. 5 "NEW STREETS." (25 & 26 Vic , cap. 102, clause 77.) In last year's Report I referred to the required Legislalative powers to enable the Vestry to take action in regard to improvements to be made in "Private (and neglected) Roads," the present Report (to 25th March last,) is not of a sufficiently advanced date to admit of an account of such works having been actually executed, but I may venture so far to anticipate the current year's doings, by stating that at the time of inditing these particulars, No. 17 of this class of Roads and Streets have been surveyed, and notices for payment served on the owners of the respective properties ; and also that No. 7 of these Roads have been already thoroughly made up and completed, much to the satisfaction of the inhabitants and the improvement of their respective localities; and I beg to express a hope that before the publication of the current year's Report the entire of the above Seventeen Streets and Roads (with others in a like condition) will have been transformed from their present neglected condition, to that becoming the neighbourhood and Parish in which they are situated. ROAD IMPROVEMENTS Have been made at Dulwich Common, leading towards the Railway Bridge, by the widening of that part of the Road from the diverted portion made by the Railway Company to the Common. 6 Also in Lordship Lane, from Bews' or Glennies' Corner, opposite the New Tavern, for some distance up Lordship Lane towards Dulwich Court Lane; this Road has been considerably widened by land given up by the Governors of the College, abutting on the site of the proposed building frontage thereon. This improvement it is intended to continue up Lordship Lane as far as Dulwich Court Lane. STREET NOMENCLATURE, &c. The re-numbering of various Streets and Roads in the Parish (a duty now imposed by the Legislature on the Metropolitan Parishes, under order of the Metropolitan Board of Works) and the affixing Street Tablets, &c.; all these have been, and are from time to time, receiving the attention of the Vestry, as well as the numerous matters of street and building operations submitted by the Board of Works for the opinion of this Vestry. DRINKING FOUNTAINS. Two new Fountains have been erected by the Vestry, one at Peckham Rye Common and the other in Peckham High Street, opposite the South end of Hill Street; a portion of the expense of which was contributed by the inhabitants. NEW BRIDGE AT GLEN GALL GROVE, CROSSING THE GRAND SURREY CANAL. Negotiations are pending in reference to this Bridge with a view to its adoption (with its adjacent Roads, leading from 7 Glengall Grove, across the Canal, to Bird-and-Bush Road and Hill Street,) as a public thoroughfare. Plans, surveys and estimates have been prepared to this effect, and the subject now awaits the consent of the proprietors for their required contribution, and also the additional contribution from, and consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works. RAILWAYS. In addition to those Railways now completed and in course of execution through this Parish, an additional Line has received the sanction of the Legislature, viz.—that from the London, Chatham and Dover Line, to commence at or near Grosvenor Square, Camber well High Road, crossing the Grand Surrey Canal, New Church Road, Peckham Grove, Commercial Road, and Peckham High Street near Rye Lane, and joining the Crystal Palace Line at Cow Lane. The Line sanctioned last year, viz. from Denmark Hill, crossing Grove Lane and Camber well Grove, to the Crystal Palace Line, and also continuing Northward towards London Bridge is being vigorously executed. The Crystal Palace Line of Railway is also commenced. LIGHTING. The Public Lamps of the Parish are as follows:- No. Supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company 1228 Ditto Phoenix do. 68 Ditto Chrystal Palace do. 54 Total 1350 Additional Lamps erected this year 92 Removals 69 8 SEWERS. The Works of Sewerage executed by the Vestry are as follows:— BRICK SEWERS. PIPE SEWERS. 670.0 - 3.9 x 2.6 4503 feet. 3648.0 - 3.0 x 2.0 20.0 - 2.6 barrel. 160.0 - 2.0 do. 30.0 - 18" do. 4528.0 or 1¾ Miles nearly. Which includes 1242 feet of open Sewer arched over. No. 60 New Gullies have been constructed and trapped. 36 Old ditto trapped and repaired. HOUSE DRAINAGE. No. of Houses permanently Drained. No. of Houses temporarily Drained. 546 251 Total 797 Houses. 9 MAIN DRAINAGE WORKS. SOUTHERN HIGH LEVEL SEWERS. These Works are at length completed, but (except to a limited extent) are not at present available for Sewerage or House Drainage, by reason of the outfall works being as yet incomplete; but a great advantage has already accrued through the extension of these works, viz., that the Storm waters rising at Dulwich and Peckham Rye have been diverted from their accustomed courses and now flow into these new Sewers, therefore these Streams no longer flood the low ground of this Parish as heretofore. I have reason to believe that although the Low Level system of Sewers is still a work to be done, yet by means of these High Level Sewers just completed, some of the advantages expected from the Low Level Sewers may in a great degree be fairly said to have been anticipated by this diversion of the High Level or flood waters from their ancient channels. The Main Low Level Sewer just adverted to, is however now in progress; its course through this Parish is from the low ground at White Post Lane, passing under Canterbury Place to and along the Old Kent Road, under the Grand Surrey Canal Bridge, until it arrives opposite the Albany Road, it then follows along the Albany Road to the Camberwell Road which it crosses, and then enters Newington Parish. In carrying out the contract for this Sewer a deviation has occurred from the original intention which is of great ad vantage to this Parish; as at first designed its course from the Canal Bridge in the Old Kent Road, ran nearly parallel to the bank of the Canal, and in a westerly direction to and along Neate Street, by its present route it will not only efficiently sewer the whole of that Road as far as the Albany Road, but will also by this alteration provide deep Sewerage for the entire length of the Albany Road. I consider, in several points of view, this alteration will be highly beneficial to the Local Sewerage of this part of the Parish, and I therefore ventured, when consulted thereon, to give my unqualified approbation to the deviation referred to. New Roads which you are now diligently at work at, that you have already accomplished much, which a reference to your printed Annual Statement will confirm, and that having but just been enabled to put these newly acquired powers into action, and the active steps you have already taken to put them in force, it may safely be affirmed that each succeeding year will produce marked improvements, and that the next Septennial Report will include the completion of many most important matters which, for the reasons stated, have been up to this time but subjects of anticipation, and that it will then chronicle the accomplishment of many improvements of which our locality is susceptible, which with the continued possession of your esteem and confidence, permit me to hope may be the pleasing duty of Your obedient Servant, J. C. REYNOLDS, SURVEYOR. 1862-3. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. ANNUAL REPORT BY J. S. Bkistowe, M.D., Land., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital Gentlemen, The year 1862 was on the whole an average year. Its chief feature, in a sanitary sense, was the prevalence during it of typhus fever, an infectious disease which had scarcely been met with in the Metropolis during the previous five or six years. Deaths from typhus swelled considerably the Metropolitan Mortuary Tables, and added something to the size of those of Camberwell. The mortality of London and that of Camberwell were both of them larger then they had been since the cholera year 1854. This result was due in part to the cause just assigned, in part however to other circumstances, which it will be my object in the present report to explain and estimate. During the last year, 1553 deaths were registered in the parish. Of this number 715 were of males, 838 of females; 205 occurred in Dulwich, 389 in St. George's, 551 in Camberwell, 16 and 587 in Peckham. In the sub-district of Camberwell however are situated the Workhouse, and two Lunatic Asylums, in the former of which 89 deaths took place, in the latter 93; and hence the mortality of this district is disproportionately and unduly raised. As regards the ages of the defunct: 601 deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age; 79 between the ages of 5 and 10, 40 from 10 to 15; 32 from 15 to 20; 75 from 20 to 30; 122 from 30 to 40; 124 from 40 to 50; 104 from 50 to 60; 150 from 60 to 70; and 126 from 70 upwards, of whom 81 had exceeded 80 years. The causes of death were as follows:— 109 deaths were due to "violence, privation, poison or premature birth;” 64 to "fever;” 101 to "scarlet fever;” 40 to "diphtheria 32 to "measles;” 53 to "hooping cough;” 21 to "croup;” 14 to "erysipelas, pyaemia or puerperal fever;” 4 to "dysentery, and acute diarrhoea (not of infants);” 152 to " diarrhœa, bronchitis, and pneumonia of infants under 3 years of age;” 108 to "hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy;” 207 to "phthisis and other tubercular diseases;” and 648 to "other diseases chiefly of a chronic nature." In the first quarter of the year 467 deaths were recorded; in the second quarter 372 ; in the third quarter 297; and in the last quarter 417. 2488 children were born in the course of the year; of these 1242 were girls, 1246 boys; 40 were born in Dulwich; 681 in Camberwell; 765 in St. George's; and 1002 in Peckham. The births in the first quarter of the year were 670; in the second 611; in the third 597; and in the fourth 610. Such are the bare facts which are exhibited in the tables appended to this report; a few of these facts we will now proceed to discuss 17 The number of deaths for the year is certainly large; it is larger than that for any year since 1854, and larger by 134 than that returned for the year 1861. At first Bight such an augmentation of the number of deaths has a very unpleasant appearance. But, associated with the increase of the number of deaths has been an increase by 97 in the number of births. An increase in the number of births of itself necessitates an increase in the number of deaths; but this increase in the number of births confirms a fact which many other circumstances indicate, viz.:—that the increase in the population of Camberwell, which the census shews has been taking place during the last few years, is still in active progress. Hence it may be safely inferred that a part, and probably no inconsiderable part, of our excess of mortality, has been the natural result of growth of population and augmented birth-rate. We must not shut our eyes to the fact however that certain diseases have been more than usually prevalent, and have been attended with considerable mortality. Under the head "fever," I find 64 deaths are placed; this number is 39 above that assigned to the same disease in the previous year's report; and 33 above the highest number registered during any one of the preceding six years. No doubt many of these fever-deaths were deaths from that form of fever, typhus, which was prevalent in London, and to occasional outbreaks of which we have ever been liable. The second disease, or rather group of diseases to which I refer, is scarlet fever and diphtheria. These (for it is impossible to isolate them for comparison with former years) together were the assigned cause of 141 deaths. This number is less by two than that at which the mortality from these diseases stood for the year 1858 ; but it is an increase of no less than 103 on that for the year 1861. These diseases, typhus, scarlet fever, and iu a less degree diphtheria, had unquestionably an important influence in raising the year's mortality. And I have no doubt 18 that it is in the combination of circumstances above specified— increase of population and of births, and prevalence of the diseases which have been enumerated—that the explanation of the augmented death-rate of the year lies. Other zymotic diseases have not largely prevailed ; and from small pox not a single death was recorded. Although the number of deaths has been unusually large, the mortuary tables of Camberwell compare favourably with those of London, and of the five groups of districts into which the Registrar General divides the Metropolis. Thus he calculates that the rate of mortality for the whole of London was 2.349. per cent; for the northern districts 2.196; for the western 2.221; for the southern 2.261; for the central 2.578; and for the eastern 2.592. Now the per-centage of deaths which I deduce for Camberwell, without even allowing for increase of population (which would have diminished the per-centage), amounts to 2.17 only, a number indicating a lower degree of mortality than any given in the above quotation. We are fairly justified therefore in continuing to claim for ourselves a pre-eminence of healthiness among the Metropolitan Parishes. The death-rate of the several sub-districts of Camberwell varied as usual. But as I have before explained, we become exposed to so many falacies when we endeavour to compare from the statistics of death alone, comparatively small populations, that the deathrate of these sub-districts must be regarded as a very suspicious test of their relative salubrity. There is however so marked a difference in this respect between Dulwich and Peckham, and this difference has been so invariable, that as between these two sub-districts the death-rate may be regarded as not an unfaithful index. In Dulwich the deaths were 1.45 percent, in Peckham 2.086 ; or in other words, 14 persons died out of every thousand in Dulwich, while in Peckham 21 persons out of every 19 thousand died. The death-rate of the Camberwell sub-district was 1.73, of St. George's 1.86. In this comparison of the subdistricts I have excluded from consideration the deaths in the Workhouse and in the Lunatic Asylums, which if shared according to population among the sub-districts, would of course raise the death-rate of each of them to a small extent. I need scarcely say however, that the deaths in these institutions have not been omitted from the calculation on which my comparison between Camberwell and the rest of London was based. Work done.—During the twelve months which expired on the 3lst March, 1863, 1374 houses were inspected; and as a result of these inspections 241 houses were cleansed and whitewashed and 73 were repaired; 61 yards were paved or otherwise amended; 36 dust bins were provided; in 78 instances water was laid on to premises for drinking purposes, and in 62 was supplied to closets; 303 cesspools were emptied and 114 filled up and abolished; 95 closets were provided, and 436 drains were trapped or otherwise amended. Besides these, 1280 nuisances arising from accumulations of ashes, dung or other refuse, pigs, obnoxious trades, &c., were investigated, and in the majority of instances remedied or removed, Further, 52 slaughter houses have been inspected, have been approved of and allowed to have their licenses unopposed. All had been cleansed and whitewashed, and when necessary, otherwise repaired. Last year for the first time, cow-houses were placed on the same footing as slaughter-houses. 62 of these had to be inspected and reported upon. Many of them were found very defective, thus proving the necessity of the supervision under which they were placed. These defects however were to a very considerable extent remedied, and it was only thought desirable to oppose the obtaining of a license in two cases. The greater number of the above works were executed without the need of any formal notice. In 309 cases notices were 20 served, and in 37 of them they required to be repeated. 22 summonses had to be taken out. On the 3lst March, 16 notices were still outstanding. I have reported monthly on the quality of the Gas supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, and have invariably found it to be of good quality ; in illuminating power above the standard, and free (according to the legal tests) from either ammonia or sulphuretted hydrogen. I have continued to report also monthly on the condition of the waters furnished by the water Companies supplying the Parish, viz.:—the Southwark, the Lambeth and the Kent, and have found their waters to maintain a satisfactory state of purity In conclusion, Gentlemen, I have to record my satisfaction with the continued zeal and ability of your Inspectors of Nuisances, and especially to thank you for the unfailing courtesy and kindness with which you reward my efforts to discharge the duties of my office. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J, S. BR1STOWE. Table I.—Shewing the Mortality of the Parish of Camberwell in Districts during the rear 1862. In what Localities ? At what Ages ?
