Mr. Mayor, Ladles and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough of Hampstead during the year 1956. The report which follows sets out those figures of births, deaths and cases of notifiable infectious disease which attempt to express mathematically the state of the health of the residents of the Borough. The report also gives a summary of the work of the Public Health Department during the year, also largely reduced to figures. This method is convenient because it allows of easy comparison with previous years and with other districts, but it is necessarily incomplete and the effect or otherwise of the work of the Department on the health of the people cannot readily be shown. One reason for this is that public health measures frequently show their effects only after a long period. A child brought up in good surroundings is likely to live longer and he may figure in the death returns after a period of say 70 years instead of 40 or 50 years. Another reason is that the improved standards of living have had a major effect on the health of the people. There can be little doubt that improved housing has played a greater part in raising the standard of health than any single public health measure. Adequate food, clothing, medical services, etc. which we enjoy in this country have raised our standard of health far above those of less fortunate countries. Not all aspects of a better standard of living, however, necessarily improve health. Diet during the period of rationing was well balanced as was evident from the health of the children; the present freedom for individual choice and the greater quantity and variety of food does not necessarily mean that everyone has a better diet from a physiological point of view. The increased number of motor cars 4 on the road does not tend to prolong life and the increase in television viewing has been criticised. It is probable, however, that it is how people live rather than where they live which is important. Habits cannot be altered merely by an Act of Parliament, but if a person is given an environment in which he can live healthily then he probably will live healthily. Good housing will encourage good habits. Nobody now would consider a bathroom, a hot water supply or an indoor lavatory as luxuries. An efficient heating system usually provides or encourages efficient ventilation, good lighting is followed by cleanliness and improved conditions of employment usually result in improved conditions in the home. If a person can take pride in his surroundings he will usually take pride in himself. It is, I believe, the wish and intention of the Council that every effort should be made to provide such an environment and this can best be obtained by advice, help and encouragement. The work of the public health inspectors is not merely to enforce the provisions of the law but it is to assist in producing those circumstances, and those habits, which will lead to an improvement in the health of the public. The mere figures of the visits of the inspectors do not adequately reflect their work in this sphere. As I have indicated, this Report is inadequate as an assessment of the health of the people of the Borough, but I feel that the Members of the Council can be reasonably satisfied of the effectiveness of the services provided during 1956 no less than in previous years. I would like to express my thanks to the Members of the Council and particularly to the Chairman arid Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for advice and cooperation at all times and especially to my own staff for their loyal support. I am particularly indebted to the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. J.F. Armstrong, and to the Chief Clerk, Mr. A.H.C. Slade, for the generous way in which their wide knowledge and experience of the Borough was placed at my disposal when I took up my appointment in April, 1956. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. DUNCAN DEWAR, Medical Officer of Health. 5 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE The Worshipful the Mayor (Councillor Miss D.R.

The Registrar General's estimate of the population as at the middle of 1956 was 97,580. BIRTHS The number of births was 1,475, being 760 males and 715 females, giving a birth rate of 15.1 per 1,000 of the estimated population. DEATHS There were 1,029 deaths of Hampstead residents. This figure was a little higher than the previous year but the increase was not larger than the normal fluctuation which one expects with statistics and does not call for particular comment. The death rate was 10.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population. The individual causes of death do not show any marked variation from the normal. Small upward or downward trends can only be shown by a detailed analysis over many years and such an analysis is not possible in each year's annual report. F6r what it is worth, however, the following are the major changes compared with the figures for 1955. Deaths from tuberculosis dropped from fifteen to four. This is probably the lowest figure ever achieved in Hampstead for tuberculosis deaths. Heart and circulatory diseases caused 390 deaths compared with 344 in 1955.The increase was principally in coronary disease and angina which showed an increase of 16 male deaths and 29 female deaths. The total deaths from cancer showed little change, 216 compared with 220. Cancer of the lung and bronchus, however, showed a decrease from 56 to 34. Cancer of the stomach increased from 23 to 30 and cancer of the breast from 17 to 26. Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for four deaths against 10 for 1955 and deaths from all other accidents also showed a small drop, from 19 to 16. 8 The number of deaths from suicide dropped from 29 to 25 but this is not large enough to be of much significance and one hopes this figure will show a much bigger reduction in future years. There were two deaths from infectious disease, one of meningococcal infection and one of poliomyelitis. Among the notified cases of pneumonia there were three deaths. One death was attributed to pregnancy and childbirth. The infant mortality rate of 25 per 1,000 live births was a little higher than in recent years. Altogether 34 infants died under the age of one year, of whom 27 died before reaching the age of one month. INFECTIOUS DISEASE The year 1956 proved to be a comparatively healthy one in Hampstead. The total number of cases of notifiable disease was 566, of which 243 were cases of measles. Although the incidence of measles did not reach epidemic proportions it is interesting to note the steady increase in the monthly number of cases up to July and the decrease during the second half of the year. Measles Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. 2 6 2 6 17 25 59 48 28 32 9 9 If eases of measles are excluded the totals for the remaining notifiable diseases have shown a steady improvement in the last six years. 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 595 453 460 444 381 323 The summer of 1956 proved to be completely free of poliomyelitis in Hampstead. The two cases which did occur, both of the paralytic variety, occurred in March. It is with regret that I record the death of one of these cases, a woman of 29 years of age. The other case, in a boy aged 2Â¼ years was comparatively mild. The diagnosis of polionyelitis is often extremely difficult and it is becoming increasingly common for cases to be admitted to hospital for diagnosis. During the year 17 cases were admitted to hospital as "Query Poliomyelitis" but in all 9 cases the diagnosis proved to be some infection or disease other than poliomyelitis. One hesitates to comment on these admissions, A proportion and possibly a high proportion of these cases would have required hospital admission in any case, but moving a patient who is in the early stages of a major attack of poliomyelitis can be fraught with danger. The question of the advisability of admission to hospital is most difficult to decide and it is no help to know that if your decision is right the absence of paralysis in the patient proves nothing whereas a wrong decision is only too often shown by the subsequent unfortunate condition of the patient. Five cases admitted as "Query Diphtheria" were found to be glandular fever with or without some additional disease. One case admitted as "Continued Fever" was finally diagnosed as acute streptococcal tonsillitis. Three cases removed as "Query Meningococcal Infection" were discovered to be acute follicular tonsillitis (2 cases) and acute respiratory catarrh. These "query" cases represent a vast amount of work in the Department. They are all visited by the Public Health Inspector and are followed up in hospital until final diagnosis Is reached. There were two confirmed cases of meningococcal infection, a male aged 68, and a boy of 7 who unfortunately died. Two cases of acute infective encephalitis occurred, one a girl of 7 years, the other aged 20 was a nurse In a local hospital. There were two cases of post infectious encephalitis, males aged 6 and 30, and in both cases the encephalitis was associated with mumps. One case of typhoid fever was notified. The patient was a laboratory technologist employed in a hospital and a week before the onset of the illness had been working on typhoid culture. Observation was continued during 1956 on a typhoid carrier who had been notified in November, 1955. 36 specimens were examined, one of which proved positive for salmonella anatum but it was not possible to establish precisely the source of this infection. The patient was still under observation as a typhoid carrier at the end of the year. 10 Of the 35 cases of dysentery notified, 20 were single cases. Of the remainder, 6 cases occurred in one household, 3 cases in another, and in three instances there were two cases in a family. The number of cases of whooping cough was low compared with recent years. January, February and March provided a total of 4 cases whereas 30 cases occurred during the month of August. A case of brucellosis was brought to the attention of the Department and on investigation it was found that the patient's family had been on holiday in Ireland and had stayed at a farm where the children had been allowed to drink untreated milk from a herd of T.T. cows. The number of cases of food poisoning notified was the lowest for the last 4 years. There were 10 isolated cases, in 8 of which the infection was attributed to salmonella typhimurium. The cause of infection in the remaining 2 cases was not discovered. Two small family outbreaks occurred involving a total of five cases. In both instances the cases were attributed to salmonella typhimurium. A larger outbreak where 12 cases were ascertained (but not notified) occurred in a small canteen. The outbreak was fairly severe and was apparently caused by some roast beef which had been cooked on the previous day and then reheated on the day of consumption* The causal organism was probably C1. Welchii. There were no cases of smallpox. In fact, for the first time for many years, we received no notification of contacts arriving in Hampstead from abroad. During the winter months, on the advice of the Ministry of Health the scheme for reporting epidemics of influenza continued in force. The Medical Officer of Health is asked to inform the Ministry of any unusual prevalence of influenza, and in order to obtain early information on this subject medical practitioners in various parts of the Borough were approached and asked to act as "spotters". Fortunately, the incidence of influenza remained at a low level and no reports were received of any outbreak. Tuberculosis The total number of newly notified cases of Tuberculosis (101) showed an increase of 13 over 1955, but was still below 11 the average for the last five years (105). Respiratory tuberculosis among males (60 cases) showed an increase of 12 cases but among females (29 cases) there was a decrease of 7 cases compered with the previous year. Non-respiratory tuberculosis which had shown a steady decrease for a number of years rose to a total of 12 cases, the highest since 1951. There were 4 deaths from respiratory tuberculosis. Mass X-ray The Mass Radiography Unit visited Hampstead in June and spent 7 days on a site in Finchley Road and 4 days in Hampstead High Street. The first three days at Finchley Road were reserved for firms and offices, the public sessions occupying the remaining four days. At Hampstead High Street one day was taken up by firms and offices and three by open sessions for the general public. No figures are available of the numbers attending or of the numbers recalled for large films but the Unit was fully occupied during its stay in Hampstead. In addition to the above the Unit spent one day at the Borough Council's Depot in Lymington Road for the perpose of X-raying the staff of the Borough Engineer's Department. VERMINOUS PERSONS 31 cases of scabies were brought to the notice of the Department. 25 of these were notified cases, the remaining 6 cases being second or subsequent cases in a family and not requiring notification. The Public Health Inspectors visited all cases and treatment of 14 cases and 6 contacts was carried out at the Cleansing Station. The remainder were treated either at home or at hospital. 10 adults and 8 children under 5 years of age were treated for verminous conditions other than scabies. The London County Council Clinic for treatment of school children continued to function on one afternoon a week and 38 children with verminous heads attended. No case of scabies occurred amongst school children. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953 the Council has power to cleanse an aged person in his own home but in no instance was such action necessary in 1956. 12 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The work of the disinfecting staff tends to become more varied each year, and more time is spent on miscellaneous Jobs not connected with routine disinfection. Last year 14 wasp nests were destroyed; 14 filthy and verminous rooms were cleared after the death or removal of the occupant; in 16 instances bedding, carpets, etc., were removed for drying after burst water pipes; and 156 parcels of clothes were disinfected prior to despatch abroad. One entire hospital training school was disinfected on two occasions after outbreaks of disease, on each occasion the school was closed and the disinfection was spread over several days. The number of rooms disinfested after vermin was low, being l80 as compared with 317 the previous year. The rooms disinfected after infectious disease dropped to 215 from 280 in 1955- MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS 107 examinations were undertaken as follows 88 carried out for new entrants to the Superannuation Scheme. Of these, 8 were classed as unfit. 16 were made of persons on whom a special report was required in connection with absence through sickness. 3 were carried out on behalf of other authorities. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. SECTION 50 10 funerals were carried out under this Act at a total cost of Â£107.1s.9d. An amount of Â£83.9s.3d. was recovered from the estates of the deceased or from relatives. In seven Instances the full amount of the funeral expenses was recovered and in two cases the expenses were written off as irrecoverable. One case was still outstanding at the end of the year. In September the undertakers asked for the contract charges for the burial of adults, and for removal of bodies, to be increased. The total cost of an adult funeral is now Â£10.l2s.6d. The fee for removal of an adult body is now Â£1.10s.9d. and for a child Â£1.0s.0d. 13 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948.

Despite repeated efforts extending over a period of nearly twelve months, we were unable to effect any improvement in the living conditions of an old lady of 73 years, who was existing under such an appalling insanitary state, of her own making, that conditions became intolerable for the remainder of the tenants in the house. She was quite incapable of looking after herself and flatly refused to go to hospital or to accept help in any form. The Magistrate made an order for her removal for a period of 3 weeks to Whittington Hospital but unfortunately she died a few days after admission* Naturally, every conceivable avenue of improvement, voluntary and otherwise, is thoroughly explored before such a drastic step as compulsory removal has finally to be taken. I have great pleasure in paying tribute to the valuable assistance afforded by the Hampstead Old People's Welfare Association and many other voluntary bodies in connection with the welfare of old persons. I would also express appreciation to Dr. Exton Smith and the Geriatric Unit of the Whittington Hospital, Highgate, for unfailing cooperation. LAUNDRY FOR INCONTINENT PERSONS PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT. 1936. SECTION l22(l) This Section empowers a Local Authority to cleanse articles which are certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be "in such a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby" and to remove the article for that purpose. Local Authorities have no power to provide a general laundry service for articles which would not come within the above category. In view of the obvious and increasing need for a frequent laundry service for incontinent persons (strongly confirmed and supported by the District Nursing Associations, the Hampstead Old People's Welfare Association and the Home Help Organiser), this matter was the subject of comprehensive 15 reports to the Public Health Committee and in January, 1957 this service came into operation. The photographs give an idea of the particularlypleasing and well-planned lay-out of the laundry, which has ample light and provides adequate space for the efficient operation of the excellent modern machinery which has been installed. Fortunately, very little adaptation of the existing laundry at the Public Health & Cleansing Station was required beyond the provision of "three-phase" electric supply and the replacement of special deep rinsing sinks. The following equipment was installed One large Washing Machine. One Hydro Extractor. One Electric Ironer. One Laundry Truck. The total cost of the new equipment and alterations amounted to Â£963, but the service has already proved to be such a boon to many harassed and distressed old folk that this expenditure would appear to be well worth while. A twice weekly service of collection and delivery has been instituted and the work is being carried out by the existing staff at the Public Health Station. The Council has no power to make a charge and the service operates under the following conditions 1.- Only articles of bed clothing and personal clothing contaminated with faeces, urine or discharges can be dealt with. 2.- When a request for the service is received, Mrs. Speechley or another Public Health Inspector visits the person concerned in order to be satisfied that the articles in question fall to be dealt with under Section 122 and that the family is unable to deal with the situation. Certificates to the effect that bed linen and/or personal clothing is in such a condition that health is likely to be endangered thereby are submitted to the Public Health Committee each month together with a report of the cases for which Certificates have been signed. In those cases where persons have not possessed at least three changes of linen the Hampstead Old People's Welfare Association and National Assistance Board have been most helpful. 16 17 18 THE CARE OF THE AGED Agencies concerned with the Care of the Aged Hampstead Old People's Welfare Association, MAI 3652 107, Kingsgate Road, N.W.6.

N.W.6. 21 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA STAFF Sanitary Inspectors (Change of Designation) Act. 1956 This Act received the Royal Assent on the 2nd August, 1956 and in consequence Sanitary Inspectors throughout the country are now more aptly designated as "Public Health Inspectors". It is improbable, however, that the change of designation alone will make any appreciable difference to the shortage of inspectors which exists at present. There are two vacancies for Public Health Inspectors in the Department, one having existed for over twelve months and the other being due to the resignation of Mr. G.R. Young who secured an appointment as Public Health Inspector with the Uxbridge Urban District Council from 1st January, 1957â¢ The response to advertisements to fill these vacancies has not been encouraging. Although this report is concerned with the year 1956, it would perhaps be appropriate to say that the Council decided that useful information might well be obtained, as has been the case with other Departments, by an investigation by an Organisation and Methods team and a survey of the Public Health Department was started early In 1957. As it seemed possible that some reorganisation would be recommended, it was felt that the question of filling the two vacancies mentioned might well be deferred until the report of the Organisation and Methods team had been received. INSPECTION OF FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES The Food & Drugs Act. 1955. The Food Hygiene Regulations. 1955 The Food and Drugs Act, 1955 came into operation on the 1st January, 1956. The Aet is a consolidating Act and, as a result of its provisions, the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, the Food and Drugs Act, 195^ and a number of Orders have been included In the one comprehensive statute. It brings into effect the provisions of the last named Act, but there is little which is new except for a number of detailed alterations in the law which affect the work of your Inspectors and Sampling Officers. On the whole, I would say that the Food Hygiene Regulations are working well and are being reasonably observed by the great majority of the food traders in Hampstead, all of whan have been supplied with a copy of the Regulations. 22 All the prosecutions instituted in respect of contaminants in food, viz.:- a nail, a cigarette end and mice droppings, concerned foodstuffs manufactured outside the Borough and the appropriate Medical Officers of Health were informed. Various cautionary letters have been sent concerning minor infringements of the Regulations. In the event of non-compliance with our requests, these will be followed up and such action taken as is warranted. SECTION 16. FOOD & DRUGS ACT. 1955 Ice Cream Eleven additional premises were registered for the sale of ice cream. In each case the ice cream Is wrapped. The total number of premises registered is 253. Many types of business now wish to sell ice cream in conjunction with their main business. Tobacconists, newsagents, fancy goods stores, stationers, general stores, greengrocers, fishmongers and butchers have all made application to be registered and the Council has had to give careful consideration as to whether, in its opinion, ice cream can safely be sold from such premises. In certain cases, written undertakings have been secured that the ice cream shall be prepared and stored quite separately from other goods, and that the staff serving ice cream shall not handle other produce sold in. the shop. Cooked Poods 56 premises are registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food, comprising the following types of premises:grocers, provisions, butchers, delicatessen, factory, cafe. HAMP5TEAD HEATH FAIRS Catering Hygiene As usual, members of the staff were on duty throughout the whole period of all the various Bank Holiday Fairs. We have an arrangement with the London County Council whereby prior notification is given of applicants who apply for licences to sell food on the Heath. Thus, before the licences are issued by the County Council we are able to investigate the 23 applicant's methods of food production, storage and equipment. Should these be unsuitable or unsatisfactory, the London County Council is notified and a trading licence is refused. Most of the applicants reside in other Boroughs and I am indebted to their Medical Officers of Health for cooperation in supplying reports on these itinerant food vendors. As may well be imagined, it is a very difficult matter indeed to keep track of all the itinerant food traders who cater for the large crowds which assemble on Hampstead Heath on Bank Holidays but, taken by and large, quite a fair amount of supervision is successfully undertaken by your Inspectors. The majority of the mobile vans are provided with food hygiene equipment of a very high order, in fact, most of our troubles arise in persuading food handlers that the equipment is there for use and is not merely a show-piece I So far as the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 are concerned, the principal matters which called for comment were 1.The need to provide more adequate protection for "open foods" displayed for sale. 2. The omission of the inscription of the names and addresses of food vendors on their stalls. 3.Smoking whilst preparing food. All these matters were immediately drawn to the attention of the vendors concerned and were followed up by cautionary letters indicating that, should further offences of a like nature be discovered, legal proceedings would be instituted. All bacteriological samples are speedily reported upon by the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, and I must once more express to Dr. Betty Hobbs, Principal of the Food Hygiene Section, my thanks for her cooperation and assistance at all times. 24 The following table shows the grading of ice cream samples taken at the fairground since the war:- Year No. of Samples Taken Grading under Meth.

I am greatly indebted to the Director of the Laboratory for unfailing cooperation and help. Details of the ice cream and milk samples submitted to bacteriological examination appear under the respective headings. 51 other samples were taken for examination. Some were routine samples; others for confirmation of unsound or defective tinning, etc. and a proportion were from suspected cases of food poisoning. (b) Samples submitted to Chemical Analysis Mr. Eric Voelcker, A.R.C.S., F.R.I.C., Public Analyst to the Borough, has examined and reported upon 503 samples which can be classified under the following broad headings:- 25 Milk, cream, condensed milk, etc. 39 Butter, margarine, cooking fat, cheese 25 Ice cream, lollies 19 Fruits, vegetables (including canned and tinned) 4l Tinned fish, shellfish 24 Meat and meat products 87 Herbs, condiments, spices, sauces, etc. 47 Flour, flour confectionery, puddings, cakes, etc. 82 Beverages, non-alcoholic 51 do. alcoholic 27 Jams, preserves 11 Sweets, confectionery 40 Miscellaneous 12 503 All the samples of milk proved satisfactory, the average milk fat content being 3.71 per cent. The legal miniraui is 3 per cent. 13 samples of pork sausages were taken, the average meat content being 68.9 per cent; the lowest meat content was 66 per cent. 3 samples of beef sausages gave meat contents of 51, 52 and 52 per cent. There were 15 adulterated or unsatisfactory samples, details of which are given in the Statistical Summary. UNSOUND FOOD Wherever possible, such food is salvaged for use either for animal feeding stuffs, soap manufacturing or other industrial purposes. Other condemned food is either destroyed at the Public Health Station or removed to the Council's Dusting Wharf for disposal with other trade refuse. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The work of the Department in this connection resolved itself into three aspects. 1.Investigation of complaints and action to abate nuisances, 2.Continuation of cooperation with the Department of Scientific & Industrial Research on the investigation into the trends of air pollution, and 26 3.Exploratory work in connection with the Clean Air Act, 1956. In the first of these connections, 21 complaints were received of alleged nuisances from smoke or grit emissions and a total of 419 observations, inspections and interviews was made by the Public Health Inspector to determine if nuisances existed and to effect remedies. The nuisances established were diverse and included smoke and smells caused by the burning of old tyres at a car-breakers; severe grit emission from large automatic-feed coal boilers at a hostel; an industrial furnace which had been converted to burn sump oil but which was being fired with wood and coke and excessive smoke emission from the chimney of a Nurses' home. All such cases were dealt with by advice and cooperation and results generally varied from complete abatement of nuisance to considerable and continuing improvements. A few sporadic complaints have recurred regarding emission from the numerous railway tunnel ventilating shafts scattered throughout the Borough. There are more main railway lines running through Hampstead than any other London Borough and, although the attention of British Railways is immediately drawn to any complaint regarding excessive smoke, etc. emission from their shafts, it would not appear possible completely to eliminate this trouble until their long term policy of electrification and/or substitution of steam engines with Diesel oil-fired engines is completed. The measurement of variations of air pollution has continued in collaboration with the Fuel Research Station. Monthly results from deposit gauges and lead peroxide instruments at Barrow Hill Reservoir and Fortune Green Road Cemetery have been recorded and passed on for inclusion in the national survey. Daily readings of smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations have been taken from the continuous filter at the Public Health Department and I append Tables to illustrate that the concentration of sulphur dioxide in the air of Hampstead is consistently below that prevailing in London generally. The Clean Air Act, 1956 (Appointed Day) Order, 1956 brought into operation, as from the 31st December, 1956, the provisions of the Act relating to smoke from furnaces, Smoke 27 Control Areas, etc. and the Smoke Control Areas (Authorised Fuels) Regulations, 1956 declared certain fuels as authorised fuels for the purposes of the Act. A Model Byelaw making obligatory the provision of appliances which could operate without the emission of smoke was also issued by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and will doubtless form the basis of the new Byelaws to be issued by the London County Council. As a preliminary step in preparation for the implementation of the Act, all applicants for advances under Section 4 of the Housing Act, 1949 and for Improvement Grants, were advised that they should make arrangements to ensure that all heating appliances in the premises were smokeless or would be converted to obviate any emission of smoke therefrom. Circular letters are also sent to the Owners, Builders and Architects concerned with all new buildings, or conversions into flats, asking for their cooperation so as to ensure that no solid fuel appliances in which smokeless fuel cannot be burned satisfactorily will be fixed in new or converted houses or flats or business premises, A list of the domestic solid fuel appliances recommended by the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation is sent to all applicants on request. In addition, the Public Health Inspectors were instructed, when completing inspections of every type of property, to take note of all the heating arrangements therein. The information thus gained will be of value should the Council decide to make a Smoke Control Zone. Various of your Inspectors have also attended a special course run by the Coal Utilisation Council at which latest developments in approved types of firegrate for use with smokeless fuels were described and demonstrated, while five of the Public Health Inspectors are undertaking a course of study with a view to qualifying as Smoke Inspectors. Many houses in Hampstead are used for single room occupation and, as would be expected, it is unusual to find solid fuel appliances used in rooms so let. Gas and electric fires are mainly used and I believe that the number of such houses in the Borough is so great as to have a sensible effect, not only on present air pollution, but on the extent and cost of future proposals for elimination of domestic smoke. 28 TABLE 1. Table showing the monthly average of Sulphur Dioxide concentration in Hampstead and in London. Expressed as parts per 100 million. 29 TABLE 2. Table showing the highest concentrations of Sulphur Dioxide (expressed as parts per 100 million) recorded each month in Hampstead and in London. 30 SANITARY CONVENIENCES AT RAILWAY AND UNDERGROUND STATIONS In view of complaints made to the Department, a survey was made of all the conveniences at the stations listed below. Improvements were effected as the result of our representations to the Railway authorities, but it was not possible for either the British Railways or the London Transport Executive to instal washing facilities at the less important stations owing to the cost and difficulties of supervision and maintenance. It will, of course, be appreciated that the Council has no specific jurisdiction over the British Transport Commission in respect of the provision of sanitary accomnodation. British Railways Kilburn High Road South Hampstead Hampstead Heath Finchley Road and Frognal West End Lane West Hampstead London Transport Executive Swiss Cottage Finchley Road West Hampstead Chalk Farm Belsize Park Hampstead Conveniences are provided in all these stations. Washing facilities are provided for ladies only at Swiss Cottage and Chalk Farm Stations and for men and women at the Finchley Road (London Transport Executive) Station. No washing facilities are provided for passengers at the other stations. FREE WASHING FACILITIES PUBLIC CONVENIENCES In connection with the clean food drive, the Council has provided free washing facilities at its four public conveniences. Liquid soap and paper hand towels are available. The public and the street traders would appear to appreciate this facility judging by the number of towels which have been issued. 31 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952 The Act prohibits the sale or letting of unguarded domestic electric fires, gas fires or oil heaters; empowers authorised officers of local authorities to inspect and list appliances kept on any premises for sale or letting and imposes penalties for contraventions. No contravention of the Act was reported. Advice was given regarding the Regulations to an importer of foreign made appliances. THE RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 There is one firm in the Borough of Hampstead whose premises are registered for the use of filling materials used in manufacturing bedding and other articles of upholstery. Four inspections have been carried out which showed the premises to be in a satisfactory condition. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no common lodging houses in the Borough. WATER SUPPLY The Borough's water supply is provided entirely by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. All the dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied from public water mains direct to the house. There are no wells or stand pipes. SECTION 54. THE FACTORIES ACT. 1937. UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES The basement bakehouses at No. 228, Belsize Road and No. 279, West End Lane, not having been used as such for a period exceeding twelve months, automatically ceased to function and must not be used as bakehouses again. Appropriate notice was given to the owners and the occupiers. The Certificate of Suitability relating to the basement bakehouse at No. 63, Hemstal Road expired on the 30th September, 1956 and this bakehouse must not be used again for this purpose. All these three basement bakehouses were first registered in 1903. 32 When the Factory & Workshops Act, 1901 came into force there were no less than basement bakehouses operating in the Borough. This number was reduced to 22 after the passing of the 1901 Act and to 7 by the time the present Factories Act came into force. Now there remains only one basement bakehouse continuing in operation in Hampstead, viz.:- No. 7, Fairhazel Gardens. THE FACTORIES ACT. 1937. PART Till. OUTWORKERS For the first time for many years, the Department was able to make a thorough survey of all the premises in the Borough where outwork is known to be carried on. Section 110 of The Factories Act, 1937 (lists of outworkers to be kept in certain trades) provides (inter alia) that every occupier of a factory shall (a) keep lists showing the names and addresses of all persons employed in the business of the factory who work outside the factory, (b) send such lists to H.M. Inspector of Factories and (c) send to the district Council during the months of February and August in each year copies of those lists, showing all outworkers so employed during the preceding six months. The classes of homework to which the Act applies are specified by Regulations made by the Secretary of State. These are very comprehensive and range over thirty-one varieties of trades and occupations. Section 111 (Employment of persons in unwholesome premises), provides that where the outworker's premises are injurious or dangerous to health of persons employed therein the district Council may take appropriate action by way of notice and there are penal provisions regarding non-compliance therewith. It is forbidden for outwork to be carried on from premises where certain specified infectious diseases are known to exist. The most recent lists received showed that seventyeight people were on the Register. Visits by your Public Health Inspectors revealed that 11 persons no longer carried on homework and 6 had removed. The remainder were employed in the following trades;- 33 25 engaged in altering or repairing, etc. of wearing apparel 19 engaged in making or filling Xmas crackers 1 '' '' packing of buttons, hooks, pins, etc. 5 " " making of artificial flowers 2 '' " making toys 1 " " making or altering curtains and furniture hangings 1 " " making of plastic goods 3 '' " making of lampshades 2 " " making of boxes 1 '' " carpet cleaning 1 " " handbag repairing. 61 Having regard to present day trends and the desire of most people to augment the family income by doing extra work in their own time, I find it somewhat surprising that so little outwork is carried on in the Borough. It will be noted that the home packing of confectionery or, indeed, of any apsect of food preparation, has now ceased. It is very pleasing to report that conditions were usually quite good; there was no overcrowding and no premises were found to be in an unwholesome condition. The attention of two manufacturers was drawn to their omission to send their lists of outworkers. RODENT AND PEST CONTROL Prevention of Damage by Pests Act. 1949 Eradication of rats and mice has continued during the year under review, under the general supervision of the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector. The work has been carried out by two rodent operatives and shows an increase over that done in 1955. The total number of premises treated during the year was 656 of which 203 related to rats and 453 to mice infestation. The addition in the number of premises treated for rat 34 infestation was mainly due to an increasingly thorough survey of properties adjoining those from which complaints emanated and the subsequent treatments of a greater number of properties. There were two cases of rat infestation which were of particular interest 1.A heavy recurrent infestation underneath a basement floor, although there was no evidence that the rats broke out into the dwelling. There was no indication as to how they gained access. The domestic drainage had been renewed within the last few years and was constructed of cast iron. The actual line of the old pipe sewer was not known with any certainty but the application of a smoke test over the raking arm of the domestic drainage intercepting trap revealed without any doubt that it ran underneath the infested house and was defective. The section was relaid in a different position and it was not until after completion of the work that there was any break out of the rodents from the sub-floor space into the dwelling, where they were obviously in search of food. One treatment was then completely successful in determining the subsequent minor infestation. No trouble has since been experienced. 2.A basement tenant complained that she had seen a rat which escaped down the trap of the water closet. Upon investigation of the drainage system the access chamber into which the branch soil drain discharged revealed numerous rodent foot-prints on the benching. A second chamber some 15-20 feet away was found complete with rat nest constructed on the upper part of the benching. The domestic drainage system and sewer connection was subjected to a test and found to be sound. In this instance the route of infestation had been from house to drain instead of, as is usual, from drain to house. It also proved beyond doubt that the water-seal to the trap of a W.C. is not a fully effective barrier to rats. Charges for Rodent Extermination As a result of a review of the cost of rodent work, the charge to business premises was increased from 7s.6d. to the more realistic figure of 17s.Od. per hour. It was at first thought that the increased charge would deter traders from taking advantage of the Council's rodent service, but this has not been so. 35 Maintenance Treatment for Rats in Sewers This aspect of rodent control continues to be undertaken by the staff of the Borough Engineer and I am indebted to him for particulars of the treatment given. Two treatments were carried out in the year, the first from 16th January to 4th February, using a sausage Rusk bait and 2Â½ per cent, phosphide poison medium, and the second from 2nd to 2lst July with bread rusk and 10 per cent. arsenious oxide. The following table indicates the result of the two treatments:- January 1957 July 1957 No. of manholes baited 717 757 No. of manholes showing prebait take 322 392 No. of manholes showing complete prebait take 85 25 The second treatment would appear to indicate a more widespread infestation but a decreased rat population. Insect and other Pests In addition to the usual complaints of ants, bugs, cockroaches, fleas, flies, lice, pigeons, wasps, woodlice and woodworm there have been increasing numbers of complaints from tenants of new blocks of flats of the pest "Bryobia praetiosa" or Clover Mite. The source of infestation would appear to be importation on turves or in grass seed. The infestations have proved very obstinate to treatment and do not respond to the usual D.D.T. and B.H.C. insecticides. Experimental treatments have been carried out using Gammexane and Malathian and with successful results. 36 Autumnal flies, namely "Thaumatomyia notata" have given a lot of trouble during the months of September/October. Nothing can be done to deal with these at source but when they attempt to hibernate and gain access to dwellings they can be readily killed with persistent insecticides D.D.T. and B.H.C. PROVISION OF DUSTBINS The vexed question of who should provide the dustbin the Owner or the Occupier, has been relieved, so far as the Borough Council is concerned, by the provisions contained in Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. It is now the practice for the Council to ask the owner to supply the dustbin. The Owner may appeal to the Magistrates Court against the requirements of the notice within 21 days. No such appeal was made during 1956. PLEASURE FAIR BYELAWS In view of the lack of legal control over the persistent public health nuisances caused by the absence of sanitary conveniences at the private Yale of Health Amusement Park, the Council determined to make Byelaws in pursuance of the powers contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1939. These Byelaws were confirmed by the Home Office and came into operation on 1st October, 1954. Despite the fact that there had been two previous successful prosecutions, it was found necessary to issue three further Summonses in respect of the absence of sanitary accommodation at the Vale of Health private fairground. The maximum penalty of Â£5 was imposed in each case and Costs were awarded to the Council. Plans were afterwards deposited showing new conveniences at both fairgrounds. BARBERS AND HAIRDRESSERS Two new premises were registered during 1956 bringing the total number of premises registered to 76. 37 HOUSING SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMME. 1956-60 The following is the list of properties comprised in the Council's approved slum clearance programme made in accordance with Section 1 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. No. of Dwellings Alexandra Mews 24 Quex Mews 5 Colas Mews 8 Elizabeth Mews 14 Steeles Mews North 7 Cottage Mews 4 Flask Walk (24, 26, 28) 3 New End (36, 38, 40) 3 Loveridge Mews 8 TOTAL:- 76 * Nos. 20, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, Elizabeth Mews have now been deleted from the programme. (None of these premises is used for human habitation.) To be dealt with by the London County Council. Colas Mews was officially Represented pursuant to Section 25 of the Housing Act, 1936 as being unfit for human habitation and that the most satisfactory method of dealing with the conditions in the area was the demolition of all the buildings therein. This matter was the subject of an objection by the individual Owner of seven of the premises, Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 12, Colas Mews and a private local Inquiry was ordered by the Minister of Housing & Local Government. The Clearance Order was subsequently confirmed by the Minister without modification. The Colas Mews Clearance Order, 1956 became effective on the 22nd December, 1956 and appropriate measures are being taken to secure the complete demolition and clearance of all the premises comprised in the area. The following photograph gives a general impression of the conditions existing at Colas Mews. 38 Colas Mews. 39 Nos. 24, 26 and 28, Flask Walk were also declared a Clearance Area and a Compulsory Purchase Order was made. The owner of the three premises subsequently lodged an objection which is to be the subject of an Inquiry by the Minister. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT. 1954 CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR The following table shows the paucity, both of the tenant's applications for Certificates of Disrepair, and the landlords' for the revocation thereof. Of the total number of 174 Certificates issued from the commencement of the Act until 31st December, 1956 landlords applied for the revocation of 71â¢ Landlords are obviously not troubling to apply for revocation of the outstanding Certificates because the increased rents will not apparently recompense them for the expensive repairs involved. 40 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT. 1955. SECTION 27 This most useful Section provides that "(l) Where a sanitary authority are satisfied that - (a) any house in their district is in such a state (in this section referred to as a 'defective state') as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health; and (b) having regard to all the circumstances unreasonable delay in remedying the defective state would be occasioned by following in relation to such house (in this section referred to as 'the premises') the procedure prescribed in the Fifth Schedule to the Act of 1936, the authority may (instead of serving a nuisance notice under the said Fifth Schedule) serve, upon the person upon whom it would otherwise have been appropriate under the said schedule to serve such a nuisance notice, a notice to the effect that the authority intend to remedy the defective state of the premises themselves and specifying the defects which they intend to remedy". This procedure was used on two occasions, tenders being obtained from local builders and the lowest tender being accepted in each case. HOUSING ACT. 1949 SECTION 4. LOANS GRANTED. SECTION 20. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Work in connection with the above continues to be of quite a substantial character, as is illustrated in the following diagram and table. Before advancing money under Section 4 the Council is required to be satisfied that houses to be acquired are, or will be made, "in all respects fit for human habitation". Very comprehensive surveys are undertaken by your Public Health Inspectors, in conjunction with the Council's Valuers. Schedules of works to render the premises fit are served on the applicant and the estimated cost of the repairs 4l is retained out of the moneys to be advanced, until the works are completed. Thus, not only is a large number of properties being brought into a good state of repair, but the applicants have the knowledge that, generally speaking, they are safeguarded against untoward heavy commitments on their houses for a very reasonable period.

Housing applications are sent to the Public Health Department for visits to be made to ascertain the number of rooms occupied by the family, the sex and ages of the members of the family, the permitted number of occupants for the accommodation, the conditions under which the family is living and the condition of the premises and any medical conditions which might be improved by rehousing. The actual pointing is done by the Housing Estates Manager and points are allocated In respect of the period on the waiting list, overcrowding, bedroom deficiency, insanitary conditions, lack of facilities, separated families, half-way house accommodation, separate home and service in the Forces. Points awarded by the Public Health Department are made on medical grounds only. In order to obtain the maximum uniformity in this service which affects the lives of so many people all the visits are made by the Woman Public Health Inspector (Mrs. Speechley) so far as is possible. During the year visits were made and reports submitted concerning 4l6 applications. In addition, 75 reports on rehousing applications were submitted direct to the London County Council and 29 to other Boroughs. A further 68 cases were investigated for the Housing Estates Manager but were found to have obtained alternative accommodation without recourse to the Borough Council. I wish to acknowledge the help received from the general practitioners of Hampstead who cooperate with the Department freely in order that a fair estimate can be made of each case. The following table sets out the points that were awarded.
