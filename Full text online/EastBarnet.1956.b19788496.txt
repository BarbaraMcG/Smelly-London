EBAR18 East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1956 BY C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S. (Eng.), L.R.C.P. (Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M.R.S.H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1956 BY C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S. (Eng.), L.R.C.P. (Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M R S H Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1956. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my report for the year 1956. This has been a light year from the point of view of notifications of infectious diseases, particularly in regard to the ever prevalent measles and chicken pox. The decline in severity in what are classed as the usual children's infectious diseases has been noticeable for several years and is reflected in the marked lessening of attention paid to quarantine and period of exclusion of contacts from schools. Diphtheria immunisation continues to prove its value, and whooping cough immunisation is becoming increasingly popular. Unfortunately it begins to appear preferable that the two injections should not be combined, which means an increasing number of injections for a babe during its first year of life, apart of course from the highly necessary vaccination. Added to all these procedures is now the poliomyelitis vaccine, which is likely to be universally demanded as soon as it becomes available in sufficient quantities, as the disease commands a fear somewhat out of proportion to its incidence and normal severity. This fear is none the less completely understandable in view of the tragic results of a severe infection and our meagre knowledge as to its mode of spread. 3 Housing continues to be the district's major problem, and we are now beginning to see the results of last year's Housing Survey. The black spots are being dealt with. Several individual unfit houses have been demolished and a further clearance area represented— an action which will occur with increasing frequency. It is likely that the knowledge that individual unfit houses are being steadily dealt with has increased the amount of repairs being done to avoid houses coming into demolition categories. Once again the Housing Committee have dealt sympathetically with requests for consideration to be extended to the few cases of urgency to which their attention has been drawn, but equally obviously the problem is a continuing one. Food hygiene has been and will continue to be an important part of the Department's duties, and the food retailers in the area have responded well. The question of the misrepresentation of the contents in labelling of food products has been carefully watched, although, as pointed out by the Chief Public Health Inspector, some labels have gained recognition by long usage, and in some instances the public have become accustomed to what might strictly be termed misleading descriptions. All other routine duties continue to be carried out by the Department with expedition. Lastly, thanks are due to the chief officers and staff of other departments for their ever ready help and co-operation on all occasions when it has been sought. C. M.

Totals 12 14 2 1 1 1 _ - 9 ANALYSIS OF VITAL STATISTICS 1. The Registrar General's mid-year estimate of population for 1956 is 40,660. This is a decrease of 50 on the previous year's estimate. The estimated population for 1955 also showed a slight decrease of 20 on the previous year. Over the two years the Registrar General estimates that the population has decreased by 70 which on a population of over 40,000 is approximately .17 per cent. 2. The number of live births has increased from 504 in 1955 to 534 in 1956. There was also a slight increase in births in 1955. The birth rate has risen from 30.0 to 30.9 due to the increase combined with the decrease in population. The number of illegitimate births shows a very considerable increase over 1955 being a 40 per cent, rise on that figure. Over the past 10 years the average of illegitimate births is approximately 20. There has been an increase over the last 2 years. However, as these figures fluctuate widely year by year it is not possible to draw any conclusions from the statistics of two consecutive years. 3. The infantile mortality rate is 13.5 per thousand live births which is considerably less than in 1955 a year in which the figure was very high. In order to make a comparison of figures the average rate over the last 5 years was approximately 18. Over this period the infantile mortality rate has varied between 21.0 and 10.5. The death rate for illegitimate infants is 0. This figure has no significance as the figures involved are too small and vary too widely for one year's statistics to have any meaning. 4. The number of deaths from cancer is the same as the previous year, i.e., 78, of which 12 were due to cancer of the lungs. 5. In Table IV it will be noted that there were 29 new cases of Tuberculosis but only 2 deaths from this disease. In the last Annual Report it was noted that the number of deaths from Tuberculosis is apparently decreasing, which is again borne out by the present year's figures. 6. Infectious diseases show a decrease of approximately 500 during the year. The number of cases of measles notified is extremely low and does not appear to be a true figure. In 1955 there was an epidemic of measles and chicken pox which accounted for the high figure of notified infectious diseases during that year. In 1956 there were no epidemics of any size. The 12 cases of food poisoning notified were isolated cases or cases occurring in one family. No outbreaks of food poisoning have occurred throughout the year. All cases of scarlet fever, poliomyelitis and food poisoning are visited by the Public Health Inspectors and every endeavour is made to trace contacts and in the case of food poisoning the vehicle of transmission. 10 Water The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date chemical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,394 examinations of water representative of supply were made, 99.8 per cent, being B. coli free in 100 ml. In addition to the above the water company submitted 58 samples of water representative of supply to an independent Analyst, 100 per cent, of these were B. coli free in 100 ml. Ten samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination to the Public Health Laboratory. The reports were in every case satisfactory. 11 East Barnet Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1956 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my fifth annual report to the Council. The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, came into force during the year and these regulations together with the Food and Drugs Act and the implementation of the Council's programme under the Housing Acts have formed the basis of the Department's main work. A further Clearance Area has been declared and the one declared in 1955 confirmed. In this field the housing survey carried out in 1953-1954 has proved very useful particularly in the answering of enquiries on the likely life and condition of houses. To carry out the survey two additional staff were employed. One of these additional members was released on the completion of the work, but the other, Mr. Harland, is still employed in assisting with housing inspection, preparation of reports, etc., in connection with Individual Unfit Houses and Clearance Areas under the Housing Acts. Although the number of visits made has lessened in part due to the reduction in staff already mentioned, the amount of general work carried out by the Department has increased very considerably, 12 and is apparently continuing to do so. The number of visits made in a year are in themselves a very poor guide as the time taken per visit cannot be assessed nor can the amount of office work involved. The Public Health Inspectors are continuing to maintain a high standard of efficiency and although several new Acts, etc., have come into force entailing considerable study, they have spared no effort to keep themselves up to date in both theory and practice. In conclusion I wish to tender my thanks to members of the staff of the Department and other officers of the Council for their assistance and co-operation throughout the year. W. K. PICKUP, Chief Public Health Inspector. 13 TABLE I Table of Visits and Inspections made during the Year Public Health 1955 1956 Nuisances and Sanitary Defects 4,478 4,236 Infectious Diseases 175 235 Schools 71 79 Smoke Observations 53 47 Caravan Sites 4 5 Brooks and Streams 36 31 Verminous Premises 12 7 Hairdressers and Barbers 22 —4,851 21 —4,661 Housing Housing Act, 1936, Part 2 3,451 1,613 Permitted Numbers and Overcrowding 18 21 Applicants for Housing (Special Cases) 83—3,552 38—1,672 Food Hygiene Restaurants and Snack Bars 315 352 Fish Shops 166 208 Butchers' Shops 274 325 Bakehouses 51 93 Ice Cream Premises 306 356 Other Food Shops and Premises 758 831 Food Inspections 173 185 Milk (Special Designations) Registrations 115—2,158 112—2,462 Factories Factories 231 194 Outworkers 93— 324 81— 275 Infestations Rat and Mouse 3,271 2,473 Insects 226—3,497 276—2,749 Food and Drugs Sampling and in connection therewith 513— 513 536— 536 Shops Acts Visits made 765— 765 702— 702 15,660 13,057 14 TABLE II Housing Act, 1936 Demolition Orders made under Section 11 5 Houses demolished as a result of Orders 4 Houses on which work was carried out in pursuance of an undertaking under Section 11 - Clearance Areas declared under Section 25— (Clearance Area) 18 Number of Notices Served during the Year 1955 1956 Informal Notices 124 173 Statutory Notices 39 25 Result of the service of these Notices as follows:— Preliminary Notices Statutory Notices 1955 1956 1955 1956 Complied with 116 152 31 26 Work in progress or in hand at end of year 2 1 1 1 Not complied with 6 20 7 5 TABLE III Improvements effected as a result of Notices served Exterior No. of Houses Roofs repaired and made weathertight 34 Rainwater pipes and rainwater gutters cleaned, repaired or renewed 28 Skylights repaired and renewed 1 Chimney pots and flues repaired 5 Brickwork repaired or repointed 6 Rendering repaired or renewed 2 Damp walls remedied 23 Choked drains cleared 17 Soil and vents repaired or renewed 2 I.C.

It will be noticed that in actual numbers they are less than the previous year. A variation in figures is natural and has little relation to the amount of work carried out; during the year the department has been exceptionally busy. The number of complaints from residents has remained above average. Nuisances and Sanitary Defects Under this heading 4,236 visits were made as against 4,478 visits the previous year. These visits relate in the main to complaints and subsequent visits made to ensure that work is carried out. This drop is not significant as previously stated. The number of complaints received has not changed to any considerable extent from the previous year. The preliminary notices served during the year (Table II) show an increase. This is due to the Food Hygiene Regulations and the numbers outstanding are largely due to these Regulations. Statutory notices have been slightly less. Table III gives a list of repairs, etc., carried out as a result of the notices served and does not vary to any appreciable extent from year to year. A comparison of figures between two consecutive years does not give any guide as to the general position as many independent factors cause considerable variations from year to year. However, over a period of 15 years there is undoubtedly a decrease in the number of complaints regarding defects in houses, and the defects in housing which are the subject of complaint are as a whole far less serious. From personal observation I feel that the general standard of living conditions has improved considerably over this period. Infectious Disease and Food Poisoning There has been an increase in the number of visits made in regard to this heading but if Table I of the Medical Officer of Health's report is consulted it will be seen that there is an increase in scarlet fever over the previous year. As this is a disease in which the household is visited and information regarding contacts, etc., obtained, this could account for the greater number of visits. In respect of food poisoning there have been 12 cases notified and 9 of dysentery. This is considerably more than the previous year. In addition to these notified cases a number of suspected cases have been visited. Schools The conveniences and canteens attached to schools are visited regularly. In the event of any defect the County Council are informed. The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, are phrased so as to include a canteen attached to a school. 18 Smoke Observations Observations have been taken on all industrial chimneys in the district and where necessary the firms operating the furnaces have been communicated with. The causes of emission of smoke have in all cases been due to accidental failure and in no case have such emissions been so great as to be classified as a nuisance. Brooks and Streams, Verminous Premises, Hairdressers and Barbers Very little change has been made in the number of visits paid to these headings. In the case of verminous premises there have been less visits made, it being exceptional to find any premises infested with vermin. FACTORIES During 1956 the routine visits to factories and outworkers for the purposes of the Factories Acts have continued and in the year in question 194 visits were made and 3 contraventions were found. Notices were served on the occupiers of the factories and the necessary work was carried out. The condition of the factories generally in this area is reasonable as far as the Sections for which the local authority are responsible. Considering that there are 99 factories in the district the number of notices served is small. SHOPS ACTS Inspections made under these Acts show a slight decrease. In the first two years a considerable amount of work was done in forming a register of the shops and in the present year routine visits to ensure that the Acts are being complied with have been made. A new Shops Bill is before Parliament which makes slight changes in several provisions but so many amendments have been made that its final form is doubtful. Whilst it is proposed to make earlier closing hours in this Bill, this time would still be later than the majority of shops close in this area. No serious contraventions of the Acts have been found during the year and while the anomalies arising from different early closing days in parts of the district have not yet been remedied, the necessary preliminary work for new Early Closing Day Orders is well in hand. HOUSING During the year of 1956 the amount of work in this field has increased, although the number of visits made are considerably less than the previous year. In 1955 it will be remembered that the main survey to obtain an estimate of the condition of housing in the district was in progress and at that time large numbers of houses were being visited for this purpose. In 1956 a start has been made in implementing those findings and the preparation and detailed inspections for Clearance Areas etc., have been started. 19 The Council had declared a Clearance Area in 1955, Albert Road, and this area has now been approved by the Ministry and the Compulsory Clearance Order confirmed. A further Clearance Area was declared in 1956, being 18 houses in Margaret Road. Several more areas are in the course of preparation. Under Section 11 (Individual Unfit Houses) of the Housing Act, 1936, 5 Demolition Orders were made. It is apparent that more demolition orders on individual unfit houses will become necessary than was at first supposed, but the total should not affect the position by more than a few houses. In several cases work of improvement has been carried out of sufficient extent to houses which were included in the return to the Minister under Section 1 of the Housing (Rent and Repairs) Act, 1954, that they may be no longer considered as premises suitable for demolition. In one case the improvement of premises has so divided a proposed Clearance Area that it can no longer be dealt with under this part of the Housing Act. I personally feel that where the houses are in the main structurally sound this work of improvement should be encouraged, particularly when the premises are isolated individually unfit houses. In addition, of course, several houses have been noted which were not included in the return which are suitable at the moment for demolition. When these premises are dealt with the Council will be informed that they are outside the scope of the original return. In all probability the number of houses to be dealt with will not change materially over the period of 11 years which the Council have decided will be required to deal with the main Housing problem of the district. As previously stated 5 Demolition Orders were served in the period under review. These Orders concerned the following premises: 8 and 10 Lyonsdown Road—This is a pair of semi-detached houses, brick built, with slated roof, situated at the lower end of Lyonsdown Road and let into flats. They consist of a basement, ground floor, 1st, 2nd, and attic floors and were in a very bad condition, mainly extensive dilapidation, dry rot and dampness. Owing to the number of families involved it has taken some time for the occupants to be re-housed. 19 Cat Hill—This house is a detached property situated alongside Pymmes Brook and has been flooded on many occasions. It was very damp and dilapidated. 13 and 15 Victoria Road—This is a pair of small semi-detached houses at the northern end of Victoria Road. They were in a dilapidated condition and very damp. At the beginning of the year there were 6 Demolition Orders and 3 Closing Orders outstanding being: 113, 115, 117 and 119 Lancaster Road, New Barnet Demolition Orders 20 54 Edward Road, New Barnet Demolition Orders 14 Warwick Cottages, New Barnet „ „ 107 Leicester Road, New Barnet Closing Order 9 Warwick Cottages, New Barnet „ „ 8 Lyonsdown Road, Basement Flat, New Barnet „ „ Of these properties, 113, 115, 117 and 119 Lancaster Road, New Barnet, have been demolished by the Council who purchased the site. 8 Lyonsdown Road, Basement Flat, is included in the Demolition Orders on 8 and 10 Lyonsdown Road and will ultimately be demolished. The position at the end of the year was that there were 7 Demolition Orders and 2 Closing Orders operative in the district. Albert Road Clearance Area The Compulsory Purchase Order on this area was confirmed during the year and a start has been made in re-housing the occupants. It is hoped that by the end of 1957 this area will be vacated as the conditions under which the tenants of these properties are living is deteriorating. Margaret Road Clearance Area In June the Medical Officer of Health submitted his official representation to the Housing Committee with regard to this area. The area is comprised of 18 houses numbered 25-59 Margaret Road inclusive on the north side of Margaret Road. The main reasons for the consideration of these properties for a Clearance Area were the general disrepair, defective woodwork and dampness of the houses. The Council accepted the Medical Officer's representation and declared the area to be a Clearance Area. The Council have decided to purchase the land for housing purposes and subsequently a Compulsory Purchase Order was made. This was not confirmed at the end of the year but as there are no objections it will only be a matter of time before the confirmation. FOOD HYGIENE In the year to which this report relates 2,462 visits were made to the various food premises dealing in food in the East Barnet District. These visits show an increase of 304 over 1956. This is due to the additional visits made under the Food Hygiene Regulations of 1955. These Regulations came into force in part in January, 1956, and the remainder in July, 1956. The parts which were delayed were those in which additional equipment or structural alterations were required in order to make premises comply. The procedure which has been adopted with regard to these Regulations in the Department is that following a first inspection a list of requirements and additional equipment needed so that the Regulations may be complied with is forwarded to the occupier of the premises. In 21 the case of multiple firms the local manager is also informed of these requirements. Revisits are made later and if necessary advice is given on how the premises may be made to comply with the Regulations. On the whole the occupiers are endeavouring to observe the Regulations and have installed additional sinks, wash basins and hot water supplies, etc. No statutory action has yet been taken to enforce compliance although there are bound to be the few "bad cases" in which it will be necessary for the Council to use their powers under the Regulations. As stated on my last report although adequate equipment and good planning assists in the maintenance of hygienic food premises, in the end it must rest with the food handlers as to whether or not good hygiene is observed. Milk Supply The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 1936-1949: Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 11 Sterilised 14 The following Supplementary licences under Principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area were also granted: Tuberculin Tested 12 Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 11 96 samples of milk were purchased and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health Public Health Laboratory at Coppetts Wood. No. of Samples Submitted Test applied:— Result of Examination:— (a) Methylene blue, (b) Turbidity (c) Phosphatase. Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Void T.T. Pasteurised 20 (a) and (c) 19 — 1 T.T. Farm Bottled 12 (a) 12 — — Pasteurised 37 (a) and (c) 33 4 — Homogenised Past. 15 (a) and (c) 15 — — Sterilised 12 (b) 12 — — As may be seen from the report of the milk samples one sample was void and four pasteurised milk samples were found to be unsatisfactory. The pasteurised milk samples did not pass the phosphatase test, in other words the milk was not properly pasteurised. As the pasteurising plant in which this milk was treated was not situated in the District the Authority having control of this plant was communicated with. They immediately carried out a full inspection of the premises and it was found that the failure of the samples 22 was due to a small amount of raw milk having been allowed to mix with the pasteurised milk. No further samples not being properly pasteurised have been found. The sample which is shown as void was due to the fact that the shade temperature was too high to allow an examination to be made. In the event of such atmospheric conditions arising the laboratory return reports on the results of examinations as void. Ice Cream Two applications were received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises and equipment being satisfactory the applications were granted. Ninety-six samples of ice cream were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination with the following results: Provisional grade 1 89 2 „„„ 4 „ „ „3 - 4 „ „ „ 3 96 The 3 samples of ice cream shown as Grade 4 were in all cases loose ice cream and the reason in each case was probably dirty servers. The necessity for absolute cleanliness was impressed upon the retailers concerned and further samples taken from the shops in question showed no recurrence of Grade 4 samples. As may be seen from the results the far greater majority of the samples taken were satisfactory and show that on the whole ice cream is carefully handled. The majority of retailers sell wrapped ice cream only and it is interesting to note that in the last two years the only samples which have been returned as Grade 4 have been loose ice cream. In each case the cause for the bad grading was most probably improperly sterilised servers. There are no premises manufacturing ice cream for sale in the District. The ice cream retailers obtain their supplies from large wholesale firms. This ice cream is manufactured to a very high standard and the quality remains constant. Meat and Other Food Inspections The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been carried out as regards all premises on which meat is sold for human consumption. The inspection of food (other than meat) is carried out as necessary. As may be seen from the Table of foods surrendered as unfit during the year a total amount of approximately 16 cwts. of food was condemned. This was disposed of by burying, all meat and meat products being stained first. 23 FOOD AND DRUGS The following Table shows the various types of Food and Drug sampled during the year and the results of analyses: Samples Analysed Samples Unsatisfactory Blackcurrant Juice 1 Bread 1 1 Breakfast Cereal 1 Butter 1 Butter Drops 1 Buttered Toast 1 Camphorated Oil 1 Chewing Gum 1 Codeine Tablets 1 Condensed Milk, Full Cream 1 Condensed Milk, Machine Skimmed 3 Corn Flour 1 Cream 1 Cream, double 1 1 Currants 1 Crystallised Pineapple Chunks 1 1 Dried Milk 1 1 Dried Mixed Fruit 2 1 Dried Peaches 1 Dripping 1 Epsom Salts 1 Flour, Self-Raising 2 Gelatine 1 Glauber Salts 1 Ground Almonds 1 Ground Rice 1 Ice Lollies 4 Jam 1 Lemon Juice 4 1 Lemonade Powder 1 Marzipan 1 Milk 54 1 Milk, Channel Islands or South Devon 43 3 Milk, Hot 1 1 Mint Jelly 1 Orange Squash 1 Pineapple Chunks (Confectionery) 1 Powdered Pectin 1 1 Prunes 1 Raisins 1 Rolls and Butter 2 Salvolatile 1 Sausages, Pork 1 Soup, Cream of Chicken 1 Soup, Cream of Mushroom 2 1 Soup, Cream of Tomato 2 Soup Mix, Clear Chicken 1 1 Tea 2 Tomato Ketchup 1 Tomato Paste, Concentrated 1 Vinegar 4 2 Vitamin Capsules 1 2 166 16 24 Included in the above Table are 90 informal samples which were examined at the office. I would like to comment briefly on the samples found to be unsatisfactory. Bread A small loaf was submitted for analysis following a complaint made by the purchaser alleging that it contained rodent excreta. Examination showed that the foreign matter in the loaf consisted of fragments of earthy matter which was probably due to the dough having been dropped in the bakehouse. There was no evidence of rodent excreta. Currants and Dried Mixed Fruit As a result of a complaint four twelve ounce packets of dried fruit were submitted to the Public Analyst. Two of the packets when examined were found to contain living maggots, together with traces of insect web and insect excreta. Some of the currants had completely disintegrated as a result of the insect attack. When the remaining stock of this commodity in the shop was examined further packets were found to be heavily infested and were condemned as being unfit for food. Legal proceedings were instituted against the shopkeeper who was fined £4 with £6 15s. Od. costs. Crystallised Pineapple Chunks This sample consisted of boiled sweets with an artificial pineapple flavour. The sweets contained no pineapple fruit and were considered to be misdescribed as "crystallised pineapple chunks." Dr. Hamence, the Public Analyst, in his report stated that in his opinion the description "crystallised pineapple chunks" was unsatisfactory as it is firmly established that the term "crystallised pineapple" means pineapple preserved in sugar. Some discretion must be exercised where the description of sweets or sugar confectionery is concerned. If the description of quite a number of boiled sweets which have been on the market for many years is considered critically in the light of modern labelling ideas, a number of them could be regarded as being false and misleading. A sweet merely described as "pineapple chunks" would probably fall within the latter category but in view of established practice no serious objection could be taken. Dried Milk As a result of a complaint from a School Canteen Supervisor a sample of dried milk supplied to the canteen was submitted for analysis. The milk, when reconstituted, was found to contain a number of black specks. Examination of these particles showed that they consisted of small fragments of burnt milk. This scorching must, obviously, have taken place during manufacture and as straining failed to remove all the particles the manufacturers agreed to replace the affected bag. 25 Lemon Juice This sample of lemon juice was packed in a plastic container and was found to have fermented and to be in a turbid condition. It was not considered to be suitable for human consumption and the shop keeper surrendered the remainder of his stock. It is understood that some difficulties had been experienced by the manufacturers in the use of plastic containers for this product and the marketing of this particular brand of lemon juice is now being undertaken by a firm well known in the food trade. Subsequent samples have proved satisfactory. Milk A half pint bottle of milk was examined to identify the nature of some small greenish coloured foreign bodies. These proved to be fragments of leaf tissue and evidence that the bottle had probably been previously used as a vase for flowers. Hot Milk This sample of hot milk which was obtained in a cafe contained 11 per cent, of added water. The milk was heated by means of a steam pipe being placed in the glass. Whilst this is an easy method so far as the shop assistant is concerned it is not satisfactory that a customer who is asked to pay 7d. for a tumbler of "hot milk" containing approximately 6 fluid ounces should receive as much as 11 per cent, added water. Powdered Pectin A sample of powdered pectin was found to contain 340 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. On enquiries being made of the distributors it was found that this particular commodity had been manufactured during the early part of the war and that none had been marketed or sold by the firm since 1942. The multiple firm of grocers selling the product agreed to withdraw their remaining small stock from sale and no further action was taken. Soup—Cream of Mushroom On analysis a sample of soup sold as "Cream of Mushroom" was found to contain only 2.5 per cent. of fat. An examination of the fat showed that it contained no appreciable amount of butter fat. A warning letter was sent to both the vendor and manufacturers. Soup Mix—Clear Chicken The analysis of an attractively packeted Soup Mix proved very interesting. The labelling obviously led the purchaser to believe that the soup cubes contained in the packet would, when prepared, produce a Clear Chicken Soup. Analysis showed that when prepared according to the instructions the resulting soup contained only 26 0.4 per cent. of total protein and that the greater part of the flavouring was due to salt and monosodium glutamate. The product was of foreign origin and considerable correspondence passed between the Council and the importers concerning the labelling which was considered in the circumstances to be misleading. Shortly before the preparation of this report a letter was received stating that alterations to the label were being considered. Vinegar Two samples of vinegar were found, upon analysis, to be nonbrewed condiment. In addition one of the samples was deficient in strength to the extent of 15 per cent. of the minimum quantity of 4 per cent. of acetic acid proper to any kind of vinegar. Both vendors received warning letters. It is rather surprising after the publicity given to this matter in the trade papers that the practice of selling non-brewed condiment as malt vinegar, and at malt vinegar prices, still persists. OTHER INSPECTIONS Pet Shops Four persons are licensed to keep pet shops in the district. Visits are made periodically to the premises and in each case the business has been found to be carried on in a satisfactory manner. The only matter which required stressing was the importance of a supply of water and sand being always available. There is no doubt that pet shops are now very popular. They attract the public, particularly on Saturdays when children are out with their parents, and the danger of fire from a dropped cigarette end, in premises where a considerable amount of straw or hay is used for animal bedding, must always be considered. Home Counties (Music and Dancing) Licensing Act, 1926 Hertfordshire (Music and Dancing) Regulations, 1956 Twenty-four premises were inspected at the request of the Hertfordshire County Council before the issue by that authority of licences for music and dancing. In four cases the attention of the persons making application for the licences were drawn to defects in the sanitary conveniences and in each instance the work required was carried out without the necessity for further action. INFESTATIONS Rodent Control During the year 273 complaints of rats and mice have been received. All complaints have been visited and in addition premises neighbouring the houses from which the original complaints were received have been visited where necessary. In consequence 365 properties have been inspected for rat and mice infestation during the year. 27 Of these properties 307 were found to be infested and were treated for infestations. The number of complaints received is considerably less than the previous year. The infestations have all been of a minor character and treatments have in general been successful. Where difficulty has been experienced re-treatment with variations of poisons and bait has produced satisfactory results. There are a few areas in the district which need constant attention. While treatment apparently removes the infestation these areas become re-infested in a comparatively short time. In some cases the re-infestation is seasonal or is due to some natural feature which attracts rats, but there remain one or two in which there is no obvious cause for re-infestation. The poisons, warfarin, zinc phosphide and arsenic are normally employed. In accordance with the requirements of the Rodent Control Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food two treatments of the sewers were made, both treatments during the year being maintenance treatments. The first was made in March when 46 manholes were baited, being the manholes which showed evidence of infestation at previous treatments together with those in the immediate vicinity. Of the manholes baited, 12 showed "takes" of poison bait. The second maintenance treatment was carried out in November when 23 manholes were baited. As a result of this baiting 9 manholes showed poison "takes". The manholes baited in the second treatment were those which showed evidence of infestation at the previous treatment together with any manholes in the close vicinity which were in direct connection with them. It is apparent that while there are some rats in the sewers the infestation is only slight. Insect Control The number of complaints received regarding infestation by insects continues to increase. All complaints are visited and information and advice is given and where necessary insecticides are supplied free of cost. Wasp nests are destroyed by the Council on payment of a small charge to cover cost of materials and man's time. During the summer months 41 nests were dealt with. 28
