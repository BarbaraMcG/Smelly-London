Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1955. The District is divided into three Wards : Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4,925. The Home population (mid year) as estimated by the Registrar General was 48,870. This was an increase compared with the 1954 figure of 48,200. The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops, but a large number of residents work outside the district, particularly in London. Only a very small number continue to work in agriculture. The product of a penny rate is £1,580.6.3 Rateable Value £378,923 Number of inhabited dwellings 13,158 Number of new dwellings erected 362 VITAL STATISTICS Births Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 759 385 374 Illegitimate 23 8 15 Total 782 393 389 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population— Crude Birth Rate 16.0 (1954 15.76) Comparability Factor 0.99 (1954 0.99) Adjusted Birth Rate 15.84 (1954 15.60) Still Births Total Male Female Legitimate 11 7 4 Illegitimate — — — Total 11 7 4 Rate per 1,000 total births (live and still)—13.87 (1954 15.54) Rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population— 0.22 (1954 0.24) 3 Deaths Total 347 Male 187 Female 160.

I wish to refer here to a report received from Dr. P. E. Baldry the Consultant Physician with regard to the work of the Ashford Chest Clinic during 1954 and 1955, the two years it has been in operation. Dr. Baldry refers to modern chemotherapy with its more effective methods of using certain drugs and to the greatly improved results being achieved. Such strides have been made in the treatment of tuberculosis that he is able to record that for the first time during 1955 there have been empty beds in the Tuberculosis wards at Ashford Hospital. Reference is also made to the prevailing high rate of notification of tuberculosis which Dr. Baldry considers to be mainly due to successful case finding and he mentions particularly the miniature X-Ray examinations. He states that the amount of tuberculosis infectivity in the community is steadily declining. Maternal Mortality No maternal deaths occurred during the year. Persons in Need of Care and Attention. It became necessary for action to be taken under the National Assistance Act. 1948, section 47 (as amended) in respect of an elderly lady who was unable to care for herself. An application was made to the Magistrates Court and an order made for her removal to accommodation provided by the Middlesex County Council under the provisions of the National Assistance Act. 7 Housing Since house building recommenced in 1946 this Authority has built 1,846 dwellings and 556 private dwellings have been erected. In addition there are 150 temporary bungalows. Despite this large programme the demand for houses is not satisfied and there are still many families, mostly young couples, who are sharing accommodation. Due to the restricted amount of building land now available the Council was forced to close its housing list in January 1954. The programme for dealing with unfit houses makes further demands, of course, upon the available supply of accommodation. In this connection every consideration is given to the needs of the people displaced, so that the enforced move causes as little worry as possible. Diphtheria Immunisation Facilities for immunisation against diphtheria are provided by the Middlesex County Council at their clinics or through the local medical practitioners. The Department has co-operated with the Area Medical Officer of the County with regard to the publicity campaigns which have been undertaken. Water Analysis 1. The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District are supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co., and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South West Suburban Water Co. is taken by the Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is derived from the River Thames, purified in the storage reservoirs at Littleton, Staines and Walton, and is filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. A contact period of over an hour is given at the works for the completion of chlorination. The water supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. 2. Samples for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis are taken by the Metropolitan Water Board at all stages of purification at least five times each week. Ninetyeight samples have been taken by the South West Suburban Water Co. In addition four samples were taken by my department. 8 Average Results of Analyses of Metropolitan Water Board Supply.

No action has been required in respect of contamination of the water. All water is chlorinated before distribution and all new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use. 5. With the exception of two or three outlying cottages, all the houses in the area are supplied from the public water mains. Only two houses are supplied by a common standpipe. These two cottages, which are now condemned, are occupied by three people. Food Poisoning. Fourteen unrelated cases of food poisoning have been notified during the year. Investigations were made but the sources of infection were not ascertained. In addition to the above-mentioned cases, two small outbreaks occurred at a factory canteen involving eight and fourteen people, none of whom were actually notified. Investigations were hampered by the paucity of evidence. In the first incident food poisoning organisms (salm typhimurium) were isolated from one case only and in the second outbreak CI. Welchii which was present in nine of the cases was thought to be the causative organism. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355-357 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Conclusion In conclusion I should like to thank the members of the Committee for the support which they have given me during the year and also Mr. Bell and the staff of the department for their able and willing assistance. F. H. WOODS, Medical Officer of Health. 10 CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing—Demolition and Closure Action in accordance with the Council's programme for dealing with unfit houses was continued and figures relating to this action are given below. In July the Council's proposals for dealing with unfit houses were submitted to the Ministry of Housing & Local Government as required by section 1 of the Housing Repairs & Rents Act, 1954. The proposals were provisionally approved by the Minister. It was estimated that there were 374 unfit dwellings to be dealt with by means of Clearance or Demolition Orders. Since 1950 a definite allocation of houses has been made for the rehousing of families from unfit dwellings and as a result the worst houses have already been dealt with. The wisdom of the decision made in 1950 became apparent as, due to various causes, not least of which was the shortage of available building land, the provision of accommodation for persons displaced became more difficult. From 1946 until the end of 1955, 167 houses have been dealt with as follows : — Demolition Orders made 148 Agreements entered into with owners to "close" or repair or Closing Orders made 15 Houses demolished 114 Houses demolished as a result of informal action Persons who haye been displaced 4 443 Action taken during 1955 is as follows : — Housing Act, 1936 No. of Houses No. of Persons displaced Houses reported to Public Health Committee as being unfit 30 — Demolition orders made 20 — Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 11 27 70 Houses closed in pursuance of an undertaking given by the owners under Section 11, and still in force — — Parts of buildings closed (Section 12) 1 5 11 Housing Act, 1949 Houses closed as a result of Closing Orders made under Sections 3 (1) and 3 (2) — — Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953. Houses closed as a result of Closing Orders made under Sections 10 (1) and 11 (2) 1 4 Housing—Repairs Action to secure the execution of repairs continued as far as possible and is summarised below. The standard of unfitness as prescribed in section 9 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, is, in my opinion, a lower standard than that previously defined in the 1936 Housing Act. As a consequence one hesitates to advise the service of notices in respect of houses with comparatively few defects. When one considers more defective houses the question of ' reasonable cost' arises and with building costs at treble or more their pre-war value and rents mostly at pre-war standards, again one hesitates. In many cases action under the Public Health Act provides an answer, but often only a partial answer. Informal Action No. of Houses No. of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local authority 82 Action under Statutory Powers Number of houses reported to Public Health Committee with, a view to service of statutory notices 19 Number of statutory notices served 7 Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices : — No. of Houses (a) by owners 0 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 12 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Section 9, 10, 11 and 16) : — (a) by owners 5 (b) by local authority in default of owners 1 Housing—Improvement Grants No improvement grants were made and in fact there were very few enquiries with regard to grants. The decision not to make grants was adopted previously after careful consideration of the whole position. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954—Disrepair Certificates Nine applications for disrepair certificates were made by tenants following service of notices of increase of rents by their landlords. In each case a certificate was issued. One application for the revocation of a certificate was made and this was granted. Overcrowding Little statutory overcrowding came to the notice of the department. Special consideration was given in the Council's housing points scheme to any applicant who was overcrowded. Moveable Dwellings Public Health control of moveable dwellings in the area is effected by means of Section 345 of the Middlesex County Council Act as amended by the 1950 Act and by byelaws. The consent of the Council is required to the placing or keeping of any moveable dwelling used or intended to be used as the sole or principal means of habitation for more than three months in any year. During the year six applications for consent were received, five were refused and a limited consent given in the other case. In addition action was taken to secure the removal of three other caravans in respect of the use of which no consent had been given. Very little trouble was experienced with the wandering gypsy. Much of the land previously camped upon by these people was no longer available to them. Shops All shops were regularly inspected, the department administering the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. 13 Licences for the keeping of pet shops were granted in two instances. Three shops were licensed to deal in game. The " late day " for the general closing hours of shops in the area is Friday, but shopkeepers remain free to fix their own half day closing subject to the provisions of the Shops Act. Most shops close for half day on Wednesday. Food Premises All types of food premises were inspected regularly and as frequently as possible, special attention being given to catering establishments, premises registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, bakehouses and other places where food is actually prepared. There were some unavoidable breaks in the routine visiting due to staff shortages and this was regretted because it was considered that constant regular inspections were most effective in raising the hygienic standard of food premises. Some occupiers, of course, did not need reminders, they maintained a good standard from their own choice, but unfortunately they were in the minority. Occasionally traders were glad of the moral support which an inspection sometimes gave for dealing with their staffs, because some foodhandlers and shop assistants were not as co-operative in the matter of hygienic practices as they could and should have been. It was hoped that the new Food Hygiene Regulations which were issued just before the close of the year would be instrumental in bringing about a big step forward towards better food handling. Success in this it was realised rests in a large measure with the people who actually handle foodstuffs intended for sale. Food premises in the district consist of the following: — Catering establishments including factory canteens and school kitchens 115 Grocery and provision shops and "general stores" 60 Greengrocers' shops 35 Butchers' shops 25 Bakers' shops 12 Milk shops 8 Fishmongers' shops 15 Sweet and confectionery shops 61 14 Food Preparing Premises There were no new registrations during the year. The register contained the addresses of 31 premises which had been registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows: — Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc 12 Premises used for the cooking of fish 9 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicle, etc., who are not the occupiers of an open shop for the sale of foodstuffs require to be registered with the local authority and the foodstores at which the foodstuffs intended for sale are stored are also required to be registered. Attention was constantly given to traders in foodstuffs elsewhere than at shops, as often trading was commenced without registration and with little regard for the hygiene of food handling. During the year one hawker of foodstuffs was registered. Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from a fixed site in any public street are required to hold a licence* under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944 and issued by the local authority. During the year one renewal licence was granted. Slaughter-Houses There was no increase in slaughtering in the district following the removal of restrictions and in fact two of the licensed slaughter houses were seldom used. No. of slaughter-houses licensed 3 No. of slaughtermen licensed 11 Knackers Yard There was one licensed knackers yard, but its use was limited. New byelaws with regard to knackers yards were adopted by the Council during the year. 15 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Carcases and Offal inspected at slaughter-houses and condemned in whole or in part.

Foodstuffs which are not suitable for such disposal are buried at the Councils refuse tip. Food and Drugs Act, 1938—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district. The Public Control Department carry out the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 operated by the County Council and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of that 17 Department, Mr. J. A. O'Keefe for the following details of action taken in this district:— Samples procured : — Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk, (various) 156 21 Arrowroot 1 — Butter 7 — Brisling in Tomato Sauce 1 — Cakes 7 — Cereal 1 — Cheese 11 2 Cooked Meats 5 — Cornflour 2 — Cream 8 — Condensed Milk 1 — Dressed Crab 1 — Drugs 11 — Flavoured Milk 1 — Fish 9 — Fish Paste 1 — Fruit Juice 1 — Glace Cherries 1 — Ice Cream 3 — Lard 1 — Liver 5 — Meat 1 — Minced Meat 5 — Mint in Vinegar 1 — Pears 1 — Peas 1 — Pickles 2 — Sausages 8 — Self Raising Flour 2 — Sweets 1 — Tomato Sauce 1 — Tomato Chutney 1 Victoria Plums 8 — Vinegar 7 — Wines and Spirits 22 — Totals 295 23 18 Action was taken with regard to the unsatisfactory samples including prosecution in one case and warnings or advice in the others. Regular inspections were made of the one licensed pasteurising plant and 70 samples of pasteurised milk were examined and found to be satisfactory. Sixteen samples of raw milk were obtained within the district and examined for the presence of tubercle bacilli but none was contaminated. Forty-eight inspections of shops were made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1926 but no serious infringements of these Acts or of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953, were discovered. With regard to the Labelling of Food Order, advertisements and the labels of pre-packed foods were scrutinised to detect false or misleading descriptions and corrective action was taken with regard to a number of commodities. Milk (Special Designations), (Raw Milk) and (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 Dealers licences were granted to sell graded milks as follows : — Tuberculin Tested 9 Accredited — Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 19 Supplementary Licences : — Tuberculin Tested 12 Accredited — Pasteurised 11 Sterilised 12 30 samples of graded milks were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. All the samples were satisfactory. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continued to receive attention. There were no registered manufacturers of ice cream in the area. Six samples were procured and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. Four were graded Group I, and two Group II. Two premises were registered, under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for the sale of ice cream. 19 Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was continued. The Council's refuse tip was kept under regular observation and any sign of rat activity dealt with immediately. During the twelve months ended on the 31st March, 1956, the complaints received of infestations numbered 217, and these together with cases discovered by members of the staff involved the inspection of 1,480 premises. Rat infestations were found at 270 premises and mice infestations at 53 premises. Of these 307 treatments were undertaken by the department, the remaining 16 being carried out by the occupiers. When treatments are carried out by this department on behalf of occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings is made in the case of private dwellings, and the full cost of the treatment is recovered in the case of business premises. Where the occupiers elect to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision is given to ensure that the treatment is effective. Arrangements were continued with the Middlesex County Council for this department to carry out any rodent control works necessary on the portions of the Duke of Northumberland's River and the River Crane in the area. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are three premises registered under this Act, where filling materials are used. Four inspections were made. Disinfestation Six premises were found to be infested with bed bugs and were disinfested : Council houses infested 3 Other houses infested 3 Disinfestation with contact insecticides incorporating D D T., was carried out by the department. 20 It was not found necessary to disinfest the furniture, etc., of prospective Council house tenants before removal to the Council's houses. Disinfestation for the eradication of the following vermin was carried out at the numbers of premises stated : — Cockroaches 8, fleas 2, carpet beetles 2, silver fish 1, midges 1. In addition 12 wasps' nests were destroyed.

Of an establishment of three additional sanitary inspectors, two of the posts were vacant for several months. In a small department such vacancies inevitably break the continuity of some of the work to its detriment, but I am glad to record that at the end of the year there was a full establishment. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee and the Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Woods, for the consideration shown to me, and the members of the staff for their support in carrying out the work of the deparment. FRANCIS V. BELL, Chief Sanitary Inspector.
