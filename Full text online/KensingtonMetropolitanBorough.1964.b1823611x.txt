Acknowledged 6/5/66 AC 4348 Public Health KEN 73 The Royal Borough of Kensington ' ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Health of the Borough FOR THE YEAR 1964 BY J. H. WEIR M.D.. B.S.. B.Hy.. D P.H MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH Presented to the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (l) of Article 8 of the London Authorities (Health and Welfare Services) Order, 1964. THE ROYAL BOROUGH OP KENSINGTON Telephone: WEStern 7211 Health and Welfare Department, 25A Kensington Square, London, W.8. October, 1965 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting the Annual Report on the state of the public health in Kensington for 1964, This is the last time such a report will be prepared and presented, as the former Royal Borough of Kensington has been absorbed into the Greater London Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Article 8 of the London Authorities (Health and Welfare Services) Order, 1964, requires me to submit this report to the present Council to whom, under Article 16 of the London Authorities (Property, etc.) Order, 196kf the property and liabilities of the former Kensington Council have been referred. As the Council will appreciate, the compilation and preparation of this report has been delayed, as the work in establishing the Health and Welfare organisation of the new Borough Council has been given first priority. Nothing has been lost by this delay because the public health in Kensington during the year under review was maintained at a satisfactory standard and, indeed, the major portion of this report deals with work and services reported to the former Kensington Council from time to time during 1964. The Minister of Health has requested (Circular 1/65) that the report should be generally in the same form as has been the case for some years past. Population. The population of the borough as finally ascertained by the Census in 1961 was 171,272. For the purpose of this report, the population for 1964 has been estimated by the Registrar-General to be 172,990. The estimated population figure for the previous year was 172,170. Birth Rate. The number of live births per 1,000 population of the borough was 18.7 in 1964 which compares with the figure of 19.1 for the previous year. Death Rate. The number of deaths per 1,000 population in 1964 was 8.62, which is the lowest figure ever recorded in Kensington. Area Comparability Factors for Birth and Death Rates. Comparisons or crude birth and death rates between local areas are not strictly valid since these rates take no account of the varying composition of the populations of the different areas by sex and age. In order to compare Kensington birth and death rates with England and Wales as a whole, the Registrar-General has, in the case of death rates since 1934 and in the case of birth rates since 1949, supplied area comparability factors (A.C.Fs.). 2 The Registrar-General has supplied, for use in Kensington in 1964, the figures 0.58 for births and 1.18 for deaths. The crude birth and death rates for the borough should be multiplied by the appropriate factor, and when so adjusted the results are comparable with the crude rates for England and Wales or with the corresponding adjusted rates for any other area. The following table gives the adjusted Kensington birth and death rates compared with the provisional rates for London and for England and Wales for the year 1964:- Kensington adjusted London England and Wales No~ of births per 1,000 population 10.8 17.2 18.5 No., of deaths per 1,000 population 10.2 11.7 11.3 Infant Death Rate. This rate for 1964 was 24.4, a decrease compared with the rate for the previous year of 25.2. The provisional rate for the County of London was 21.3 and for England and Wales was 19.9. The following table shows the rates for the last five years:- Year Kensington London Ehgland and Wales 1964 24.4 21.3 19.9 1963 25.2 21.8 21.1 1962 22.4 21.1 21.7 1961 20.9 21.5 21.4 1960 20.8 21.6 21.8 Variations in the infant mortality rate are contributed to partly by perinatal mortality, i.e., stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life, prematurity (see table below) and the statistical difficulties arising from the small numbers involved. Just over two deaths suffice to increase the rate by one. Number of deaths of babies under one week of age Year Age in days at death Total No. of deaths due to prematurity 1 or under 2 3 4 5 6 1960 27 4 - 4 - 2 37 22 1961 30 6 - 3 - 1 40 21 1962 36 4 1 - 1 4 46 19 1963 36 4 1 - - 1 42 20 1964 41 2 3 2 1 - 49 15 1963 1964 Neo-natal mortality rate (i.e., deaths of infants under 4 weeks per 1,000 total live births) 16.11 16.66 Early neo-natal mortality rate (i.e., deaths of infants under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) 13.07 15.12 Perinatal mortality rate (i.e., stillbirths and deaths of infants under 1 week per 1,000 total live and stillbirths) 26.39 29.79 3 Maternal Death Rate. Three deaths of mothers due to child-birth were recorded in 1964, giving a maternal death rate per 1,000 live and stillbirths of 0.91. (The provisional maternal mortality rate for the County of London was 0.36 and for England and Wales the figure was 0.25). Infectious Diseases. There was no serious outbreak of infectious disease in the borough during 1964. The total number of notifications received was 782 in comparison with 1,394 in 1963. The difference is almost entirely due to the decrease in the number of cases of measles notified in 1964 compared with the previous year. Tuberculosis. The death rate from all forms of tuberculosis per 100,000 population was 4.0; last year's figure being 7.0. The 1964 Kensington death rate compares with the rate (provisional) of 5.24 for England and Vales. Lung Disease. Kensington's death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis per 100,000 population in 1964 showed a marked decrease compared with the previous year, but the death rate for cancer of the lung showed an increase. Comparative figures for England and Wales showed a decrease in the rate in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis, and a continuing increase in the death rate for lung cancer. The following table shows the trend in these diseases for the past ten years Year England and Wales Kensington Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the Lung Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the Lung Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate 1955 5,838 13.1 17,271 38.9 12 7.1 73 43.1 1956 4,851 10.9 18,185 40.7 19 11.2 73 43.2 1957 4,250 9.5 19,118 42.6 13 7.7 90 53.6 1958 4,000 8.9 19,809 43.9 10 6.0 79 47.7 1959 3,475 7.7 21,063 46.4 9 5.4 75 45.0 I960 3,094 6.8 21,992 48.1 11 6.6 94 56.0 1961 3,002 6.5 22,810 49.4 16 9.45 71 42.0 1962 2,774 5.9 23,779 51.0 11 6.4 75 43.6 1963 2,609 5.6 24,434 51.9 11 6.4 84 48.8 1964 2,209 4.6 25,371 53.5 6 3.4 86 49.7 (Death rates quoted above are per 100,000 population) VITAL STATISTICS The table set out on pages 4 and 5 gives the important vital statistics for 1964, together with comparative figures for the previous seven years. 4 5 SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS FOR KENSINGTON DESCRIPTION 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 POPULATION Population (estimated) 172,990 172,170 172,020 169,080 167,240 166,500 165,700 167,900 Density of population per acre 75.5 75 75 74 73 73 72 73 LIVE BIRTHS Total births 3,240 3,290 3,395 3,295 3,077 3,026 2,990 2,765 Legitimate births 2,572 2,650 2,721 2,697 2,560 2,546 2,549 2,404 Illegitimate births 668 640 674 598 517 480 441 361 Birth rate per 1,000 population 18.7 19.1 19.7 19.5 18.4 18.1 18.0 16.5 STILL BIRTHS - Total still births 49 45 61 55 44 55 49 50 Legitimate still births 31 27 42 40 31 44 37 42 Illegitimate still births 18 18 19 15 13 11 12 8 Still birth rate per 1,000 population 14.9 13.5 17.7 16.4 14.1 17.8 16.1 17.8 DEATHS Total deaths 1,492 1,757 1,756 1,731 1,657 1,654 1,659 1,750 Death rate per 1,000 population 8.62 10.20 10.21 10.24 9.91 9.93 10.01 10.4 DEATHS OP INFANTS UNDER 12 MONTHS OP AGE Total infant deaths 79 83 76 69 64 75 68 78 Legitimate deaths 60 69 60 56 51 63 58 58 Illegitimate deaths 19 14 16 13 13 12 10 20 Infant death rate per 1,000 births 24.4 25.2 22.4 20.9 20.8 24.8 22.7 28.2 Death rate of legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate births 23.5 26.0 22.0 20.8 19.9 24.7 22.8 24.1 Death rate of illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate births 28.4 21.9 23.7 21.7 25.1 25.0 22.7 55.4 MATERNAL DEATHS Deaths of mothers as a result of pregnancy or childbirth 3 3 1 2 4 1 1 1 Death rate of mothers per 1,000 live and still births 0.91 0.90 0.29 0.60 1.28 0.32 0.33 0.36 TUBERCULOSIS Death rate from all forms per 1,000 population 4.0 7.0 7.0 10.05 8.4 6.0 6.6 10.1 Death rate from respiratory tuberculosis per 100,000 population 3.4 6.4 6.4 9.45 6.6 5.4 6.0 7.7 Death rate from nonrespiratory tuberculosis per 100,000 population 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 1.8 0.6 0.6 2.4 - 7 - CAUSES OF DEATH AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE IN 1964 Cause of death All Ages Under 1 yr. 1 yr. and under 5 5 yrs. and under 45 45 yrs. and under 65 65 yrs. and over Respiratory tuberculosis 6 _ _ 1 1 4 Other forms of tuberculosis 1 - - - 1 - Syphilis 1 - - - 1 - Diphtheria - - - - - - Whooping Cough - - - - - - Meningococcal infections 1 1 - - - - Acute poliomyelitis - - - - - - Measles 1 - 1 - - - Other infective diseases, etc. _ - - _ _ _ Cancer (all forms) 335 - - 16 125 194 Leukaemia, aleukaemia 14 - - 3 7 4 Diabetes 9 - - 1 2 6 Vascular lesions of nervous system 167 - - 4 23 140 Coronary disease, angina 279 - - 6 74 199 Hypertension with heart disease 18 - - - 2 16 Other heart disease 99 - - 9 l4 76 Other diseases of circulatory system 87 _ - 1 12 74 Influenza 1 - - - - 1 Pneumonia 69 I4 - - 7 48 Bronchitis 81 1 - 2 27 51 Other respiratory diseases 17 - - - 2 15 Ulcers of the stomach 15 - - - 2 13 Gastritis, enteritis and diarrhoea 14 1 - 1 1 11 Nephritis and nephrosis 6 - - 1 - 5 Hyperplasia of prostate 6 - - - - 6 Pregnancy, childbirth and abortion 3 - - 3 - _ Congenital malformations 19 18 - 1 - - All other diseases 138 4l - 12 25 60 Motor vehicle accidents 21 1 1 11 1 7 All other accidents 42 2 2 10 11 17 Suicide 39 - - 22 11 6 Homicide and operations of war 3 - - 3 - - TOTALS 1,492 79 4 107 349 953 8 GENERAL PROVISION OP HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA The Royal Borough of Kensington as constituted under the London Government Act, 1899, covers an area of 2,291 acres, and is conterminous with the civil parish and registration district of the same name. The line of demarcation formed by Holland Park Avenue, Notting Hill Gate and the Bayswater Road, divides the borough into approximately equal halves known as North and South Kensington respectively. The borough is further sub-divided into nine wards. North Kensington includes the wards of St. Charles, Golborne, Norland and Pembridge, whilst South Kensington is made up of the five wards Holland, Earl's Court, Queen's Gate, Redcliffe and Brompton. The population of the borough as ascertained at the census in 1961 was 171,272 persons. For the purpose of this report the population for 1964 has been estimated by the Registrar-General to be 172,990. Population: Census 1901 176,628 ,, 1911 172,317 ,, 1921 175,686 ,, 1931 180,677 ,, 1951 168,160 ,, 1961 171,272 1964 estimated 172,990 The following table gives the number of population in the nine wards of the borough as ascertained in the 1961 Census:- Ward Population St. Charles 25,543 Go1borne 14,522 Norland 16,893 Pembridge 20,153 Holland 20,930 Earl's Court 21,289 Queen's Gate 14,903 Redcliffe 23,806 Brompton 13.233 Total 171,272 Area (statute acres) 2,291.1 Roads: Mileage maintained by Council 94.37 Assessments: Number of assessments at 1st April, 1964 52,889 Rateable Value: 1st April, 1964 £18,470,368 Product of Id. rate (net): 1st April, 1964 £72,500 9 THE GENERAL DRAINAGE AND SEWER SYSTEM The drainage system in the Metropolitan Boroughs is a combined one whereby surface water and foul water both enter the same sewers. In most cases houses are connected direct to borough council sewers, and these in turn discharge into the London County Council main sewers. In a few cases, where local sewers do not exist, house connections are taken direct into the main sewers. Flooding On the evening of 21st July, 1964, at 5.30 p.m. there was a severe rain storm and following notifications of flooding in Kensington an immediate survey of the area was made. The North Kensington branch library and the Lancaster Road conveniences were flooded and a number of basements in the area of Camelford Road, Talbot Grove, St. Marks Road, Cornwall Crescent, Blenheim Crescent, Lancaster Road and Elgin Crescent. A gully machine was brought into operation but, apart from the Lancaster Road conveniences, it was found that the water had generally subsided. On 22nd July, 1964, two barrier loader teams commenced calling at each of the houses reported as being affected and issued a notice from the Public Health Department, together with disinfectant. Rugs, carpets and other soft furnishing, after labelling, were taken away to the public baths for drying. By the end of the day, calls had been made on all known cases of flooding, but during the next two days other messages were received from occupiers of premises where items needed to be dried or articles of furniture disposed of and these were dealt with as soon as they were received. On 24th July, 1964 it was possible to start returning small items that had been dried and a special gang was employed throughout Saturday, 25th July, in returning the large items of carpets and mattresses and the work concluded. In all, calls were made at about 200 premises and 221 items were taken away for drying and 285 articles taken away for disposal. The Council placed on record their appreciation of the work carried out by the staff in this matter. The records from 1928 show that, under certain heavy storm conditions, about 1,100 basements have been at different times subject to flooding in Kensington. It is to eliminate this surcharge in North Kensington that relief sewers are now being provided by both this Council and the London County Council. No relief sewer of this nature has so far been proposed for South Kensington. WATER SUPPLY The water supply in Kensington is almost entirely provided by the Metropolitan Water Board, but there are two premises which obtain water from artesian and deep wells. Samples of water were taken both by the Council and the owners for bacteriological and chemical examination. Results showed that the waters were suitable for drinking and other domestic purposes. Fluoridation of Water Supplies The Minister of Health announced in the House of Commons that he would approve local authority schemes to add fluoride to the water 10 supplies. The Council decided that they were in favour of the Metropolitan Water Board being asked to introduce fluoridation of water at an early date. All other constituent Councils of the Standing Joint Committee indicated their support, and the Metropolitan Water Board were informed accordingly. So far no action has been taken by the Water Board to introduce the fluoridation of water in London. BACTERIOLOGICAL AND ANALYTICAL WORK The following is a summary of the work performed during 1964:- Nature of specimen or sample Number examined Nose and throat swabs 118 Faeces and rectal swabs 663 Milk (bacteriological) 38 Water (drinking) 18 Water (swimming baths) 12 Ice Cream 21 Miscellaneous 82 Medicinal Baths (Personal Cleansing Station) The following table shows the work carried out during 1964s- Description Scabies Vermin Persons Cleansings Persons Cleansings Adults Kensington 52 90 98 102 Other boroughs 22 34 15 16 School children Kensington 23 45 124 128 Other boroughs 9 20 105 109 Children under 5 Kensington 10 16 14 17 Other boroughs 9 14 1 1 TOTALS 125 219 357 373 In addition to the cleansing of persons referred to above, articles of personal clothing disinfested at the Medicinal Baths during the year numbered 465. Disinfection and Disinfestation A summary of the routine work carried out in 1964 by the disinfecting staff is shown in the following table:- Houses disinfected after infectious disease 107 (183 rooms) Houses disinfested after vermin 335 (768 rooms) Total weight of bedding, etc., dealt with:- Tons cwts. qtrs. lbs. 6 4 2 19 11 It is the practice of certain foreign countries to prohibit the import of parcels of clothing, unless accompanied with a certificate that the articles have been disinfected. The Council afford facilities to persons desirous of sending clothing abroad, but make a charge of 2/6d. for each certificate provided. During the year, 140 parcels of clothing were disinfected and the income amounted to £17.10s.0d. The following table indicates the destination of these parcelss- No. of parcels Bulgaria 4 Czechoslovakia 11 East Germany 33 Eire 4 Italy 1 Spain 87 TOTAL 140 Some other countries allow the import of clothing if accompanied by a certificate stating that no case of infectious disease has occurred at the sender's address within twenty-one days prior to mailing. During the year, 5 such certificates were issued. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, imposes a duty on occupiers of premises to notify the Council of rodent infestation, and the Council are required to ensure that the borough is, as far as practicable, kept free from rats and mice. The Council deal with rat and mice infestation in dwelling houses without cost to the occupiers, but expenditure incurred in treating infestations on commercial and industrial premises is recovered from the owners. The Council are required to submit reports on (i) the extent of infestation, (ii) special circumstances to which any undue presence of rats and mice might be attributed, and (iii) the nature and extent of co-operative working with contiguous local authorities. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food requested a report for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1964, in the following form:- Prevalence of Rats and Mice Type of Property Total Local Authority Dwelling Houses All other (including Business & Industrial) I. Number of properties in Authority's district 31 42,006 11,678 53,715 II.

Total treatments carried out - including re-treatments 11 584 54 649 Destruction of rats in Council's sewers Destruction of rats in sewers has been carried out on a systematic basis of continuous baiting of the sewers using a new acute poison, fluoracetamide. Baits are laid at access points throughout the sewers, of which there are ninety-three miles in the borough. These points comprise side entrances connected by galleries to the sewers and ventilating shafts immediately over the sewers. There are over 1,600 of these baiting points, but it is never possible to bait all the points at one treatment owing to road repairs and the presence of parked vehicles. The last treatment included the laying of non-poison test bait. Observations were made to ascertain the number of points where there was still evidence of a rat infestation, however small. The results which have been obtained show a remarkable decrease in the rat population of the sewers. 13 In addition, the Council's sewermen and contractors' staff engaged on the repair of sewers have commented on the decrease in the number of rats seen in the sewers. There has also been a marked decrease in the number of complaints of rats received in the department from householders. The results which have been obtained are highly encouraging and the Council have decided to continue with this method of treating the sewers. The rodent staff deal with infestations from pests other than rats and mice, and the following is a summary of all action taken during the year Premises inspected following complaints 693 Premises where rats were found 67 Premises where mice were found 550 Premises where other vermin were found 115 Number of visits made 2,793 Number of successful treatments 730 Cases in which advice only was given 34 Borough Council properties (excluding dwelling houses) dealt with 12 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT. 1933 At the end of the year the number of sellers of Part II Poisons (other than registered pharmacists) on the list maintained by the Council was 115. Of this number 8 were new registrations during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 This Act regulates the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Subject to certain exceptions, the Act makes it unlawful to use prescribed filling materials except on premises registered by a local authority. The local authority are required, on the application of the occupier of premises, to register the premises on payment of a registration fee of One Pound. At the end of the year there were 19 registered premises in the borough. If on registered premises there are unclean filling materials, the occupier shall be guilty of an offence. It is also an offence to sell or offer for sale any article which is upholstered with unclean filling materials (second-hand articles are excepted). Inspections of the registered premises were made during the year and 6 samples of rag flock and other fillings were taken for analysis. The results were all satisfactory. Description No. of samples Algerian Fibre 1 Cotton Felt 2 Hair 1 Woollen Felt 1 Rag Flock 1 The Act further provides that no rag flock shall be delivered to registered premises except from premises licensed for manufacturing rag flock or used as a store for rag flock. A local authority on receiving 14 from the occupier of premises an application for the grant or renewal of an annual licence authorising him to manufacture rag flock or to use his premises as a rag flock store, may grant or renew the licence on payment of a fee of One Pound. No licences have been issued in Kensington. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act requires that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence issued by the Council and in compliance with any conditions specified in the licence. During the year, 9 premises were licensed under the Act. The general conditions for pet shops approved by the Council are those recommended for their constituent councils by the Metropolitan Boroughs1 Standing Joint Committee. ANIMAL BOARDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT. 1963 This Act, which came into operation on 1st January, 1964, regulates the keeping of boarding establishments for animals - defined as any dog or cat, and provides that no person shall keep a boarding establishment for animals except under the authority of a licence granted by the Council. There are no animal boarding establishments in the borough at the present time. HEALTH EDUCATION Health education is an important activity and forms an integral part of the National Health Service. For many years, the Council have made an annual grant to the Central Council for Health Education, which is the body recognised by the Minister of Health as the medium through which health education material is distributed throughout England and Vales. For the year 1964/65 the Council made a grant of £23.0s.0d. Posters, leaflets and other material dealing with a variety of health topics for display and distribution were obtained from the Central Council. After this campaign, posters, leaflets and bookmarks continued to be distributed during the remainder of the year as part of normal health education work. HOME SAFETY The majority of home accidents, when investigated, show clearly that human ignorance and carelessness were basic causes. The prevention of home accidents depends on individuals having the necessary knowledge to ensure their personal and domestic safety. The Home Safety Act, 1961, empowers the Council to arrange for the dissemination of information and advice relating to the prevention of accidents in the home, and activities under this heading are combined with the work of health education. Accidents in the home are not required to be notified in the same way as accidents in factories, and therefore information regarding home accidents is incomplete. The London County Council, as the ambulance authority, have been keeping records of home accident cases (both fatal and non-fatal) removed to hospital by them. The Medical Officer for the County Council has kindly supplied me with the following figures for 1964. It has not been possible to give details of cases by cause in age and sex groups. The figures relate to Health Division 1, which comprises Kensington, Chelsea, Fulham and Hammersmith. 15 Cause of Accident Division 1 London County Fall: On stairs 122 824 From ladder 14 98 From chair 14 146 Outside 28 198 In garden 11 175 In bath 1 21 From one level to another 41 341 On same level 59 470 Unspecified 563 4,509 Hit by object 23 218 Cooking stove 21 170 Teapots 6 59 Other boiling water 26 199 Electric shock 4 49 Poisoning 58 473 Gassing 22 185 Knife-like wounds 44 373 Fires 24 221 Windows 5 23 Suffocation 4 27 Not specified 49 412 Totals 1,139 9,191 CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. 1961 This Act empowers the Secretary of State to make Regulations imposing, in respect of any prescribed class of goods, requirements which are expedient to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury. Fireguards The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations, 1953» continue to operate and make it an offence to sell any gas or electric fire, or oil heater, suitable for use in residential premises, unless it is fitted with an adequate guard. Generally speaking, traders do not commit offences under these Regulations, but it is necessary to keep a carefulwatch on the sale of second-hand fires from stalls in public markets. Oil Heaters The Oil Heaters Regulations, 1962, prescribe certain standards of construction, design and performance with which all unflued domestic oil heaters manufactured after 1st June, 1962, must comply, and make it an offence for any person to sell, or let on hire, or hire purchase, or have in his possession for sale, any such oil heater or component part of an oil heater not complying with the Regulations. As the Oil Heater Regulations, 1962, apply only to heaters manufactured since 1st June, 1962, the Council have asked the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to consider making representations to amend the Regulations so that they apply to all oil heaters irrespective of the date of manufacture. Concern has been expressed over the growing practice, particularly in the northern part of the borough, of heating rooms in tenement houses by oil heaters, and the increased danger from fire which results from this practice. The oilheater has rapidly gained in popularity over the past few years and is in considerable use by the large coloured population in North 16 Kensington. It provides a rapid means of intensive heat at a price lower than either gas or electricity; there is no work or expense involved in installation; comparable heating from an efficient oil heater is obtained at approximately half the cost of an electric fire. Second-hand heaters can be bought very cheaply and the fuel which is used, namely, paraffin, is readily available and is usually delivered direct to the home by the distributors. The fuel is available in small quantities and, if necessary, a supply can easily be purchased each day; thus, for the cost of one gallon of fuel at 2/3d., a room can be heated effectively for, say, sixteen hours per day. There is a further point that no difficulties in connection with gas and electricity meters are encountered. There are grave risks of fire from oil heaters, particularly those manufactured before June, 1962. The fuel itself is highly inflammable and can be stored in circumstances giving rise to danger. The filling, if undertaken whilst the heater is alight, can also cause accidents. Even the modified heaters which have been manufactured since 1st June, 1962, can be knocked over and can also cause a fire if moved whilst alight. Since 1954, the Council have arranged, or participated in, a number of campaigns emphasising the need for home safety precautions, particularly when dealing with oil heaters. Various types of posters relating to oil heater safety have been obtained and have been displayed on posterboards about the borough; and leaflets have been made available to the public at the public libraries and to those calling at the Public Health Department. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Smoke Control Areas. Section 11 to 15 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, relate to the functions of the Council to declare smoke control areas, in which the emission of smoke from the chimney of any building (not exempted under the Order) would be an offence. The procedure for establishing a smoke control area has been prescribed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, who has stated that now considerable experience has been gained, there is no longer a need for provisional proposals to be submitted. In order to take full account of the local supply situation in preparing future Smoke Control Orders, the Council must consult representatives of the producers and distributors to determine the availability of the various fuels. The results of these consultations must be reported to the Minister when the Order is submitted for confirmation. The Housing Act, 1964 (Section 95) amended the Clean Air Act, 1956, to provide (i) that grant be payable towards the conversion of open grates in dwellings constructed or produced by conversion between 1956 and 1964 which previously had been excluded from grant. Most of these had been fitted with open grates capable of burning smokeless fuel; (ii) a wider discretion as to the expenditure to be taken into account for grant purposes and to provide that grant may be withheld for appliances which would strain available fuel resources; (iii) for grant to be allowed on the provision of ignition even if no other works are involved; (iv) for local authorities to be empowered to pay grant retrospectively where expenditure is incurred without their approval, between the date of confirmation and date of operation of the Order. 17 The main effect of this new policy will be to increase the cost and difficulty of creating Smoke Control Areas. The installation of appliances which are now to be regarded as "reasonably necessary", i.e., openable stoves, under-floor-draught open fires, fixed gas fires, electric storage heaters and fixed oil heaters, will have the effect of substantially increasing the cost of any future areas. This is based on the assumption that many of the existing coal users may wish to continue to use solid fuel in openable stoves. So far as electric block storage heaters (whose use is advocated) are concerned, the cost of installation of two of these is £54 to provide the same heat as an open grate, burning gas coke, costing £7. For the foreseeable future, it will therefore remain essential that owners and occupiers in smoke control areas should, for grant purposes, continue to have freedom of choice between appliances using solid fuel, gas, off-peak electricity and oil. In particular, it will remain essential that, in smoke control areas where designation by the local authority of open grates under Section 95(2) of the Housing Act, 1964, is under current arrangements not required, owners and occupiers should continue to have the freedom of choice between solid fuel appliances capable of burning only open grate fuels and appliances capable of burning other solid fuels, as well as appliances using gas, off-peak electricity and oil. The following is the programme of Smoke Control Areas adopted by the Council with the object of securing that the whole of Kensington is controlled by 1970. The map of the borough following page 17 indicates the various areas. Smoke Control Area Boundaries Detailed Survey and Order Made Order operative Holland Ward (No. 1) N. Holland Park Avenue S.

The Council considered it unreasonable for owners or occupiers of these premises to be required to carry out adaptations to fireplaces and to receive grants in respect of this expenditure. The properties involved were as follows:- 15 - 31 (odd) Grenfell Road 195 - 215 (odd) and 219 - 231 (odd) Lancaster Road 12 - 54 (even) and 60 - 82 (even) Norland Road 13 - 19 (odd) Penzance Place 1 - 12 (consecutive) Penzance Street 59 - 71 (odd) Princedale Road 37 - 46 (consecutive) Royal Crescent Mews 36, 37 and 38 Treadgold Street The Council decided to ask the Minister of Housing and Local Government to make an Order suspending or relaxing the operation of the Norland Ward (No. 2) Smoke Control Area in relation to these properties. Luring the year, the Council decided to make an Order in respect of the Earl's Court and Queen's Gate Smoke Control Area. This area is that part of the Earl's Court and Queen's Gate Wards bounded on the north by the middle of Kensington High Street and Kensington Road, on the east by the middle of Palace Gate and Gloucester Road, on the south by the middle of West Cromwell Road and Cromwell Road, and on the west by the borough boundary. It has an area of about 236 acres. The detailed survey showed that the total cost of adaptations will be about £31,735 of which, after deducting Exchequer grant, and the cost for which private owners will be responsible, the Council will be liable for £9,718. 20 The date of operation should be 1st October, 1965. Section 11(3) of the Act empowers the Council to exempt from the provisions of a Smoke Control Order any buildings upon such conditions as maybe specified. There are three premises in this area using bituminous coal in under-feed stoker fireplaces. It will be necessary to exempt these plants, subject to certain conditions, and provision for this was made in the Order. The Minister has asked local authorities to exempt from Smoke Control Orders buildings, or separately occupied parts of buildings, not supplied with town gas, subject to the condition that the exemption would have effect only where authorised fuels or kindling sticks and paper were used. Provision for this was also made in the Order. Pinal costs in respect of completed Smoke Control Areas The following table shows the final figures in respect of the conversion of fireplaces (except in Council property) in dwelling houses and other buildings in Smoke Control Areas completed by the end of the years:- Area No. of dwellings where fireplace conversions were carried out Total amount of grants paid to applicants Total amount of Exchequer contribution Total cost of statutory grants made by Council in respect of private dwellings Total amount of discretionary grants paid by Council under Section 15 Holland Ward (No. l) 135 £1564.1.9. £893.14.0. £670.7.9. £100.3.6.

Section 3 requires that new furnaces, not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a specified capacity, shall be so far as is practicable, smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for approval before the work of installation takes place. Daring 1964, 16 notifications were received, and no application for approval of plans, etc., was submitted. 21 Smoke emissions. The Sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956, which relate to industrial smoke came into force on 1st June, 1958. Up to that date emissions of industrial smoke were dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions mainly affecting the Council are contained in Section 1, which prohibits the emission of dark smoke (except for certain periods laid down by regulation) and Section 16 which deals with smoke nuisances. During the year, 36 complaints of smoke nuisance were received and 14 formal smoke observations were carried out. Remedial measures in all cases were secured without further proceedings. Routine measurement of atmospheric pollution. The two stations used by the Council for measuring atmospheric pollution by means of deposit gauges were discontinued as from 1st January, 1963. The three smoke measuring stations set up at the following premises have, however, continued to operates- (1) Public Health Department, Hornton Street, W.8. (2) Public Library, Ladbroke Grove, W.10. (3) L„C.C0 Child Welfare Centre, Redcliffe Street, S.W.10. The equipment at the Public Health Department consists of a smoke filter and a hydrogen peroxide bubbling apparatus. The smoke filter measures the daily concentration of smoke suspended in the atmosphere, and the hydrogen peroxide bubbler extracts the sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere. Readings are taken each day. The equipment at the Public Library and the Welfare Centre consists of smoke filters only. Measurements axe taken three times a week. With the use of a Reflectometer, daily and monthly averages are calculated from the results. The work undertaken in Kensington is a small part of that taking place throughout the country, and all results are forwarded to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for correlation with results obtained in all other districts. Enission of smoke in the London area has decreased by about sixty per cent in the last ten years, according to estimates by Warren Spring Laboratory, DSIR.* This is considered to be due mainly to the decrease in domestic smoke pollution. On the other hand, increasing use of fuel oil by industry and of coal and fuel oil by power stations has brought an estimated increase of 32 per cent in sulphur dioxide emissions. Estimates for the whole country are 35 per cent less smoke emission and 23 per cent more sulphur dioxide in the last ten years. *Warren Spring Laboratory Annual Report 1963 NOISE ABATEMENT ACT. 1960 This Act came into operation on 27th November, 1960. Under Section 1 any noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law is deemed to be a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. 22 In London, Section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937, has for many years given Metropolitan Borough Councils power to deal with noise as a nuisance under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, where a person made or caused to be made or continued an excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which was injurious or dangerous to health. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, amended this Section to conform with the new meaning of noise nuisance. Local authorities are now able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance (not necessarily injurious or dangerous to health) by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance, and, if the notice is not complied with, it can be enforced by proceedings in a Magistrates' Court. Apart from action by a local authority, any three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make complaint direct to a Magistrate. Complaints are received in the department from time to time regarding noise nuisances, mainly arising as a result of industrial work. Remedies are generally secured without recourse to legal action, but in one case legal proceedings were instituted against the occupier of a factory causing a noise nuisance in operating their works. It should be noted that, in the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business, it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practicable means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9.00 p.m. and 8.00 a.m., except in the special circumstances defined in sub-section 2 of the section, and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment, with the exception that between noon and 7.00 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are on sale; the loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. One successful prosecution was undertaken during the year, and the offender was fined £5.0s.0d. and £1.1s.0d. costs awarded to the Council. PUBLIC BATHS The Minister of Health (Circular 1/60) has requested that reference should be made to any public swimming baths in the borough. The Council have provided indoor swimming pools at the Public Baths situated in North Kensington at the junction of Lancaster Road and Silchester Road. The original building was constructed about seventy years ago and no major structural alterations have since taken place. There were four swimming pools, two of which have now been discontinued. The swimming pools now available are as follows:- (1) The large mixed swimming pool. (2) The small mixed swimming pool. The large pool has an area of approximately 4,500 square feet and the smaller one is one-third of this area. Both pools are available for swimming in the summer months, midApril to mid-October, but during the winter months only the large pool will be available to the public. 23 The water used for swimming is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board's supply at the commencement of the bathing season, and throughout the season it is treated by a continuous filtration system. The whole of the equipment is designed to comply with the latest recommendations of the Ministry of Health for indoor swimming pools. Samples of water in the pools are taken from time to time, and during 1964 the results obtained were well within the bacteriological standards recommended by the Ministry of Health. The residual chlorine similarly was maintained within the concentration advocated. PUBLIC MORTUARY Since 1958, the Council have had an arrangement with the Hammersmith Borough Council that all Kensington cases should be accommodated in the Hammersmith mortuary at 77 Fulham Palace Road, W.6. The agreement provides that an annual payment of £500 shall be made for this service. Details regarding the number of Kensington cases admitted during 1964 to the Hammersmith mortuary in accordance with the agreement are as follows:- By Order of Coroner 366 (90 inquests) On application of Undertaker 4 Total 370 BURIAL OF THE DEAD Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, imposes on the Council the duty to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies, or is found dead, within the borough, where no suitable private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. The Council have authorised the Medical Officer of Health to make arrangements for the burial of any person to whom the Section applies. In the twelve months ended 31st December, 1964, the Council became responsible for the burial of 24 persons dying in the borough. The following is a summary of the action taken:- (a) Cases where the funeral expenses have been fully recovered 13 (b) Cases where part only of the expenses has been recovered 6 (i) No. of these where there was no further estate or "liable" relative 3 (ii) No. of these where "liable" relatives were unable to contribute 3 (c) Cases where full cost has been borne by the Council 5 (i) No. of these where there was no estate or "liable" relative 3 (ii) No. of these where "liable" relatives were unable to contribute 2 24 Amount recovered by the end of the year £295.l6.0d. Additional amount expected to be recovered Nil £295.l6.0d. Irrecoverable £l45.19.0d. Total cost £441.15.0d. Of the twenty-four cases dealt with, sixteen were eligible for Death Grant from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. The total amount recovered from this source amounted to £257.7s.6d. (included in the above figures). Since the National Assistance Act came into force on 5th July, 1948, the Council have arranged for the burial of 618 persons. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF STAFF The Medical Officer of Health arranges all medical examinations of staff for the purpose of the Council's superannuation scheme. During the year, 158 examinations were made. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE The Council accepted the responsibility, within their powers, for co-ordinating and assisting in the extension of activities for aged persons and to alleviate unsatisfactory conditions under which many old people are living. Co-operation with voluntary bodies interested in the welfare of old people was effected wherever possible. Four members of the Public Health Committee served on the Kensington Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee, which acted as a co-ordinating non-executive committee through which voluntary bodies claimed assistance from the Council and through which the Council passed requests for executive action. Grants to Clubs, etc, Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council have power to make grants towards the expenses of voluntary organisations whose activities include the provision of meals or recreational facilities for old people. During the year, the following grants were made:- (a) The Kensington Communal Kitchen Service were granted approximately £4,000 towards the cost of operating a meals-on-wheels service for old people, in co-operation with the Kensington Women's Voluntary Services. (b) The West London Angling Competitions Committee were granted £5 towards the cost of their annual competition and outing. (c) The W.V.S. "Home from Home" Club were granted £150 towards the cost of providing additional equipment and removing from the Old Central Library to Young Street, W.8. 25 (d) The Kensington Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee were granted £35 to assist in meeting their general expenditure. (e) The Old Age Pensioners' Club, Brompton Oratory, were granted £10 to assist in providing equipment. Kensington Day Centre The Kensington Council of Social Service established a Day Centre for old people in Convent Gardens, North Kensington, W.11., in May, 1964. The Council decided, in principles, to make an annual grant of £3,250 payable half-yearly in advances, subject to having substantial representation on the Management Committee of the Centre. This was agreed to by the Committee of the Kensington Council of Social Service and six members of the Council were appointed to serve on the Management Committee. Holidays The Council, in co-operation with the Family Welfare Association, operated a scheme for providing holidays for old people. During 1964, advance bookings were made with the Ramsgate and District Hotel and Boarding House Association for two weeks' reservations in each of the months of May and September. The old people selected for holidays under this scheme are required to pay £2 per week towards the cost. Private coaches were hired to take them to and from the holiday establishments. The Hotel and Boarding House Association provided entertainments, coach outings and other concessions during the holidays. Applications for holidays were approved by the Chairman, and then passed to the Family Welfare Association for the holidays to be arranged. Five shillings per booking was paid to the Family Welfare Association towards their administration expenses. The following is a summary of the action takens:- Total applications received 150 Unsuitable on medical grounds 8 Referred to the London County Council for recuperative holidays 2 10 Applications approved 140 Cancellations after approval 24 Number sent on holiday 116 £. s. d. £. s. d. Cost of holidays 1,358. 6. 0. Booking fees paid to Family Welfare Association 25. 5. 0. 1,383. 11. 0. Less contributions by applicants 469. 0. 0. Cost to Council £914. 11. 0. The scheme continued to work satisfactorily and letters of appreciation were received from many of the old people. 26 Advice Leaflets The Council arrange for the publication of a pamphlet giving information on the services available in the borough for old people individually or through a club. The pamphlet was revised during the year and a new edition printed. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance send to every person in London reaching retirement pension age a leaflet giving general information on welfare services for old people. Institutional and Domiciliary Care of the Aged Sick Institutional care, home nursing, sick room equipment and home helps were provided by the London County Council. Hospital treatment, medical care, ophthalmic, dental and pharmaceutical services are provided under statute by the Minister of Health. One Hospital Management Committee in the northern portion of the borough utilised the part-time service of a local medical practitioner as a clinical assessor to decide the priority need for admission of all patients submitted to that Hospital Group as being in need of hospital treatment and classed as "chronic sick", Cases on the chronic sick waiting lists of St» Mary Abbots Hospital in the southern part of the borough were visited and assessed by the Council's women health officers. This ensured the early or immediate admission of patients where the need was urgent on medico-social grounds. There was usually no difficulty in the admission to hospital for the treatment of acute conditions. Where necessary, medical care, home nursing, home helps, convalescent holidays, financial aid and pensions were arranged with the appropriate statutory bodies. These, together with various services operated by the Council augmented by voluntary bodies, were provided to such good effect that in many cases the need for hospital admission was postponed indefinitely. The number of "chronic sick" visits by the women health officers during the year totalled 745. It was necessary to arrange for 26 old people to be admitted to hospitals for institutional treatment, and in addition, 18 cases were admitted to homes for the aged. Domiciliary Cleansing Arrangements have been made whereby old people's living accommodation and household articles are cleansed and, if necessary, disinfested. Ten old people were dealt with in 1964. At present no direct authority exists for the Council to provide a laundry service, as such, for old people. Section 122 of the public Health (London) Act, 1936, enables the Council to cause any article in the house to be cleansed, disinfected or destroyed, if it is in such a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby. The cleansing of grossly fouled bedding in cases of incontinence may be dealt with under this section. To comply with the legal requirements, the Council have given a general authority to the Medical Officer of Health to take whatever action appears to him to be necessary under the terms of Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, 27 In 78 cases, action was taken under the section. The bedding was marked, laundered at the Council's disinfecting station and returned to the old people. The scheme works smoothly and appears to fill a much felt want. Prom stocks of bedding held, the Council are able to supply linen and bedding on loan to old people while their own is being laundered, and where possible voluntary organisations are asked to undertake replacements of much worn articles. During the year 1,728 separate collections of laundry were made under this scheme, and the number of articles cleansed totalled 21,001. Library Facilities The Libraries Committee authorise the provision of books for old people confined to their homes. The circulation of the books was effected by the Women's Voluntary Services mobile library. Chiropody The London County Council, with the approval of the Minister of Health, extended their functions under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, to include a chiropody service, giving priority to the needs of old people, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers. They make a grant to the Kensington Old People's Welfare Committee for the purpose of enabling the provision of a chiropody service for housebound old people. The Kensington branch of the British Red Cross Society accepted responsibility for the complete administration of the service in the borough. Meals Service The arrangements for meals either delivered to old people in their homes or in canteens were continued with great success by the Women's Voluntary Services in conjunction with the Kensington Communal Services Committee. The Women's Voluntary Services undertake the work of verifying the bona fides of applicants, arrange delivery of meals at the homes of old people, and collect the money (l0d. per meal). The Kensington Communal Services Committee supply the meals and the vehicles for delivery. More than 60,000 meals were supplied during the year. The net deficiencies of the scheme (after crediting subsidies from the London County Council and grants from the Kensington Council) have been met to date by the Kensington Communal Services Committee. As from 1st April, 1963, the Council assumed responsibility for the subsidies hitherto paid by the London County Council. Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council have power to make grants to voluntary bodies undertaking the supply of meals to old people and grants of approximately £4,000 were made to the Kensington Communal Services Committee for 1964/65. Visiting The Council's women health officers visit old people brought to their notice. A comprehensive record system is kept of old people in the borough including personal particulars, environmental conditions and special needs. The local voluntary organisations supply records of old people whom they help and every endeavour is made to keep this information up-to-date. The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Council's women health officers in connection with the care of old people during the year 1964:- The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Council's women health officers in connection with the care of old people during the year 1964:- 28 Cases on register at the beginning of year 5,286 New cases added to register 528 Cases removed to hospital 26 Cases removed to homes (voluntarily) 18 Cases removed to homes (compulsorily) Nil Cases removed from district 68 Number of deaths 291 Total number of cases remaining on register at end of year 5,411 Number of old people sent away for holiday 116 Number of old people provided with Council's laundry service 78 Number of old people provided with "meals-on-wheels" 216 Cases referred to National Assistance Board 59 Cases referred for assistance from Home Help Department 141 Cases referred for assistance from voluntary organisations 89 Cases referred to recreational clubs 235 Number of visits to chronic sick cases 745 Cases assisted with provision of medical and nursing care 44 Cases where disinfestation was carried out 10 Cases referred to home chiropody service 291 Number of initial home visits made 584 Number of re-visits 2,090 Number of other visits made in connection with old people, including visits to clubs 116 Number of interviews, enquiries, etc., on behalf of old people 2,930 Removal of old and infirm persons to institutions, etc. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council may apply to a Court for an order to remove to a suitable institution any person who:- (a) is suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, is living in insanitary conditions, and (b) is unable to devote to himself, or is not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, amended Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and provided that application for removal of urgent cases may be made by the local authority or by the Medical Officer of Health, if authorised by the Council to do so, without giving seven days' notice as previously required. Such applications may be made either to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction or to a single Justice, on a certificate by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner. Further, where the hospital or institution agree to receive the case, it is not necessary to give seven days' notice to the manager thereof. Detention Orders made in respect of these urgent cases are limited to three weeks, and if it is necessary to extend this time, compliance must be made with the original requirements of Section 47. Although many cases of old people were investigated during the year, in no case was formal action taken to secure compulsory removal to an institution. 29 SANITARY INSPECTION The following table shows a summary of the inspections, etc., carried out by the public health inspectors and their assistants during the year:- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Houses inspected on complaint 2,372 Houses inspected after infectious disease 1,381 Re-inspections 4,432 Smoke observations 18 Other inspections 2,235 Housing Acts, 1957/1964 Initial inspection of dwelling houses 806 Re-inspections 5,390 Initial inspections for overcrowding 265 Re-inspections 1,360 Underground Living Rooms Initial inspections 485 Re—inspections 1,759 Drainage Applications 381 Plans submitted 381 House drains inspected 5,719 House drains tested 891 Factories Act, 1961 Premises inspected 118 Outworkers' premises inspected 114 Clean Air Act. 1956 Total inspections 3,830 The following table shows the number of notices issued in respect of nuisances, defects., etc., found during the years:- Public Health (London) Act. 1936 Intimation notices 830 Statutory notices 348 Pinal notices 110 Various Factories Act 5 Report of waste water to the Metropolitan Water Board 20 Report of dangerous structures to the London County Council 65 Other notices (including notice of entry) 265 30 The following is a summary of the principal works completed under the supervision of the public health inspectors during the years- House drains, reconstructed or repaired 228 House drains cleansed 73 Water closets, reconstructed or repaired 122 Water closets, new provided 294 Soil pipes, vent pipes, repaired, etc 97 Soil pipes, vent pipes, new provided 132 Baths, new provided 309 Sinks, new provided 302 Lavatory basins, new provided 455 Bidets, new provided 22 Waste pipes, new provided 377 Cisterns, cleansed 2 Dustbins provided 72 Accumulations of filth, etc., removed 155 Roofs repaired 136 Dampness in dwellings remedied 170 Artificial lighting to staircases provided 5 Houses disinfected after infectious disease (including bedding, etc.) 107 Booms in such houses disinfected after infectious disease 183 Verminous houses cleansed (including bedding, clothing, etc.) 335 Verminous rooms in such houses cleansed 768 Other sanitary works executed 173 HOUSING Inspection of dwelling houses during the year (i) (a) Dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Act) 8,723 (b) Inspections made for the purpose 32,227 (ii) (a) Dwelling houses (including those under sub-head (i) above which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 1,291 (b) Inspections made for the purpose 7,149 (iii) Dwelling houses found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 1,269 Remedy of defects without service of formal notices Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action under the Housing or Public Health Acts 574 31 Action under statutory powers during the year (a) Premises repaired after service of formal notice under the Public Health (London) Act:- (i) By owners 345 (ii) By local authority in default 4 (b) Action under Sections 9, 10 and 12 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (i) Dwelling houses in respect of which notices under Section 9 were served requiring repairs 346 (ii) Dwelling houses which were rendered fit by owners under Section 9 127 (iii) Dwelling houses rendered fit by the Council in default of owners 1 (c) Action under Sections 16, 17 and 23 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (i) Dwelling houses in respect of which demolition orders were made Nil (ii) Dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of demolition orders Nil (iii) Dwelling houses in respect, of which closing orders, in lieu of demolition orders, were made 2 (iv) Dwelling houses in respect of which undertakings were accepted from owner to render premises fit for habitation Nil (v) Dwelling houses rendered fit for habitation by owners and closing order determined 3 (d) Action under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (i) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders were made 18 (35 rooms) (ii) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders were determined, the tenements or rooms having been rendered fit 53 (109 rooms) (iii) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders operate, but where the Council consented during the year to the use of the rooms for purposes other than sleeping 4 (7 rooms) (iv) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which the Council accepted undertakings from owners to render fit within specified time 1 (2 rooms) (v) Undertakings cancelled Nil (e) Housing Act, 1957, Part IV -

The first portion of acres has been dealt with by the Borough Council, and the redevelopment of the site by the erection of new flats and maisonnettes is well in progress. The remaining portion of the Kensal New Town Area, which is zoned for residential development, will be dealt with by the Council and the London County Council on the following basis:- (i) The Council will undertake the redevelopment of 3.1 acres to the north and 1.62 acres to the south of the 6½ acres upon which they are at present engaged. This area, including the present 6½ stores, is bounded by Kensal Road, Golborne Road, Bosworth Road and the railway. (ii) The London County Council will undertake the redevelopment of 7.2 acres to the east of the Borough Council's present 6½ acres. This area is bounded by Golborne Road, Kensal Road and the 33 railway. The London County Council will also be responsible for the redevelopment of a small area of 0.41 acres between Kensal Road and the canal, to the west of an area in Paddington, of 3.6 acres, which the County Council now propose to zone as open space in place of the open space of 3.6 acres originally proposed at the eastern end of the area. The London County Council will be responsible for school extensions and the provision of additional open space north of Kensal Road. During the year, progress was made in dealing with Kensal New Town Area. Following a Public Inquiry held by the Minister on 6th February, 1964, in respect of the Kensal New Town (Nos. 7 and 8) Compulsory Purchase Orders, the Minister confirmed the Orders with certain modifications. Tenders were subsequently invited for the demolition of the properties which are contained in Phase 2 of the redevelopment scheme. Plans for the redevelopment of Phase 2 of the area were drawn up to provide for the erection of 47 flats, 47 tenants' stores and 35 hard standings for cars. A suitable tender was accepted by the Council in the early part of 1965. Plans for the rebuilding of Phase 3 of the scheme were drawn up and these will provide for the erection of 188 flats. Work on the erection of 54 flats and maisonnettes in Stage 3 of Phase 1 commenced during the year and was programmed to be completed in 1965. Lancaster Road (West)Area This area, which oonsists of 20.23 acres, is scheduled for redevelopment during the period 1960/72 and forms that part of the Blechynden Street area south of the metropolitan railway line containing approximately 455 houses, 15 factories, 140 shops, 6 licensed premises and 11 other business premises. Whilst the Council's intention is that this Lancaster Road (West) scheme should be regarded primarily as a venture in slum clearance, it is appreciated that in the area there may be many houses which will not be representable as unfit for human habitation. During the year, work on the redevelopment proposals was proceeded with but the approval of the draft plans was affected by a proposal to provide a certain amount of office accommodation within the established zone of the redevelopment scheme. At the time of writing, the negotiations with the Greater London Council are still being carried on. Linked with the Lancaster Road (West) Redevelopment Area is the Blechynden Street area comprising 8.30 acres situated north west of the metropolitan railway line which is to be redeveloped by the Greater London Council. During the year, the Minister of Housing and Local Government approved Compulsory Purchase Orders for a number of properties in this part of the Blechynden Street area including the following premises in Kensington 1 - 3 (consecutive) Bramley Mews 43 - 49 (odd) and 53 - 59 (odd) Bramley Road 33 - 67 (odd) and 73 - 81 (odd) Blechynden Street 1 - 25 (odd) Lockton Street 1 - 15 (odd) and 2 - 14 (even) Martin Street 36 - 44 (consecutive) Mersey Street 21 - 33 (odd - excluding 29A) and 10 - 30 (even) Silchester Terrace Houses in Multiple Occupation In the last few years, the Council have given very serious consideration to the question of improving tenement houses. 34 The Housing Act, 1961, provided new powers for dealing with bad living conditions in houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The 1961 Act provides, amongst other powers:- (i) A new power to apply a code of management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed. The requirements of this code are prescribed in the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962, which came into operation on 22nd May, 1962. (ii) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions, and the provision of adequate means of escape from fire. (iii) A power for local authorities to carry out works themselves in default and recover the cost. (iv) A new power to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house, or part of a house, which is in multiple occupation. The new powers are designed to deal primarily with the worst type of multi-occupied house. Part I of the Regulations mentioned in (i) above deals with their application and interpretation; Part II prescribes the duties of management to be discharged by the manager of the house; and Part III deals with ancillary requirements including the provision of information. It also places certain obligations on occupants for the purpose of ensuring that the manager can effectively carry out his duties. Responsibility for management will rest on an owner or lessee who receives the rents or other payments from tenants or lodgers, including any agent or trustee through whom the rents are received. The main substance of the code of management is contained in Part II of the Regulations which deals with the manager's responsibilities for repair and maintenance. Broadly, these responsibilities amount to ensuring the repair (including reasonable decorative repair), cleanliness and good order of the parts of the house in common use; the proper maintenance throughout the house of installations for basic services, such as water supply, drainage;, gas and electricity; the repair and good order of all means of ventilation and means of escape from fire. The manager is also required to ensure an adequate provision of refuse bins and to take reasonable precautions to protect tenants from injury as a result of structural conditions in the house. Where rooms are let to tenants or lodgers as their living accommodation, the manager must ensure that the rooms are clean and in a reasonable state of structural repair at the commencement of the letting and that defects are remedied in the rooms which are already let, when the Regulations are applied to a house. There is a continuing obligation for the repair and proper working order of installations in the rooms, for the supply of water, gas and electricity as well as baths, sinks, basins and sanitary conveniences. In Part III of the Regulations a general obligation is placed on occupants to take reasonable care not to hinder the manager in carrying out his duties. 35 Regulation 14 requires the manager to display in a suitable position in the house a notice containing his name and address and that of any other manager with an indication of his interest (i.e., agent or trustee), a copy of the Management Order, a copy of the Regulations and, if the local authority require, a notice which the authority may provide for indicating briefly the main provisions of the Regulations. The Regulations do not stand in isolation, and they must be taken together with existing powers under the Housing Act, 1957, and the powers contained in the 1961 Act relating to the provision of additional services and facilities and the prevention or reduction of overcrowding. It is likely that there will be houses where Orders applying a code of management, prescribed in the Regulations, will be all that are necessary to bring about an improvement in conditions. In others, the reason for the unsatisfactory state of affairs will be not so much bad management as lack of essential facilities. To put this right, a local authority can require the necessary work to be done and, where need be, link the notice of works with a direction limiting the number of occupants in a house. In the very worst type of houses conditions may be so bad that, to effect any real improvements it will be necessary to take action at one and the same time to secure better managements additional facilities, and a limitation on the number of occupants. The premises affected vary considerably, and render impracticable the provision of a single rigid code of requirements applicable to all cases. The Council have adopted certain minimum requirements as standards of essential services and amenities. These were given in detail in my reports for 1962 and have been recommended for adoption throughout London by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. Plan of Action In January, 1963, the Medical Officer of Health reported to the Public Health Committee on the improvement of houses and, inter alia referred to areas of properties which are up to 100 years old where the property is either unsuitable or not worth converting. These areas are shown on a map coloured pink and include a total of 1,436 properties. The best long-term solution for these properties is demolition and redevelopment, but the existing slum clearance commitments of the Council will prevent them from undertaking this for many years, The properties consist predominantly of houses in multiple occupation. The joint meeting of the Public Health Committee and Housing and Town Planning Committee recommended that, as a short-term policy, the provisions of Part II of the Housing Act, 1961, relating to houses in multiple occupation should be applied to these areas as soon as possible, and that additional staff should be engaged and additional office accommodation provided. The aim was to deal with the 1,436 houses within three years, and to do this it was decided to engage four additional technical assistants working under the direction of two qualified public health inspectors. In view of the substantial increase in administrative and clerical work it was decided to engage one senior clerk and two shorthand typists. The accommodation at the Public Health Department was already strained to the limit and, in order to house this new housing section, it was decided to convert the coach house and stable at the rear of the Red House, Hornton Street, for the accommodation of the additional staff. The work on this office conversion was completed in October, 1963. Difficulty was encountered in securing qualified staff as technical assistants. In view of the nation-wide shortage of public health inspectors, and the even greater shortage in the London area, it was decided to attempt to recruit assistants with sufficient experience to undertake routine inspections, but, despite several advertisements, the type of applicant was 36 generally quite unsuitable with regard to experience and qualification to undertake the work involved. As a result, a further effort was made to secure public health inspectors and, by the end of 1963, it was possible to assign four inspectors to this works, together with the clerical staff referred to. The full establishment of six public health inspectors was reached early in 1964. Two public health inspectors had been engaged on the preliminary work for some time prior to the completion of the office accommodation and inspections had commenced. A system was devised to deal with the house-tohouse inspection, reports preparation and service of all necessary notices for when it was eventually possible to commence the operation on a full scale. The procedure involved under the Act of 1961 is complicated and calls for very close liaison between the officers of the Town Clerk's and Medical Officer of Health's Departments. It was decided that the purpose of the inspections should be threefold:- (i) to secure, under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1961, the satisfactory management of all premises in multiple occupation; (ii) to obtain the installation of satisfactory sanitary facilities and amenities under Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961, to comply with the standards made by the Council; and (iii) to secure the repair of houses under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1957. Problems Encountered In the administration of new legislation of this nature it is inevitable that difficulties should be encountered. The largest single problem which has been met in this work is the element of delay. This has been experienced at all stages of the procedure, of which the following are examples:- (a) When endeavouring to obtain details of persons interested in the premises, undue delay has been caused by owners in the time taken to reply to the enquiry. This information is essential before any notices can be served. (b) A lack of co-operation by owners and tenants has been met in gaining access to some premises. (c) Delay brought about by the administrative procedure necessary in making a management order. (d) Various methods adopted by recalcitrant landlords to avoid or delay executing the necessary works® (e) Changes of ownership. (f) Changes of occupier and the method of letting a house. (g) Slow progress by builders in executing work. This has been brought about mainly by the insufficiency of builders willing and able to undertake this type of work. (h) Delay by landlords proceeding with works at a very slow pace and by this action preventing the Council from executing the work in default. 37 (i) Poor standard of work found in many cases which necessitates a larger number of re-inspections and causes delay in the resultant alterations necessary to amend the work. (j) Genuine cases of hardships, particularly in the case of some old owner/occupiers or old principal tenants who have sub-let and become liable to carry out certain works as they are responsible for the multiple occupation. Representations were made to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government by this Council and other local authorities and, as a result, a new Housing Act was passed by Parliament in 1964 to remove some of the difficulties experienced in administering the 1961 Act. The additional powers given to local authorities by the Housing Act, 1964, dealt with, inter alia, (a) Improved methods of recovering costs of carrying out work in default under Part II of the Housing Act, 1961. The expenses of works carried out by the local authority in default are made a charge on the property, and on estates and interests in the premises, and the authority is given all the powers of a mortgagee, including the power of sale to cover their costs. (b) Penalties against landlords for failure to execute works under Part II of the Housing Act, 1961. (c) Means of operating (i) the power to require works and (ii) the power to give a direction for the reduction of overcrowding (Sections 15 and 19 respectively of the Housing Act, 1961) in combination instead of alternatively. (d) The obtaining of a Justice's warrant to enter premises for the purposes of Part II of the Housing Act, 1961. In addition, local authorities are vested with a new power to enable them to make control orders in respect of multi-occupied houses in which the living conditions are so bad as to justify urgent action in the interest of people living in the house. A control order enables a local authority to take possession, against all landlords and proprietors, of premises and undertake all management duties subject to compensation to the dispossessed landlord. A control order remains in force for five years, unless it is revoked by the County Court or by a higher tribunal or by the local authority. The local authority are required to take such immediate steps as are necessary for the protection of the resident's safety, welfare or health and subsequently to improve and manage the house as well, in all respects, as they would have required a manager or person in control to do under the provisions of Part II of the Housing Act, 1961. Inspections were commenced in the Golborne Ward, in an area bounded by Acklam Road, Portobello Road, Wornington Road and St. Ervan's Road, and by the end of the year 651 houses had been initially inspected to record defects. The following table summarises the action taken during 1964 and the total results since the work commenced in 1963:— The following table summarises the action taken during 196k and the total results since the work commenced in 1963:– 38  1964 1963 Total Houses inspected 355 296 651 No action required 15 27 42 Management orders made 32 27 59 Notices served: Section 9 - Housing Act, 1957 346 105 451 Section l4 - Housing Act, 1961 30 - 30 Section 15 - Housing Act, 1961 355 117 472 Section 16 - Housing Act, 1961 3 2 5 Negotiations in progress 3 6 9 Work in progress 97 96 193 Work completed 183 27 210 Work in default authorised 73 4 77 In the area dealt with to date, the houses mainly consist of a basement and three storeys, with a back addition, usually to the basement and ground floors. In some cases, the basement rooms are subject to closing orders. In the past, these houses have been occupied by a family on each floor, but due largely to the settling of immigrants in this area, many have been found to be in one-room lettings. The majority of the houses in the area have no bathroom and, generally, there is one internal water closet situated on the ground floor or first half-landing, with an external water closet in the rear yard, the latter normally used only by the basement tenant. The requirements generally have, therefore, been for the provision of at least one bath in every house, and in some cases an additional internal water closet, together with a hot water supply and exclusive facilities for the cooking, preparation and storage of food in each separate letting. Where there are one-room lettings it has been found mainly that kitchens are shared or cooking facilities are provided on landings. In these cases, the provision of hot and cold water supplies, sinks, food storage and cooking facilities have also been required within each letting. In a number of cases, the baths have been installed in the ground floor back addition rooms and, where additional water closet accommodation has been necessary, it has been possible to provide it in the new bathroom, in those cases where there is a separate water closet also available. Where the back addition rooms are occupied, the bathrooms have been provided by building up the back addition by an additional storey. IMPROVEMENT OR CONVERSION OF EXISTING HOUSES Owners of private dwellings may apply to the Council for assistance towards carrying out work of improvement or conversion. One aim is to encourage owners to provide services and amenities in houses which are sound but which were built to a lower standard than is generally acceptable nowadays. The other is to encourage the provision of additional satisfactory dwellings, either by converting the large outmoded house from one dwelling into a number of flats, or by converting an old building into one or more dwellings. Grants are not intended to help owners meet the cost of ordinary repairs and renewals, nor are they intended to adapt a perfectly adequate dwelling to the needs of a particular family. They are not normally payable for the provision of extra living rooms or bedrooms, or for increasing the size of existing rooms. They are not payable for the improvement of premises used primarily or partly for business purposes. Two methods of application are available. The first is to apply for an improvement grant - known as a discretionary grant - under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. The maximum grant payable is one-half of the approved expenditure (which must not be less than £100) subject to a maximum allowance of £500. 39 In considering a scheme of improvement or conversion submitted for grant, only one question may properly be asked,, namely, whether it will produce a satisfactory modernised dwelling complying with the statutory conditions and the specified requirements. Applications for improvement (discretionary) grants received and dealt with during 1964 are summarised as follows:- Applications received 28 Applications granted 28 Applications refused Nil Total amount of grants approved £10,729.0s.0d. The second method is to apply for standard grants, which were introduced by the House Purchase & Housing Act, 1959. The Act sets up a new system of standard grants to supplement the present system of improvement grants paid at the discretion of the local authority. These standard grants are payable only in respect of the provision of specified standard amenities and on the expenditure actually incurred for this purpose. Provided certain conditions are satisfied, the owner of the property can claim the grant as of right. There are five standard amenities (as shown below) eligible for standard grant, which is one-half of the cost shown to have been incurred in executing the works involved, subject to a maximum payment of £350. (a) A fixed bath or show in a bathroom (b) A wash-hand basin (c) A hot water supply (d) A water closet for the dwelling (e) Satisfactory facilities for storing food During 1964, seven applications for standard grants were granted in respect of individual premises and a total payment of £630 was authorised. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING OF COMMON STAIRCASES IN TENEMENT HOUSES AND FLATS Council Byelaws relating to artificial lighting of common staircases in tenement houses and flats came into operation on 11th March, 1958. The principal Byelaw reads as followss- " The occupier of every tenement house to which these Byelaws apply and the owner of every block of flats shall provide adequate artificial lighting for all common staircases (a) from half an hour before sunset until 12 o'clock midnight; (b) for one hour before sunrise during the months of October9 November, December, January, February and March, and (c) at other times as and when necessary if adequate means of natural lighting are not provided. " During 1964, formal notices were served in 5 cases, requiring compliance with these Byelaws. CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR IN RELATION TO IWELLING HOUSES The Council's duty to issue certificates of disrepair in respect of "rent controlled" dwelling houses, not reasonably suitable for occupation, is governed by the Rent Act, 1957. 40 The following is a summary of the action taken during 1964:Part I - Applications for Certificates of Disrepair Number of applications for certificates 2 Number of decisions not to issue certificates Number of decisions to issue certificates - Nil (a) in respect of some but not all defects Nil (b) in respect of all defects 2 Number of undertakings given by landlords 1 Number of undertakings refused by Council Nil Number of certificates issued 1 Part II - Applications for cancellation of Certificates Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 5 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 1 Decision by Council to cancel in spite of tenant's objection 1 Certificates cancelled 5 OVERCROWDING All cases of overcrowding are dealt with on the strict interpretation of the standards laid down in the Housing Act, 1957: distinguishing between "penal" and "non-penal" cases. The number of new cases of overcrowding reported to the Committee during 1964 was 169, giving an equivalent number of persons of 64l. The total number of overcrowding cases which were recorded during the year as having been abated was 160, comprising a total of 618½ units. ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING PRIORITIES ON MEDICAL GROUNDS During the year, 135 applications for rehousing on medical grounds were examined, and recommendations for the award of additional points were made to the Chief Housing Officer. In each case, the precise medical condition and resultant disability were determined (frequently necessitating communication with the family doctor or with the hospital attended). The premises were inspected in detail to ascertain the extent and nature of the existing accommodation; the adequacy of day and sleeping space; the risk of infection; the existence of remediable or irremediable sanitary or structural defects, and the existence of inconveniences, such as stairs, which might be prejudicial to the patient. On this information and that supplied by the Chief Housing Officer, an assessment of points to be awarded on medical grounds was made in 133 cases. FACTORIES Section 153(l) of the Factories Act, 1961, requires the Medical Officer of Health to make an annual report in regard to the Council's functions under the Act. The following tables give the prescribed particulars in the form requested by the Ministry of Health in Circular No. 1/65, dated 11th January, 1965:- 41 Part I of the Act 1 - INSPECTIONS for the purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by public health inspectors).

BASEMENT BAKEHOUSES The Factories Act, 1961 (Section 70 ) requires the Council to inspect in every fifth year allbasement bakehouses in the borough for which certificates of suitability have been issued. The certificates continue to operate if the Council are satisfied that the bakehouses are still suitable. The last quinquennial review was made in 1963, and at the present time there are six basement bakehouses in use in the borough. They are as follows:- 151 Earl's Court Road 65 Grolborne Road 139 Portland Road 178 Fulham Road 79 Golborne Road 46 Walton Street 43 SANITARY ACCOMMODATION, ETC. IN SHOPS The Shops Act, 1950, empowers the Council to enforce in all shops - (a) suitable and sufficient means of ventilation; (b) suitable and sufficient means of maintaining a reasonable temperature; (c) suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation. As from 1st January, 1959, the London County Council transferred to Metropolitan Borough Councils the responsibility for enforcing provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to adequate lighting, suitable and sufficient washing facilities and, where employees take any meals in the shop premises, suitable and sufficient facilities for taking those meals. Under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, the Council may grant a certificate exempting a shop from the provision of suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation or washing facilities if they are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances affecting the shop it is reasonable that such a certificate should be in force, and that suitable and sufficient accommodation or facilities are otherwise conveniently available. The Council have decided that in those shops where members of both sexes are employed, separate sanitary conveniences for each sex should be required if the number of employees exceeds four, but if the number is less than four, one sanitary convenience should be regarded as suitable and sufficient, provided that the door of the convenience is fitted with a proper lock or fastener on the internal side, and an automatic indicator shows on the external side of the door whether the apartment is engaged or vacant. During the year 1964, no exemption certificate under the Shops Act was granted. Similarly, under the Pood Hygiene Regulations, exemption may now be granted in food shops in respect of the provision of constant water supply, wash-hand basins with hot and cold water, cupboard or locker accommodation for outdoor clothing and facilities for washing food and equipment, if such provision cannot reasonably be required. During 1964, no exemption certificate was issued under the Pood Hygiene Regulations. REGISTER OF FACTORIES The Factories Act, 1961, requires the Council to keep a list of all factories within the borough with respect to which the duty of enforcing the provisions of the Factories Act is imposed upon them. The following table gives a summary of the factories on the Council's register at the end of the year, indicating the types of business carried on, whether or not mechanical power is used, and where situated - i.e., North or South Kensingtons:- 44 Factory - Business North Kensington South Kensington Mech.

The requirements of the Act follow closely those of the Factories Act and include provisions relating to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, lighting, sanitary conveniences, washing facilities, drinking water, seats, safety of machinery, first aid and fire precautions. Enforcement of the provisions of the Act is divided among a number of authorities. In most premises covered by the Act, its general requirements are enforced by local authorities who were already responsible for inspecting many such premises under other legislation dealing with public health and shop closing hours, H.M. Inspectors of Factories enforce the general provisions of the Act in certain premises which are associated with, or broadly similar in their conditions to, factories, i.e., railway premises, fuel storage depots and offices in factories. They are also responsible for inspecting premises owned or occupied by the Crown and those occupied by local authorities,, Provisions relating to fire precautions are the responsibility of the Fire Authority, i.e., with regard to this borough's area, the London County Council, In Kensington, inspections are carried out by the Public Health Department, and a full-time public health inspector was appointed for this purpose on 1st July, 1964, He has been assisted, for the time being on a part-time basis, by a member of the Department's technical staff. Clerical assistance, also on a part-time basis, has been undertaken by a clerk who is also responsible for other aspects of environmental health. Inspections of shops and catering premises have been carried out, in the main, by district public health inspectors who are also responsible for the enforcement of additional legislation such as the Food Hygiene Regulations. It was estimated that the following numbers of premises might be subject to supervision by the Council:- Offices 1,090 Shops 2,868 Warehouses 41 Catering Premises 392 Other Premises 943 5,334 The number of premises registered during the year was:- Offices 1,145 Retail Shops 1,363 Wholesale Shops and Warehouses 177 Catering Establishments Canteens 370 Fuel Storage Depots 7 3,062 The numbers of persons employed in these premises were:- Offices 9,294 Retail Shops 10,746 Wholesale Shops and Warehouses 1,029 Catering Establishments open to the public 4,417 Canteens 303 Fuel Storage Depots 33 25,822 46 The Ministry of Labour, in a letter dated 10th June, 1964, to local authorities stated that they did not propose to suggest a frequency for the periodical general inspection of premises. Some classes of these premises, e.g., food shops, have to be inspected under other statutes and these visits may often present opportunities for an inspection under the Act. However, the number of premises to be inspected varies widely between different local authority areas in relation to their size and other circumstances. While the Ministry hoped that authorities would aim to give all premises on their registers an initial general inspection as soon as possible, they recognised that in many areas it was likely to be a number of years before all premises covered by the Act could be visited. Authorities were requested to give priority to premises where conditions were thought to be poor or where there were special hazards. Subject to this, it was recommended that inspections should be planned so that a reasonable selection of premises of different classes receive a general inspection each year. The numbers of registered premises inspected during the year were:- Offices 162 Retail 230 Wholesale Shops and Warehouses 11 Catering Establishments open to the public, canteens 24 Fuel storage depots 1 The total number of visits of all kinds by inspectors to registered premises was 562. SUPERVISION OP POOD SUPPLIES FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 1955 This is the principal Act for controlling the composition, labelling, fitness and hygienic handling of food. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, I960 These Regulations are the principal instruments for enforcing good food hygiene practice in foodshops. Their main requirements were given in my Reports 196l/62. During the year, the public health inspectors have been engaged on surveying food premises in the borough and a total of 2,545 inspections was made. In 5 cases, it was necessary to send informal notices pointing out deficiencies under the Regulations and, generally speaking, the food traders are complying with the requirements in a co-operative manner. It was, however, found necessary to take legal proceedings for contraventions of the Regulations as follows:- Total number of male employees 9,706 " " " female " 16,116 47 DETAILS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS IN 1964 As requested by Ministry of Health Circular 22/58 Date of Hearing Offence Regulations Result Fine Costs awarded to Council 17. 1.64 Dirty walls of kitchen 23(1) £ s d £ s d 1 0 0 2 0 0 Dirty ceiling of kitchen 23(1) 1 0 0 - - - 28. 1.64 Dirty walls of basement kitchen 23(i) 15 0 0 2 2 0 Dirty ceiling of basement kitchen 23(1) Not separately dealt with Dirty walls of ground floor kitchen 231 20 0 0 - - - Dirty ceiling of ground floor kitchen 231 ) Not separately ) dealt with Dirty floor of ground floor kitchen 23(2.5 Unsatisfactory equipment 6 1 10 0 0 - - — Absence of notice re washing hands 14(5) 5 0 0 - - - 6. 3.64 Unsatisfactory floor of foodshop 23(1) Conditional discharge 3 3 0 Unsatisfactory equipment 6(1) Conditional discharge — — — Dirty walls of ground floor front room 23(1) 5 0 0 4 4 0 Dirty floor of ground floor front room 23(1) Not separately dealt with Dirty walls of ground floor rear room 23(1) 5 0 0 — — — Dirty ceiling of ground floor rear room 23(1) Not separately dealt with Dirty floor of ground floor rear room 23(1) Dirty shelving of ground floor rear room 23(1) 2 0 0 — — — Accumulation of refuse Unsatisfactory condition of 24 5 0 0 — — — food store 23(1) 10 0 0 — — - Unsatisfactory ceiling in food store 23(1) 5 0 0 - - - Unsatisfactory floor in food store 23(1-3 Not separately dealt with Unsatisfactory walls in food store 23(1) Accumulation of refuse Unsatisfactory condition of 24 5 0 0 — — — food store 23(1.) 10 0 0 — — — Unsatisfactory ceiling of food store 23(1) 5 0 0 — — - Unsatisfactory walls of food store 23 (1) Not separately dealt with Unsatisfactory floor of food store Unsatisfactory condition of 23(1) food store 23(1) 10 0 0 - - - Dirty water closet apartment 14 2 3 0 0 — - — Dirty water closet apartment 14(2) 5 0 0 — - — Absence of notice re washing hands 14(5) 1 0 0 - • - Absence of wash basins 16 10 0 0 - - - Absence of first-aid equipment 17 2 0 0 - - - Absence of lockers 18 1 0 0 - - - Risk of contamination to food (chicken) 13 1 0 0 - - - Risk of contamination to food (cheese) 13 1 0 0 - - - 13. 3.64 Unsatisfactory food premises 5 Dismissed Dirty floor of food room 23 Dirty platform of food room 23 48 DETAILS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS IN 1964 (Cont'd.)

The following is a record of the inspections made by the public health inspectors engaged on this work for 1964:- Premises registered under - No. of Premises No. of Inspections (1) Section 16, Food and Drugs Act, 1955 (a) for the sale, or the manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice cream or the storage of ice cream intended for sale 379 96* (b) for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale 106 147 (2) Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 as dairies or where the occupier is registered for the sale of milk in sealed containers only 195 207 * Additional inspections of the premises (not primarily in connection with the sale of ice cream) are recorded under different headings in the following tables:- 49 Food premises (all categories) No. of Premises No. of Inspections Bakehouses - underground 6 13 Bakehouses - others 8 12 Bread and cake shops 38 26 Butchers 64 122 Dairies and premises where milk is sold 195 207 Fishmongers 26 36 Food Factories 17 51 General Stores 48 255 Greengrocers 82 41 Grocers 213 382 Ice Cream 379 96 Preserved Food 27 10 Public Houses and Off-licences 197 70 Restaurants and cafes 359 378 Sweet shops 136 28 Street markets, stalls and storage premises 97 (licensed traders) 536 (318 miscellaneous visits ) Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963 These Regulations, part of which came into force on 29th September, 1963, and the remainder on 1st October, 1964, re-enact with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The principal change in these Regulations is that, from 1st October, 1964, the designation "Entreated" replaced the designation "Tuberculin Tested". The designation "Tuberculin Tested" was considered to be no longer suitable as a description for some milk only, since all milk produced in England and Wales now comes from attested herds. All milk sold by retail in England and Wales must be specially designated and those designations would in future be "Untreated" (relating to "Raw" or "Farm Bottled" milks), "Pasteurised" and "Sterilised". From 29th September, 1963, until 31st December, 1964, a person holding the appropriate licence could use the words "Tuberculin Tested Milk (Pasteurised)" as an alternative to the words "Pasteurised Milk" in relation to milk which has been pasteurised in accordance with the Regulations. From 1st October, 1964, until 31st December, 1964, milk could be labelled as "Tuberculin Tested Milk" if the conditions applicable to the use of the special designation "Untreated" were otherwise satisfied. The licences granted during the year are shown in the following table, together with the total numbers in force at the end of the years- Licences issued in 1964 Total number in force at end of year Tuberculin Tested milk 9 164 Pasteurised milk 12 187 Sterilised milk 6 148 50 The following table shows the number of samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) milk and processed milks taken during the year, together with the results of examination:- Designation No. of Samples Methylene blue test Phosphatase test Turbidity test Passed Failed Passed Failed Passed Failed Tuberculin Tested (Farm bottled) 8 * 7 _ _ _ _ _ Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 13 *10 _ 13 _ _ _ Pasteurised 17 *15 _ 17 _ _ _ Sterilised _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * One sample of tuberculin tested (farm bottled) milk, three samples of tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk and two samples of pasteurised milk were not submitted to the methylene blue test as the atmospheric shade temperature exceeded 70°F, which is the limit specified in the Regulations. Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 \ (a) Registrations The number of persons registered under these Regulations at the end of the year, to sell milk from premises in the borough (including the sale of cream in sealed containers) was 195. (b) Unclean Milk Containers It is an offence under the Regulations for any dairy farmer or distributor to use for holding milk any vessel that is not in a state of thorough cleanliness immediately before use. In the case of bottled milk, the time "immediately before use" is considered to mean at the time the bottle is first filled and, therefore, any offence would be committed at the time and place of bottling. During the year, five instances of "dirty milk bottles" were reported. In one case legal proceedings were instituted; in two other cases warning letters were sent to the bottlers, and in the remaining two cases it was decided to take no further action. Composition of Milk During the year, 175 samples of milk (all grades) were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, all of genuine composition. The following table shows the percentage of milk fat and non-fatty solids of the genuine samples of milk, other than Channel Islands and South Devon milks, taken during each month:- Month No. of samples taken Average Percentages Milk Fats Non-fat Solids January 24 3.67 8.43 February 20 3.62 8.43 March 14 3.60 8.47 April 9 3.49 8.55 May 11 3.38 8.67 June 5 3.44 8.69 51 Month No. of samples taken Average Percentages Milk Fats Non-fat Solids July 1 3.40 8.60 August _ _ _ September 1 3.65 8.60 October 2 3.82 8.77 November 14 3.76 8.71 December 5 3.72 8.63 Average for the whole year 3.59 8.60 Legal minimum standard 3.00 8.50 Milk and Dairies (Channel islands & South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956 These Regulations require that all milk for human consumption sold under the specific description of - Channel Islands Milk Jersey Milk Guernsey Milk or South Devon Milk must contain not less than 4% by weight of milk fat. This compares with the presumptive milk fat standard of 3% specified for ordinary milk by the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. The following table shows the average percentages of milk fat and non-fat solids of the genuine samples taken during each month:- Month No. of samples taken Average Percentages Milk Fats Non-fat Solids January 11 4.45 8.87 February 11 4.51 8.83 March 10 4.30 8.87 April 10 4.19 8.79 May 6 4.21 8.96 June 3 4.28 8.95 July 2 4.20 8.85 August - - - September 1 4.40 9.10 October 1 4.70 9.05 November 10 4.50 9.00 December 4 4.60 9.03 Average for the whole year 4.39 8.99 Legal minimum standard 4.00 8.50 Unsound Food Seizure Under Part I of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, it is an offence to sell, offer, or expose for sale, or to be in possession for the purpose of sale or preparation for sale, food intended for human consumption which is in an unfit condition. Such food can be seized and taken before a Justice of the Peace, who can condemn it and order it to be destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption. 52 During the year, it was found necessary to enforce this procedure on only one occasion, when after a complaint had been made of unfit food, the shop premises concerned were inspected and a quantity of foodstuffs on display were seized due to their infested condition and taken before a Justice of the Peace who condemned them and ordered them to be destroyed. Legal proceedings were instituted for this offence and for other offences under the Pood Hygiene Regulations, I960, for which the defendant was fined £50 and £l.ls, 0d, costs. Surrender Any person having in his possession food which is diseased, unsound, or unfit for human consumption can, under Section 180(8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, surrender it to the Council for destruction or other suitable method of disposal. During the year the following amounts of food were surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption:- Food Tons Cwts. Qtrs. lbs. Meat (raw) 15 - 20 Meat (other) 7 - 19 Ham and Pork 1 11 - 4 Sauerkraut 15 3 19 Cucumbers and Gherkins in Brine 10 3 11 Butter and Cheese 23 Pish (wet and dry) 4 - 8 Sausage 11 3 12 TOTAL 4 15 1 4 Tins, jars, packets or cartons of fruit, vegetables and miscellaneous foodstuffs and 10,304 Frozen foods 10,017 TOTAL 20,321 All food condemned as unfit for human consumption is collected by the Council, taken to the refuse destructor in Fulham and destroyed. In no instance were large quantities of food involved, necessitating special examination of stocks of food. Complaints by purchasers of food During the year, 75 complaints were received from members of the public alleging the unsatisfactory condition of food purchased by them in the borough. The complaints generally related to the presence of foreign matter in foods, and the unsatisfactory condition of bread, meat pie, liver, cheese, sausages, confectionery and meat. Of these complaints, 16 cases resulted in the Public Health Committee instructing the Town Clerk to institute legal proceedings and in each case a conviction was awarded. In 7 cases, the Public Health Committee decided to send warning letters to the vendors or manufacturers concerned. The remaining 52 cases were dealt with informally, either owing to the lack of sufficient evidence, or to the complaint not being substantiated. 53 The Liquid. Egg (Pasteurisation) Regulations, 1963 The Regulations require the pasteurisation of liquid egg to be used in food intended for sale for human consumption, other than egg broken out on the food manufacturers' premises and used within twenty-four hours. The Regulations prescribe the method of pasteurisation and the test to be satisfied. There is no egg pasteurisation plant in Kensington and it was not found necessary during the year to take any sample of liquid egg in accordance with these Regulations. Adulteration of Food During the year, 245 formal samples were submitted for analysis by the Public Analyst, of which 11 (4.49%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. 755 informal samples were also submitted for analysis, of which 24 (3.17%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. In two of the formal cases legal proceedings were taken. In three cases warnings were given to the Producers, Manufacturers or Vendors and in all cases the results of these unsatisfactory samples were brought to the notice of the producers, manufacturers or vendors as the case may be. Ice Cream The Food Standards (ice Cream) Regulations, 1959, and the Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1959, have been made jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Ice Cream Regulations prescribe standards for ice cream and introduce separate standards for "dairy ice cream" (or "dairy cream ice" or "cream ice"), and for "milk ice". The Labelling Regulations prohibit the labelling, marking or advertising of ice cream in a manner suggestive of butter, cream, milk, or anything connected with the dairy interest unless the ice cream contains no fat other than milk (except such as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, flavouring substance, or emulsifying or stabilising agent), but permit the presence of skimmed milk solids to be declared. These Regulations also provide that it is an offence to sell under the description "ice cream", any pre-packed ice cream which contains fat other than milk fat, unless it bears on the wrapper or container a declaration "Contains non-milk fat" or, if appropriate, "Contains vegetable fat" in type of a prescribed minimum size. The following table shows the number of samples of ice cream taken during 1964 for chemical analysis compared with those taken in the previous year:- 1963 1964 Number of samples 7 8 Variation of fat content per cent 8.4 to 12.2 7.5 to 16.8 Variation of non-fat content per cent 24.9 to 31.5 22.2 to 28.8 Average fat content per cent 10.2 10.2 Average non-fat solids content per cent 27.1 24.9 The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959, require that ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are to be pasteurised or sterilised. 54 There is still no legal bacteriological standard for ice cream. As in previous years, samples were taken and submitted for examination under the provisional methylene blue reduction test, which is a simple and practical means for the routine examination of ice cream. The test is not of sufficient precision to justify its use as a statutory test. The grading is determined by the length of time taken to decolourize the methylene blue, and it is suggested that if samples consistently fail to reach grades 1 and 2 it would be reasonable to regard this as an indication of defects in manufacture or handling which warrant further investigation. During the year 21 samples of ice cream were also taken and submitted to the methylene blue test. The results are as follows:- Grade No. of samples 1 6 2 2 3 2 4 11 Premises in the borough where ice cream is manufactured, stored or sold, were frequently inspected during the year and generally were found to be in a satisfactory condition, having regard to the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959. General There are no abattoirs or slaughterhouses in the borough, and no killing of animals for human consumption is carried out. FOOD POISONING The Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, requires any medical practitioner, on becoming aware that a person is suffering or is suspected to be suffering from food poisoning, to notify the Medical Officer of Health. The following table gives a summary of all cases (notified or not) brought to notice during 1964:- Food Poisoning Notifications (corrected) First quarter 3 Second quarter 6 Third quarter 11 Fourth quarter 20 Total 40 Cases otherwise ascertained Nil Fatal cases Nil 55 Particulars of outbreaks:- No. of Outbreaks No. of Cases Total Cases Family Outbreaks Other Outbreaks Notified Otherwise Ascertained Agent unidentified 1 1 9 - 9 Single cases:- No. of Cases Total Cases Notified Otherwise Ascertained Agent identified 7 - 7 Agent unidentified 24 - 24 Outbreaks due to unidentified agent (2 outbreaks) In the first case a medical practitioner and his wife suffered vomiting, headaches and other symptoms after eating a pate manufactured by and purchased from a local store. A portion was sent for examination. The doctor and his wife submitted specimens which, including the pate, were negative. In the second outbreak, seven cases were notified, all of whom were patients at a local hospital (maternity ward). Five were babies under ten days old. The ward was closed to new patients. All staff and patients submitted specimens but no positive findings were obtained. The ward was thoroughly cleansed, and all bedding, etc., was treated at the Council's disinfecting station. Single cases Thirty-one isolated cases of food poisoning were notified. In twenty-four of these, no causative agent was identified, but in the remaining seven cases the identified agents were either Salmonella brandenberg or Salmonella typhimurium. INFECTIOUS DISEASE Smallpox The Public Health (Aircraft) (Amendment) Regulations, 1963, amending the Public Health (Aircraft and Ships) Regulations, 1952 - 1961, enable port health officers to require the production of international certificates of vaccination against smallpox. If a person has not a certificate he may be offered vaccination, or may be placed under surveillance or in isolation. Experience has shown that travellers coming to this borough, not holding valid certificates, refuse vaccination and prefer to be kept under surveillance for sixteen days. 56 During 1964, 124 notifications were received from port health authorities, and all persons involved were contacted once every other day during the period of surveillance. No case of smallpox was notified in the borough during 1964. The Ministry of Health's memorandum on vaccination against smallpox recommends that public health officers likely to have to deal with cases of smallpox at short notice should be regularly revaccinated at not more than yearly intervals. During the year, thirty-seven members of the staff of the Public Health Department were vaccinated or revaccinated by the Medical Officer of Health. Scarlet Fever The number of cases notified in 1964 was fourteen. There was no fatal case during the year. Diphtheria No case of diphtheria was notified during the year. Enteric Fever During the year, five cases of paratyphoid fever and two cases of typhoid fever were notified. The first case of paratyphoid fever was a 22-year old Pakistani who arrived in this country, via Germany, on 13th December, 1963. He felt unwell on the l6th and was admitted to hospital on 24th December; faeces specimens taken proved positive. He discharged himself from hospital on 3rd January, and returned to Pakistan by air on 5th January, 1964. Three other cases were females (unknown, to each other) aged 19, 22 and 26 years old, who were admitted to hospital between 8th and 10th June, 1964. All lived near to South Kensington Station, but the only connection between any of the cases was that two of them had eaten food at the same restaurant. Enquiries at the restaurant showed that only fresh cream, milk and meat were used. The staff (22) of the restaurant submitted faeces and urine specimens, all of which proved negative. The fifth case of paratyphoid fever was a 15-year old girl who arrived from France on 18th Augusts, 1964, and was admitted to hospital on the same day. She had a history of "fever" for four days prior to admission to hospital. She was found to be a "carrier" of the disease. She was discharged from hospital on 9th September and returned to Belgium and was advised that further treatment was necessary,, A letter to this effect was given to the patient and a further letter was sent to her father in Belgium advising that she should contact her own doctor. The first case of typhoid fever was a child aged 2¾ years who was admitted to hospital. All contacts submitted faeces and urine specimens which proved negative. Blood specimens submitted by the mother (who stated that she had had typhoid in the 1940's and received no treatment) and a cousin, who had previously been in hospital with a high temperature of unknown origin, were negative. As there was a possibility that the child may have been infected by grandparents who had returned to Germany, the German authorities were officially requested to arrange for specimens to be submitted. It was reported that all specimens were negative. The second case of typhoid fever was a 19-year old female who was admitted to hospital, having just returned from Beirut where she had been residing for the previous twenty-one months. She complained of high temperature, backache and vomiting, and stated that she had received treatment for "paratyphoid". No contacts were involved. 57 Puerperal Pyrexia During 1964, the number of cases of this disease notified was 86, of whom 53 were persons normally resident outside Kensington. All cases occurred in hospital. In order to show some perspective in reviewing the incidence of puerperal pyrexia (defined as any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4°F. or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage), the following table gives an analysis of the causes of pyrexia in the notified cases:- Cause No. of cases Breast infections 7 Urinary infections 37 Respiratory infection 5 Genital tract infections 6 Post operative 1 Causes unknown after investigation 30 Total 86 In addition to the foregoing, information was received concerning 31 patients normally resident in Kensington, who were notified as suffering from puerperal pyrexia in other London districts. No death occurred under this heading. Pneumonia There are various forms of pneumonia, but the only types notifiable are (i) acute primary, and (ii) acute influenzal pneumonia. During the year, 19 notifications were received, 17 being acute primary pneumonia and 2 being acute influenzal pneumonia. During the year, the number of deaths from pneumonia (all forms) was 69, and the number of deaths from influenza was one. Dysentery Thirty-one cases of dysentery were notified during 1964, all of which were bacillary in origin, the majority being due to the Sonne bacillus. Generally speaking, the cases were of a mild type and there were no deaths. Eleven of these patients were treated in hospital. Erysipelas Three cases were notified during the year. There were no deaths. Meningococcal Infection One case of this disease was notified during the year and was removed to hospital. Malaria Four cases of malaria were reported during the year, but investigations showed that the patients had recently been abroad and presumably had contracted infection overseas. Poliomyelitis No case of acute poliomyelitis was notified during the year. The figures for the last ten years are as follows:- 58 Year Confirmed cases Deaths 1955 30 Nil 1956 21 Nil 1957 15 1 1958 4 Nil 1959 8 Nil 1960 3 Nil 1961 7 Nil 1962 3 Nil 1963 1 Nil 1964 - Nil Acute Encephalitis No case of acute encephalitis was notified during the year. Measles Of the 378 cases notified during 1964, 11 cases were admitted to hospital for treatment. One death occurred during the year. Ophthalmia neonatorum Three babies were notified during 1964; one was treated at home, and two were treated in hospital. Information was also received of one baby born to a Kensington mother in hospital outside the borough, who contracted the disease. All the babies recovered without injury to sight. Gastro-enteritis This disease is notifiable in children up to the age of five years. The number of cases reported during the year was three. Two were removed to hospital for treatment. Scabies The number of scabies notified during 1964 was 4l. Tuberculosis During the year, 117 new cases of tuberculosis were notified, of which 96 were respiratory and 21 non-respiratory. The following table shows the number of cases added to and the number removed from the notification register during the years- Respiratory NonRespiratory Total MFMF On register of notifications on 1st January, 1964 640 465 63 85 1,253 Notified for the first time during the year 60 36 7 14 117 Brought to notice other than by notification 35 29 2 2 68 Removed from register on account of having - (a) recovered 40 28 7 3 78 (b) removed from district, lost sight of, etc. 123 93 12 12 240 (c) died 10 7 - 17 Remaining on register on 31st December, 1964 562 402 53 86 1,103 - 59 - The system of investigation into the environmental conditions of tuberculous patients continued during the year. All newly notified cases and those cases transferring into Kensington or changing their address in the borough, have been visited by the public health inspectors with the object of tracing the source of infection, preventing the spread of infection and removing conditions favourable to infection. Particular attention was given to the home conditions in addition to the dissemination of advice to prevent the transmission of infection to contacts. During the year, 226 visits were paid to the homes of tuberculous patients. In 124 of these, the environmental conditions were such as to require no further action on the part of the Public Health Department; in a further 4l cases, it was found that the patients had moved away; and in 31 other cases the investigations were postponed as the patients were away in hospital or had not been contacted by the end of the year. The action taken in the remaining 30 cases is summarised as follows :- Action or supervision Cases Investigation or supervisioin undertaken in respect of:- Prevention of spread of infection 13 Recommended for priority rehousing 7 Action taken under Public Health and Housing Acts in respect of insanitary or unhealthy conditions 10 Incidence of tuberculosis amongst Kensington residents who originated from areas outside England, Scotland and Wales In my Annual Report for 1951, attention was drawn to what appeared to be a disturbing trend in the incidence of tuberculosis amongst immigrants. Since 1952, a more detailed investigation of this problem has taken place, and the following table sets out the information found in 1964:- Country of origin Period (in years) between entry to U.K. and notification of disease Total 1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9[10 India 2 1 2 1 1 - - - - - 7 Portugal - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 West Indies - 3 1 3 - - - - - - 7 Ireland 3 1 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 9 Prance - - 1- - - - - - - 1 Japan 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 Nigeria 3 - 1 - - - - - - - 4 Hungary - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 British Guiana 1 - - - - - 1 - - - 2 Italy 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 Spain 2 2 - - - - - - - - 4 Canada 2 - - - - - - - - - 2 Pakistan 1 - 1 - - - - - - - 2 N.

The total of 181 cases surveyed differs from the total of tuberculous patients visited in the year. The difference consisted of old cases changing residence within the borough. In 1951, a full survey was not made, but it was estimated that twenty per cent of the tuberculous patients visited for the first time in that year were immigrants who contracted the disease within ten years of arrival in this country. A more accurate investigation in the following years indicated that, of the new cases and "inward transfers" reported in the borough, the proportions who were immigrants contracting the disease in the first ten years of arrival were as follows Year Proportion per cent 1952 16 1953 10 1954 16 1955 17 1956 15 1957 16 1958 23 1959 20 I960 20 1961 11 1962 20 1963 27 1964 23 This year, 40 per cent (1963 - 26 per cent) of the infected immigrants contracted the disease within one year of arrival in this country; 77 per cent (1963 - 62 per cent) contracted it within three years of arrival. Persons born in the Republic of Ireland were regarded as immigrants for this purpose. - 61 - Whooping Cough Thirty-five cases were notified during the year - two being treated in hospital. International Certificates In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, certain countries require that visitors should be vaccinated or inoculated against specified diseases. International certificates have been prescribed for smallpox, yellow fever and cholera. When completed by the medical practitioner, the certificates must be authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During the year, 4,547 of these certificates were authenticated in Kensington. In addition, 55 special exemption certificates were issued to travellers for use in North America. Notifications The following tables show (l) the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year 1964 with comparative figures for the previous seven years; (2) the number of notifications divided into age groups; and (3) the number of cases notified in each ward of the borough:— TABLE 1 Notifiable disease Number of cases notified 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 Scarlet fever 14 9 15 30 29 54 27 33 Diphtheria (including membranous croup) - - - 1 - - - - Enteric fever 7 7 2 3 8 6 5 5 Puerperal pyrexia 86 74 103 168 138 112 116 123 Acute primary pneumonia and acute influenzal pneumonia 19 13 20 28 16 60 70 75 dysentery 31 36 57 97 71 110 117 77 Erysipelas 3 2 7 5 9 6 11 7 Meningococcal infection 1 4 - 2 4 2 6 3 Malaria 4 3 3 1 2 1 1 5 Acute poliomyelitis: Paralytic - 1 2 6 3 7 2 13 Non-paralytic - - 1 1 - 1 2 2 Acute encephalitis - - 1 - - 1 1 3 Tuberculosis (all forms) 117 151 160 195 164 194 179 208 Measles 378 944 269 1497 457 737 654 982 Ophthalmia neonatorum 3 4 3 5 6 1 5 1 arteritis* 3 3 13 14 9 7 13 10 Pood Poisoning 40 31 18 42 40 65 47 52 Scabies 41 33 18 25 28 42 52 52 Whooping cough 35 79 22 30 154 83 92 130 TOTALS 782 1394 714 2150 1138 1489 1400 1781 * Notifiable only in children under the age of 5• NOTE: Cases of mistaken diagnosis are excluded from the above table. - 62 - TABLE 2 Notifiable disease Number of cases notified in 1964 Age groups in years Under 1 1 to 2 3 to 4 5 to 9 10 to 14 15 to 24 25 and over Scarlet fever - 1 1 8 1 3 - Diphtheria (including membranous croup) _ - - - - - - Enteric fever - - 1 - - 5 1 Puerperal pyrexia - - - - - 50 36 Acute primary pneumonia and acute influenzal pneumonia 1 - - 2 - - 16 Dysentery - 8 4 4 - 5 10 Erysipelas - - - - - 1 2 Meningococcal infection 1 - - - - - - Malaria - - - - - 1 3 Acute poliomyelitis: Paralytic - - - - - - - Tuberculosis (all forms) - 2 3 7 - 21 84 Measles 27 97 107 124 9 10 4 Ophthalmia neonatorum 3 - - - - - - Enteritis 2 - 1 - - - - Food Poisoning 9 3 3 1 - 5 19 Scabies - 1 - 3 3 21 13 Whooping cough 8 11 8 8 - - - TOTALS 51 123 128 157 13 122 188 TABLE 3 Notifiable disease Total cases notified in each Ward in 1964 St.Charles Golborne Norland Pembridge Holland Earl's Court Queen1s Gate Redcliffe Brompton Scarlet fever 4 6 - 2 1 - - 1 - Diphtheria (including membranous croup) - - - - - - - - - enteric fever - - - 1 - - 2 2 2 Puerperal Pyrexia 4 3 4 3 5 11 53 2 1 Acute primary pneumonia and acute influenzal pneumonia 6 2 3 3 2 1 - - 2 Dysentery 5 3 9 5 3 - 3 1 2 Erysipelas - 1 - 1 1 - - - - Meningococcal infection - - 1 - - - - - - Malaria - - - 1 - 1 - 2 - Acute poliomyelitis: Paralytic - - - - - - - - - Tuberculosis (all forms) 28 27 10 20 8 10 2 9 3 Measles 72 108 36 66 32 33 8 18 5 Ophthalmia neonatorum _ 2 - 1 - - - - - Enteritis - 2 - - - - - 1 - Food Poisoning 9 5 5 9 4 3 - 3 2 Scabies 8 8 4 12 1 3 2 2 1 Whooping cough 10 16 3 - 1 - 2 2 1 - 63 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT. 1936 Nuisances During the year, 90 summonses were issued for various nuisances under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936.
