6753 ench BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFEICER of HEALTH for the year 1885. . 6752 ench TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. GENTLEMEX, I hare the honour to submit to you my Report on the health and Sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1885. The number of Births registered in the District daring that period was 2,121, a number somewhat lower than the average for the ten yean 1875-84. The Birth rate wan 36 per 1,000, the Metropolitan Birth rata having been 32.6 per 1,000 of the population. The Deaths in the District during the year exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the District, but inclusive of those residents which occurred in 2 Public Institutions situated beyond the limits of the District, amounted to 1,490. This is a number slightly higher than the average of the ten years 1875-84. The Rate of Mortality was 25.4 per 1,000 the Metropolitan rate having been 19.7 per 1,000 population and the rate for the Eastern District 22.1 per 1,000. The Deaths of children under one constituted 23 per cent., and those of children under 5 year 42 per cent. of the total deaths. The total number of Deaths in Public Institutions amounted to 376, a number far in excess of any previously reported by me. This arises from my having availed myself of increased facilities for obtaining exact returns of such deaths, such facilities having only recently been available. Diseases of a Zymotic Character caused the deaths of 280 persons; and included -'2 from Smallpox, of which number 3 were returned as vaccinated, 14 as unvaccinated, and in 5 cases no state- ment was made, 87 from Measles, 32 from Scarlet Fever, 49 from Whooping Cough, 20 from Diphtheria, 11 from Typhoid Fever, 42 from Diarrhœa, and 8 from Erysipelas. The rate of Mortality from the seven principal diseases of this class was 4.5 par 1000 of population. Constitutional Diseases caused the deaths of 288 persons; and included 33 from Cancer, 47 from Mesenterica, 42 from Tubercular Meningitis, 141 from Phthisis. The rate of Mortality in this class was 4.9 per 1,000 population. 3 Developmental Diseases caused 102 deaths, among which are included 22 from Premature Birth, and 77 from Old Age. Local Diseases caused the deaths of 706 persons, and included 44 from Apoplexy and allied disease, 11 from Epilepsy, 40 from Convulsions, 84 from Disease of the Heart, 196 from Bronchitis and 111 from Pneumonia. The death rate from diseases of this class was 12 per 1,000 population. Violence caused 70 deaths, of which 18 were due to Fractures and Contusions, 28 to Drowning, and 15 to Suffocation. Sanitary Work, &c. The usual house to house inspection was carried on regularly throughout the year, and resulted in the inspection of 3,581 house*, and the service of 2,216 orders for Sanitary Amendments. In addition to this inspection 1,178 houses let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family were examined and registered under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act of 1866. The Bakehouses, Cow House*, and Slaughter Houses were regularly inspected, and the provisions of the Canal Boats Act were enforced These proceedings however indicate but briefly the activity which prevailed in this department and for a detailed list of the work done I beg to refor you to Table VI. My Official Representation, under the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings' Acts, concerning the Angel Gardens area in Shadwell 4 was by the instruction of the secretary of State for Home for Home Affairs, the subject of an enquiry by Mr. Cubitt Nichols. This was an enquiry into the correctness of my Representaltion, and was held in the Board Boom at your Offices. It commenced on 16th April. lasted all day, and was adjourned to the 25th, when, after again lasting all day, it was closed. Toward, the end of the year, nothing further having transpired. the Board addressed a letter to the Home Secretary requesting him to call the attention of the Meteropolitan Board to the great delay, and to ask then to come to a speedy decision. Up to the present time no decision has been communicated to your Board, although I believe there is no doubt about the correctness of my Replantation. Cow and Slaughter Houses. These structures were again licensed after conforming with the requirements of the Board. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. Ninety-nine samples of Food and Drugs were examined at the Laboratory. Of these 8 were Coffees, 1 of which was adulterated with Chicory to the extent of 25 per cent. Twenty-seven were Milks, of which three were mixed with. Two were Cocoas, of which one was mixed with Sago. Six were Quinines, of which one contained a small quantity of Cinchonine. Eight were Butters, of which one was adulterated with 86 per cent. of foreign fat, and six were Mustards, of which 1 was mixed with 40 per cent. of 5 Wheat Flour and coloured with Turmeric. The remaining samples consisting of Bread, Flour, Pepper, Gin, Rhubarb, Beer and Vinegar were genuine. I have pleasure in acknowledging the great assistance I have received from the Inspector* who have carried out my instructions in an intelligent and satisfactory manner. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your moat obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst.
