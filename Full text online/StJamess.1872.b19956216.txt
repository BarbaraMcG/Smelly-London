EDWARD HENRY EDWARDS, General Report of Works executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1872-73. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1873. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, In presenting one more General Report of the Works executed in the Surveyor's Department, but little need be added beyond the general lists of the main works executed; the matters carried out in this Department differ in some respects from the others, that inasmuch as they all involve an expenditure of the Public or Ratepayer's money, it necessarily follows that in any well regulated establishment, all expenditure is carefully considered and arranged beforehand, and the Vestry of St. James's—especially their Works Committee, in whom a large amount of confidence is most justly 14 placed—very properly "count the cost" before any outlay is incurred; unless, indeed, it happens to be a matter where delay or dilatoriness would be culpable. The result is that but little can be done without an amount of deliberation at the time, and such proper records retained, that render any recapitulation of the same in the shape of a General Report superfluous, as all the Members of the Vestry, especially those who take upon themselves the more important duties are perfectly "au fait," and intimately acquainted with the minutest detail of all the transactions in connexion with the execution of works; so much so that it would be hardly an exaggeration to state, that they not only satisfy themselves as to the necessity of the works in the first instance, but also satisfy themselves that they are actually carried out in a substantial and thoroughly satisfactory manner; and the fact that these details are seen to at the time is the best guarantee that neither extravagance or neglect can occur in works executed by the Vestry, or under the superintendence of the Works Committee. The responsibility of purely Professional—Technical or Constructive—matters must of necessity fall upon the Surveyor, and I am grateful and thankful to be 15 able to report that hitherto no "accidents" have occurred (to use the mildest term) that might have been avoided. After these few observations as to the general Supervision of Works by the Works Committee, in every Member of which Ratepayers can place the fullest confidence, there are really only two matters to which it is advisable to refer, and those are the introduction, on a limited scale, of Wood Paving, and Asphalte. The piece, or specimen of Wood Paving has been laid down in Charles Street, St. James's Square. The circumstances under which both were done are so fresh in all memories that I do not propose to do more than refer to the matters, and ask the Vestry to be kind enough to watch for themselves the practical results of each. The Wood Paving has, I believe, answered the purpose for which it was laid; personally I am of opinion that it cannot be improved in itself, but that a little more is required to be done to obviate the only "hitch" I see, and that is the percolation of water; this could be easily overcome, and does not in any way invalidate the ingenuity or usefulness and general success of the scheme. But facts must and indeed should be looked fairly in the 16 face, and difficulties of any kind overcome. I still hope the specimen will induce the Vestry to adopt it further, after satisfying themselves of its advantages. The piece in Charles Street cannot he considered as a test, but there are other places that can be, and time will not be thrown away in watching those places as opportunities may occur. The position in which the piece of Asphalte, "Barnett's Patent," has been laid in Piccadilly, is one specially adapted to try its qualities fairly, as there is just the kind of traffic (footway) to test any kind of material. The surface produced is all that could be required, and the rapid manner in which wet and moisture disappears, is an incalculable advantage especially in a position or situation where a vast number of people have to wait for public vehicles. In this instance as in the Wood Pavement, the test that will be submitted, will I hope lead to satisfactory results and further adoption, as the maintenance of footways in busy thoroughfares is becoming a more serious matter than is generally understood; in fact they cannot be readily understood, the change within the last ten years and the increase of wear and tear being almost incredible, po say nothing of the generally increasing and 17 commendable idea of pleasing appearances being combined with utility. Although the whole of the Worts connected with such a Parish as St. James's are very important, and the duties connected with finding out what is necessary, reporting, and executing, are very onerous and constantly on the increase, (indeed the increase since I have had the honor of being in office is astonishing), still considering the manner in which everything is discussed beforehand, a repetition of the various matters would not result in any practical benefit. A portion of one Sewer has been re-constructed, and several New Gullies with Pits built; a great number still require to be done, and the Local Sewers in some neighbourhoods are anything but perfection, still care and attention have been successful in avoiding accidents, and as a little is done every year, in course of time the whole may be made as perfect as is practicable, by which time some method of disposing of House Refuse may be found that will render much of the present uses of Sewers useless. The Regent Street Drainage is the only portion as to which I entertain apprehensions of any sudden failure of a serious nature. B 18 Before closing this short Summary or Report, I find every year more and more cause to regret the want of Public Conveniences, not, of course, personally, but on behalf of the Public; the circumstances connected with my office compelling attention to the subject. In saying this it is with the full conviction, founded on experience, that the Vestry of St. James's have done their utmost hitherto, and I trust will eventually succeed in accomplishing the required result; so much has ended in failure that it is almost discouraging, but if the ice can be broken and proper accommodation of the kind provided, I am sure it will lead to many others, that we shall all be surprised that none were done before. I trust that next year I shall have the pleasure of reporting the completion of at least one, if not more, of such constructions, which if not ornamental are decidedly more than useful, that is, essential, and which if not models of perfection will be an advance upon the hideous erections that now do duty and are so justly complained of; certainly beyond their utility nothing or very little can be said in their favour. This is the only matter in which we have been 19 compulsorily idle. In every other department it has been a very busy year, more having been done from various causes than I ever remember before— though I do not anticipate any diminution in the future, and the Public look for more and more every year. The Rupert Street extension can hardly be classed among the ordinary works or duties of a Vestry, and I have not put the amount in the List, as it is almost a public matter. Still to a certain extent it has been carried out and is a matter for great congratulation, as the general continuation of the street will certainly follow, and will prove a greater benefit to the Neighbourhood, the Parish, and the Public, than is at present credited or imagined. Thanking you for the continued confidence of another year, I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir, my Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble servant, ALBERT P.

T0 THE VESTEY OF The Parish of St. James's, Mestminster. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, It now becomes my duty, for the seventeenth time, to lay before you the number and causes of the deaths in the Parish in the year 1872, and to present you with a summary of the work under my direction; to which I beg to add a few observations of my own. I am happy to feel that my remarks will be shorter than usual, as the past year has witnessed the termination of one of the largest and fiercest epidemics known to London during the century, and, at the same time, a remarkable diminution in the existence and fatality of other epidemic diseases. 28 General Mortality of the Parish in 1872. The deaths for fifty-two weeks of 1872, was six hundred and fifty-five. This is the smallest death rate that has been recorded for any year since 1866. This number, however, includes the death of a large number of individuals who have died in the Workhouse, who had been brought from the Parish of St. Anne's, Soho; if these be deducted, a still smaller bill of mortality is presented. Thus, Deaths in St. James's, Westminster, - 655 ,, from St. Anne's Soho 35 620 The deaths from St. Anne's, Soho, have been respectively, 1869 41 1870 38 1871 41 1872 35 The average death rate for St. Anne's has been 39 per annum. The average death rate of the Parish for the last sixteen years has been fourteen a week; whilst during 29 the year 1872, they did not reach, on the average, twelve a week. The whole number of lives saved, as against the average deaths of the Parish, which has been 730, is one hundred and ten. This is a very large saving, and one which I would remind you is entirely independent of the decrease of the population. The death rate is therefore but one in fifty-one of the whole population, or 19.6 in the 1.000. Although not a death rate incapable of diminution, it shows a considerable decrease in the mortality of preceding years. It also shows very favourably in comparison with the death rate of all London for 1872, which was 21.5 in the 1,000. Comparing the death rate of St. James's with other cities and towns in England in 1872, out of seventy of the largest cities and towns in England there are only seven that presented a lower rate of mortality, and these were Cheltenham, Hastings, Maidstone, Chatham, Reading, Oxford, and Colchester. The mortality of St. James's, Westminster, with its crowded courts and streets, and over crowded Berwick Street division, was less than that of Brighton, Devonport, Southampton, Chester, Worcester, York, Tynemouth, Exeter, Gosport, or Plymouth. Its death rate is also less than that of any of the great cities of Europe, whose statistics are supplied to the Registrar General. The following table enables us to compare the death rate of 1872 with the two last years, arranged in order that the age at death may be seen, 30 1870. Under 1 Year. Above 1 and under 5. Above 5 and under 20. Above 20 and under 40. Above 40 and under 60. Above GO and under 80. Above 80.

The diminution is more remarkable in the ages of above one 31 year and under four years. Thus, in 1870, 226 children under one year died; in 1871, 164; and in 1872 only 149. Of children above one year and under five, there died in 1870, 112; in 1871, 95; and in 1872 only 86. The death rate of childhood is perhaps the best test of the healthiness of a district, and the diminishing ratio of death amongst the young an indication of the improved sanitary condition of a district. I have often pointed out the heavy infant mortality of our Parish as compared with others. The mortality of 1872 was 24 per cent. of the whole mortality of the Parish, and 17.5 per cent. of the whole of the children born in the Parish The death rate being calculated at 618, and the birth rate at 855. This is a lower death rate than any previous year for 17 years. The death rate of infants under one year of age in eighteen of the largest towns in England and Wales was 27.6 per cent. to the death rate, and 17.5 per cent. to the whole of the children horn. I put down some of the lowest and highest of these death rates of children under one year, from the Registrar General's Return for 1872. Per centage of Deaths to Births. Per centago to Deaths. London 15.9 26.3 Portsmouth 14.6 21.3 Liverpool 22.2 31.7 Leicester 22 8 35.0 Bristol 15.1 24.3 Saint James, Westminster 17.5 24.1 32 So that you see our per centage of the deaths to the births is greater than all London, although it is less than any large town. At the same time it demands investigation. In order to discover where our infant death rate is greatest, I have counted the deaths in one year in every district of the Parish separately, and find the result as follows: Deaths under the Yeae in Disteicts of the Parish or St. James, "Westminster. Deaths. Per centage. Population. St. James's Sq. Div. 39 19 10,443 Golden Square Div. 40 26 12,855 Workhouse 14 16 Berwick Street Div. 56 35 10,279 149 96 33,587 It will at once be be seen from these figures that the largest mortality of these babes fall upon the Berwick Street district, the most populous and over crowded of the three districts ; whilst the St. James's Square district has the least. I have often in the course of my Annual Reports had to call your attention to the health of the Berwick Street district. Whilst the deaths of St. James's Square is 14 in the thousand; of Golden Square 21 in the thousand; that of Berwick Street division is still 25 in the 1,000. The cause of this mortality is undoubtedly overcrowding ; and this is the cause of infant mortality as well as of other diseases, such 33 as consumption and diseases of the lungs, of which I have before spoken. In 1867 I took the opportunity of calculating the extent of the over crowding of this district, for the purpose of carrying out the "Regulations" for Lodging Houses, under the Sanitary Act of 1866. I then said that, in order to carry out in your Parish the "Regulations" with regard to cubic space, that at least 7000 persons must have been removed from their homes. Nor would this have been the whole of the evil, for if these 7,000 persons had been, for the sake of their health, compelled to get rooms somewhere else, they would have been obliged to leave the Parish altogether. They must, therefore, have gone to the surrounding parishes, to have increased the overcrowding there, or have been expelled to suburban districts, where it would have been impossible for them to carry on their occupations. It is in this way that, I believe, a large amount of pauperism has been caused in London, by persons being driven from the locality in which they were capable of earning a maintenance, to districts where they have no means of employment. It seems then to me that till the time comes when it shall be seen necessary to erect proper dwellings for the poor in this and other parishes of London, that we must submit to overcrowding, with all its physical degiadation and moral pollution, as a lesser evil than driving men, women, and children into the streets, and to places far away from their work, and the exercise of that industry by which alone they can be kept from 34 destitution and pauperism. In this conclusion I was encouraged by the Vestry, and the work of depopulation has only been carried on in cases where immediate necessity demanded it. Since I made the above remarks, an Act has passed the Legislature, under the direction of Mr. McCullagh Torrens, Member for Finsbury. This Act provides that when dwellings are considered by a Local Board unfitted for the residences of human beings, that they can direct the landlord to pull down the said buildings without compensation to the owner, or any provision for the accommodation of the present tenants. It is scarcely necessary to say that such an Act could not be acted upon without the grossest injustice to the owners of property, and the infliction of the greatest hardship on the poor. The fact is, the original Bill of Mr. Torrens contained clauses for compensation and rebuilding. Mr. Torrens, speaking at a meeting of the Charity Organization Society, said: "He would like to see the excluded provisions brought again before the Upper House, putting it before the Lords that the Bill had contained four provisions—viz, compulsory repair, demolition, compensation, and rebuilding. The Lords had considered the last two unnecessary, and the experiment had therefore been tried with only the first two. There was nothing more unreal, more provokingly preposterous, or more repulsive to the working-classes than the idea that the best thing was to clear them out of the town and drive them into the country. It could not be done. They might be forced to overcrowdhouses to any extent near their work, but they would not go away, and to drive them out would be to sever wealth and poverty, and disorganise the social system. He was not pledged 35 to any one mode of accomplishing this object; he only wished to see a practical scheme. The amendments of the Act, as embodied in the resolutions passed, were to the effect that the report of the medical officer of health, condemning certain houses as unfit for human habitation, should be forwarded to the Local Government Board, or to the Metropolitan Board of Works, when so authorised, in order that a medical inspector should examine the premises and report thereon, previous to the reference to the surveyor of the local authority; that whenever land was made vacant by the removal of dwellings under the provisions of the Act, power should be given either to the Metropolitan Board or to the local authority to require owners to sell the land, by arbitration, to any private association or public body for the purpose of erecting new dwellings for the poorer classes under suitable restrictions; and that when the premises have been demolished and a site cleared, and no sufficient offer shall have been made by private persons for the purchase of the site, within a specified limited period, the local authority shall report the facts to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who shall be empowered and required to purchase the site by arbitration, and to arrange for the erection of dwellings for the poorer classes on it. The Board should also be required to sell the building so soon as sufficient offer had been made under stipulations guaranteeing the maintenance of the dwellings for the poorer classes, and that the balance or less be carried to the account of the rates of the metropolis."—The Metropolitan. I trust that this Society will do all in their power to see that an amendment embodying Mr. Torrens' suggestions for the improvement of the Bill may be speedily introduced into Parliament. In spite of the objectionable character of this Bill in its author's own estimation, you will see by referring to your minutes, that two Vestries in London—St. George the Martyr, Southwark, and St. Giles, Camberwell—have succeeded, with the 36 sanction of the magistrates in Surrey, in destroying a quantity of useful property in these parishes. Your notice has been called to these cases as I had been employed to examine the condemned premises. The property thus sacrificed had been grossly neglected by the landlord, who, against the provisions of the Sanitary Act, had allowed it to become dirty, neglected, and overcrowded. If such property were condemned in all other parts of London, it would involve the destruction of half the metropolis, including the unsanitary homes of the rich as well as the poor. If we would avoid the poor turning round, and legislating on these principles for the rich, we should take care that the reduction of rates and the getting rid of the poor are not the motives for driving the poor from their homes. Zymotic Disease. This group of diseases is always the most interesting, because there is a well grounded opinion that they are preventible. That they are not prevented is not so much the fault of the law and the authorities as the apathy and ignorance of the public. These diseases are all of them capable of spreading from one person to another, or are generated by agencies external to the human body. The public generally, however, believe that most of these diseases, as measles, scarlet fever, and hooping cough must be taken once in a life, and the sooner children have them the better. Hence the difficulty of getting any one to take precautions. People fly from the bedside of infected persons and go to their 37 duties in life covered with the invisible germs of disease, and spread it in all directions among those who have not had an attack. Thus, a melancholy amount of life is destroyed every year. Our annual bill against these diseases for the last eighteen years, is as follows:- Table of Zymotic Disease foe 18 Years.

The amount of disease in this year is in excess of the average. It will be also found that Small Pox, Measles, Hooping Cough, and Diarrhoea were beyond the average; whilst Typhus and Scarlet Fever were below the average. The distribution of Zymotics in the four quarters of the year will be seen in the following table: First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Total. Small Pox 2 2 .... 2 6 Measles. 14 4 2 4 24 Scarlet Fever and Diptheria 2 2 1 1 0 Whooping Cough 13 7 3 7 30 Fever 6 1 1 .... 8 Diarrhœa 2 4 18 4 28 Total 39 20 25 18 102 This table shows that Hooping Cough and Measles are more prevalent during the colder months of the year; whilst Diarrhoea is most prevalent during the summer quarter.

Saint James's Square Division, - 15 Golden Square ,, - 43 Berwick Street ,, - 32 Workhouse - - 12 102 This table brings out an unlooked for result, and yet not perhaps an unaccountable one, and that is the greater prevalence of Zymotic disease in the Golden Square district. The explanation of this is to be probably found in the fact that the inhabitants of this district do not as a rule have recourse to parochial medical relief, as those do who live in Berwick Street; consequently there is less medical attendance, and the existence of Zymotic disease, which can be so easily arrested when measures are taken soon enough, is not made known to the Medical Officer of Health. Although Zymotic diseases are more likely to spread in an overcrowded district, yet they can be easily prevented spreading by isolation and the proper use of disinfectants. Small Pox. 1871 saw one of the most extensive epidemics of Small Pox known in this kingdom since the introduction of vaccination. In my last Report I gave 41 a full account of this epidemic up to the end of 1871. The cases of Small Pox recorded this year extended to the end of September, but their fatality was greatly diminished as compared with the disease in 1871. The following table gives an analysis of the causes of Small Pox and their results in 1871 and 1872: 1871. 1872. Number of cases - 230 72 Reported as vaccinated - 210 59 Unvaccinated 15 9 Re-vaccinated 3 9 Total Deaths 33 9 The total deaths from Small Pox here recorded are above the deaths registered in the Parish, as they give the deaths of persons who have died in the various hospitals. I calculated that a third of all the cases of Small Pox that have occurred during the years 1870-1-2 have been taken to hospitals. In the three years we have had In 1870 3 deaths. In 1871 3 „ In 1872 9 „ 45 This amount of death is very small as compared with the deaths from the same cause in other parts of London, and in many towns and cities of Great Britain. In proportion to the number of cases, the 42 deaths were, in 1871, as 1 in 7, but in 1872, they were as 1 in 8. The lesson of the great epidemic of Small Pox is the necessity for vaccination. Whilst the deaths of vaccinated and doubtful cases of vaccination has not been more than 5 per cent., or 1 in 20, of those attacked, it has been found that above 50 per cent., or more than half, of all those who were unvaccinated have died. The history of no other disease supplies so assuredly and necessarily the means of its entire destruction. If people were instructed, and Governments wise, Small Pox need not be known to exist at the end of the present century. Adulteration of Food. The improved Adulteration of Food Act not having come into operation till the present year 1873, I have nothing to report of its operation in 1872. I may now state that frequent applications were made in 1872 for the analysis of suspected food, and on three occasions food exposed for sale was seized and condemned during the year 1872. Sanitary Work of the Year 1872. The work done by the Sanitary Inspector and his assistant during the year 1872 is given in the table in the Appendix. From this you will see the immense amount of work done in the Parish by 43 them, and under their directions; work which could not otherwise have been done, and which cannot but have prevented a vast amount of disease and misery if not of death. I cannot but attribute the decreased mortality of the last two years to your wise determination, to keep up the Sanitary Department to a standard, by which not only known nuisances and causes of disease are at once removed, but the homes of the poor inspected, and the very beginnings of the causes of disease and death removed. I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. APPENDIX containing PAGE 1. Table of Causes of Death 46 2.
