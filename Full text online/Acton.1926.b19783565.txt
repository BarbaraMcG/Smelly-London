ACT 29 1926 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1926 1926 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1926. Municipal Offices, Acton, W.3. july, 1927. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report for the year 1926 on the health of the Borough, together with the work of the Public Health Department. The vital statistics for the year are satisfactory. The death-rate is low; there has been a fall in the infantile mortality ratr and the district has been comparatively free from infectious disease. With the exception of an outbreak of Measles which burred in the early part of the year, the incidence of infectious disease has been remarkably low. So far, Acton, in common other London districts, has been free from the mild type of small-pox which has been so prevalent in the Midlands and northern towns. As regards general sanitary work, it cannot be said that very satisfactory results have been obtained with Meat Regulations. An attempt has been made here to enforce theRegulations, but their interpretation is difficult and the Court of Quarter Sessions allowed the appeal of the butchers against the decision of the local magistrates. The chief complaint, though, arises out of the want of uniformity in the enforcement of the Regulations. Immediately outside the district, it is possible to see meat and other foodstuffs coming under the Regulations. exposed on the street pavements. If some uniformity could be arrived at, a good deal of the difficulty which is expeienced by authorities that take an interest in clean food might be obviated. 4 The following table is a summary of the vital and other statistics for the year 1926. Population (Census 1921) 61,299 Population (estimated 1926) 63,040 Area of Borough .... 2,305 acres. Assessable Value (district rate) £516,616. Net produce of a Penny Rate £2,192. Birth-rate 17.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. Death-rate (all causes) 10.4 ,, ,, ,, Tubercular Death-rate 1.04 ,, ,, ,, Death-rate from Pulmonary Tuberculosis 9 ,, ,, ,, Cancer death-rate 1.25 ,, ,, ,, Infantile Mortality 55 per 1000 births. POPULATION. The Registrar General estimates the population at the end of June 1926 to be 63„040, a decrease of 70 on the population of 1925. At the Census which was taken on June 19th, 1921, the actual number enumerated was 61,299. Owing to the abnormally fine weather in the summer of that year, some holiday movement was already in progress, and the Registrar General, from figures at his disposal, made certain adjustments in the population of certain districts. The adjusted figure for Acton was 62,000. The estimated increase in the population since the Census is 1,040. In a memorandum, the Registrar General states that the estimate of population as at June 30th, 1926 is supplied for use in connection with the vital statistics of 1926. It has been derived from the 1921 Census population (corrected where necessary to give a closer approximation to the resident population of the year as described in the Registrar General's Statistical Review for 1921) after allowance for the births, deaths and migration which occurred between the census date and June 30th, 1926. In the absence of definite information regarding migration between localities, the allowance made for this element of the movement is necessarily an approximate one. The method adopted has been applied impartially to all areas in the country and it is believed that for the majority of areas the resulting populations may be accepted as sufficiently accurate for the purposes they are intended to serve. It is to be observed, however, that the basis of estimation has been modified from time to time in the light of accumulated 5 evidence regarding the effect of the migration factor and in some areas there may accordingly appear to be a lack of continuity between the estimates of successive post-censal years. The estimate of population is believed to provide as true a measure of the position in June last as the data permit, but the difference between the figure and the corresponding estimate for 1925 is not necessarily representative of the births, deaths and migration which occurred between the 30th June, 1925 and the 30th June, 1926. As the Registrar General has explained in his memorandum, the method has been applied impartially by him to all areas in the country. Of the large towns in the outer ring of London, in six instances only does he estimate that an increase has occurred and these are, Croydon, Ealing, Hendon, Hornsey, Edmonton and Ilford. In the other 11, including Acton, he estimates that there has been a decrease in the population. In former reports, I have given my reasons for believing that the estimate of the Registrar. General is too low, and I shall now simply give certain figures which are available. Between October 1st, 1925 and June 30th, 1926, 277 new separate dwelling houses were occupied, 6 flats, 2 tenements and 8 shops with houses attached—a total of 293. Between April 1st, 1921, and June 30th,, 1926, 1,146 new buildings have been erected and occupied. Between the Census of 1911 and that of 1921, the increase in the number of inhabited houses was 810. The following table shows the increases which have taken place in the number of Parliamentary electors since 1921:— 1921 30,350. 1922 30,425. 1923 31,394. 1924 31,999. 1925 32,776. 1926 33,424. Between the autumn of 1921 and the autumn of 1926 there has been an increase of 3074 in the number of Parliamentary electors. GENERAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS. In last year's Survey Report an account of the general and sanitary conditions was given, and no noteworthy change has taken place in this respect. It was then stated that the district is partly industrial and partly residential. If any change has occurred, it has been a tendency towards industrialism. 6 Dwelling houses have been erected in the north-eastern and northwestern portions of the district, but factories have been erected in the northern part. POOR RELIEF. I am indebted to Mr. Harmsworth, the Clerk of the Guardians, for the figures relating to Poor Law Relief. The amount of out-of-door relief given by the Guardians for the parish of Acton in the year ended December 31st, 1926 was:— £ s. d. Ordinary Relief 6127 14 3 Relief to Unemployed 1578 0 6 £7705 14 9 There has been a considerable decrease in the amount of ordinary relief granted, but a rise in the amount of unemployment relief. The increase in the latter was due to the General Strike last year. HOSPITAL PROVISION. General.—The Acton Hospital, Gunnersbury Lane, provides for the treatment of Medical and Surgical cases of both sexes. It is maintained chiefly by voluntary subscriptions, and the number of beds is 50. Last year 1163 in-patients and 5590 outpatients were treated at the Hospital. Thirty-three deaths of Acton residents occurred in the Acton Hospital last year, compared with 37 deaths in the voluntary hospitals of London. Fever.—The Council has its own fever hospital, which has accommodation for 80 patients. Smalt-pox.—The Borough is one of the constituent bodies which form the Middlesex Joint Small-pox Board. The Board owns Clare Hall Sanatorium which can be utilized in case of epidemics. The Joint Board has an arrangement with the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the treatment of occasional cases of Small-pox. Tuberculosis.-—The tuberculosis scheme is administered by the Middlesex County Council, which has Sanatoria at South Minims and Harefield. 7 Poor Law.—The district is in the Brentford Poor Law Union, and the Infirmary is at Isleworth. Clinics and Treatment Centres.— Child Welfare Consultation Centres—(a) Church Road. (b) Palmerston Road. Every Monday and Wednesday afternoon at 2. Ante-Natal Consultation Centre—School Clinic every other Wednesday morning at 11. Day Nursery—Bollo Bridge Road. School Clinic—Adjoining Municipal Offices. The above are provided and maintained by the Borough Council. Tuberculosis Dispensary—School Clinic on Tuesday and Thursday. Treatment Centres for Venereal Diseases—Various hospitals in London. The two latter are provided by the Middlesex County Council. PROFESSIONAL NURSING IN THE HOME. General.—There are two district nurses employed by the Acton Hospital. One of them is primarily engaged in district nursing and during the year 91 persons availed themselves of her services. The other is engaged to nurse patients who have been discharged from the hospital, and 117 patients were nursed. Midwives.—There are 13 midwives practising in the district. The Council pays the fees of the midwives in certain necessitous cases, and last year £2 10s. Od. was paid in fees to midwives. LEGISLATION IN FORCE. The following local acts, special local orders, general adoptive acts and bye-laws relating to Public Health are in force in the district:- Adopted. Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889 1889 Public Health Amendment Act, 1890 1890 Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890 1893 Notification of Births Act, 1907 1907 Public Health Act, 1907 (Clause 50) 1921 Public Health Act, 1925 (Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5) 1926 8 The Acton Improvement Act, 1904 New Streets and Buildings 1925 Removal of House Refuse 1899 Common Lodging Houses 1898 Slaughter Houses 1898 Nuisances, etc. 1924 Offensive Trades 1903 Tents, Vans and Sheds 1906 Removal of Offensive or Noxious Matters 1908 Houses let in Lodgings 1925 Cleansing of Cisterns 1912 Employment of Children 1920 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water.—All the inhabited houses are supplied with water from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. There are a few deep wells in the district, but the water from these is used entirely for industrial and similar purposes. For instance, the Public Swimming Baths are supplied with water from an artesian well, and the supply seems to be practically inexhaustible. Even in the driest summer the level of the water is not affected. Drainage and Sewerage.—Under the Acton Sewage Act the sewage is discharged into the sewers of the London County Council. In cases of storm the overflow is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Closet Accommodation.—There are no privy or earth closets in the district. All the water closcts are connected with the Council's drainage system and there are no cess-pools. Scavenging.—The collection of the House Refuse is carried out directly by the Council, and the whole of the house refuse is burnt in the Council's Refuse Destructor. Last year 15,888 tons of house refuse were collected. AMBULANCE FACILITIES. (a) For Infectious Cases.—The Council has a Motor in which cases of infectious disease are removed to hospital. The ambulance is housed in a garage at the Fever Hospital. (b) For Non-Infectious and Accident Cases.—The Council has a separate ambulance for non-infectious and accident cases. The ambulance is housed in a garage at the Fire Station, and is available at all hours. The ambulance is provided primarily for street accidents, and this service is free. The ambulance was called out to 218 street accidents in the year. 9 The ambulance is also available for the removal of cases of illness to or from Hospitals, Nursing Homes, etc. ; a charge is made for the hire of the ambulance, the amount varying with the distance of the Institutions. The ambulance was hired on 226 occasions by private persons, and the fees paid amounted to £79 12s. HOUSING. This question was dealt with fully in last year's report, and the conditions cannot be said to have changed materially since last year. At the present time many buildings are being erected, and last year, probably over 300 new dwelling houses were erected. But the class of dwelling house which is now being erected is for sale only, and is quite beyond the means of artisans and unskilled labourers. For a certain type of house, the demand is greater than the supply. Since the war, many new industries have been started in the district, but very few houses have been built which are suitable for those and their families whose wages are under £3 per week. The Council's houses are occupied by clerks and skilled artisans, and even these in some instances find the rents higher than they can afford to pay, and as a consequence permission has been given in certain cases to sublet. Apart from the Council's houses, and those erected on the Great Western land, and some rected by a few private firms for their own employees, all the houses erected have been for sale only. Many of the new industries which have been established have many expert employees, and the labour employed in these industries is drawn from all parts of London and other industrial areas. These people are naturally anxious to get rooms or houses near the works, and there is competition for any houses which may become vacant. The difficulties which we encounter vary, and cannot be classified. Usually the question of overcrowding is the most pressing one. In the course of our inspections, we find a family occupying one room. The family consists of husband, wife and a number of children, in some instances as many as six children. Based on the standard adopted in the Council's bye-laws relating to Houses-let-in-lodgings, the tenement is overcrowded. Occasionally there are one or two children over 12 years of age, and of opposite sexes. 10 In nearly all cases the tenant has been in occupation of the room for some years at the comparatively low rental of 4/6 per week, and frequently this sum is as much as the tenant can afford to pay. In other cases, it is found that originally the one-roomed tenement became occupied by a son or daughter of the tenant of the house. The son or daughter wishes to get married, and being unable to obtain a flat or rooms, one of the parents' rooms is allotted them as a temporary measure. The room becomes their permanent abode, as the supply of suitable and adequate accommodation does not tend to increase in any appreciable degree. Where illegal overcrowding is found to exist, a notice to abate the nuisance is served upon the occupier of the room, and the only practicable way to comply with the Council's requirements, is for him to arrange with friends or relations for the lodging of one or more of the children. If this cannot be done, the tenant has to search for other accommodation. If he is successful, he has to pay an increased rent, which often he can ill afford. Some of the older types of three and four storey houses with a couple of rooms in each floor are let by the landlord as two-roomed tenements at an average rent of about 8/6 a week. The difficulty encountered in these is due to the unsultability of the premises for subletting. There is usually one, or at most two W.C.'s in this type of house, and the scullery or wash-house on the ground floors is used in common. Occasionally, a small sink is fixed on one of the landings, or in the back rooms of the upper floors. In the south-east and south-west parts of the district there are a number of streets mainly comprised of six-roomed houses which are let to two families as flats at rents from 9/9 to 12/6 per week. These flats although having a front entrance door common to both, have usually a separate scullery and W.C. to each flat. Similar in housing capacity to this class of house, there are also mariy six-roomed houses which have but one scullery and W.C. used in common by the two families to whom they are let. The rent is usually slightly less than for the former class of "flat"; although frequently let by the landlord to two families, it is quite common for the whole house to be rented by one tenant, who sublets two or three of the rooms. The smaller house of four or five rooms and a scullery is usually let by the landlord to one family at an average rent of about 14/- a week. 11 Subletting is more or less usual in the foregoing types of houses; even among the tenants of the three-roomed flats mentioned above, it is frequently found that one of the rooms is let to an old couple or a widow with one or perhaps two children. The object is apparently to lessen the burden of the rent. As previously stated, actual overcrowding of sleeping rooms or combined living and sleeping rooms is found from time to time in varying degrees of seriousness, and the tenants find great difficulty to obtain larger and better accommodation, at a rent which he can afford to pay. Such accommodation is scarce, and there is an unwillingness on the part of many landlords to let their houses to tenants who have large families. Another difficulty arises from the fact that a higher rent is usually asked for a fresh flat even of the same accommodation where the house has become decontrolled under the Rent Restriction Acts. The abatement of overcrowding by the mere service of statutory notice has been difficult and frequently futile. There is a reshuffling of the accommodation, but the old conditions frequently recur. There is no doubt that there is a greater demand for all the above types of houses than that which is met by the supply, but it is difficult to see by whom such accommodation will be provided, as in addition to the fact that such an enterprise would show a financial deficit, the land in the borough is practically all built upon. The average wage of a skilled artisan is about £3 5s. to £4 weekly, while the unskilled man seems to receive anything from £2 5s. to £2 15s. per week. These classes of the population, occupying pre-war constructed flats and half-houses under the protection of the rent restriction Acts are just able to pay the present rents where they have been adjusted so as to include only the legal increases under the Acts. I am informed that artisans' houses which are let at pre-war rents, notwithstanding the additional 40% allowed by the Rent Restriction Acts, are not a paying proposition, and private enterprise is not likely to provide under present conditions, additional accommodation of the type mentioned above. Although the Rent Restriction Acts are not in the strict sense of the word, Public Health Acts, they have a very close bearing upon our work. It is obvious that many people will not be able to pav more rent, and the only alternative, if an increased demand be made, will be to reduce the amount of the accommodation with resultant overcrowding. 12 It has been stated that the rents of houses for the working classes would not be increased if the Rent Restriction Acts were repealed. From the experience of the few premises which have become decontrolled, there is every reason to believe that a general and substantial increase in the rents will result from a repeal of the Acts.

Table 7 gives particulars of the births registered and notified in the district, and the births registered outside the district; certain explanations are necessary to explain what appear to be discrepancies in the figures. The total numbrrs of births are those registered during the calendar year (i.e. January 1st—December 31st inclusive) and are corrected for inward and outward transfers. These figures are received from the Registrar General, and differ, therefore, from uncorrected figures compiled locally either for the calendar year or for a period of fifty-two or fifty-three weeks. The total figure—1098 births—is the one received from the Registrar General, but it differs very little from the figures compiled locally. 935 births were notified inside the district, and 139 names were received from outside authorities. In addition 30 were registered in the district, which had not previously been notified. These figures give a total of 1,104, compiled locally, compared with 1,098 received from the Registrar General. The number of births corresponds to an annual birth rate of 17.4 per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 16.5 per 1,000 in 1925. Both the total number of births and the birth rate are higher than those of 1925, but there is reason to believe that the birth rate is not higher, and only appears so, for reasons which have been stated in the paragraph on the population of the district. The birth-rate for England and Wales was 17.4 per 1,000 inhabitants, for London 17.1 and for the 105 County Boroughs and large towns including London 18.2 per 1,000. In last year's report, the birth-rate was dealt with fully, and the conditions have not materially changed since the issue of that report. The birth-rates per 1,000 population in the different wards were as follows :— North-East. North-West. South-East. South-West. 16.8 14.7 12.3 24. 15 46 children were born out of wedlock. This number corresponds to an illegitimate birth-rate of 3.82 per cent of the total births. This rate is lower than the illegitimate birth-rate of the whole of England and Wales, but it is the highest illegitimate birth-rate in this district since 1921. Throughout the country the illegitimate birth-rate has been steadily falling since 1918, when it was 6.26 per cent of the total births. In 1925, the rate had fallen to 4.07 per cent. It is still higher than the minimum rate of 3.95 per cent in 1901—1905. DEATHS. 422 deaths were registered in the district; of these 15 were of non-residents. 250 deaths of residents occurred outside the district. The total number of deaths belonging to the district is 657, which corresponds to a death-rate of 10.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. The death-rate for England and Wales was 11.6 per 1,000, for the 105 County Boroughs and great towns it was 11.6 and for London it was 11.6, per 1,000 inhabitants. The death-rate was slightly lower than that of 1925 and of the rate in 1924. The number of deaths at each age-period was lower than that of 1925 with the exception of the age-periods 15-25 years and 25-45 years. Ward Distribution.— North-East. North-West. South-East. South-West. 207 124 125 201 Compared with 1925, the number is higher in the NorthEast Ward, but lower in the other three Wards. Death-rate of each Ward. North-East. North-West. South-East. South-West. 12.5 9.4 8.2 11.5 Causes of and aires at death. Table 3 gives the causes of and ages at death. There is a considerable increase in the number of deaths from Cancer as compared with 1925, but in 1925, the number of deaths was less than in 1924. The number in 1926—92—was the same as that of 1924. 16 There is also an increase in the number of deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, but the number of deaths from this disease was abnormally low in 1925. Heart disease still looms as an important cause of death, and though the number was slightly lower than that of 1925, Cancer and Heart Disease are the two diseases which account for the highest number of deaths. Deaths in Public Institutions. One of the most marked changes taking place in the social life not only in this district but also in most districts of Greater London is the increasing use made of the facilities for Institutional treatment. Most of. the new houses which have recently been occupied have only the bare accommodation for the family, and when a case of serious illness occurs in the house, there is not sufficient accommodation for the efficient nursing of the patient.' In very many instances, the patient has to be treated either in a Hospital or a Nursing Home. Last year 260 deaths, or nearly 40 per cent of the total deaths, occurred in public institutions. In addition 18 deaths occurred in nursing homes. INFANTILE MORTALITY. 60 deaths occurred of children under one year of age. The infantile mortality is usually calculated as a proportion of the deaths of babies to the total births, and is stated as the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1000 births which occurred in the same year. The number of births in 1926 was 1098 and the infantile mortality was therefore 55 per 1000 births. This is the lowest infantile mortality recorded in the district; the next lowest being that of 1924, when it was 56 per 1000 births. The infantile mortality in the different wards was as follows :— North-East. North-West. South-East. South-West. 66 15 72 54 So far as causation is concerned conditions vary very little in ordinary years. The chief causes were Premature Birth and Pneumonia with 16 deaths and 12 deaths respectively. In a very hot summer deaths from diarrhœl diseases may figure largely in the returns, but usually this cause has been brought very 17 largely under control. Last year only 5 deaths were due to Diarrhoea. The improved methods of feeding and the cleaner conditions under which milk is produced and distributed have contributed to the lessened mortality from diarrhceal diseases. 3 babies were found dead in the district, two in the North-East Ward and one in the South-East. 52 of the babies were legitimate ones; this number gives a legitimate infantile mortality of 49 per 1000 legitimate births. 8 babies born out of wedlock died before the age of 12 months, giving an illegitimate infantile mortality of 174 per 1000. The number of illegitimate deaths includes the three babies found dead in the district and whose parentage was not traced. Notification of Births Act. 30 births were registered, which had not been previously notified. Of the notifications received, 714 were from doctors and parents and 385 from midwives. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. There is no material change to record in the arrangements which are made by the Council to conserve maternal and infant life. The Council has made every effort to obtain premises in East Acton to hold a child welfare centre, but so far its endeavours have been unsuccessful. Negotiations were made between the Council and a voluntary society which carries out work in East Acton but on the Hammersmith side of the border. Eventually the voluntary society decided that it could not extend its operations into Acton. Proposals were then made for the renting of rooms in connection with the Wesleyan Church, but the Trustees could not see their way clear to rent the rooms to the Council for the purpose of an Infant Welfare Centre. Their premises were insufficient for the activities of the Church. The Council is still hoping to find suitable premises for the purpose. In other parts of the district the work was carried out on the lines set out in former years. It was feared that the general strike in the summer would have prejudicially affected the nutrition of the babies. Out-of-work pay was not paid in 18 many instances until a fortnight had elapsed. We were considerably helped by a gift of twenty guineas which was placed at the disposal of the Health Visitors by Sir Sydney and Lady Skinner. Without waiting for any special enquiries to be made and forms to be filled in the Health Visitors were enabled to relieve any necessitious cases, and tide over the difficult period at the commencement of the Strike. Day Nursery. The total number of whole day attendances made at the Day Nursery by children were 3814. In addition there were 242 half-day attendances. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. In the autumn of 1925, an extensive epidemic of Measles commenced in the district. There were no deaths from the disease in 1925, but the epidemic continued into 1926, and 12 deaths occurred during the year. Scarlet Fever. 103 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, and there was no death from the disease. The age-incidence and the ward-distribution of the disease are given on Table 5. In the majority of cases the disease was of a mild type, but during the year, some cases occurred which illustrated unusual features in the disease. One case occurred in which the disease was in all Probability spread through infected linen. It is now usually recognised that Scarlet Fever is spread by infected persons and not through inrected things, and some people are even sceptical of the importance of the latter in the spread of infection. It is Probably true that in the vast majority of instances, infection does arise from persons actually suffering from the disease, or from a convalescent patient who may remain intermittently infectious for a prolonged period. Where the evidence points to infected articles of clothing, toys, books, etc., it is usual to subject such evidence to very strict examination. 1926 19 E. N. aged 30 years was notified on March 16th, and removed to Hospital on the same day. On admission she had a characteristic rash on the trunk and limbs together with sore throat and an injected soft palate. The temperature was raised for some days. On March 22nd, the skin on the body and hands began to peel; the peeling was profuse and characteristic. The case was a typical one of Scarlet Fever in every respect. She was employed as a packer and sorter at a laundry, and on March 10th, she was sorting the linen, etc. which had been sent from a house in Hampstead. On March 4th, two cases of Scarlet Fever were notified from the Hampstead residence, and the clothes were sent to the laundry on March 8th. The soiled linen, etc. was supposed to have been disinfected by a trained nurse and a doctor, but the patient and another girl stated that all the articles were quite dry and there was no suspicion of any smell resembling the smell of the ordinary disinfectants in use. I saw the clothes which were sent to the laundry on March 15th. The articles were stated to have been "carbonized," which term probably meant "carbolized." When I saw the articles on March 18th, they were absolutely dry and certainly, neither carbolic acid nor any of the coal-tar derivants had been used. Nowadays, in Acton, it is very difficult to state definitely that an adult patient has not been in contact with some person who might be in an infectious state, but though strict enquiries were made E. N. does not seem to have been near an infectious person. There was no infection among the other workers in the laundry, in the patient's home, or in the street she lived in. The district was comparatively free of Scarlet Fever at the time, and no notification had been received in the first fortnight of March from any house within a quarter of a mile of the patient's home. The essential dates were : March 4th, two cases in Hampstead; March 8th, laundry collected; March 10th, linen sorted by E. N.; March 12th, initial symptoms of Scarlet Fever in E. N.; March 14th, rash ; and March 16th„ notification. As far as could be ascertained, the linen was the only source of infection. In Scarlet Fever, inquiries are made concerning the movements not only of recent cases of Scarlet Fever, but also of persons who have recovered from the acute attack. Cases of Scarlet Fever occur, and the only sources of infection which can be traced are persons who have previously suffered from Scarlet Fever and have remained intermittently infectious lor a prolonged period. This condition is not very uncommon, and the cases are too numerous for us to regard them merely as coincidences. I gave instances in a former Annual Report of cases which pointed to a prolonged period of intermittent infection. 1926 20 A few cases occurred last year. In most instances the cases are those of young school children. The condition is uncommon in very young children and in adults. D. R. aged 5 years was notified of Scarlet Fever on December 7th, 1926. His sister aged 6 years suffered from Scarlet Fever in the previous year. She was admitted into Hospital in October, 1925 and discharged on December 4th, 1925. She had no complications, and made a perfect recovery, but in the first week of December, 1926, she had what her mother called a " cold in the head." K. G. aged 12½ years w.as notified on May 17th, 192G. She was living in the same house as N. J. aged 10 years. The latter had had Scarlet Fever in 1923, and just before K. G. was notified of Scarlet Fever, N. J. had had considerable nasal and post-nasal catarrh. A case occurred in 1925, which suggested that the infection might possibly last even longer than this. R. N. aged 11 years was notified of Scarlet Fever in July, 1925. The source of infection was not traced, but her sister M. N. aged 10 years had had Scarlet Fever 5 years previously. In all these cases, the suspected carrier of the infection suffered from a Nasal and Post-nasal catarrh, at the time the infection is supposed to have occurred. It is not suggested that the patients remain infectious during the whole period, but that under some conditions, a small percentage of children who have suffered from Scarlet Fever become intermittently infectious. The most common factor present at the time they are suspected to be infectious is an abnormal condition of the mucous membrane of the nose and nasopharynx giving rise to a catarrh. Tuberculosis. 101 new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and 17 cases of other forms of Tuberculosis, were notified during the year. The age-iricidence and ward distribution are given on Table V. At the end of the year, the number of cases on the Register was:— Pulmonary. Non-Pulmonary. Total. Male Female Male Female 117 105 25 30 277 192 21 Isolation Hospital. During the year, 200 cases were admitted into the Hospital compared with 183 in 1925. On January 1st, 1926 there were 28 cases under treatment, and on January 1st, 1927, 25. 195 cases were discharged and there were 8 deaths. The following is a list of cases admitted:— Acton Wembley Kingsbury Total Scarlet Fever 82 16 4 102 Diphtheria 41 17 — 58 Measles 34 3 — 37 Others 3 — — 3 160 36 4 200 Scarlet Fever. 102 cases of Scarlet Fever were admitted, with no death. Diphtheria. 58 cases of Diphtheria were admitted, and four deaths occurred. Measles. During the early part of the year, an extensive epidemic of Measles occurred in the district, whenever the Doctor deemed the home conditions unsatisfactory, or the case was a severe one, the patient was admitted into the Hospital. Of the 37 cases admitted, four died. Others. One of these was an abscess of the jaw; one was a case of Mumps and the third was a baby admitted with his mother. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS, 1926.

In last year's report a full account was given of the precautions taken to ensure a healthy meat supply in the district. As far as the inspection of meat is concerned in the particular slaughterhouse referred to in last year's report, the conditions have not changed. Towards the end of 1920, the slaughterhouse in Hanbury Road was purchased by a firm that used to slaughter in Aldgate. In former years the number of cattle slaughtered in this building was small, but since the reopening in the end of last year, a large amount of slaughtering has taken place there. iMEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION.
