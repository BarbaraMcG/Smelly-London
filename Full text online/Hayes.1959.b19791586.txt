To the Chairman and Members of the Council, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, As requested by the Minister of Health the statistics for 1959 contain more detailed information about infant deaths. In addition to deaths under 1 year and under 4 weeks the deaths of infants under 1 week are shown. This figure, taken together with the number of stillbirths gives the wastage of infant life caused by birth itself - the perinatal mortality. The perinatal mortality rate for Hayes and Harlington is 28.3 i.e. higher than the infant mortality rate which is 17.1. Although the infant mortality rate compares favourably with the rates for the County and England & Wales, the fact that it is much lower than the perinatal mortality rate should make us think. It has been usual to look on this as a figure which cannot be made smaller but medical research shows that many congenital abnormalities are related to illness and poor nutrition of the mother during pregnancy and as our knowledge increases we may be able to waste less infant life in the future. In the table showing causes of deaths in age groups I have included home accidents. There were 5 of these, 4 of them in the age group 60 - 89 years and all 5 deaths were due to carbon monoxide poisoning from coal gas. Coal gas is a useful domestic tool but it is also a highly lethal weapon which is not treated with the respect it deserves. Many gas companies operate a free inspection service for old people and it is a great pity that more advantage is not taken of it. The pattern of infectious disease in the district is again very similar to that of last year, but there has been a slight increase in the incidence of enteric infections. All these cases were mild and were confined within the family so far as we know, but there are almost always children in the families affected, and I feel that it is the children who help to spread 3 the disease, probably by hand to hand contact. Bacteriological investigation of school toilet accommodation in the past has proved abortive and no pathogenic organisms have been found. Scabies, a common skin infection during the war years, is beginning to appear again. I have been asked to help with the treatment of at least one family a year for the past few years, and in 1959 this rose to three families. The disease is so contagious that it is essential to treat the whole household at the same time whether all the members appear to be infected or not. As this involves each individual being bathed before treatment the biggest problem especially in a large family is that of a hot water supply. However, local arrangements have now been made for treatment, and so far this has been very successful. In January a one-day conference on the problem of the elderly in the community was attended by delegates from this authority. Recent surveys on the problem were commented upon, and there was lively discussion between the members of an expert panel and delegates. The chief factor which emerged was the need for co-operation between the various voluntary and statutory welfare services in operation. Unless each knows of the other's existence and scope there can be a great deal of energy wasted owing to duplication of enquiries and so on. Some old people are lonely and welcome many visitors, but others do not, and if several people in succession call offering help, the old person may well become infuriated and refuse all assistance. The Smoke Control programme launched in 1957 has proceeded apace, and in January a general assistant was appointed with special duties in connection with clean air. We sought a man with building or plumbing experience who would be able to take over the routine assessment and inspection of conversion of fireplaces. The appointment has been a successful one, and the assistant has been able to relieve the Public Health Inspectors of a considerable amount of straightforward work, leaving them more time to attend to other duties for which they are specially qualified. The Department suffered a certain amount of upheaval in December when the building in which it was housed was declared unsafe and an urgent removal was made to premises at Springfield House, Hayes End Road. The allocation of accommodation there is still only temporary and I would like to thank all members 4 of the staff for the extra effort they made in connection with the removal as well as for their work during the year. I thank the Council's printing section for their co-operation in the presentation of this report, and last, but by no means least, I would like to acknowledge the interest and help of those members of the Council who are particularly concerned with the public health. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW. Medical Officer of Health. 5 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (census 1951) 65,608 Population (mid-year 1959, Registrar General's estimate of civilian population) 68,670 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1959 20,013 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1959 £1,256,141 Product of penny rate £5,178 Live Births: M F Total 561 550 1, 111 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 16.2 Comparability Factor is 0.94 giving a corrected birth rate of 15.2 Birth rate for England and Wales 16.5 Birth rate for County of Middlesex (adjusted) 14.4 Illegitimate Live Births: M F Total 17 23 40 Expressed as a percentage of total live births 3.6 Stillbirths: M F Total Legitimate 7 10 17 Illegitimate 2 1 3 20 Rate per 1,000 live and still births 17.7 Total Live and Stillbirths: M F Total 570 561 1,131 6 Infant Deaths (deaths under 1 year): M F Total Legitimate 14 4 18 Illegitimate 1 - 1 19 Infant Mortality (deaths under 1 year): England & Wales Cty. of Mdx.

This table was compiled from local figures which may differ from the total given by the Registrar General on page 8. HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA INCLUDING CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Tubercul o sis. There has been little change in the number of new cases of tuberculosis notified and in the number of deaths. Of the new cases most of the men are over 25 years but the women are under this age. The scheme for vaccination of school children has continued and has been taken advantage of by many to whom it was offered. Hospital treatment is provided at all the hospitals in the vicinity, but especially Harefield, whilst observation and outpatient treatment is carried out at the Uxbridge Chest Clinic. This clinic is also dealing with an increasing number of nontuberculous chest complaints. Acute Poliomyelitis. I am pleased to be able to report that no case of acute poliomyelitis has occurred in the district during the year. This is the first year since 1954 that this has happened, and one cannot help feeling that the Poliomyelitis vaccination campaign has had some bearing on it. The response to the campaign suddenly became greater in the early part of the year when the tragic death of a well-known footballer brought home to young adults the fact that being fit is not necessarily a complete insurance against infectious disease. Immunisation and Vaccination. In view of my comments last year about the generally accepted immunisation programme, it is interesting to note that during 1959 a meeting of experts in this field was held at the Wellcome Institute in London and the subject was discussed very thoroughly. As a result two recommended programmes were put forward to cover the immunisation of children against whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and smallpox. Both these were planned to give a minimum number of injections and involve the use of combined prophylactics. The programmes are being followed at local clinics in the district, and it is good to see the increasing interest in protection against tetanus. Many mothers whose children did not receive the combined diphtheria/whooping cough/tetanus injections are coming forward and 11 asking for additional protection against tetanus. The figures showing the number of children immunised and vaccinated during 1959 are given by courtesy of the Area Medical Officer on page 13. Maternity and Child Welfare Services etc. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council and there are numerous sessions for ante-natal and post-natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services in clinic buildings, church halls, schools and the mobile clinic. Medical Examinations of Council Employees. The total number of examinations carried out during 1959 was 140. Of these 27 were for superannuation purposes alone, 36 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, 49 for Sick Pay and Superannuation and 28 for various special purposes. Water Supply. Two companies, the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Company and South West Suburban District Water Company supply water to this district. The supply is adequate and samples taken during the year have reached a satisfactory standard. One property inthis district is still supplied by a well, but action is now being taken to connect the house to a mains supply. Establishments for Massage S Special Treatment. Six establishments (five for chiropody and one for physiotherapy) are registered under the provisions of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. All are satisfactory, but trouble is encountered from time to time in dealing with applications for registration by unsuitable persons who have received inadequate training e.g. tuition carried out by correspondence. Existing legislation is not helpful and there appears to be no encouragement for an authority to maintain a high standard of service. 12 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION, 1959 Number of Children who completed a full course of Primary Immunisation Number of Children who received a secondary (Reinforcing) Injection Diphtheria Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Whooping Cough only Diphtheria Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Whooping Cough only 1955 91 650 21 436 298 5 1956 141 843 3 1,012 536 - 1957 88 858 20 774 275 1 1958 304 605 242 865 93 4 1959 504 595 392 809 153 8 Smallpox Vaccination Poliomyelitis Vaccination Primary He- Vaccination Primary Re- Vaccination 1955 573 107 - - 1956 627 195 - - 1957 1,030 327 2,295 - 1958 659 141 10,278 3,299 1959 865 177 8,050 11,403 13 TUBERCULOSIS New Cases and Mortality during the year, 1959 Age Periods New Cases Mortality Respiratory NonRespiratory Respiratory Non Respiratory M F M F M F M F Under 5 years - 1 - - - - - - 5-14 - 1 - - - - 1 - 15 - 24 5 5 - - - - - - 25 - 44 8 5 3 2 - - - - 45 - 64 8 2 - - - - - - 65 & over 1 1 - 1 2 - - - Age unknown - - - - 2 - - - TOTALS 22 15 3 3 4 - 1 - TUBERCULOSIS 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 New Cases 73 59 51 49 45 43 Deaths 11 12 5 8 6 5 14 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS) DURING THE YEAR, 1959 Disease Notified cases Confirmed Deaths Scarlet Fever 87 - Whooping Cough 16 - Acute Poliomyelitis & Encephalitis 1 - Measles 924 - Dysentery 21 - Meningococcal Infection 1 - Pneumonia 47 21 Erysipelas 8 - Food Poisoning 5 - Puerperal Pyrexia 2 - Ophthalmia Neonatorum - - INCIDENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Disease 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 Scarlet Fever 52 117 88 42 81 87 Pneumonia 42 60 82 68 58 47 Diphtheria 0 0 0 0 0 0 Meningococcal Infection 0 1 2 4 2 1 Puerperal Pyrexia 6 6 9 12 2 2 Erysipelas 8 6 4 5 2 8 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 0 0 0 0 1 0 Measles 75 1,154 77 1,324 339 924 Whooping Cough 73 59 87 148 30 16 Dysentery Group 12 0 14 66 11 21 Poliomyelitis and Encephalitis 1 22 6 4 5 1 Food Poisoning 1 8 21 14 2 5 15 16 ANALYSIS OF TOTAL CASES OF NOTIFIABLE DISEASES Disease AT AGES Under 1 yr. 1 2 3 4 5-9 10 - 14 15 - 24 25 & over Age unknown TOTALS Scarlet Fever _ 5 4 9 13 42 11 1 2 _ 87 Whooping Cough 3 2 3 3 1 2 2 - - - 16 Acute Poliomyelitis - - - - - - - - - - - Measles 33 85 110 114 162 404 9 2 1 4 924 Dysentery 1 1 3 1 2 5 3 3 2 - 21 Meningococcal Infection 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 Disease AT AGES Under 5 yrs. 5-14 15 - 44 45 - 64 65 & over Age unknown TOTALS Pneumonia 8 12 9 15 3 47 Encephalitis - - 1 - - - 1 Erysipelas - 2 1 2 3 - 8 Food Poisoning 1 1 1 2 - - 5 Peurperal Pyrexia - - 2 - - - 2 REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR I have the honour to present ray tenth annual report on the sanitary circumstances of the district. There are no spectacular events to report, but progress in all our activities has been steady and safisfactory. Our achievements in Smoke Control have given us a pre-eminent position in this field and many other Authorities have drawn on our experience and knowledge of the subject. The pollution figures published by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research show this district in a very good light, our figures now being comparable with many areas which are generally considered to be of a much more salubrious nature than Hayes. Statutory overcrowding has been further reduced and is now virtually non-existent. Housing conditions will be further improved when plans which have already been approved, to demolish or close more unfit houses, are carried out in the next two years. The introduction of Standard Grants has given a great fillip to the improvement and modernisation of the older type of house and there is ample evidence that next year it will be possible to report substantial progress in this direction. It is perhaps opportune to draw attention to a development in staffing which has taken place in recent years and which has not been mentioned before in these reports. During the past three years five vacancies for Additional Public Health Inspectors have been filled. In four instances the new Inspector has been newly qualified with little or no practical experience. The result of this is that the combined knowledge, qualifications and experience of those Inspectors who are in closest contact with the general public and who act as representatives of the Council in their dealings with shopkeepers, factory management, Property owners, builders, architects and other professional People is less than at any time during the past ten years. The post of General Assistant whose duties include rodent control, disinfection, drain clearing etc. twice became vacant during the year and here again it was only possible to obtain replacements who had no previous experience in the work. The work of the Public Health Inspectors involves the enforcement of a mass of legislation, some of which e.g. The Clean 17 Air Act, requires the changing of old established customs. I consider it to be of prime importance that work of this nature should be done in such a way as to avoid giving people the feeling that they are being pushed around. When this happens it is not only a particular Department or Council, but Local Government as a whole, that is brought into disrepute. If the purpose and intention of the legislation in question is explained to people and they can be persuaded that it is not only sensible but necessary, and that it will, in the long run be beneficial to the whole community, enforcement becomes smooth and harmonious. This method of approach makes heavy demands on the staff and requires men of high calibre if it is to be fully effective. I wish to express my appreciation to the Public Health Committee for their encouragement and to the technical and clerical staff for their help during a busy and interesting year. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following headings:- I. Sanitary Administration, viz:- inspection of the district, summary of complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent control, destruction of vermin and insect pests, disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses, II. Air Pollution, viz:- smoke control areas, height of chimneys, new furnaces, The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations 1958, grit and dust, byelaws re new heating and cooking appliances, pollution from road vehicles, pollution from railway, measurement of atmospheric pollution, publicity, co-ordinating committee, III. Food, viz:- milk supply, ice cream, inspection of meat and other foods, food hygiene, hawkers of food, sampling of food and drugs, food poisoning, complaints about food, inspection of food premises, IV. Housing, viz:- inspection, repair, demolition, closure, overcrowding, improvement grants, certificates of disrepair, moveable dwellings, new houses, V. Factories and Shops, viz:- inspection of factories, (See Appendix I), outworkers and shops etc. 18 VI. Miscellaneous duties, viz:- Petroleum (Regulation) Acts, 1928-36, Rag Flock & Other Pilling Materials Act, 1951, Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, Pet Animals Act, 1951, Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956, Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 (Dealers in old metal), swimming pools, mortuary, official searches. Appendix I (a) Prescribed Particulars on the Administration of the Factories Act, 1937. (b) Outwork. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN S. HODGINS. Chief Public Health Inspector. 19 PART I - SANITARY ADMINISTRATION Inspection of the District.

The Smoke Control Programme is now in full swing and accounts for the increase in the number of visits under this heading from 2,179 to 4,042. Complaints. The number of complaints received was slightly more than last year. Increases were recorded in the figures for rats and mice, offensive accumulations and deposits, noise nuisances and insects. The abnormally large number of wasps nests reported was responsible for the increase in the latter. There was a substantial reduction in the number of complaints about insanitary and dilapidated houses and if this trend continues it might be assumed that the Rent Act, 1957 is at last taking effect in this direction.

After a lengthy hearing the Council's case was found proved but the Company was granted an Absolute Discharge on payment of £5. 5. 0 costs. Offensive Trades. There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on. In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage. Two cesspools were abolished during the year, leaving cessPools still in use at 30 premises. Seven pail closets were also abolished, reducing the number of premises relying on this abhorrent form of sanitation to 16, mainly farms, factories, workplaces etc. None of the remaining cesspools can be dealt with by legal action. The job of persuading owners to make a connection to the sewer is, in spite of the Council's willingness to bear half of the cost, one of the most time-consuming of all the tasks undertaken by the Department. In one case on which agreement was reached during the year negotiations with the owner commenced in 1956. 23 A 50% grant is also available for the conversion of pail closets to water closets. The following table shows the number of premises still using cesspools and pail closets:- Cesspool drainage Pail Closets A. Premises within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 8 2 Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension 4 - C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available 16 12 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon 2 2 Totals 30 16 Four small private sewage disposal plants are in use. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer & Surveyor's Department. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge, where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging was continued and nuisances from this cause thereby reduced to a minimum. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under Section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure etc., and have proved of considerable assistance to the Public Health Inspectors in their efforts to minimise nuisances from this source. The prevention of nuisances however is of less importance than the prevention of disease. By preventing conditions under which flies breed, the risk of diseases which they are known to spread viz. dysentery, typhoid, paratyphoid and epidemic diarrhoea and diseases, which they are 24 suspected of spreading, e.g. poliomyelitis can be reduced to a minimum. During the year representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, acting on behalf of a local dairy farmer, sought unsuccessfully to persuade the Council to modify their control over the keeping of animals. The effect of the modifications would have been seriously to weaken the effectiveness of the 3yelaws. The farm in question, at one time completely separated from any built-up area, is now, as a result of the growth of the district, on the very fringe of a heavily populated area. This kind of thing is happening on the outskirts of urban areas all over the country and a certain degree of sympathy can be felt for farmers who find themselves engulfed by the Urban sprawl. To keep the picture in perspective however it should be remembered that the appearance of thousands of new customers on a dairy farmer's doorstep is not necessarily without its advantages to him. Providing he, and his official mentors, appreciate that the possible dangers to public health from keeping animals in a built up urban area are greater than at an isolated rural farm, and the standard of hygiene is adapted accordingly, I see no reason why farming and populace should not exist happily side by side. Rodent Control. Treatment at dwelling houses is carried out free, but a charge based on the cost of labour and materials is made for treatment at business and industrial premises. All complaints are investigated by the Public Health Inspectors before treatment is carried out in order to find out whether the infestation is the result of defective drains, accumulations of refuse, improper keeping of animals etc. Ditches, undeveloped sites, rubbish dumps and other places where infestation is likely to occur, are subject to regular routine inspection and treated when necessary. An increase of nearly 40% in the number of complaints received as compared with last year is a trend which will have to be watched closely. The explanation might arise from the fact that the post of rodent operative fell vacant twice during the year and on neither occasion was it possible to obtain anyone with previous experience in the work to fill the vacancy. Training is given, of course, but until full efficiency is reached, second complaints may be received about infestations which have not been completely eradicated. 25 During the year 261 treatments were carried out at dwelling houses and 98 at business premises. Destruction of Vermin and Insect Pests. The abnormally hot summer caused a noticeable change in the pattern of infestation. Nine cases of bug infestation were dealt with against five last year whilst the number of wasps nests destroyed increased from eight to forty three. During the year the following treatments were carried out:- Wasps Nests 43 Ants 4 Bugs 9 Fleas 2 Disinfection. In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases of which tuberculosis is a typical example. All library books however, which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library. Facilities for the steam disinfection of bedding are available when required at St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, but it has not been necessary to use these facilities during the year. Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses, etc. These sites are regularly inspected for rodent infestation, pollution, general nuisances and, particularly in summer, mosquitoes. When adverse conditions are found remedial action is taken. During the year two ponds, which have, in the past, been frequent sources of trouble, were filled in. 26 PART II AIR POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas. The ten-year programme to bring the whole of the Urban District under Smoke Control is in full swing and at the end of the year the following progress had been made:- Area No. Area in Acres Dwellings Other Buildings Order Operative Remarks Council Others 1 240 - 3 23 1. 6.58 Order in operation. 2 350 - 10 8 1.12.58 Order in operation. 3 265 - 55 13 1. 9.58 Order in operation. 4 440 138 9 18 1.12.58 Order in operation. 5 376 2 90 19 1. 1.59 Order in operation. 6 252 373 556 46 1. 9.59 Order in operation. 7 357 254 102 18 1. 5.59 Order in operation. 8 413 663 214 18 1. 6.60 Order confirmed. 9 10 96 114 737 74 Details submitted to Ministry for approval in principle. 87 2 891 41 1. 6. 60 Order confirmed. 11 12 13 14 49 - 478 1 1. 7.60 Order confirmed. 59 - 790 8 1. 9.60 Order confirmed. 64 20 783 33 1. 8.61 Details submitted to Ministry for approval in principle. 49 379 180 13 1. 9.60 Order confirmed. Totals 3097 1945 4898 333 These areas account for 60% of the area of the district and 35% of the dwellings in the district. 27 So far it has not been necessary for the Minister to hold any inquiries to hear objections to Smoke Control Orders in this district; only one objection has been lodged and that was subsequently withdrawn. In fact the only resistance to smoke control which has been found, and even this has not been widespread, has been the continued use of sticks and paper by a few people for lighting fires in Smoke Control Areas. In some quarters the amount of smoke emitted by lighting a fire with sticks and paper is regarded as not worth bothering about, but it should be remembered that there are approximately 35,000 fireplaces in this district and a small quantity of smoke multiplied by that figure makes an appreciable amount. There are also objections on other grounds particularly because of the difficulty which would be created in the enforcement of Smoke Control Orders. If a Public Health Inspector saw smoke coming from a chimney (as he frequently would if the use of sticks and paper were permitted) he would, before taking any action, have to decide whether the smoke was caused by lighting with sticks and paper or by the use of some other unauthorised fuel. Inspectors would obviously give themselves a safety margin and I am certain that many contraventions would occur and go unchecked and it is surely futile to make Smoke Control Orders unless it is intended to enforce them. Fortunately a great many people have accepted the view that with Smoke Control, as with most other activities, it is worth while doing the job properly, particularly as there is a clean, cheap, and simple alternative to sticks and paper. At the beginning of the year an assistant with building trade experience was appointed. His duties include detailed surveys, inspecting adaptations prior to payment of grants, dealing with queries arising from applications for approval of proposals to adapt fireplaces and also a considerable part of the clerical work associated with setting up Smoke Control Areas. (b) Height of Chimneys. Under Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, plans of new industrial buildings deposited for byelaw approval must be rejected if the height of any chimney shown on the plan is insufficient. Such plans are passed to me by the Engineer and Surveyor for a decision on this particular point, although it is usual for consultations to take place with builders or architects before plans are submitted. 28 During the year eight plans were examined for this purpose. In every instance the original proposals were unsatisfactory but the proposed chimney heights were increased after consultation with the parties concerned or the method of heating was changed to one for which a low chimney was adequate or indeed no chimney at all was necessary. (c) New Furnaces. Nine notifications under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act were received regarding the installation of new furnaces but no applications for prior approval were made. (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. These Regulations lay down the maximum periods for which dark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. Three contraventions were observed and as will be seen on Page 23 proceedings were taken in two instances. In the case in which an incinerator was involved the Company subsequently stopped burning their industrial waste and made arrangements to dispose of it on a controlled tip. In the other case the firm installed chain grate stokers and found that the economies effected by this virtually smoke free plant would pay for the cost of conversion in three years. (e) Grit and Dust. Little progress can be reported on the two cases mentioned last year. Although no complaints have been received it is considered, by reason of the type of fuel used and the method of firing, that neither of these furnaces complies with Section 3 of the Act requiring the emission of dust and grit to be minimised and efforts will be continued with a view to grit arresting Plant being installed. (f) New Building Byelaws re Heating and Cooking Appliances. A new building byelaw, made under Section 24 of the Clean Air Act, has been in force in this district from the 1st September, 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating and cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, oil or solid smokeless fuel. 29 (g) Pollution from Road Vehicles. Although the Council have no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co-operative attitude is met with. If local authorities were given power to deal with this aspect of clean air an improvement would soon be effected, (h) Pollution from Railway. The main line of the Western Region of British Railways runs through the industrial part of the district. During the year a letter was received from British Railways stating that dieselisation of local services would be completed by the end of the year and of main line services before the end of 10 years. (i) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution. Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. An electric reflectometer is used for assessing smoke stains and the figures obtained are therefore far more accurate than if obtained from visual comparison with a shade card. The measuring station at William Byrd School is situated in fairly close proximity to the Bath Road and London Airport but is a considerable distance away from any source of smoke particularly in a southerly and south westerly direction; the station at Coldharbour Lane is in the centre of the town where it is likely to receive the full effect of industrial pollution and the station at Grange Park School is in the middle of a modern residential area. 30 Monthly Averages for Sulphur Dioxide 1959 SULPHUR (parts per 100 million) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School, Lansbury Drive January 9.4 8.2 10.9 February 9. 0 7.5 12.1 March 5.2 4.1 6.5 April 3.9 4.8 4.6 May 3.4 3.4 3.2 June 2.4 2.7 2.3 July 1.6 1.6 1.5 August 2.9 2.3 2.4 September 3.8 3.7 3.5 October 4.8 5.0 5.5 November 7.2 7.6 8.7 December 4.7 4.1 5.1 Monthly Averages for Smoke 1959 SMOKE (Mg. per 100 Cubic Metres) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School, Lansbury Drive January 18. 1 20.1 22.3 February 15. 2 16.0 20.3 March 8.8 8. 9 10.8 April 7.0 4.8 8.0 May 5.0 5.0 5.0 June 3.0 3.0 3.0 July 3. 0 3. 0 2.0 August 4. 0 3. 0 3.0 September 6.0 6.0 5.0 October 10.0 9. 0 10.0 November 13.0 16.0 17. 0 December 9. 0 11. 0 12.0 31 The abnormal frequency of fog in January and February is reflected in the high pollution figures for those months. The figures again clearly show the high degree of responsibility that domestic grates must carry for air pollution. In winter months, when domestic grates are in use, sulphur and smoke pollution is consistently worse in the residential district than in the industrial area. In common with the rest of the country the sulphur figures show an increase as compared with last year. The increasing use of oil is partly responsible but it is also officially stated that coal seams now being worked in British mines have a higher sulphur content than those formerly worked. Apart from the first two months of the year, during which fog was very frequent, the smoke pollution figures show a general improvement over last year. (j) Publicity. Arrangements were made for the Coal Utilisation Council's demonstration centre to be sited in the district for 6 months in 1960. The Solid Smokeless Fuel Federation's mobile exhibition spent three weeks in the district and the North Thames Gas Board's mobile showroom was also frequently used. Talks were given to local organisations and press publicity was obtained as a result of the establishment of Smoke Control Areas. Large numbers of pamphlets provided by the gas, electricity and solid fuel manufacturers have been distributed in proposed smoke control areas. (K) Co-ordinating Committee. The Council invited eight neighbouring Local Authorities to form a Co-ordinating Committee and eventually the Ealing Borough Council and Feltham Urban District Council agreed toco operate to this end. Three meetings of the Committee were held and towards the end of the year efforts were being made to extend the membership so as to form an area of more workable shape and size. 32 PART III - FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are:- Milk Distributors 21 Dairies 5 The following licences have been issued: Designation Dealers Licences Supplementary Licences Tuberculin Tested 11 10 Pasteurised 12 10 Sterilised 16 12 An order made under Section 37 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is compulsory, is in force. During the year 13 samples of pasteurised milk were taken for bacteriological examination; all passed the prescribed tests. Two licences were issued by the County Council in respect of the use of the special designation "Pasteurised" for milk Processed within the district. These premises were regularly inspected by officers from the County Council who took 94 samples of Pasteurised milk, only one of which failed to pass the prescribed tests. In addition two samples of raw milk were taken in the district by officers of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli; both gave negative results. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. 33 Ice Cream. Fifteen premises are registered for the manufacture of ice cream but only two of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further 95 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream; in the majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. The methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are used by both manufacturers in the district. Sixty samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, for bacteriological examinat ion. The use of the special standard devised by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, has been continued and is, for convenience, set out below:- Grade I II III IV Count below 500 500 - 10,000 10,000 - 100,000 Over 100,000 Faecal Coli Nil Nil Nil or present The grading of samples taken was as follows: - Grade I Grade II Grade III Grade IV 15 or 27% 24 or 43% 7 or 12% 10 or 18% These results are better than last year. The proportion of samples falling in Grades I and II is 70%, compared with 64% last year and on the very high standard by which these samples are graded this can be regarded as reasonably satisfactory and, at the same time, as a challenge to obtain even better results. No attempt has been made to produce more satisfactory figures by taking samples from sources of known reliability; on the contrary, attention has been concentrated on manufacturers whose products have been found to be of inconsistent bacteriological quality. Of the 17 samples in grades III and IV only three were manufactured in the district. All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are 34 equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the district and the table on page 37 shows that this was little used. Practically the whole of the district's meat supplies are now obtained from Smithfield market. The inspection of meat in slaughter houses, which is carried out to the standards laid down in Memo. 3/Foods, resulted in the condemnation of 16 pounds of offal, whilst in retail shops, 884¾ pounds of raw meat and 2,720 pounds of tinned meat were condemned. The following foods (other than meat) were also condemned during the year:- Chicken (Frozen) 49 lbs. Fish (tinned) 43½ lbs. Fish (raw) 264 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 5,736¼ lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 548¾ lbs. Tomatoes (tinned) 163¾ lbs. Milk (tinned) 108¾ lbs. Flour 143 lbs. Preserves 22 lbs. Butter 36½ lbs. Miscellaneous Frozen Foods 228 lbs. Miscellaneous Food 46 lbs. Miscellaneous Food (tinned) 41¼ lbs. Ice Cream and Lollies 288 lbs. Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried on the Council's refuse tip. Regulations requiring the sterilizing and staining of meat unfit for human consumption were made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but were revoked, due, it is believed, to pressure from the trade, before they came into force. Thus, an opportunity to provide an essential safeguard against the improper use of diseased meat was lost. 35 Byelaws relating to sanitary conditions and management of private slaughterhouses are in force in the district. They are based on the Model Byelaws but improve on them by making provision for (a) hanging accommodation for meat outside the slaughtering or dressing room, (b) covered accommodation for the storage of manure, (c) the taking of all reasonable precautions to prevent access by domestic birds or animals not intended for slaughter into slaughterhouses. Three slaughtermen's licences were issued. Food Hygiene. Pood hygiene is now more a matter of correct methods of handling rather than of suitable premises. There is little scope for further improvement in the hygienic equipment and construction of food premises. In recent years laminated plastics, stainless steel, glazed tiles and other easy-to-clean materials have been used in prodigious quantities; browns and greens for painted surfaces have been replaced by bright, light colours; hot water, detergents and sterilants are used in profusion, sinks and wash basins have been fixed in every conceivable nook and cranny with printed exhortations about handwashing displayed in close proximity, and glass or perspex covers for sandwiches, cakes etc. provided in abundance. In spite of all this there is still much to do before one can be satisfied that food hygiene has reached a satisfactory standard, e.g. there are still many shopkeepers who are not courageous enough to ask their customers to leave their dogs outside and still many customers who are not sufficiently discriminating or, worse still, sufficiently interested, to patronise only those shops where hygienic standards are high and keep out of those shops where standards are not so high. In the field of food hygiene the education of food handlers is now the major outstanding problem. The difficulty of this was well illustrated during an investigation into an outbreak of food poisoning in a large works canteen. It was found that 25% of the kitchen staff had been employed for less than 3 months and that this rate of turnover was normal with this type of job. However, everything possible is being done and it is an essential part of the Public Health Inspectors duties during their visits to food premises to watch closely the habits and methods of food handlers and to point out any undesirable practices and explain the dangers that might arise from them. 36 Carcases and Offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed - - - - 18 Number inspected - - - - 18 All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - _ _ 3 Percentage of the number inspected affected with diseases other than tuberculosis and cysticerci - - - - 16.7% Tuberculosis only Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 1 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - - - - 5. 6% Cysticercosis Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration - - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - 37 No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955, have been granted. Pull use has been made of the propaganda material and posters issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood and the Central Council for Health Education. Large numbers of posters have been exhibited in places where they will do most good i.e. factory canteens, school kitchens, civic restaurant, food factories, etc. Bye laws made under Section 15 of the Pood and Drugs Act,1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950. The long-awaited Codes of Practice for meat handling made their appearance towards the end of the year and will, it is assumed, be followed by codes for other food trades indue course. The value of the new Codes to this district is negligible; they merely represent an approach to the Food Hygiene Regulations which has been followed by all conscientious Public Health Inspectors for the past 5 years. It is understood that the original draft was revised following consultations with trade associations and other interested parties and it is not difficult to imagine that it was during this process that they became addled. Hawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and immediately after the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, came into force the Council adopted Section 11 of the Act to extend the registration of hawkers to cover all classes of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Mobile shops from which groceries, meat, fish, ice cream, refreshments, etc. are sold are all fitted with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nail brushes but such a high standard is not enforceable in the case of vehicles from which only fruit and vegetables are sold. Number of hawkers registered 44 Number of hawkers' storage premises registered 8 38 Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) Miscellaneous foods, such as cream cakes and meat products are regularly sampled by the Public Health Inspectors for bacteriological examination. Although there are no recognised standards of bacteriological quality for this class of food the results are of considerable assistance to the Inspectors in their contacts with food-handlers, illustrating, as they often do, that the greatest care is necessary in the storage and handling of this class of food. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory, for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following table and supplementary information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer:- Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (New) 48 - Milk (Various) 39 - Cutter 15 - Cakes 5 - Cooked Meat 8 - Cream 16 - Drugs 7 - Pish and Fish Products 14 - Fruit - Fresh and Canned 9 - Fruit Juice, Squash etc. 7 - Ice Cream 13 - Liver 8 - Margarine 5 - Pleat and Meat Products 27 - Sausages etc. 10 3 Spirits 5 _ Vinegar 13 _ Miscellaneous 18 _ Totals 267 3 39 "Sausages. Two samples of pork sausages obtained from a retailer in your district were found to contain preservative although no prescribed notice was exhibited at the time of the sales, The retailer concerned was unaware of the presence of the preservative, the sausages having been obtained ready made from a manufacturer who had not declared its presence. An official caution was issued to the manufacturer. Another purchase of sausages from a different retailer was also found to contain preservative. In this case the prescribed notice had been removed temporarily and was later replaced. " "Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 . 1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926 are complied with. These Orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, tomatoes, currants, raisins, sultanas, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. Inspections were made at 139 premises of 568 displays of these foodstuffs. Any infringements detected were of a minor nature and were dealt with by verbal warning. " "Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the Registered Trade Mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any), and in the case of a compounded food with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the nammer in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 284 articles of pre -packed food was examined at 85 different premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above regulations. " "False and Misleading Descriptions. Pood advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the local Councils, and work under this heading is combined with inspections made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Pood Order. "Examples where corrective action was sought are fruit syrups described as fruit 'juices', slimming claims in association 40 with lemon juice drinks, and a "Seedless Fig Bar" which contained crushed seeds. Some extravagant claims in respect of medical remedies were challenged and the advertisements withdrawn." "Special Designated Milk. During 1959 my Council issued two Dealers’ (Pasteuriser's) licenses in respect of premises within your area where milk is processed. These premises were regularly inspected and compliance with statutory requirements was well maintained. A total of 94 designated milks was taken, only one of which failed to obtain a satisfactory certificate. An official caution was issued in respect of this sample which failed the phosphatase test. " "Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing two samples of raw milk were procured within your area and submitted to tests for the presence of tubercle bacilli. Neither was found contaminated. " Food Poisoning. Nine cases of Food Poisoning occurred during the year, Six were due to Salmonella Typhi murium, one to Salmonella Anatum, one to Clostridium Welchii and one to an unidentified agent. The task of investigating food poisoning is made considerably more difficult for the Public Health Inspectors by the delay which often takes place in notifying cases to the Public Health Department. By the time the Inspector arrives on the scene all traces of the suspected meal have been disposed of and the affected persons have great difficulty in remembering exactly what they ate during the crucial period. The importance of obtaining this information is evident if it is realised that whilst some foods are more open to suspicion than others there is practically no article of food or drink which can be ruled out as being above suspicion'. Complaints about Food. Forty complaints were received about food alleged to be grossly contaminated, unsound or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded, but proceedings were taken in only four instances. Some of the complaints were of a trivial nature; in other cases of a more serious nature the previous good record of the 41 trader concerned influenced the Council in deciding to deal with the matter by a warning letter; in a few other cases the Clerk and Solicitor did not consider the available evidence was strong enough to ensure successful proceedings.

Re-housing of the tenants of condemned houses was however still in progress at the end of 1959 and likely to continue until well into 1960. A further 28 houses which had become unfit since the 5-year programme was drawn up were reported to the Council and it was agreed that they should be dealt with during 1960 and 1961. The routine inspection of houses under the Housing and Public Health Acts was carried out to a limited extent throughout the year. One would like to do much more of this work but the staff have been fully occupied on more pressing matters. Inspection of Houses during the year. 1.

At the end of the year only 12 dwellings were known to be overcrowded, 24 cases having been abated and 15 new cases having been discovered during the year. This figure represents 0.06% of the total dwellings in the district showing that statutory overcrowding has now ceased to be a problem. Improvement Grants. The increased interest in Improvement Grants mentioned in my last report continued throughout the year and the number of applications received, whilst still not large, was much greater than in any previous year. Six applications for Standard Grants were received and all were granted. Nine applications for Discretionary Grants were received. One was withdrawn before it was considered by the Public Health Committee and one application was refused because it did not comply with the Ministry's requirements; in the other seven cases maximum grants were approved. As an additional encouragement to owners to carry out improvements the Council have now discontinued their practice of charging a fee for their administrative expenses in connection with Discretionary Grants. 45 Certificates of Disrepair. The following action was taken under the Rent Act, 1957 in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 22 landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 23 Undertakings given by Landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 14 Undertakings by Landlords not accepted 2 Applications for cancellation of Certificate of Disrepair (Form M) 24 Applications for cancellation of Certificate of Disrepair refused (Form R.C. 3) 12 Certificates of Disrepair cancelled (Form R.C. 2) 14 Application by Landlord or Tenant for Certificate as to the Remedying of Defects which Landlord has undertaken to remedy (Form 0) 23 Certificate as to the Remedying of Defects specified in a Landlord's Undertaking to remedy Defects 22 Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 10 Moveable Dwellings. The Council owns a well equipped site for 95 caravans. Last year I reported that proposals had been received for improving one of the two unauthorised sites in the district to bring it up to the standards required by the Middlesex County Council Act. Unfortunately these proposals failed to get Planning approval and the site owner was thereby provided with an effective insurance against action under the Middlesex County Council Act. As he is also protected against planning action the site continues, larger and more unsatisfactory than ever;. Very little trouble has been experienced from gypsies during the year. 46 New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and private developers:- Council: Houses 8 Old Persons' dwellings Fiats 46 Maisonettes 21 Private Development: Dwellings 169 Housing Association: Dwellings Nil 47 PART V - FACTORIES AND SHOPS Factories Act, 1937. There are one hundred and sixty-two factories with mechanical power and six factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including: - Aircraft, building materials, car accessories, caravans, carbon products, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, electrical transformers, electronic devices, furniture, lubricating oil, optical lenses, radar, gramophone records and gramophones, rubber, tarmacadam, steel wool and wood block floors. Full details of the inspections carried out and notices served are set out in Appendix I to this report. Outworkers. Part VIII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons to carry out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. There are one hundred and nine outworkers in the district and 82 inspections were made: in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops Act. All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to more than 650 premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 907 visits. In addition 21 tours of duty were undertaken outside normal office hours i.e. in the evenings and on Sundays. As a result two informal notices were served but in no instance was it considered necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises is held in the Public Health Department. 48 PART VI - MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulations) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide. During the year 106 licences were issued in respect of: - 155,175 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures, 42,539 gallons of cellulose solutions, 896 lbs. of calcium carbide. All licences now incorporate the Model Licensing Conditions suggested by the Home Office in 1957 and the latest recommendations of the Home Office for electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps have been adopted. This work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified officer in the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. During the year 333 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirement of the Acts were complied with and three minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district the Act does not apply to any of them as the type of filling generally used is outside the scope of the Act. All premises used for upholstery and similar trades are visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and the type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas, electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted. Such appliances are sold at 41 shops in the district and all were visited by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are 49 sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Three premises are licensed under the Act and 13 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the licence. Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act, relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and in a district which is still partly rural, fill a useful purpose. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the local authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises of which there are four, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. Swimming Pools. There is no public swimming pool in the district, but during the year a practice pool, provided by a Parent-Teacher Association was installed at a local secondary school. At first chlorination was carried out by hand but following unsatisfactory results from bacteriological examination of the water, automatic dosing equipment was fitted. Pressure filters giving continuous filtration are part of the installation. Mortuary. For many years the Coroner for the district has required all bodies from this district to be taken to the Uxbridge Mortuary for post mortem examination. Consequently, the Council's mortuary, built in 1939 on land adjoining Hayes Cottage Hospital, has not been used. In order to avoid further expense on maintenance and repairs to the building the lease was surrendered and the building reverted to the Hospital Authorities. Official Searches. During the year 1,570 applications for information from persons proposing to acquire premises in the district were dealt with. Each one required answers to questions about sanitary notices or orders (outstanding or contemplated), Smoke Control Orders, Certificates of Disrepair and Slum Clearance. 50 51 Appendix I Part A.
