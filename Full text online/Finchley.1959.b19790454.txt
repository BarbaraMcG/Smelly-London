TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF FINCHLEY. In accordance with my statutory duty as your Medical Officer of Health I have the honour to present the Annual Health Report for the year 1959. This report is prepared according to the Ministry of Health circular 1 /60 and preceding relevant circulars. VITAL STATISTICS : (1) Birth Rate : The birth rate of 13.5 was slightly higher than the birth rate of 13.1 for 1958, giving a total of 932 births as against 902. The birth rate for England and Wales was 16.5. (2) Infantile Mortality Rate : The infantile mortality rate, i.e., the deaths of infants under one year, was 20.4 as compared to 20.0 for the year 1958— a total of 19 deaths as compared to 18 for the year 1958. The bulk of these deaths was due to ante-natal causes—and in our present state of medical knowledge hardly preventable. The national average rate was 22.0. (3) Death Rate : The death rate of 11.5 was slightly lower than the death rate of 11.9 for 1958—a total of 790 deaths as against 825 in 1958. Almost half the total number of deaths was due to diseases of the heart and blood vessels. There were fewer deaths from cancer of the lung, 27 as compared to 35 in 1958, and there was only one death due to leukaemia. There were no maternal deaths. (4) Population : The Registrar-General's estimate as at 30th June, 1959, indicates that the population of the Borough has fallen by 160—68,920 as against 69,080 for the year 1958. Once again, I find it difficult to explain this fall in that there was a natural increase of 142, and the number of inhabited houses showed an increase of 139 from 20,295 to 20,434. 5 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES : While it is not possible to draw up a balance sheet to show in financial terms the contribution of the work of this Department to the health of the community, the extent of this work is fully recorded in this report. Many studies have been carried out on diseases but relatively few have delved into the relationship between death and the social and economic condition of the individual and the general community. Let us take infant deaths. In Finchley in 1900, 111 infants per thousand born, died in the first year of life—in 1959 only 20 per thousand died. While medicine can claim a considerable amount of credit for this saving of infant life, there are many other factors involved; amongst them the standard of child and family care, general and health education, personal and environmental hygiene and good housing. It is generally understood that infantile mortality rates are highly sensitive to conditions of living, and it is hoped that this Department's efforts have played some part in making Finchley a safe place in which to be born. It is often said that ratepayers do not really know what their rate contributions are used for, but it should be understood that the Council, through all of its Departments, plays a vital part in keeping the community well served by the provision of good housing and open spaces, slum clearance, the inspection of food and food shops, the control of infectious diseases, and latterly an effort to provide clean air under the Clean Air Act of 1956. Apropos of housing, it is a pleasure to record the efforts that the vast majority of residents make to improve their homes. Even in our slum clearance areas one has been pleasantly surprised by the contrast between the interior and exterior of these homes. The inhabitants of our Borough to-day are deserving of good houses which they will undoubtedly turn into most pleasing homes. COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE: On the whole 1959 was a mild year in regard to infectious disease. In January there was a sharp outbreak of influenza which was of short duration. Measles became epidemic during April and May, but there were no deaths relating directly to these infections. There were no cases of diphtheria, typhoid or smallpox. Four cases of paratyphoid were notified. Investigations showed that three of these infections originated abroad (see page 25 for further details). Five cases of poliomyelitis were notified. Of these, 2 were nonparalytic and 3 paralytic. Of the 3 latter cases, 2 showed only minor 6 paralysis but the third case was severely affected in both legs and trunk. While not satistically significant, it is interesting to note that this latter case was the only one which had not had at least one vaccination against poliomyelitis. Last year only two persons died from tuberculosis, equalling 1958, the lowest number of deaths ever recorded. Twenty-six new cases were notified as against 29 cases during 1958, the majority of these cases, as expected, occurring in elderly persons. Finally, a word of appreciation to Dr. Emond, Superintendent of Coppetts Wood Infectious Diseases Hospital. His weekly ward round keeps mc in touch with the majority of cases of infectious disease which require hospital treatment in the Borough, and indeed with the variety of medical conditions which are sent to fever hospitals. GENERAL: Care of the Elderly: In my Report last year, I commented upon the increasing number of elderly in the Borough. The most accurate statistics available to me suggest that the number of elderly in the Borough has doubled in the last 25 years. While this problem is well to the fore in the eyes of the Council, and the statutory and voluntary welfare bodies, it is somewhat alarming to note that the number of hospital beds provided by the Regional Hospital Board for the Catchment Area of which Finchley is a part is lower than the average of beds provided in other hospital regions. It is to be hoped that this situation will be remedied. While the economic burden of the aged in the community may not as yet have reachcd a significant level, there is always the immediate danger of the overloading of the present medical facilities through increasing invalidism, or more important, epidemic illness. CONCLUSION : Since taking up my appointment last year, I have endeavoured to meet and make myself known to all working in the field of public health, personal health services, the voluntary and welfare services and the hospital services, and to make known and place at the disposal of these workers any help which this Department can give. The fact that it has become somewhat of a tradition that the Medical Officer of Health also undertakes the Honorary Secretaryship of the Finchley Division of the British Medical Association plays no little part in 7 this, and I thank the family doctors of Finchley ; their co-operation and assistance is greatly appreciated. To further this aim I have devoted a section of this Report (see page 66) to cover as many as possible of the statutory and voluntary services available in the Borough. No doubt there are omissions with regard to the voluntary bodies, and I shall be pleased to remedy this in my next report if the information is brought to my notice. I would like to acknowledge the help of all those too numerous to mention in this preamble who have contributed to the information for this section. I would again draw your attention to the loyalty and fidelity of the staff of this department and my appreciation of the help of the Chief Officers and members of other departments whose help enables this report to be completed ; and, finally, my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement. I am, Your obedient servant, J. G. HAGAN, Medical Officer of Health 8 Acknowledgments to:— The Chief Officers of the Council— The Town Clerk—R. M. Franklin, Esq. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor—P.

Figures concerning notified cases of Tuberculosis will be found on page 27. Diphtheria There were no cases of Diphtheria in 1959. During the year, 12 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 339 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. In addition, 328 children were immunised by General Practitioners with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Six hundred and nine children were given " booster " doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone and 6 children were given " booster " doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. 22 Scarlet Fever There were 27 cases of Scarlet Fever, 31 less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis Five cases of Poliomyelitis occurred during the year. Vaccination against Poliomyelitis The number of persons vaccinated in Finchley during 1959 is shown as follows:— 1. (a) With two injections:— (i) under 15 years 2,177 (ii) over 15 years 3,131 (b) With three injections 7,845 2. No. of expectant mothers vaccinated 401 3. No. of Hospital and Ambulance Staff vaccinated 22 Measles The number of notifications was 602 compared with 206 in 1958. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 7 in 1959 and there were no deaths. During the year, 337 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Only two forms of pneumonia, namely, acute primary and influenzal, are notifiable. Thirty-five such cases were reported to me during the year. In the table of deaths, all forms of pneumonia are included in the classification (No. 23). It will be seen that 66 deaths occurred and of these 60 were persons of 65 years of age and over. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 30, and 29 of these occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue. The remaining one case occurred at home. 23 Food Poisoning Thirteen persons were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year, and in addition 2 cases were otherwise ascertained. This compares very unfavourably with last year when only 3 cases occurred. Three of these cases formed a family outbreak, the suspected food being imported quick-frozen peeled prawns in plastic containers. Samples of these peeled prawns and their containers investigated at Colindale Laboratory showed the presence of Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci, the same strains as those isolated from the faeces of the affected family. It is common knowledge that imported prawns have been discovered to contain practically every dangerous variety of germ known, and that at present there are no bacteriological standards laid down with regard to the numbers of these organisms present. The real danger arises when these items are purchased by families who take them to homes lacking refrigerators and the frozen packs thaw with resultant rapid growth of organisms and inevitable food poisoning. This matter was taken up with the Company who supplied the food, and it was pointed out that these packs should contain a warning to the purchasers that the food should be eaten as soon as possible after purchase. After much correspondence the Company has agreed to affix a warning label on their future products. It is regrettable that these attractive and tasteful foods should be allowed to become disreputable, and it is hoped that when Port Medical Officers can devise a suitable bacteriological standard, importing companies will make every effort to prevent the infection of food at the packing stations abroad. It will also be helpful, of course, when every house in Britain can afford a refrigerator in which to maintain these foods in good condition. 24 The following is a summary of the cases:— Agent No. of Cases Total No. of cases Notified Otherwise ascertained Salmonella Typhi-murium 7 — 7 Salmonella Newport 1 — 1 Salmonella St. Paul 1 — 1 Coagulase-positive Staphylococci 1 2 3 Totals 10 2 12 Agent not identified 3 — 3 Totals 13 2 15 Research In connection with food poisoning, a survey of organic fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs is being carried out in collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Service, Colindale, and the Public Health Department, Hendon. It has been found that samples of such commodities have been shown to contain food poisoning bacilli. This survey is continuing and it is hoped that a report will be available by next year. Paratyphoid As stated previously, four cases of paratyphoid were notified, in one of which the source of infection could not be traced. Three of the cases occurred abroad. One of these incidents related to a school child forming one of a school party of 29 children accompanied by three teachers who had holidayed in France. Fortunately none of the other children was infected, but grave difficulty was experienced in tracing the names and addresses of children and teachers who accompanied the party, and it would be advisable generally for organised school parties to make available the names and addresses of members to the Head Teacher or to the Borough Education Officer before embarking on these tours. 25 Perhaps a further point would be to ensure that the countries visited have good standards of hygiene. One would have thought that tourist countries, from an economic point of view, should be impressed with the importance of this. Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was six hundred and twenty-six. Two hundred and seventy-nine persons were re-vaccinated. International Certificates of Vaccination Persons travelling to certain foreign parts have to provide themselves with certificates of vaccination or inoculation which must have been completed by their own medical practitioners before proceeding. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a medical officer in the Government or local authority of the country of issue. A form of authentication which has been accepted by the health authorities abroad is that given by public health authorities and identified by a rubber stamp impression placed by them on the certificate. The rubber stamp in this office bears the words " Finchley Corporation—Signature of doctor authenticated." The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. During the year over 600 certificates were authenticated. Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1959:— Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs : Diphtheria Bacilli 153 Haemolytic Streptococci 44 Vincent's Angina 2 Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci 3 26 Faeces : Sonne Dysentery 27 261 Salmonella 22 Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci 1 Clostridium Welchii 4 Esch. Coli 7 Sputum: T.B. Smear — I 21 Other Organisms 8 Whooping Cough: Cough Plate — 1 Post-nasal Swab — 119 436 Tuberculosis Two persons died from tuberculosis during 1959, giving a death rate of 0.029 per 1,000 population. Twenty-six new cases were notified and this figure is the lowest number per year of new notifications on record. The case rate per 1,000 population was 0.38. One child under school age was found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs. The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Nou-Pulmonary M. F M. F. M. F. M.

It is understood that arrangements will be made for the Unit to visit the Borough in 1961. Medical Examinations Thirty persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 18 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. In addition, 7 employees were examined for the purpose of extending sick pay, and, in the case of elderly employees, for proposed extension of service. Housing Applications During the year, a number of housing applications, accompanied by medical certificates, were submitted by the Borough Housing Officer to ascertain if additional points could be recommended on medical grounds. On receipt of these applications, it was often necessary to visit the family concerned and to discuss various aspects of each case with the family doctor and with the Housing Officer. In addition, a number of applications were considered on account of overcrowding and sanitary defects. Much work is involved in investigating these cases in order to be certain that deserving cases are given full consideration. In special cases where the medical condition of the applicant merited urgent rehousing but the award of extra " points " would not give immediate help the case was brought before the Housing Lettings Committee of the Council, for their decision, and in every instance the medical reports were taken into account. Health Education Health Education is now reaching its true place in the medical world and in recent years many campaigns have been conducted, particularly with regard to food hygiene, vaccination and immunisation, and home safety ; in this connection a number of talks were given by Officers of this Department to interested groups. It must be realised, of course, that Health Education is a continuing process and touches every activity of this Department in the course of the year. The Public Health Inspectors on their visits and inspections 28 to homes, institutions and shops will always point out an}7 defect which comes to their notice within the field of Health Education. It has been said that the mere teaching of factual material is inadequate and does not provide the required new attitudes nor change old ones. It is necessary that well-made films be produced and indeed this has been done on various aspects of Health Education. Perhaps the most potent factor of all has not yet been fully exploited, that is the use of television. It is regrettable that this medium tends to neglect this important field, and perhaps a programme entitled " Emergency Home Safety" would be of more value and create less controversy than " Emergency Ward 10." It should certainly be of greater value to the community. Medicine always makes news and surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of our specialist health educators to produce a television programme to compete with the popularity of the less valuable popular medical programmes seen to-day. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47—Removal to Suitable Premises of Persons in need of care and attention Difficulties nearly always arise in these cases where aged persons have allowed their homes to become neglected and, in many cases, filthy ; they themselves, apart from living in a squalid atmosphere, are able to care for themselves, and in many of these cases, if the premises could be cleaned up satisfactorily, the old persons would tend to become more interested in their housework. In one particular case of an old person living with a mentally defective son in poor financial circumstances, one of our Public Health Inspectors together with two other members of the staff obtained the necessary materials through relatives and carried out the work themselves outside normal working hours, transforming a slum into a very pleasing residence. Fortunately these cases are few in number, and if the present impetus towards the care of the aged carries on and our social and visiting services develop, I think that there will be no need to arrange legally the removal of any of our aged persons in the future. (b) Section 50—Burial or Cremation of the Dead It is the duty of the Local Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead 29 in the area, in any case where it appears to the authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being otherwise made. In these circumstances, the deceased persons are buried in the St. Pancras Cemetery. The expenses incurred in each case amount to a total of £18 15s. 6d. This charge is inclusive of the undertaker's fee and the cemetery fee, and may, of course, vary from time to time. The Local Authority may be able to recover part or all of this sum from the estate of the deceased person. Only one burial was carried out by the Council in accordance with the provisions of this Section during the year. Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, " It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Seven copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the public health inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. Laundry Service for the Incontinent The laundry service, which commenced in 1957, continued to operate in the Borough. The service has been set up to assist in the problems concerning incontinent persons. It operates in accordance with the provisions of Section 42 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, which deals with, amongst other things, the cleansing of soiled articles. The washing machine is installed at the Disinfecting Station and arrangements are made for articles to be collected and delivered twice weekly. The practice is for collections to be made on Tuesdays and Fridays, and for deliveries, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The cost of the service is borne by the local authority. The only stipulation made is that the garments or bedding involved must not be of a type which could be accepted by a commercial laundry. 30 During 1959, 208 collections of articles were made. The number of persons for whom the service was recommended, and subsequently authorised by the Medical Officer of Health or by the Public Health Inspectors was 7. Two persons were continuing to receive assistance at the end of the year. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1959:— Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 1,557 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 4,018 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 — (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose — (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 1 (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 229 2.

Housing Act, 1957, Part III—Slum Clearance 1. The slum clearance programme was continued during the year, and there remained only three small areas to be dealt with to complete the five-year programme submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The following are the particulars of these areas:— 32 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 11,599. At 272 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 839 were discovered, and at the end of the year 834 including a number outstanding at the end of 1958 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 83 was in hand and 1,395 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 726 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:— Inspections under Housing Acts 42 Other Inspections including Inspections under Public Health Act, 1936 3,375 Re-Inspections 1,693 Inspections under Rent Act, 1957 113 Inspections of Works in Progress 726 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 279 Visits to Slaughterhouses 14 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 10 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 22 Inspections of Meat, Fish and Other Food Shops 498 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 94 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 393 Visits re Rodent Control 3,039 Visits re Overcrowding 141 Visits re Hawkers 48 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 10 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 7 Visits re Heating Appliances—Fireguards 23 Visits re Clean Air Act, 1956 478 Miscellaneous 594 11,599 35 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Repairs or amendments to existing drains 26 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 246 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 234 Length in yards of iron drains laid 58 Manholes provided 16 Manholes repaired 2 Manhole covers provided 31 Intercepting traps fixed 5 Caps to intercepting traps provided 25 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 5 New gully traps fixed 26 Gully curbs provided or repaired 5 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 5 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 3 Water tests applied 102 Smoke tests applied 27 Air tests applied 19 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C. basins fixed 43 W.Cs. unstopped, cleansed or repaired 18 New flushing cisterns fitted to W.Cs 19 Existing flushing cisterns repaired 21 New W.C. apartments provided 9 W.C. apartments cleansed 3 Lavatory basins provided 31 Baths provided 15 New impervious sinks provided 18 New waste pipes fixed 16 Waste pipes trapped, repaired or unstopped 4 Urinals cleansed or repaired 2 Ventilated lobbies provided 1 36 Bees 6 Moths 2 Clover Mites 3 Silver Fish 1 Spider Beetles 2 Beetles 1 Woodworm 1 Cluster Flies 1 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was 20, compared with 60 in 1958. Sanitary Conveniences There are 31 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Complaints One thousand seven hundred and fifteen complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz.:— Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 7 Accumulations of refuse and manure 56 Blocked or defective drains 326 Defective roofs 34 Defective W.Cs 16 Flooding 13 Foreign matter in food 4 Dirty milk bottle 1 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 116 Noise 8 Non-removal of refuse 15 Nuisances from dampness 29 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 28 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 4 Premises infested with insects 69 Premises infested with rats or mice 455 Smells from public sewers 5 Smells from sewage works 4 Smoke nuisances 10 39 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 16 Unsound food 17 Verminous condition of houses 10 Wasps' nests 360 Woodworm 8 Bees 7 Foxes 1 Shops Act 2 Drinking Water 6 Other complaints 88 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of the complaint. The very great increase in the number of wasps' nests dealt with will be noted (47 in 1958, 360 in 1959), due, no doubt, to the abnormal hot and dry summer. This increase was general throughout the country. Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. Six defects were discovered as a result of these inspections and were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Twenty-four premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex CountyCouncil which is the licensing authority. 40 Factories Acts, 1937-1948 1.

It has been found that the home conditions are quite satisfactory. The following table shows, by trades, the number of outworkers residing in the district, and who were notified to me in the August lists as required by Section 110(i)(c) of the Factories Act, 1937:— Wearing apparel 27 Artificial flowers 1 Lampshades 11 Making of brushes 1 Making of boxes 1 There were no cases of default in sending lists to the Council (Section 110) and no instances of work in unwholesome premises (Section 111). 44 FOOD FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 Food Hygiene Regulations The food hygiene regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises and stalls, and of apparatus and equipment, the hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction of food premises, their repair and maintenance and the facilities including sinks and wash basins to be provided ; and the temperature at which certain foods are to be kept. A number of the fish shops in the Borough have been completely modernised, including the provision of plate glass windows, doing away, therefore, with the old open-fronted shops. 1. Number of Inspections: The Public Health Inspectors continued a survey of food premises and during the year, 577 visits were made to shops and other premises in order to ascertain compliance with the Regulations, and arising therefrom 69 contraventions were found, and 4 letters sent and 18 verbal notices given in connection therewith. The following is a summary of the works done during the year:— Benches provided 1 Bread Troughs (zinc lined) provided 2 Clothes Lockers provided 2 Cold Display Cabinets provided 3 Doors provided or repaired 3 Dustbins provided 2 Electric light provided 1 Extractor Fan provided 2 45 First Aid supplies provided 1 Fish and Chip ranges fixed 3 pairs Floors renewed or repaired 5 Hot water installed 11 Lavatory Basins provided 5 Nailbrushes provided 4 Oven provided 1 Ovens removed 2 Shelves (glass) provided 1 Shelves (wood) provided 1 Shop Front provided 1 Sinks provided 9 Redecorations carried out and plasterwork repaired 50 Towels provided 1 Walls tiled 4 Waste Channel cleansed 1 W.C. cleansed 1 W.C.

Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops: Notices for exhibition have been supplied to all food shops in the district, pointing out that the presence of dogs is a danger to the health of the public. 5. School Kitchens: A number of visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to school kitchens and the staffs are to be commended on the high standard of cleanliness which has been maintained. 6. Method of Disposal of Condemned Food: Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared continued to receive special attention. There were no new registrations of hawkers during the year. The number of barrow boys operating in the district at the end of the year was 4. Slaughterhouses There is only one slaughterhouse in the district, which has been regularly inspected. 47 Carcases and Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed (if known) - — — 2 304 — Number inspected — — — 2 304 — All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci: Whole carcases condemned - - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 21 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci - - - - 6.91 - Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned - - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 1 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - - - - 0.33 - Cysticercosis: Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — - - - - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration - - - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - - 48 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1959 (1) In Slaughterhouses TUBERCULOSIS Pigs Head 1 OTHER DISEASES Pigs Livers 4 (Cirrhosis) Lungs 13 prs.

Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958, which repealed the Act of 1933, all animals slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Two persons were licensed during 1959. Butchers' Shops There were 49 butchers' shops in the district, all of which are provided with glass fronts. All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough at the beginning of the year was 20. One closed, leaving 19 at the end of the year. At 18 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the Public Health Inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. 51 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 8 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1959, as follows:— Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 16 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 18 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 26 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 9 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 8 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 9 Food Sampling The following information has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955:— List of Samples procured in the Borough during the year Article Total Samples procured. Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 66 9 Milk (various) 41 — Bread, etc 2 — Butter 5 — Cakes 10 — Cheese 11 3 Cooked Meat 13 — Cream 6 — Drugs 8 — Fish and Fish Products 21 1 Fruit, Fresh-Canned 6 — Ice Cream 14 — Liver 12 — Margarine 6 — Meat and Meat Products 43 2 Preserves 3 - Sausages, etc. 12 — 52 Sweets 3 - Vinegar 23 3 Miscellaneous 6 2 Totals 311 20 Regarding the samples noted as unsatisfactory, the following comments are added:— Milk. Two consignments of new milk delivered to milk depots in the district were found to include churns of milk deficient in solids not fat. The deficiencies were not serious, and the other churns of milk associated with the six deficient samples contained genuine milk. No evidence of added water was found and the low solids not fat were most likely due to a natural diet deficiency. In another case a delivery was found to include three churns of milk low in fat. Again the associated churns of milk were correct and the overall average satisfactory. Cheese. A retailer's assistant was misled by a delivery roundsman's description, and contrary to the company's instructions applied the description "Cream Cheese" to soft whole milk cheeses. A cream cheese should contain at least 50 per cent. fat on the whole cheese to justify this description; in the case concerned the whole milk cheeses contained 29 per cent. fat. The company was officially cautioned. In another case a Continental pack of "KASE CREME" cheese was found on sale not bearing on the label an indication of the type of cheese in English nomenclature. Upon representation being made to the importers it was named as "Soft Cheese," being approximately 37 per cent. fat on the whole cheese. It was considered that the retention of the German name would only mislead purchasers into expecting a cream cheese. Fish and Fish Products. Tinned fish may not contain preservative when sold in this country. A sample of tinned smoked saithe was found on sale, which upon analysis was shown to have been preserved with Hexamine. This is allowable in the country of its origin, and the importer had inadvertently overlooked its inclusion. An official caution was issued. 53 Meat and Meat Products. Two samples of tinned beef procured from a butcher were found to have been preserved with sulphur dioxide. Proceedings were undertaken and the company fined £3 with £4 12s. 0d. costs. Vinegar. Samples of vinegar from three retailers were found deficient in acetic acid. A genuine vinegar should contain at least 4 per cent. of acetic acid, and it would appear that these samples had fallen below the minimum due to deterioration during storage. Subsequent sampling revealed genuine vinegar, and no further action was taken. Miscellaneous. Plain flour supplied to a school kitchen was found by the cook to behave in an unexpected manner when used in a small quantity of gravy. Analysis disclosed that it contained 38% of Sodium Bicarbonate. The millers had uncovered similar trouble from the equivalent batch and suspected sabotage by an aggrieved employee. In view of the circumstances they were given an official caution. The Public Control Department also reported upon the following matters:— Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887—1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926, and which relate to the marking with an indication of origin of certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold, are complied with. Inspections were made at 237 premises of 772 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, butter and dried fruit. Any infringements detected were of a minor nature, and were dealt with by verbal warnings. Two prosecutions were undertaken under the main Act. One was in relation to the application of a false trade description of measure to bulk milk delivered by a farmer to a receiving depot within this district. The company concerned was convicted but given an absolute discharge on the payment of £11 14s. 0d. costs. The other prosecution was in respect of a delivery of meat to a Finchley 54 School kitchen which was deficient in weight. The firm was fined £5 and ordered to pay £2 2s. 0d. costs. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and in the case of a compounded food with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 614 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 85 premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above Regulations. False and Misleading Descriptions. Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false or misleading statements and descriptions. Much of this scrutiny of food labels can be combined with inspection work under the Labelling of Food Order. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the Boroughs, and work under this heading is combined with inspections made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Food Order. Examples where corrective action was sought are, fruit syrups described as fruit "juices," slimming claims in association with lemon juice drinks, and a "Seedless Fig Bar" which contained crushed seeds. Some extravagant claims in respect of medical remedies were challenged and the advertisements withdrawn. Special Designated Milk. During 1959 the Middlesex County Council issued two Dealers' (Pasteuriser) and one Dealers' (Steriliser) licences in respect of premises within Finchley where milk is processed. These premises were regularly inspected, and compliance with statutory requirements was well maintained. A total of 85 samples of designated milk was taken, all of which were certified as being satisfactory. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing 49 samples of raw milk were procured within the Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated. 55 Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix." Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 165 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Coffee Stalls There are now no coffee stalls in the district, the last remaining one was closed and demolished in 1957. Fish Friers At the end of 1959 there were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out. Game Licences Fifteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows:— Number on Register at beginning of 1959 950 Number closed 8 New Shops 10 Number on Register at end of 1959 952 Changes of Occupancy 28 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was twelve. Swimming Pools Finchley has two Swimming Pools, Squires Lane Baths and the Open Air Pools in the High Road, N.12. The latter comprises Adult and Children's Pools and is said to be one of the finest examples in the London Area. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough 56 Engineer and Surveyor, under whose control the baths are operated, for the following report:— "Both establishments are equipped with modern filtration and chlorination plants. The water is drawn from the public water supply and is continuously filtered on a six-hour cycle, make-up water being added as necessary to cover losses by evaporation, filter washing and other causes. The chlorination is controlled in accordance with the latest practice in this important subject. "Samples of the water are taken regularly for bacteriological examination and the results are consistently satisfactory. This reflects greatly to the credit of the staff directly concerned with the operation of the purification plants, for the bathing load is frequently heavy. Indeed, during the year under review, 377,800 bathers visited the Open-Air Pools during the season, the greatest number ever recorded being present on the 5th July, 1959, when the attendance was 14,570." Thirty-six samples of the water were taken by Public Health Inspectors during the year. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copics of reports on 12 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses. Clean Air Act, 1956 The above Act deals with the control of dark smoke, smoke from furnaces, smoke control areas and special cases of smoke emission, which include special processes to be dealt with under the Alkali Act, colliery spoil-banks, railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. It also makes provision for the establishment of a Clean Air Council for England and Wales. Certain sections of the Act came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, including those relating to the height of chimneys and to smoke control areas. The remaining provisions came into operation on the 1st June, 1958, and included those relating to the 57 hibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisances and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. With regard to the making of smoke control areas, any local authority may make an Order, which must be confirmed by the Minister declaring the whole or any part of its district as a smoke control area. Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of chimney smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused only by the burning of an authorised fuel. If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area, has to incur expenditure for adapting his heating arrangements, the local authority shall repay him seventenths of the cost, four-tenths of which is recoverable from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In 1958, the Council passed a resolution to make the whole of the Borough a smoke control area within 10 years. At the request of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, local authorities had to submit to the Minister their proposals with regard to the making of smoke control areas for the next five years. The Council decided that all that portion of the Borough, lying to the south of the railway line from the Borough boundary in the west to the North Circular Road, and thence south of the North Circular Road to the Borough boundary in the east should be included in this programme and further agreed to commence a survey in connection with 4 areas as follows, the Minister having given his preliminary consent thereto:— (1) Basing Estate, N.3. Total number of dwellings—200; Acreage—12.6. (2) Red Lion Hill, N.2. Total number of dwellings—291; Acreage—10.34. (3) Elmshurst Estate, N.2. Total number of dwellings—171; Acreage—10.09. (4) Hampstead Garden Suburb, N.2 and N.W.I 1. Total number of dwellings (including commercial and other premises)—1,546; Acreage—446. At the end of the year, the inspections of the properties within these areas were well in hand. Owing to the considerable amount of work involved, the Council Council Housing Estates. 58 agreed to make an appointment of an Assistant suitably qualified for this purpose. A certain amount of publicity has been given, and during the year, lectures were given by members of the staff to organisations in the district, on clean air, in general, and more particularly, with regard to smoke control areas. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Ten complaints were received during the year concerning industrial and domestic chimneys. In addition, 28 complaints were received with regard to the burning of garden and other refuse and action was taken in a number of cases where it was considered that burning was habitual and causing a nuisance. A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, are being converted or installed for oil burning. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil fired plant and for the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes refused in the absence of the necessary legislation to control this matter. Atmospheric Pollution Four deposit gauges are sited as follows:— (1) Roof of Gaumont Cinema, High Road, N.12. (2) Lyttelton Playing Fields, N.2. (3) Moss Hall School, Moss Hall Grove, N.12. (4) Sewage Disposal Works, Summers Lane, N.12. 59 A summary of the monthly analyses of the deposits collected is shown below:— 1959 SITES (1) (2) (3) (4) January 15.52 9.20 9.45 13.18 February 11.72 9.97 8.58 10.63 March 15.42 8.93 11.08 14.86 April 11.99 7.84 8.46 16.62 May 6.75 4.26 5.02 18.75 June 9.62 5.86 6.19 8.84 July 8.85 8.57 6.70 6.57 August 9.02 5.79 6.19 8.11 September 7.40 7.91 6.93 5.80 October 10.90 8.11 8.21 9.60 November *37.53 10.22 8.73 13.95 December 9.95 11.20 10.57 21.73 The figures show total solids (tons per square mile per month). *This figure is not authentic due to unauthorised tampering with the bottle. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Twenty-three visits have been made to premises to ascertain that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. No contraventions of the Act were found with regard to the sale of new fires, but in the case of a second-hand dealer it was ascertained that a fire exhibited for sale did not comply with the Act. A verbal warning was given and the fire withdrawn from sale. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The number of persons licensed at the end of the year was 6. All the premises have been inspected. 60 Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following 2 instances:— (1) Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 2. A bakery firm, whose premises are outside the district, was summonsed for selling, to the prejudice of the purchaser, a sliced loaf of bread not being of the substance demanded, in that it contained pieces of string. The case was dismissed, it being submitted that the presence of the string was not harmful and did not alter the substance of the bread. Arising from this decision, and other similar decisions, the Council referred the matter to the Association of Municipal Corporations with a view to clarification of the meaning of this Section of the Act. After consideration, it was decided to take no action for the time being until further evidence of similar decisions was forthcoming. (2) Food & Drugs Act, 1955—Section 2. A dairy firm was prosecuted for selling a bottle of milk containing foreign matter (i.e., a snail). As there appeared to be some doubt as to how and when the snail entered the bottle, the case was dismissed. RODENT CONTROL In recent years it was found convenient to prepare this report for the period of the financial year (i.e., 1st April to 31st March). This facilitated the work in connection with submitting a claim to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, under Section 11 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. However, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1958, Section 4, no grant from the Ministry is now payable. In view of this, it is intended that the period under review in future Annual Reports should be for the calendar year, as is the case with all other subjects discussed here. The Rodent Control report this year covers the period from 1st April, 1959, to 31st December, 1959. 61 Complaints and Infestations Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was con finned Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1/4/58 to 31/3/59 1/4/51) to 31/ 12/51) 1/4/58 to 31/3/59 1/4/59 to 31/12/59 1/4/58 to 31/3/59 1/4/59 to 31/12/59 Rats 382 283 234 184 148 99 Mice 98 82 75 74 23 8 Total 480 365 309 258 171 107 It is 15 years since Rodent Control work was handed over to Local Authorities by the County Council. During this period many improved poisons have been discovered and new methods have come into being with their use. The diligent work carried out throughout the last 15 years is undoubtedly keeping the rat population down to a low level and while the number of complaints does not materially decrease, the size of the infestations arc remarkably small. Several occupiers of property in Friern Barnet Urban District sent in written complaints of rats invading their property from the Sewage Farm. Once again test baits were laid and no evidence of such migration could be found. Each complainant was informed of these findings. Two hundred and thirty-seven additional premises were inspected and, arising therefrom, 28 rat infestations and 3 infestations of mice were found. Seventeen smoke tests were applied to rat runs which revealed defects in drains and/or sewers in 9 cases. 62 Summary of Work carried out from 1/4/59 to 31/12/59 Rats Mice Visits in connection with infestations and surveys 1,996 450 Number of confirmed infestations 212 77 Prebaits 54 — Zinc Phosphide 25 — Arsenic — — A.N.T.U — — Warfarin 1,849 309 Gassings 1 - Treatment of Sewers The 25th and 26th Maintenance Treatments of sewers were carried out in May and October respectively, oiled warfarin being used. It is interesting to note that of the 114 "takes" in May, only 18 showed slight "takes" when dealt with in October. The following table indicates the amount of work involved:— May, 1959 Oct., 1959 Total number of manholes baited 700 623 Number of poison "takes" 114 68 63 GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE BOROUGH STATUTORY SERVICES PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the Middlesex County Council.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The Borough of Finchley forms part of the EAST CENTRAL DIVISION for Mental Health Services in the Middlesex County Council. Divisional Office: 2, Maryland Road, Wood Green, N.22. (Tel. : BOWes Park 4281). Senior Medical Officer: Dr. R. C. Greenberg. Divisional Mental Welfare Officer: Mr. W. J. Ward. Mental Welfare Officers: Mr. E. Inglis; Mr. D. L. Richards; Mr. E. Armstrong; Mr. W. J. B. Staple. 66 Mental Health Social Worker: Miss C. M. Coups. Psychiatric Social Workers: Mr. E. Heimler; Miss E. Arkinstall. The mental health social worker makes regular visits to the homes of all the sub-normal and severely sub-normal females and males up to the age of ten years and advises on all aspects of the patient's well being and employment in appropriate cases. She submits written reports on her visits so that where necessary the County Medical Officer may take appropriate action such as arranging admission to psychiatric hospitals either on a temporary or permanent basis. Such temporary admissions, of up to eight weeks, are arranged to meet acute domestic difficulties or ill health of mother. The mental welfare officers deal similarly with the sub-normal and severely sub-normal males over the age of ten years. The main duty of the mental welfare officers is the care and in part the after-care of those persons suffering from mental illness including dealing with those requiring compulsory detention in psychiatric hospitals under the Lunacy and Mental Treatments Acts which will not be repealed until the Mental Health Act, 1959, comes fully into operation. Both the mental welfare officers and the mental health social workers transport patients in their cars to and from the psychiatric hospitals. The psychiatric social workers are largely concerned with the after-care and rehabilitation of persons discharged after undergoing treatment either in hospitals or at out-patient clinics but also deal with a similar type of case who may not have had to enter a psychiatric hospital and in cases referred from the National Assistance Board because of chronic unemployment. As regards the general practitioners, they receive via the Middlesex Executive Council, a schedule setting out the information given above and also the procedure under which they may obtain the services of a mental welfare officer outside normal office hours. In addition to the home visiting service, there are junior training schools for the young severely sub-normal and adult training centres for those of sixteen years of age and over. Although at present there 67 are none of these establishments actually sited within the Borough, some eighteen Finchley children are transported daily by coach to Hornsey and Neasden Junior Training Schools and six Finchley youths are taken by express coach to Isleworth Adult Training Centre. A therapeutic social club is run under the direction of Miss Arkinstall, Psychiatric Social Worker, for incipient mental cases and for those discharged from psychiatric hospitals who are in need of after-care, at York Park Day Nursery, York Road, Hendon, N.W.9, at 7 p.m. every Tuesday evening. Under the Mental Health Act, 1959, it is proposed to increase the above facilities and to provide, in addition, residential accommodation and day centres for the mentally disordered living in the community. WELFARE SERVICES Welfare Services under Part III of the National Assistance Act, 1948, are provided by the Welfare Department of the Middlesex County Council.

The Club does not confine itself to those who have suffered from Poliomyelitis. Persons who have suffered from any kind of disablement may attend at the Bath, providing that each can produce a certificate from his family doctor stating that he is free from infection and would benefit from attending the swimming sessions. The cases are collected from a wide area by ambulance and cars (such arrangements being made by the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship) and are assisted in changing and serving hot drinks, and also in the water by 72 voluntary helpers, from the British Red Cross Society and members of various Swimming Clubs. The improvement physically and mentally has been most marked. This Club is an excellent illustration of the successful co-operation with and between the voluntary bodies. ST.
