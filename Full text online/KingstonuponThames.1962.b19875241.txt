PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, GUILDHALL , KINGSTON-UPON-THAMES. JUNE, 1963. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE ROYAL BOROUGH OF KINGSTON-UPON-THAMES. ANNUAL REPORT, 1962. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the public health and social conditions of the Borough for 1962. As in previous years the report follows the general lines indicated by the Minister of Health, and is in accordance with Circular l/63. Population - The Registrar General's estimated mid 1962 home population figure is given as 35,990 (resident population figure - used for calculation of the statistical data in this report). The estimated day population is about 300,000 persons who enter the town, for business, education, and recreation purposes,, This influences the volume of work and responsibility of the Corporation. Births - The number of live births for 1962 is 614 and compares with 639 for 1961. The crude birth rate is 17.0 per 1,000 population compared with 17.1 for 1961. Deaths - The number of deaths recorded in 1962 is 463 compared with 462 for 1961. This makes a crude death rate of 12.8 as compared with 12.8 for 1961. The excess of births over deaths was 151 compared with 177 for the previous year. The number of infant deaths (under 1 year of age) in 1962 is 18 which gives an Infant Mortality rate per 1,000 live births of 29.3. The corresponding figures for 1961 were 10 infant deaths and an Infant Mortality rate of 15.6. The following table shows the approximate average rate for the previous five years. (ii) INFANT MORTALITY RATE 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Total No. Deaths 8 13 6 10 18 RATE PER l,000 LIVE BIRTHS 14.9 23.0 10.4 15.6 29.3 No maternal deaths (i.e. from pregnancy, childbirth, abortion) were recorded out of a total of 622 live and stillbirths. Causes of Death - Main conditions causing death during 1962 weres:- 1962 1961 Heart Disease 143 133 Cancer 94 112 Vascular Lesions of the Nervous System. 54 55 The following table shows the relevant figures for the past five years in respect of Kingston residents. The Registrar General couples cancer of the lung with cancer of the bronchus in his abbreviated list of causes of death. 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus Total Total Total Total Total 25 26 23 21 29 M F M F M F M F M F 23 2 23 3 20 3 19 2 24 5 (iii) Infectious Disease - The number of infectious disease notifications received in 1962 was 81, as compared with 560 in 196l, a difference of 479,, which is accounted for by a decrease in the eases of measles and puerperal pyrexia throughout the year. Active protection of the child population against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus smallpox, tuberculosis and poliomyelitis was continued at a good pace. Diphtheria - For the fifteenth yeas in succession no cases of diphtheria occurred in Kingston, Outbreaks of the disease occurred in unimmunised children in seme areas which only emphasized the importance of keeping the child population as highly immunised as possible and particularly for initial protection to be given in their first year. Parents are constantly encouraged to take full advantage of the immunisation service provided and intensive campaigns are carried out to immunise the school and pre-school population against this disease, This is done under my direction as Medical Officer of Health as well as Divisional Medical Officer for North Central Division of Surrey, at the Surrey County Council Clinics and by General Medical Practitioners, Housing and Rehousing - The provision of housing accommodation has proceeded throughout the year. It is felt necessary to reiterate that substantial measures must be taken in an endeavour to meet existing housing requirements as well as those of a possible increased population. During 1962, the Corporation provided 11 housing units comprising 7 single and 4 double bed-sitting rooms. Two houses, 94 flats and 1 bungalow were built by private enterprise giving a total of 109 housing units in Kingston during the year. The Minister of Housing and Local Government announced a massive national drive to speed slum clearance;, modernise obsolescent houses and build many more new houses (Circular No, 42/62), It is desired to "accelerate the progress of most of the elements of the housing programme and to keep up the pace until the housing of the entire nation is decent." It is again emphasized that there is a need to secure complete slum clearance, also building for old people and those who are living in overcrowded squalid conditions though not in unfit houses, and who cannot rehouse themselves by their own efforts. An increased provision of suitable Mousing accommodation is a most important service for old people. As increasing proportion of local authority housing is of this type, but there is considerable leeway to be made up. There is no doubt that many of the elderly are greatly handicapped by remaining in dwellings that are too big for (iv) their needs, or, beyond their physical capabilities to manage, Old people prefer to spend their last years in a house of their own among their own possessions and memories; their own community of relatives and friends; but the provision of suitably designed and equipped homes enables the old person to retain his independence for longer than before. Food Poisoning - In spite of the very large number of eating places and food shops in Kingston, no cases of food poisoning occurred during 1962 which could be attributed to lack of hygiene in the trade. Eight cases of infection in very young children by known food poisoning organisms were reported during the year. The pattern of spread, concerned three separate families affecting with one exception, young children and those of school age, The single adult case was that of a man aged 55 years who was taken ill during a business visit to Carlisle and reported as having salmonella bredeney infection. Infective Hepatitis - During the year twelve cases of Infective Hepatitis (Infectious Jaundice) occurred in the northern part of Kingston, Infective Hepatitis is not a notifiable disease so that there may have been a few more eases elsewhere. The incubation period is 4/6 weeks which makes it difficult to find the source of infection for every case. However, it was possible to establish the source in most of the cases. The infection was transferred from one member of the family to another in some instances and in others from contact with neighbours. There is no obvious reason why there should have been a slight increase in the numbers which normally occur in the summer months. It is not usually a serious illness and the only special measures that are necessary are good hygiene in the home. Cigarette Smoking - Lung Cancer - Health Education - The determination of the Government to break down public apathy to the relationship of smoking and lung cancer was established when in October two mini-vans were bought and equipped for use by the Central Council of Health Education as mobile information units. These mobile units have been specially designed to meet the needs of a long-term campaign by local authorities throughout the country to inform the public about the dangers to health involved in smoking. The cost of the units and equipment is met by a special grant from the Ministry of Health. (v) Each unit consists of a white mini-van descriptively sloganned and tearing the name of the town visited. The equipment includes film and filmstrip projectors, tape recorders, films and exhibition material, together with posters and leaflets on the subject. The units are manned by four young university graduates. all non-smokers,, Each has been specially trained and briefed to deliver talks on the subject of smoking and health and is expert in the use of visual aids. These activities are directed particularly to young people in schools and youth clubs, and they work in close liaison with Medical Officers of Healthy and Education Departments. A specimen day's programme includes talks to classes in primary and secondary schools, at ante-natal clinics and mothers' clubs, training colleges for teachers, etc. Evening sessions also include youth clubs, evening institutes, parent/teacher associations, W.V.S., Red Cross Branches, etc. Mobile unit visits were arranged for Kingston.

Social Conditions. Kingston-upon-Thames is a Royal and Ancient Borough situated upon the south bank of the River Thames, within the County of Surrey and the Greater London area. Although it is renowned as a prosperous market town and for its extensive shopping centre, which provides the main economic function, there is also important industrial activity in Aircraft and Engineering. Kingston is not only a centre for education and recreation, but is a "commuting" area for business people travelling daily to and from London. The social conditions are influenced by the trend of the high level of employment which exists in the town and the Manager of the local Employment Exchange, Miss M. Bond, has kindly provided the following information regarding employment in Kingston and Districts:- "At the end of 1961 I reported that unemployment during the year had been slightly higher on average than in 1960 This trend unfortunately continued throughout 1962. In December 1961 there were 400 men and 91 women unemployed but by the end of 1962 these totals had risen to 705 and 129, the total of 834 representing 1% of the working population in the Employment Exchange area. When compared with the national percentage of 2.5 the local percentage was small but nevertheless gave cause for some concern. The diversity of industry in the Employment Exchange area is such that if one section is experiencing difficulties other sections are prosperous and a reasonable balance is usually maintained, During 1962, however, there appeared to be a general air of caution and engagements of labour through the Exchange were 342 fewer than in the previous year. With rising unemployment figures it is a natural corollary that demands for labour should fall and this is evident in 3 the fact that at the end of 1962 there were only 302 vacancies notified as outstanding for men compared with 531 at the same time last year. The majority of these were for workers with a high degree of skill or specialised experience. It was some little consolation to know that in the case of women demands were higher towards the end of the year, and from September onwards there were more vacancies available for women than for men. It is not surprising in view of the fewer employment opportunities for men that considerably fewer were found work during the year. The Exchange placed 3,188 men in local work and 127 in work in other Exchange areas, The higher demands for women enabled 1,076 to be found work locally and 80 in other districts, representing an increase of 41 over the figures for 1961, Of all those placed 12 men and 53 women were persons already in employment who were, for a number of reasons, seeking a change, while 204 men and 49 women were disabled. Most of these placings were in jobs within daily travelling distance of Kingston but two of the men were applicants on Local Authority Housing Lists for whom it was possible to find work in new and expanded towns. In the absence of suitably qualified persons on housing lists four vacancies in new or expanded towns were filled by the submission of other registrants. As part of the employment service 26 key workers employed by a Surbiton firmg, some of whom lived in Kingston, were assisted under the Ministry's Transfer of Labour Schemes to move their households to Plymouth where they were required to train local labour at the Company' s new factory. The number of ex-Regular service men who sought help in their resettlement into civilian employment was 40 in 1962 compared with 34 in 1961. Of these 15 were placed and 4 were accepted for courses of vocational training to fit them for specific occupations in civilian life. The disappointing downward trend in employment during 1962 appeared to be felt in most manufacturing industries and was due to a variety of causes, There was a general tendency to caution as a result of the Common Market negotiations and many firms reported a reduction in orders, In general the workers discharged were in the semi-skilled and unskilled categories and were more difficult to place in other work because of their lack of skill and qualifications. Where redundancies occurred arrangements were made wherever possible to register workers before they were discharged so that efforts to place them in alternative employment could be made without delay and before their notices expired. In most cases workers received severance payments based on length of service which helped in some degree to mitigate hardship where unemployment ensued. 4 In the aircraft industry the industrial picture was on the whole not so gloomy as the general picture. The decision to proceed with the manufacture of nine P1127 vertical take-off and landing aircraft produced increasing demands for skilled workers in specialised occupations. Recruitment of such workers was undertaken from all parts of the country and several workers coming to work in the Kingston area were paid allowances towards the cost of their lodgings under the Ministry of Labour Transfer Schemes. The retail trade in Kingston continued at a prosperous level and many firms introduced self-service facilities. There is always a high unsatisfied demand for women shop assistants and self-service arrangements do much to overcome the shortage. It is perhaps unwise to attempt to make any predictions about the employment position for 1963. It is probable that unemployment registers will be at a generally higher level than for some years past but I think it is safe to say that if there is a general improvement in the national economic position then Kingston, because of the diversity of its industry, will have a large share in any such improvement." 3. Extracts from Vital Statistics of the Year. The crude birth and death rates for local areas cannot properly be compared by reason of the fact that the population on which they are based may be of widely differing sex and age constitutions. Consequently the Registrar General provides a comparability factor for each area. When the crude rate of any area is multiplied by this factor an adjusted rate is produced which can be used to compare with the adjusted rate of any other area, or with the crude rate for England and Wales as a whole (where the comparability faster is unity). The comparability factors for Kingston-upon-Thames are Births 1.00; Deaths 0.88. The birth and death rates in respect of the town are shown over-leaf and for the purpose of providing some comparison the rates for England and Wales are also shown. 5 VITAL STATISTICS Male Female Total 1211 Total 1961 (a) Live Births- Legitimate 272 292 564 (596) Illegitimate 25 25 50 (43) 297 517 614 (639) Live Birth Rate per 1,000 population. 17.0 (17.1) Adjusted Birth Rate. 17.0 (16.8) 3rd.

Smoke Control Orders Nosâ€ž 1 and 2 became operative on October 1st. 1962, covering an area of approximately 160 acres in the town centre and extending southwards from the railway to the junction of South Lane and Portsmouth Road, and from the river by way of The Bittoms, Penrhyn Road, Brook Street, Orchard Road, Fairfield South, Minerva Road and London Road to the railway. The number of premises affected is as follows - Domestic 914 Commercial 617 Industrial 22 Other 48 The Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the making of the No, 3 Smoke Control Order, the operative date being October 1st, 1963, covering an area of 135 acres bounded by Cambridge Road, London Road, Kingston Hill and the municipal boundary with Maiden & Coomb. 25 The number of premise affected is as follows Doraestic 1,271 Commercial 110 Industrial 2 Other 7 During the year survey work was started in Area No, 4. which covers approximately 100 acres and includes over 1,000 dwellings and commercial premises in the southernmost part of the town, This will extend from Area N0. 1 south along the river and south-east along Denmark Road and Grove Lane to the municipal boundary with Surbitonc Smoke Nuisance0 Sixteen complaints were received in respect of smoke nuisance, ten of which referred to the burning of rubbish. This type of nuisance is sometimes created by the thoughtless action of persons who are unaware of the proper means of disposal, but on many occasions it is caused by a complete disregard of the rights and feelings of others who are subjected to considerable annoyance from smoke disagreeable fumes and ash, Much nuisance would be avoided if soft rubbish such as lawn mowings could be composted, As the soil in the area is mainly light, the addition of humus would help to enrich it, Tree trimmings and woody stems should be laid on a wire mesh rack and when dried, this material wi burn quickly with a minimum of smoke. Two complaints referred to the smoke nuisance from a dlesel driven compressor used by one of the public utility companies engaged on road works Upon representation to the proper quarter the appliance was withdrawn for servicing,, It is not infrequently that excessive smoke is seen to come from diesel engines in various types of vehicles and invariably the nuisance is due to lack of proper maintenance. A diesel engine properly maintained and used does not emit smoke in any quantity which could be considered to be objectionable. The four remaining complaints were domestic in character, and advice waa given in these cases. During the year the incinerator at a large store was entirely reconstructed and a washing system installed which effectively removes fly ash and much of the chemical oontent of the flue gases. This installation which was, in the main, designed by the engineering staff of the store, is probably one of the most advanced of its kiad in operation. 26 In the last Report reference was made to a. survey following complaints which had been received of excessive grit deposition alleged to be emanating from the Power Station. Due to the variable factors relating to plant operation and weather conditions, such surveys are often protracted and the results inconclusive. The snowfall on the 31st Decemberj, 196l, however. presented an opportunity to carry out a widespread survey of the Borough over a period of 43 hours between the end of the snowfall and the Collection of the samples. Specimens were taken by skimming a layer of snow from an area of a quarter of a square metre at seven different points in the Borough, The material collected was submitted to the Public Analyst, and the results were collated with the hourly wind readings during the period. The results of this survey can best be summarised in the concluding paragraphs of the Public Analyst' s report:- "In my opinion the collection of these deposits from the surface of the snow under the conditions obtaining at the time is of great importance as it eliminate pollution due to wind-borne dust from roads ground surfaces and roofs of houses. This is confirmed by the virtual absence of ordinary siliceous particles. The conclusion to be drawn from the magnitude of the deposit at Canbury Car Park as compared with the other sites chosen is inescapable. There can be little doubt also, that the pollution over the Kingston area derived from the power station is heaty and that particles of substantial size are carried for a considerable distance," These conclusions were reported to H,M,District Inspector of Alkali etc. Works and upon his approach to the authorities at the Power Station a full investigation was carried out which was followed by the adoption of improved methods both of operation and maintenance of the grit collecting equipment. It is reasonable to assume that the action taken at the Station is reflected in the improved figures reported from the deposit gauges and the absence of complaints by residents. As weather conditions also affect the results from deposit gaugesâ€ž it may be some years before the full effects Â©an be ascertained. Recording of Atmospheric Pollution. Instruments are maintained on the Guildhall roof and at Tiffin Girls' School for the recording of smoke and sulphur dioxide by the volumetric method. The advantage of this method over the deposit gauge is that it is possible to obtain daily readings of pollution and to observe more closely the effects of weather conditions on the state of the atmosphere. The following tables and graphs indicate the results obtained, Steoke and sulphur dioxide are expressed in microgrammes per cubic metre. 27 Results obtained from Volumetric Instrument at the Guildhall.

The Corporation swimming baths are situate in Denmark Road and comprise two pools, one of which is in use throughout the year; whilst the other is used for swimming during the summer months, and in the winter season is converted for use as a hall for concerts, dancing etc. The pools are equipped with pressure filters capable of treating the water of both pools every hours during bathing periods. In hot weather the filters are working continuously day and night. Chlorination is marginal and the residual quantity is maintained at the deep end of the baths with a maximum of 0.6 parts per million available chlorine. (b) Private. There are no privately owned swimming baths or pools open to the public in the Borough. 12. ERADICATION OF BSD BU&S. During the year eleven premises were disinfestedo Five of these were houses under the control of the Corporation. 13. COMPLAINTS. The number of complaints received from the general public during the year was 364 compared with 456 for the previous year. The following is a brief list of causes for complaints received during 1962:- Accumulations 15 Ashbins 1.6 Caravans 2 Drains & Sanitary Arrangements 81 Food 23 General Housing Defects 49 Insects and Pests 24 Noise 11 Offensive Odours 16 Rodents 96 Overcrowding 1 Smoke l6 Water 7 Yard Paving 2 Others 5 364 36 14. RODENT AND INSECT PEST CONTROL. During the year under reviewâ€ž the volume and character of the work has been similar to that of previous yearsâ€ž Householders still provide harbourage for rodents in their gardens by hoarding old furniture. perambulators and other rubbish. The Corporation have provided a service for the removal of such articles - details given belowâ€ž The 54 vertical block control schemes yielded the usual proportion of sewer and other defects. During the year 17 such defects were responsible for rat infestations. Rodent control in sewers is now carried out more economically by treating more frequently known areas of persistent infeation in the system,, The percentage method previously used has, by experience, been preved to be unnecessary. The pest control service provided on a contract basis to the industrial and commercial interests in the town is appreciated and an efficient and readily available control has been maintained. The Authorityâ€™s service is held in esteem by the officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. Colonial students and field officers regularly spend part of their training in the Department. We on our part readily acknowledge the co-operation of the officers of the Ministry, particularly with regard to identification of unusual insects. (The Borough Surveyorâ€™s Department arrange for the free collection of domestic rubbish, including perambulators, etc., provided reasonable notice is given, and the accumulation is not excessiveâ€ž) 37 Rodent Control - Statistical Statement. 1962.

HOUSING During the year one application for a Certificate of Disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957 was made, as compared with nine in 196l. With regard to statutory action under the provisions of the Housing Act 1957, Closing Orders were made in respect of Noâ€ž 31, Elm Road and the upper part of No. 49, Eden Street. During the year the following premises were demolished in compliance with Clearance Orders previously made - NoS. 77a/99, Park Road and Nos. 17/21b, Brook Street.

All milk supplies in the town are brought in from outside sources, there being no milch herds in the Borough. 111 known sources of supply are regularly sampled. The quality generally has proved to be satisfactory throughout the year. Under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) (Special Areas) Order 1951, the Borough of Kingston-upon-Thamea forms part of Specified Area No. 1. By the provisions of the Order it is an offence to sell in the Borough milk which is not either Pasteurised, Sterilised or Tuberculin Tested. The sale of raw undesignated milk is therefore entirely prohibited within the Borough. (b) designated Milks. The following table shows the number and types of licences in force during 1962 under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 1960. These Regulations prescribe that the licences shall cover a five-year period, and with the exception of one pasteuriser's licence, all are dealerâ€™s licences to sell prepacked milk. Type of Licence Number Pasteurised milk 10 Sterilised " 4 Tuberculin Tested Milk 1 Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk 4 Pasteurised & Tuberculin Tested Milk 3 Pasteurised, Sterilised and Tuberculin Tested Milk 6 To Pasteurise 1 29 41 (c) Bacteriological Examination of Milk. During the year 108 samples of milk were sent to the Public Health Laboratory at Epsom, and the following is a tabulated statement of the results:- Phosphatase Test Methylene Blue Test Pass Pass Pail Void T.T.Pasteurised 61 55 â€” 6 Pasteurised 32 29 â€” 3 Tuberculin Tested â€” 12 2 1 93 96 2 10 All the samples of Pasteurised Milk passed the phosphatase test which indicates that the milk has been properly pasteurised. The methylene blue test is a measure of the bacteriological condition of the milk and in accordance with the standard set by the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 1960, this test is void if the atmospheric shade temperature exceeds 700 F. during the period of the test. The two samples of Tuberculin Tested Milk which failed the test were from the same source. Appropriate follow-up action is being taken. (d) Ice Cream. The number of registered premises in the Borough in which ice cream may be stored or from which it may be sold is 173. This figure also includes five producers,, In addition to these dealers and producers, there are other premises, such as restaurants, canteens, cinemas, ete. upon which ice cream is sold. These premises are not required to be registered. By far the greater part of the ice cream sold in the town is obtained from manufacturers whose premises are situate outside the Borough. More than ever the production of ice cream is being confined to the few large manufacturers. The following table shows the results of examinations in respect of 79 samples submitted to the Ministry of Health Public Health Laboratory at Epsom during 1962. Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice cream, undue attention is not paid to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Those which are placed within Grades I and II are considered to be satisfactory, and those within Grades III and IV not so. Adequate follow-up action is taken where samples fall within the latter grades. 42 Of the 79 samples taken, 57 were from the producers in the town and the remainder from the retailers. The results are considered to be most satisfactory and indicate a good standard of hygiene. GRADE I II III IV Total Ice Cream 70 3 2 4 79 (e) Meat and Other Foods. (i) There are no slaughterhouses in the Borough. The supply of meat for the town arrives from Smithfield and through the local wholesale shops. A certain amount of home killed meat also comes from the modern abattoir at Guildford. (ii) Foodstuffs condemned as unfit. The following tabulated statement shows the amounts of various foods which were condemned during the year and the causes for condemnation. The quantities involved are small in comparison with the amount of food which is handled in the town. The list is very much condensed to avoid unnecessary detail.

Where this method of disposal would be unsatisfactory, arrangements can be made for incineration at the refuse destructor of the Merton and Morden Urban District Council. (f) Food Hygiene. The normal routine inspection of food premises was carried on throughout the year. Generally speaking it was found that a very satisfactory standard of food hygiene was being maintained. In the few instances where slackness or structural defects were encountered, appropriate action was taken. The active co-operation of proprietors and managers is almost invariably given to the Public Health Inspectors who, on their part, seek to give assistance by advice and encouragementâ€ž The modernisation and structural improvement of food premises is still being voluntarily undertaken by both large and small firms, in many eases prompted by the increased prepacking of foodstuffs and the continuing preference of the public for the self-service type of shop. New restaurants and cafes are opened from time to time and appear to flourish, indicating an unsatisfied demand for meals and snacks in the better class of establishment. As in the past, whin plans and proposals are submitted for the alteration of existing, or the establishment of new, businesses, every effort is made to ensure that the premises will comply with the Regulations in the first instance. This is a service which is appreciated by the proprietors. 44 A distinct improvement in the hygienic conditions at many food shops and restaurants is being achieved by the use of the paper sack system of refuse collection. Proprietors have been quick to realise the advantages of this system, particularly where storage space is limited or access by the refuse collection service is difficult. The sacks are supplied by the Corporation at cost price and a suitable paper sack holder can be obtained from the makers for about the price of an ordinary refuse bin.

During the year, 78 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 and the Labelling of Food Order and other relevant Orders and Regulations. 46 Only one sample was the subject of adverse comment. The manufacturers were approached with regard to a contravention of the Labelling of Food Order, but it transpired that the sample taken was of old stock and that the packet now in use carried an amended form of label which complied with the Order.

Metal in Chicken Noodle Soup. The piece of metal proved to be solder from the side seam of the can body. The manufacturers were notified. Metal in Wheatmeal Loaf. This was found to be part of a cap to a can containing malt extract. The baker undertook to arrange for the caps to be removed from the cans before being taken into the bakery. Leg of Lamb. A musty smell was detected when carved. The matter was referred to an adjoining Borough where the joint was purchased. Glass in Wimpy Hamburger. Additional precautions were taken to protect the stock from possible contamination by foreign matter. Weetabix containing hard substance. The material complained of was found to be a normal constituent but its presence in the hard form was due to a manufacturing fault. Violet Discoloration in Roast Pork. The pig had been inoculated with anti-swine fever vaccine which incorporates a dye known as crystal violet. There would be no danger to health through consumption of meat9 but its presence is objectionable. Foreign Bodies in Loaf. These were found to be poppy seeds used for sprinkling on the outside of certain loaves. The presence of the seeds in the loaf was not normal and the baker undertook to ensure that these could not be incorporated in the dough. Mould Growth on Apple Strudels. It was not possible to trace the cause of mould growth. No fault could be found with the methods of distribution. storage and sale of either manufacturer or retailer. It was not possible to pursue the matter any further. Foreign Matter in Wrapped Loaf. This was identified as a piece of brown (i.e.wholemeal or wheatmeal) dough incorporated in a white loaf. This was a case for alteration in bakery routine. Pork Pie with Mould Growth. This appeared to be due to a failure in stock rotation. After due consideration, in this case a warning letter was sent to the vendor. 49 Pea in Bottle of Lemon Barley. A most unusual case. In the absence of a seal on the bottle9 it is not known at what stage the foreign body was introduced. Dirty Milk Bottles. Two cases were reported during the year. Both related to hard mineral substances adhering to the inner surfaces of the bottles. In both eases the sealing processes at the dairies rendered the bottles sterile and the contents were not, therefore, unfit for food. The dairies concerned were warned and they have undertaken to ensure stricter supervision in order to avoid a repetition. The public could co-operate to a greater extent by ensuring that milk bottles are not misused. Rubber Band in Butter. Investigation at the shop confirmed that the band was one used for semiring egg cartons. The Manager agreed to keep the box of bands in a position less likely to cause trouble, while the assistants were warned to exercise greater care. Alleged Contamination of Pine Oatmeal. The consignment was made in a hurry and due care was not exercised to ensure that the grinding stone was completely free from fibrous grain before a change to oat flour. The oatmeal, however, was not considered to be unfit for human consumption. Alleged foreign matter in Pork Luncheon Meat. This sample was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that in his opinion the blemish in the pack was probably due to a little of the raw minced meat and cereal preparation having been left behind in the blender or other part of the plant, and that in the interval before a subsequent batch was put through it had been discoloured by oxidation and by absorption of iron. There was no evidence of decomposition of meat. The manufacturers were informed so that their attention could be directed to any fault which may have occurred during processing. Of the remaining six complaints, four referred to food sold out of conditions, one to a minor foreign body and the other to a fault in manufacture. Fewer complaints have been received which could be attributable to lack of care in stock rotation. It is to be hoped that retailers will continue to focus attention on this important aspect of the trade. In the present era of severe competition in the food trade it must surely be good business to ensure that foods are served as fresh as possible; the cause of clean and safe food will be advanced at the same time. 50 Whilst every ease of food contamination must be regarded as serious, the number of complaints are few in relation to the very large amount of food which passes through the shops in the town. Consideration must also be given to the number of transactions involved and the persons concerned in processing, packing and handling the food. Food traders and manufacturers are very sensitive to complaints and the trade in general co-operate fully in an effort to avoid any cause for repetition. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926. Regular and frequent inspections were made during the year with regard to the labelling and display of appropriate notices, in compliance with the Orders made wider the above Act in respect of certain foods - mainly imported apples and tomatoes. Thirteen warning notices were given, but it was not sidered necessary to take any legal enforcement action. 51 SECTION F PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL.

The number of cases notified during the previous five years are given below. 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 9 3 11 - 5 Immunisation against whooping cough is usually performed as a combined process with diphtheria immunisation, and practically 100% of the children being immunised for the first time receive "combined" material which affords protection against both these diseases, Enteric Fever (Typhoid or Paratyphoid), There were no cases of typhoid or paratyphoid "B" notified in Kingston during 1962 and this is the fifteenth successive year without notification of enteric feverâ€ž Measleso There were 19 cases of measles notified during 1962 compared with 447 in 1961. 1962 was a non-epidemic year, but the beginning of the biennial epidemic which is expected to reach a peak in the early part of 1963, was evident from the increase in the number of notifications received in the last few weeks of the year, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, No cases of ophthalmia neonatorum occurred during 1962, Puerperal Pyrexia, The maternity block at Kingston Hospital serves Kingston and a large surrounding area embracing a population of some 285,000 persons, During 1962, l,88l deliveries took place in the hospital, and inevitably some eases of puerperal pyrexia occurred, all of which were notified to the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with the regulations which define the illness as a febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100,40F, or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage, During 1962, 38 oases were notified from Kingston Hospital, 9 of which referred to Kingston residents, These figures compare with 89 and 24 respectively for 196l, 55 An analysis for the years back to 1958 is shown overleaf, Cases 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 (aj Tatal notified, 60 72 89 89 38 (b) Number included in (a) of (i) Kingston residents, 18 24 19 24 9 (ii)Extra district residents, 42 48 70 65 29 (c) Number included in (a) notified from Kingston hospital, 60 70 89 89 38 (d) Number included in (a) notified by private doctors, - 2 - - - (e) Number of cases included in (d) removed to hospital other than included in (c) - - - - - Smallpox No eases were recorded in Kingston during 1962, A series of smallpox outbreaks did, however, occur in some Midland Towns, Wales, and London, The incidence of a number of smallpox cases occurring together tends to become more frightening than an isolated case and it became necessary as a result of the reaction of the people to the publicity given nationally to take steps to prevent a public rush for vaccination, and to restrict vaccination facilities tÂ© priority groups, In Kingston this was done by providing special clinics for three main groups of persons i,e:- (1) Contact of cases or suspected eases, (2) Primary infant vaccination, (3) Persons who had not been vaccinated within the last year travelling to and from known areas where smallpox cases had been confirmed, This brings to the fore the importance of maintaining constant vigilance and in particular surveillance over persons arriving from abroad when they have come by air from countries where outbreaks have occurred, Most countries insist upon an International Certificate of Vaccination being produced before travellers are allowed to land, In this conneetion, a large number of certificates issued by Kingston doctors are officially authenticated in the Public Health Department each year in accordance with regulations, 56 Smallpox vaccination is voluntary and every effort is made to maintain a high immunity level in the population by vaccinating infants during their early months, This is carried out by general practitioners and at the Surrey County Council clinics, Vaccination and re-vaccination is available free for persons of all ages, Scarlet Fever, Four cases were notified during 1962, two of which were of school age, No serious cases or deaths were reported, As a streptococcal infection scarlet fever is always viewed as potentially dangerous, Modern drugs however, prove to be a good weapon, and the illness usually takes a mild form, Poliomyeliti s, No oases of poliomyelitis were notified in Kingston during 1962, Vaccination with Sabin oral vaccine was started in 1962 and has been increasingly used during the year, The vaccine given by mouth, not only provides protection but also prevents protected persons from harbouring natural dangerous poliomyelitis virus and spreading disease to unprotected persons. This type of vaccine is of great value during an epidemic because it works quickly. Oral vaccine is available for the immunisation of persons eligible under approved local health authority arrangements, i,e, "priority groups" namely those over six months and under 40 years of age and certain others at special risk, The following small groups are also included:- A, Hospital staff who come in contact with patients, B, Practising dental surgeons, dental students, dental hygienists, student hygienists and dental surgeons' chairside assistants, and their families, C, Practising nurses not working in hospitals (those working in hospitals are already eligible) and their families, D, Public health staff who may come in contact with poliomyelitis cases, and their families, E, Children and young persons bora on or after 1st January 1933, providing that in the ease of babies they have reached the age of 6 months, F, Expectant mothers, 57 Dysentery (Sonne), A total of 8 oases of dysentery were notified during 1962 compared with 7 during 1961, These notifications were all in respect of individuals or individual families, No outbreaks occurred during the year, Although the type of cases which occur are normally sporadic individual dysentery cases there is always an awareness that such infection can be widely spread by contagion from person to person, and that the illness can have a serious effect on babies and debilitated persons, Most of the notifications received concern children of school age and under, requiring treatment at home with appropriate segregation during the carrier stage either by exclusion from school or day nursery, No effort is spared to prevent the spread of the disease and there is close liaison with general medical practitioners who are kept fully informed of developments including up-to-date information as to drug sensitivity of organisms, An essential and important factor undertaken by the publie health inspectors is the opportunity to stress the necessity for personal hygiene, especially to those concerned with food handling and the care of young children. Every effort is also made to ensure that personal hygiene is intensified and adhered to during outbreaks. Furthermore, everything possible is done to prevent contact of individuals, in particular children, with persons outside the infected home until the whole family is free from infection, Measures such as these tend to decrease the spread of the disease and also act as an education in personal hygiene, Tuberculosis, In accordance with the national trend the number of new eases of tuberculosis notified continues to be satisfactorily low, In 1962 in Kingston 20 eases were reported, all of these referred to lungs, Compared with 1961, there appears to be very little change when there were 14. eases of which 13 referred to lungs, A total of 6,670 persons were x-rayed during a visit of the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board X-Ray Unit in October and November, (3,030 males -3,640 females), A total of 5 cases (2 male - 3 female) of active pulmonary tuberculosis were discovered and referred for treatment or close clinical supervision, 58 Whilst we can claim that fear and pessimism, concerning tuberculosis has been largely removed from people's minds; that statistics show a declining death rate and a satisfactory reduction in the number of new cases there are, however,, many cases on the register receiving treatment and attention at the Chest Clinic, It is, therefore, necessary, to remember that breakdown and infectivity are continually possible in these cases, It is to be hoped that in due course continued effects of improved living conditions of the populace, continued advances in therapeutic treatment, facility for early detection of tuberculosis by public mass x-ray sessions and B,C,G, vaccination of school children will eventually bring this disease to the point of eradication, The following table shows comparative figures of notified cases and deaths for the years 1953 to 1962 (inclusive):- Year Cases Notified Deaths Respiratory Non-Respiratory Total Respiratory Non-Respiratory Total 1953 37 5 42 8 1 9 1954 26 4 30 3 1 4 1955 14 6 20 6 6 1956 25 2 27 2 - 2 1957 26 1 27 6 1 7 1958 16 2 18 2 3 5 1959 18 1 19 3 - 3 1960 13 1 14 3 - 3 1961 13 1 14 2 - 2 1962 20 - 20 2 - 2 The efficiency of notification has been good and there is no reason to suspect refusal or neglect to notify, Throughout the year no action became necessary under the Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations 1925, or Section 172 of the Public Health Act, 1936, These regulations respectively relate to the restriction of tuberculosis sufferers from employment in the handling of milk, and the compulsory removal to hospital in certain circumstances of persons suffering from tuberculosis, 59 Considerable help is given to tuberculosis and other chest disease patients and their dependants by the Kingston and District Care Committee for Tuberculosis and Other Chest Diseases, During 1962, 106 families within the area covered by the Committee were helped in the form of grants for extra nourishment, clcthing, fuel, removals, beddings, fares, pocket-money, etc, and a total of Â£2,484, was expended from the funds of the Committee on this work, An analysis of the total notified cases during 1962 in age groups is shown on the next page, and the following graph depicts the numbers of new eases and deaths in respect of respiratory tuberculosis occurring for the past 15 years, 60 NOTIFIED CASES OF.
