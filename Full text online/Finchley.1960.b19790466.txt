TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF FINCHLEY. In accordance with my statutory duty as your Medical Officer of Health I have the honour to present the Annual Health Report for the year 1960. This report is prepared according to the Ministry of Health circular 1/61 and preceding relevant circulars. VITAL STATISTICS: (1) Population : The Registrar-General's estimate at the 30th June, 1960, showed a slight increase in population—68,980 as against 68,920 persons in 1959. This increase was to be expected in view of the slow-down in the movement of families to the New Towns; the natural increase, i.e., the number of births as related to deaths and the increase in the number of separate dwellings provided in the Borough, some 341 dwellings having been provided in the past two years, bringing the total number of inhabited houses to 20,636. 1961 is a Census Year and more accurate data will be available. (2) Death Rate: The death rate of 10.7 was again lower than that of 1959 which was 11.5, a total of 738 deaths as against 790. As is to be expected diseases of the heart and blood vessels make up almost half the total of deaths. Cancer of the lung caused 38 deaths as compared to 27 in 1959 and 35 in 1958. While diseases of the heart and blood vessels may be due, to infection, or heredity, or stress conditions and ageing processes and the methods of prevention complex, lung cancer has quite definitely been related to one clear factor—excessive cigarette smoking. Investigations carried out in the United States of America and Britain showed that smokers are more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers. An enquiry in 1952 gave the following 5 figures:- "among non-smokers only one death in over 300 was due to lung cancer. In people who smoked 10 cigarettes a day, lung cancer accounted for one death in every 25. In people who smoked 20 cigarettes a day, one death in 8 was due to lung cancer." There were no maternal deaths in i960. (3) Infantile Mortality Rate. The infantile mortality rate, that is the deaths of infants under one year per thousand live births, was 13.3 as compared to 20.4 for 1959—a total of 14 as against 19 deaths in 1959. All of these babies died in the first two weeks of life, the majority in the first week, the deaths in the main being due to ante-natal causes. The national average rate was 21.7. (4) The Birth Kate. One hundred and twenty more babies were born in Finchley in 1960—a total of 1,052 as against 932 births in 1959, the birth rate being 15.3 as against 13.5 for 1959. The national birth rate showed an increase to 17.1 as against 16.5 in 1959. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES: The very basis of our standard of living, in fact one can say for us to live lies in the control of our environment, our food, our water, cur sanitation, our housing, and any one of these factors if neglected can be killers; but our Public Health Inspectors act as our custodians and in the course of the year the staff undertook no less than 18,880 visits of inspection and reinspection in their daily work. Until recently there was one factor in our environment over which we had little control and that was the very air we breathe. How important this has become when one considers the modern weapons of war and the danger of our atmosphere becoming polluted as a result of nuclear tall-out. Unfortunately the control of this form of pollution lies not in our hands. However, at the moment radioactivity is not an immediate problem, but the smoke, grit and sulphur with which we smog ourselves daily too can become a killer, as witness the smog which killed 4,000 Londoners as recently as 1952. The advent of the Clean 6 Air Act of 1956 has enabled us to make progress in this matter, and next year we hope that a large zone in the southern part of the Borough will become a smoke control area, and eventually by 1971 the whole Borough will be breathing cleaner air. The pressing forward of smoke control areas has brought to the fore the vexed question of garden bonfires. Legislation is vague and indefinite in regard to bonfires, nor do I feel that at this stage one can legislate wisely for the problem. The answer, in my opinion, lies in a good neighbour policy, i.e. keeping down bonfires to a minimum, informing neighbours when one is about to have a fire, selection of a day when air movement is high and wind direction suitable. COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE : 1960 proved a mild year in regard to infectious disease, although school returns indicated sharp outbreaks of chicken pox and mumps in the latter part of the year. I am pleased to report that there were no cases of poliomyelitis notified in 1960, as against 5 in 1959. Diphtheria was again absent from the Borough, although small outbreaks occurred in the schools of nearby London Boroughs, an indica tion, I trust, to the parents in Finchley of the necessity of having their children immunised, particularly before entry to the school community. Eight cases of food poisoning were notified as against 15 in 1959, and one case of paratyphoid, compared to 4 in 1959. Eight persons died as a result of tuberculosis but none of these deaths occurred in persons under the age of 25 years, 6 of the deaths in fact being over the age of 45—an indication of the advances made by the Chest Physicians in recent years in the control of this once very prevalent disease. There were no cases of smallpox, although scares occurred as a result of suspected persons coming from abroad. There was a marked increase in the number of cases of sonne dysentery from 12 in 1959 to 45 this year. Fortunately the disease was mild and confined to family groups and did not appear to spread into the schools or nurseries, where considerable inconvenience and disorganisation can result. Details concerning the above illnesses can be read under the appropriate heading in the body of the report. GENERAL: In my reports over the past 2 years I have commented upon the increasing numbers of elderly in the community and have drawn 7 attention to the necessity of the provision of more hospital beds for the aged in the area. I make no apologies for again drawing the attention of the Council and the various interested bodies to my remarks. I should point out here that the Council have in recent years provided, directly or indirectly, 228 flatlets or dwellings for the aged and will provide a further 46 places in the near future ; sufficient evidence of the Council's concern in this matter. Housing is inevitably bound up with medical care and it is but reasonable to suggest that this large programme of housing for the elderly should be backed up by adequate hospital facilities. It follows also that Middlesex County Council as the Welfare Authority must bear an increased responsibility for the provision of a sufficient number of places in Old Persons' Homes for those Council tenants who through illness or advancing age become incapable of caring for themselves. The Council's housing programme also includes the provision of accommodation for the physically handicapped. It can be seen from this that the Council's housing commitments are wide, and with an increasing birth rate over the past 2 years consideration will no doubt have to be given to the provision of family homes. Apropos of this, I have noticed an increasing development of maisonettes and mini-houses throughout the Borough. No doubt there is a demand for this smaller type of modern property, but it is to be hoped that in future years they will not become congested or overcrowded by family occupation. The increase of houses let in multiple occupation should be noted, and it appears that existing legislation controlling these premises is unsatisfactory, the greatest difficulty being caused by owners who avoid their obligations and the local authority arc unaware of the circumstances until a housing problem has been created. A number of such problems occurred during 1960. The Noise Abatement Act of 1960 became law towards the end of the year. This Act deals with noise which is a nuisance but as yet, little experience of the working of the Act has been obtained. Finally, the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was published towards the end of 1960, and one must admire the thoroughness with which the Commisioners have carried out their work. The Report itself is very readable and whether 8 one likes the recommendations or not, one cannot help but feel that they have logical grounds for suggesting changes bearing in mind that the structure of local government to-day is based on legislation passed nearly 80 years ago. From the point of view of the Health Services generall}', probably the outstanding proposal is the integration of the Welfare Services with the Personal Health Services; a recommendation which was made some years ago by the Guillcbaud Committee but as yet adopted by few local authorities. CONCLUSION: I should like to thank the family doctors of Finchley for their co-opcration and assistance to this Department during the year. I would like to acknowledge also the help of those people who have contributed to the information contained in this report and my fellow Chief Officers for their help and assistance throughout the year. As in the past, I would draw your attention to the work and loyalty of the staff of this Department, and finally my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee once again for their support and encouragement.

Five hundred and eighty-six were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone and 19 children were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Scarlet Fever There were 19 cases of Scarlet Fever, 8 less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis No case of Poliomyelitis occurred during the year. Vaccination against Poliomyelitis Early in 1960 it was decided to extend poliomyelitis vaccination to persons under the age of 40. Hitherto vaccination could only be obtained by persons under the age of 26 and certain special groups such as Health Visitors and Public Health Inspectors. The number of persons vaccinated in Finchley during 1960 is shown as follows:— By General By Middlesex Practitioners. County Council 1. With 3 injections:— (a) Born 1943-1960 1,253 803 (b) Born 1933-1942 1,509 886 (c) Born before 1933 and under 40 years 370 216 (d) Others 17 16 2. With 2 injections:— (a) Born 1943-1960 677 330 (b) Born 1933-1942 496 149 (c) Born before 1933 and under 40 years 1,098 322 (d) Others 7 16 Measles The number of notifications was 74 compared with 602 in 1959. There were no deaths. 26 Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 25 in 1960 and there were no deaths. During the year, 155 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Only two forms of pneumonia, namely, acute primary and influenzal, are notifiable. Twelve such cases were reported to me during the year. In the table of deaths, all forms of pneumonia are included in the classification (No. 23). It will be seen that 42 deaths occurred and of these 36 were persons of 65 years of age and over. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 26, and 25 of these occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue. The remaining one case occurred at home. Food Poisoning Four persons were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year, and in addition 4 cases were otherwise ascertained. This compares rather favourably with last year when 15 cases occurred. A causative organism was not identified in any of the notified cases. Paratyphoid As stated previously, only one case of paratyphoid was notified. The patient, a bus conductress, was originally notified to me as a suspected case of typhoid and was under observation at a North London Fever Hospital. All contacts were traced, and all General Practitioners in Finchley were advised to keep watch for any case of obscure fever. Despite extensive investigations, it was not possible to trace the source of infection in this case. The patient made a good recovery. Dysentery Forty-four cases of dysentery were notified and all of these cases were visited, investigated and the persons concerned advised on how to prevent the spread of this infection. All cases were due to shigella 27 sonnei. This bacillus one might say is rampant throughout the country and caused some 48,000 cases nationally in 1960. The incidence appears to be gradually increasing. Fortunately it is a mild infection as a rule, although the illness can be severe in infants and in the aged. It tends to become epidemic in schools, hospitals, nurseries or camps. Fortunately, in Finchley the cases were confined to family groups, apart from a number of cases which occurred in an Old People's Home. Its prevention is simple, i.e., the teaching of hand washing in schools and an improvement in the general standard of hygiene in the home. Research In connection with food poisoning, a survey of organic fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs continues in collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Service, Colindale, and the Public Health Department, Hendon. It has been found that samples of such commodities have been shown to contain food poisoning bacilli. A preliminary report has been prepared and it is expected that the final report will be published during 1961. Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was six hundred and fifty-three. Two hundred and eighty-seven were re-vaccinated. International Certificates of Vaccination Persons travelling to certain foreign parts have to provide themselves with certificates of vaccination or inoculation which must have been completed by their own medical practitioners before proceeding. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a medical officer in the Government or local authority of the country of issue. A form of authentication which has been accepted by the health authorities abroad is that given by public health authorities and identified by a rubber stamp impression placed by them on the certificate. The rubber stamp in this office bears the words "Finchley Corporation—Signature of doctor authenticated." The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. During the year 630 certificates were authenticated. 28 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1960:— Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs: Diphtheria Bacilli — 110 Haemolytic Streptococci 34 Vincent's Angina — Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci 3 Fæces: Sonne Dysentery 84 349 f Salmonella 10 Coagulase Pos. Staphylococci — Clostridium Welchii 3 Esch. Coli 6 Occult Blood Test 1 Sputum: T.B. Smear 2 44 Other Organisms 11 Whooping Cough: Cough Plate — 2 Post-nasal Swab — 154 507 Tuberculosis Eight persons died from tuberculosis during 1960, giving a death rate of 0.11 per 1,000 population. Twenty-six new cases were notified and this figure equals that of 1959, when the lowest number per year of new notifications were recorded. The case rate per 1,000 population was 0.37. One child under school age and two children of school age were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs. 29 The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M.

It is understood that arrangements will be made for the Unit to visit the Borough in 1961. Medical Examinations Thirty-two persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 15 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. In addition, 10 employees were examined for the purpose of extending sick pay, and, in the case of elderly employees, for proposed extension of service. Housing Applications During the year, a number of housing applications, in some cases accompanied by medical certificates, were submitted by the Borough Housing Officer to ascertain if additional points could be recommended on medical grounds. On receipt of these applications, it was often necessary to visit the family concerned and to discuss various aspects of each case with the family doctor and with the Housing Officer. 30 TUBERCULOSIS (ALL FORMS) Additional points were awarded as follows:— Points Award Number of Applications 1 10 2 5 3 14 4 3 5 (maximum) 7 In addition, a number of applications were considered on account of overcrowding and sanitary defects. Much work is involved in investigating these cases in order to be certain that deserving cases are given full consideration. In special cases where the medical condition of the applicant merited urgent rehousing but the award of extra "points" would not give immediate help the case was brought before the Housing Committee for their decision, and in every instance the medical reports were taken into account. Health Education Health Education comes more and more into the activities of a Public Health Department, and in certain subjects it really is the province of the specialist in health education. Television, perhaps the greatest medium for health education, has not yet been fully exploited, although a number of well-made films were shown for general consumption during the year. A number of talks on this subject were given by the Medical Officer of Health and other members of the staff to local organisations. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47—Removal to Suitable Premises of Persons in need of care and attention No action was taken under this Section during 1960, although a number of cases, usually aged people living in poor conditions, were brought to the notice of this department. As I stated last year, these cases are generally few in number and with the extension of social and visiting services it is hoped that they will become a rarity. (b) Section 50—Burial or Cremation of the Dead It is the duty of the Local Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears to the authority that no 31 suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being otherwise made. In these circumstances, the deceased persons are buried in the St. Pancras Cemetery. The expenses incurred in each case amount to a total of £18 15s. 6d. This charge is inclusive of the undertaker's fee and the cemetery fee, and may, of course, vary from time to time. The Local Authority may be able to recover part or all of this sum from the estate of the deceased person. Four burials were carried out by the Council in accordance with the provisions of this Section during the year. Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health." Five copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the public health inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. Laundry Service for the Incontinent The laundry service, which commenced in 1957, continued to operate in the Borough. The service has been set up to assist in the problems concerning incontinent persons. It operates in accordance with the provisions of Section 42 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, which deals with, amongst other things, the cleansing of soiled articles. The washing machine is installed at the Disinfecting Station and arrangements are made for articles to be collected and delivered twice weekly. The practice is for collections to be made on Tuesdays and Fridays, and for deliveries, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The cost of the service is borne by the local authority. The only stipulation made is that the garments or bedding involved must not be of a type which could be accepted by a commercial laundry. 32 The number of persons receiving assistance at the beginning of the year 2 The number of persons for whom the service was recommended and subsequently authorised by the Medical Officer of Health or by the Public Health Inspectors during the year 17 The number of persons receiving assistance at the end of the year 4 During 1960, 259 collections of articles were made.

Housing Act, 1957, Part III-— Slum Clearance The five-year slum clearance programme submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government was almost completed at the end of the year, all the houses having been represented to the Council the previous year. The particulars with regard to the five areas outstanding at the beginning of the year are as follows:— 34 Clearance Area No. 12 Nos. 1-10 (inclusive) Belgrave Terrace, N.12 and Nos. 4-10 (even) Stanhope Road, N.12 (14 houses). Negotiations with regard to the compensation of one of the occupiers of the shops in Stanhope Road was completed and the whole of the premises have now been demolished and the tenants, with the exception of three of the shops, rehoused. The site is to be used by the Council as a car park and for the erection of a public convenience to replace the existing convenience at Tally Ho Corner. Clearance Area No. 13 Nos. 5-18 (inclusive) and No. 21, Winifred Place, N.12 (15 houses). Negotiations for the acquisition by the Council of the above site for use of the land as a car park was completed during the year. The tenants were re-housed and the premises demolished. Clearance Area No. 14 Percival (Cottages, 185, 187, 189 & 191, East End Road, N.2 (4 houses).

The owner of this area objected to the Council's proposal to make an order and the Minister of Housing and Local Government, after holding an enquiry, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order without modification. The premises were vacated and five of the tenants rehoused, the other tenant finding his own accommodation. Demolition of the houses had not been carried out at the end of the year. All that remained at the end of the year to finalise the programme was the demolition of the ten houses in Areas Nos. 14 & 16. 35 Housing Act, 1957, Part II— Individual Unfit Houses Hawthorn Cottage, Strawberry Vale, N.2 This old detached house, which was found to be very dilapidated, was represented, the tenant rehoused and the premises demolished. Rent Act, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957, since which date the number of applications for certificates of disrepair has continued to decrease, as will be seen below. From 6th July, 1957, to 31st December, 1957 (approximately 6 months) 60 applications From 1st January, 1958, to 31st December, 1958 50 applications From 1st January, 1959, to 31st December, 1959 14 applications From 1st January, 1960, to 31st December, 1960 8 applications The following table shows further details in connection with applications under the Rent Act:— Number of applications outstanding at beginning of year 1 Number of Certificates issued 1 Number of Certificates not issued (because work had been done or undertaking already given by landlord) 1 Number of Certificates refused 2 Number of Undertakings given by Landlords 5 Number of applications outstanding at end of year — Number of applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair 5 Number of applications outstanding at beginning of year 2 Number of objections by tenants to cancellation 1 Number of certificates cancelled 6 Number of cancellations refused 1 Number of applications outstanding at end of year — Number of applications for Certificates as to the Remedying of Defects which the Landlord had Undertaken to Remedy 1 Number of applications outstanding at beginning of year — Number of such Certificates issued 1 Number of Certificates not issued — Number of applications outstanding at end of year — 36 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 18,880.

At the end of the year 965 had been remedied or abated and the work in connection with 102 was in hand. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 422 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress.

Two hundred and thirteen enquiries were dealt with regarding premises which were the subject of applications for advances under this Section. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 30 Number of articles disinfected 858 Two hundred and ninety-four visits were made by inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required.

The above-named Regulations, which came into operation on the 1st October, 1960, amended and consolidated the Regulations of 1955 —1957, and brought within their scope the handling and service of food on board home going ships and certain other vessels. These food hygiene regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises and stalls, and of apparatus and equipment, the hygienic handling of food, the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction of food premises, their repair and maintenance and the facilities including sinks and wash basins to be provided; and the temperature at which certain foods arc to be kept. A number of the fish shops in the Borough have been completely modernised, including the provision of plate glass windows, doing away, therefore, with the old open-fronted shops. 1. Number of Inspections: The Public Health Inspectors continued a survey of food premises and during the year, 976 visits were made to shops and other premises in order to ascertain compliance with the Regulations, and arising therefrom 697 contraventions were found, and 129 letters sent and 44 verbal notices given in connection therewith. The following is a summary of the works done during the year:— Bakehouse provided 1 Chopping block provided 4 Cleaning & redecorating carried out 181 Clothing lockers provided 10 Cooker hoods cleaned 2 Draining boards provided 3 Dustbins provided 6 Fat clarifier provided 1 First Aid material provided 12 Floors cleaned 2 Floors renewed or repaired 13 Flushing cisterns repaired 2 46 Fresh air inlets repaired or provided 1 Gauze provided at window 1 Glass Window provided or repaired 2 Hot water provided 32 Impervious working surface provided 17 Lavatory basins provided 24 Light provided 1 Manhole cover provided 1 Mica flap provided 1 Nailbrushes provided 3 Plaster repaired 14 Plate rack provided 1 Refrigerator painted or repaired 6 Rubbish removed 2 Shop front provided 1 Sinks provided 13 Sinks re-sited 1 Soap provided 1 Store provided 1 Towels provided 1 Ventilated lobby provided 6 Wall tiling renewed or repaired 3 Wash bowl provided 1 Waste bin provided 1 W.C. notices provided 3 W.C. pan provided 1 W.C. sealed off 1 Yard paving repaired 1 2.

Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops: Notices for exhibition have been supplied to all food shops in the district, pointing out that the presence of dogs is a danger to the health of the public. 5. School Kitchens: A number of visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to school kitchens and the staffs are to be commended on the high standard of cleanliness which has been maintained. 6. Method of Disposal of Condemned Food: Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared continued to receive special attention. There were no new registrations of hawkers during the year. The number of barrow boys operating in the district at the end of the year was 4. 48 Slaughterhouses Act, 1958 Report on Slaughterhouse facilities Under Section 3 (1) of the Slaughterhouses Act, 1958, each Local Authority was required to review and, after consultation with such organisations as appeared to the Authority to represent the interests concerned, to report to the Minister on:— (a) the existing and probable future requirements of their district for slaughterhouse facilities having regard to the needs both of persons requiring the use of such facilities and of other persons; and (b) the slaughterhouse facilities which were, or were likely to become, available to meet those requirements (including any port slaughterhouse). There are 49 butchers shops in Finchley and they all obtain supplies of meat from markets in London. There is one private slaughterhouse operating in the District from which the owner obtains part of his supplies of home-killed meat for sale in his own shops in Finchley and adjoining districts, including Hornsey, Hendon, Barnet and Friern Barnet. In addition this facility is used by local pig keepers who need occasional and seasonal accommodation. An undertaking was given by the occupier of the slaughterhouse to carry out the works necessary to comply with the Act. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food accepted the Report of the Recommendations but postponed the date of operation bringing the new Regulation into force, from December until the spring of the following year. 49 Carcases and Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed (if known) — — — — 424 — Number inspected — — — — 424 — All Diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci: Whole carcases condemned — — — — 1 — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — — — — 67 — Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci — — — — 16.04 — Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned — — — — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — — — — 4 — Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis — — — — 0.94 — Cysticercosis: Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned — — — — — — Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration — — — — — — Generalised and totally condemned — — — — — — 50 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED (1) In Slaughterhouses TUBERCULOSIS Pigs Head 4 OTHER DISEASES Pigs Hearts 14 (Pericarditis) Livers 8 (Cirrhosis) 1 (Hepatitis) 1 (Peritonitis) Lungs (pairs) 31 (Pneumonia) 6 (Congestion) 1 (Pleurisy) Whole Carcase 1 (Erysipelas) 1 (Uraemia) (2) In Shops Cattle Beef 188 lbs.

Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958, which repealed the Act of 1933, all animals slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Two persons were licensed during 1960. 53 Butchers' Shops There were 49 butchers' shops in the district, all of which are provided with glass fronts. All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough at the beginning of the year was 19. Two closed, leaving 17 at the end of the year. At 16 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the Public Health Inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 8 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1960, as follows:— Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 16 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 20 Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 26 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 8 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 7 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Sterilised 8 Food Sampling The following information has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955:— 54 List of Samples procured in the Borough during the year Article Total Samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Milk (new) 98 7 Milk (various) 47 2 Butter and Margarine 11 — Cakes and Biscuits 6 1 Cheese 5 2 Cream 4 — Drugs 15 — Fish and Fish Products 26 2 Fruit—Fresh and Canned, etc 24 3 Ice-Cream and Lollies 6 — Meat, Meat Products and Liver 32 — Soup 5 2 Spirits 6 — Vinegar 15 — Miscellaneous 21 2 Totals 321 21 Regarding the samples noted as unsatisfactory, the following comments are added:— Milk. Four samples of milk were found to be slightly dificient in solids-not-fat, and a further three were slightly deficient in butter fat. All these samples were procured from large consignments of milk and the average butter fat and solids-not-fat content, over the whole of these consignments was satisfactory. There was no evidence of added water and subsequent sampling showed an improvement in quality. Two samples of hot milk procured from a Supermarket were found to be deficient in butter fat and solids-not-fat, and in addition one contained added water. The milk was served from a warm milk urn and then given a heat boost from a steam injector. The sellers were warned against this method of heating milk and a caution was issued. Doughnuts. A complaint was made through the Finchley Public Health Department by a member of the public that a doughnut tasted soapy. After investigation it was established that this was caused by 55 the confectioner mixing fresh cream and imitation cream to make the filling for the doughnuts. There is a long term chemical reaction between fresh and imitation cream when mixed, and the confectioner was unaware of this. The matter was dealt with by an official caution. Cheese. Following the scrutiny of television and press advertisements, two samples of cheese were procured which were advertised as being "Cream Cheese or "Creamy Cheese." It is considered that for a cheese to be properly described as "Cream Cheese" it must contain at least 50% of milk fat, and both these samples were below that standard. Representations were made to the makers on the ambiguity of the wording of the advertisements and they agreed to amend them. Fish. Two purchases of fish fillets described as "Sea Bream" were found to be Redfish (Sebastes Marinus). The purchases were obtained from separate shops and an official caution was issued to each. Fruit. Rhubarb purchased by a resident of the Borough was found to be contaminated with weed killer. Enquiries were made to trace the source of the contamination, but without success. A purchase of grapefruit displayed as "seedless" disclosed an average of 14 seeds per fruit and an official caution was issued. Borscht. A sample of tinned Borscht for which a claim as to Vitamin "C" was made was found to be deficient in ascorbic acid. The deficiency was probably due to natural deterioration, and a subsequent sample proved to be genuine. Soup. A packet of dehydrated Cream of Chicken Soup was found to be deficient in fat. "Cream" soup mixes when reconstituted must contain the equivalent fat to canned liquid soup, and an official caution was issued to the manufacturers. Rice. A complaint was received that a purchase of rice contained maggots. The purchase was submitted to the Public Analyst, who reported that no maggots were present, though there was a small amount of dust. 56 Soft Drink. A complaint that a bottle of soft drink had an offensive odour and taste was investigated. The Public Analyst reported that the drink was contaminated by phenol. It contained chlor-phenol derived from the action of free chlorine in water used directly on the phenol formaldehyde stopper. The amount of phenol in the drink was very small—less than one part per million—but was sufficient to cause the smell and taste. Extensive investigations were carried out to find a remedy for this contamination, which is very rare. The manufacturers changed the preservative used from sodium benzoate to metabisulphate so that the sulphur dioxide would cancel the chlorine in the water, and also changed the type of stopper used. There have been no further complaints. The Public Control Department also reported upon the following matters:— Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887—1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926, and which relate to the marking with an indication of origin of certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold, are complied with. Inspections were made on 102 premises of 407 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes and poultry. One prosecution was undertaken for selling Argentine chilled steak as English, and displaying unmarked meat. The manager was cross-summoned by the firm and fined £2 on each of three summonses. All other infringements were of a minor nature and were dealt with verbally. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and in the case of a compounded food with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 508 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 99 premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above Regulations. 57 False and Misleading Descriptions. Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false or misleading statements and descriptions. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the Boroughs, and work under this heading is combined with inspections made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts, and the Labelling of Food Order. Examples where corrective action was sought are a whole milk cheese described as "Cream Cheese," sponges containing imitation cream sold as "jam and cream sponges," grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, etc., containing seeds described as "seedless," and false suggestions of fruit content in sweets. Special Designated Milk. During 1960 the Middlesex County Council issued two Dealer's (Pasteuriser's) and one Dealer's (Steriliser's) licences in respect of premises within Finchley where milk is processed. These premises were regularly inspected and compliance with Statutory requirements was well maintained. A total of 64 samples of designated milk was taken, all of which were certified as being satisfactory. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, 78 samples of raw milk were procured within the Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix." Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 165 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Fish Friers At the end of 1960 there were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out. Game Licences Fifteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act, 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. 58 Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows:— Number on Register at beginning of 1960 952 Number closed 18 New shops 13 Number on Register at end of 1960 947 Changes of Occupancy 29 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was thirteen. Swimming Pools Finchley has two Swimming Pools, Squires Lane Baths and the Open Air Pools in the High Road, N.12. The latter comprises Adult and Children's Pools and is said to be one of the finest examples in the London Area. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, under whose control the baths are operated, for the following report:— "Both establishments are equipped with modern filtration and chlorination plants. The water is drawn from the public water supply and is continuously filtered on a six-hour cycle, make-up water being added as necessary to cover losses by evaporation, filter washing and other causes. The chlorination is controlled in accordance with the latest practice in this important subject. "Samples of the water are taken regularly for bacteriological examination and the results are consistently satisfactory. This reflects greatly to the credit of the staff directly concerned with the operation of the purification plants, for the bathing load is frequently heavy. During the fine summer season of 1959, 377,800 bathers visited the the pools. In the 1960 season, although the weather was not good, attendances reached 189,898." Ninety-two samples of the water were taken by Public Health Inspectors during the year. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company, now incorporated in the Lee Valley Water Company (following the passing of the Lee Valley Water Act, 1959). Reports on 326 bacteriological and 6 chemical samples which were taken by the Company during the year 59 were forwarded to me. In all cases except three the results were satisfactory. These three were substandard due to roof leakage at one of the reservoirs after heavy rainfall. All dwelling houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Finchley has been completely sewered for many years, and, where necessary, works of enlargement have been carrid out. So far as sewage disposal is concerned, it should be pointed out that the Sewage Works situated in the East of the Borough are seriously over-loaded and considerable effort has to be made to maintain a satisfactory effluent. However, work on the East Middlesex main drainage scheme is proceeding, and it is hoped that Finchley will be joined to this scheme in 1962. Periodic tests are carried out on the effluent from the Sewage Disposal Works. I am grateful to Mr. P. M. Spencer, the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, for this information. Clean Air Act, 1956 The above Act deals with the control of dark smoke, smoke from furnaces, smoke control areas and special cases of smoke emission, which include special processes to be dealt with under the Alkali Act, colliery spoil-banks, railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. It also makes provision for the establishment of a Clean Air Council for England and Wales. Certain sections of the Act came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, including those relating to the height of chimneys and to smoke control areas. The remaining provisions came into operation on the 1st June, 1958, and included those relating to the prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys, measures for dealing with grit and dust from furnaces, abatement of smoke nuisances and the application of the Act to railway engines, vessels and Crown premises. With regard to the making of smoke control areas, any local authority may make an Order, which must be confirmed by the Minister declaring the whole or any part of its district as a smoke control area. Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of chimney smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused only by the burning of an authorised fuel. 60 If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area, has to incur expenditure for adapting his heating arrangements, the local authority shall repay him seventenths of the cost, four-tenths of which is recoverable from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In 1958, the Council passed a resolution to make the whole of the Borough a smoke control area within 10 years. At the request of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, local authorities had to submit to the Minister their proposals with regard to the making of smoke control areas for the next five years. The Council decided that all that portion of the Borough, lying to the south of the railway line from the Borough boundary in the west to the North Circular Road, and thence south of the North Circular Road to the Borough boundary in the east should be included in this programme. A survey of the following 5 areas was completed during the year and the details thereof submitted to the Minister whose approval was given:— Area No. of Premises Acreage (1) Basing Estate, N.3 200 12.6 (2) Red Lion Hill, N.2 291 10.3 (3) Elmhurst Estate, N.2 171 10.1 (4) Part of Hampstead Garden Suburb, N.2 and N.11 1,546 446.0 (5) Part of Hampstead Garden Suburb, N.2., and East Finchley, N.2 932 110.4 Total 3,140 589.4 All of these areas will come into operation on 1st September, 1961, The Minister had confirmed Areas Nos. 1-4, but confirmation of Area No. 5 was being awaited at the end of the year. The Survey of Area No. 6 was commenced during the year. This area, comprising 2,414 premises (332.1 acres), is to the north of Area No. 4 and to the west of Area No. 5, and is bounded by the railway line in the north and by the North Circular Road in the west. A certain amount of publicity has been given, and during the year, lectures were given by members of the staff to organisations in the district, on clean air, in general, and more particularly, with regard to smoke control areas. 61 Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Ten complaints were received during the year concerning industrial and domestic chimneys. In addition, 20 complaints were received with regard to the burning of garden and other refuse and action was taken in a number of cases where it was considered that burning was habitual and causing a nuisance. A considerable number of installations, both industrial and domestic, are being converted or installed for oil burning and the largest factory in the area changed over from coal to oil during 1960. Many enquiries are received by the Petroleum Inspector from persons desirous of installing oil fired plant and for the safe storage of the oil and whilst advice is freely given it is sometimes refused in the absence of the necessary legislation to control this matter. Atmospheric Pollution Arising from a conference of the Co-operating Bodies of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, it was generally agreed that the deposit gauges, with certain specific exceptions, should be replaced by the volumetric apparatus which records SO2 and smoke pollution in the atmosphere as against the coarse deposit from all sources measured by the deposit gauges. The Council have agreed therefore to discontinue for the present the use of the deposit gauges and to erect three of the volume type of apparatus. By the end of the year one had been installed and was in operation in the Public Health Department's Laboratory. Four deposit gauges were sited as follows:— (1) Roof of Gaumont Cinema, High Road, N.12. (2) Lyttelton Playing Fields, N.2. (3) Moss Hall School, Moss Hall Grove, N.12. (4) Sewage Disposal Works, Summers Lane, N.12. 62 A summary of the monthly analyses of the deposits collected is shown below:— 1960 SITES (1) (2) (3) (4) January 12.73 8.18 8.49 9.97 February 14.97 11.22 11.78 21.16 March 20.61 13.90 13.04 11.69 April 11.40 7.52 8.06 11.15 May 12.16 11.24 8.85 11.61 June 10.54 8.58 8.26 10.70 July 9.38 7.36 7.26 11.05 August 8.84 12.08 6.86 9.93 September 12.00 9.11 6.86 11.76 October 12.38 13.27 * * November * * * * December * * * * The figures show total solids (tons per square mile per month). * Discontinued. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Seven visits have been made to premises to ascertain that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. No contraventions of the Act were found with regard to the sale of new fires. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There arc two traders whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The number of persons licensed at the end of the year was 6. All the premises have been inspected. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following 3 instances:— (1) Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 2. (a) A dairy firm was prosecuted for selling a bottle of milk containing foreign matter, i.e. a mouse. They pleaded guilty and were fined £50, with £23 10s. costs. (b) A dairy firm was prosecuted for selling a bottle of milk containing foreign matter, i.e. grubs. 63 They pleaded guilty and were fined £5 with £5 13s. costs. (2) Public Health Act, 1936 (Sec. 41). F.U.D.C. Act, 1908 (Sec 14). A firm of builders were prosecuted for failure to give notice with regard to the altering of the course of an underground drain and causing certain sanitary fittings to be connected to the surface water drains instead of the soil drains. The defendants were fined £1 1.0 with £1 1.0 costs with regard to the first offence, and with regard to the second and third summonses, which related to the passing of sewage into the surface water sewer, and of surface water into the sewage sewer, respectively, the Company was given an absolute discharge, subject to the payment of £2 2. 0 costs on each summons. RODENT CONTROL No financial assistance is now received from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food in respect of this service, and in consequence it is no longer desirable to prepare this report for the period of the financial year. In view of this, the period under review is for the calendar year as is the case with all other subjects upon which the Report is made. Allowance should be made for the fact that figures quoted for comparative purposes arc in respect of 9 months from the 1st April, 1959 to the 31st December, 1959. Complaints and Infestations Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 9 months to 31/12/59 1960 9 months to 31/12/59 1960 9 months to 31/12/59 1960 Rats 283 255 184 196 99 59 Mice 82 96 74 77 8 19 Totals 365 351 258 273 107 78 During recent years, improved poisons have been discovered and new techniques have been established which are contributing to some 64 lessening of the general level of rat population in the district. During the year under review, fewer complaints were received than in the preceding 12 months and infestations were in all cases small. Following visits to 282 premises, in addition to those from which notification had been received, 50 instances of rat infestation were found. Of the 323 premises at which evidence of infestation was found, 43 were food premises and poultry was kept at 4 addresses only. In 9 cases, smoke tests were applied to rat runs and as a result defects in drains or sewers were revealed in 6 cases. The necessary remedial works were carried out. Summary of Work carried out from 1/1/60 to 31/12/60 Rats Mice Visits in connection with infestations and surveys 1,570 396 Number of confirmed infestations 246 77 Prebaits 54 — No. of Zinc Phosphide Poisonings 23 — No. of Warfarin Poisonings 1,312 504 No. of Gassings 5 – Treatment of Sewers The 27th and 28th Maintenance Treatments of Sewers were carried out in May and October, respectively when baits of oiled warfarin incorporating a mould inhibitor were used. It is interesting to note that of the 64 manholes in which there was evidence of rat infestation in May, all but 2 were cleared of infestation when rechecked with testbaits in October, having been baited to extinction in the earlier treatment. In order to undertake the treatment of sewers, it is necessary to have the tempotary use of men and equipment from the Department of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, to whom I am grateful for co-operation. The following table indicates the amount of work involved:— May, 1960 Oct., 1960 Total number of manholes baited 654 916 Number of poison "takes" 63 44 65 GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE BOROUGH STATUTORY SERVICES PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, arc provided by the Middlesex County Council.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The Borough of Finchley forms part of the EAST CENTRAL DIVISION for Mental Health Services in the Middlesex County Council. Divisional Office: 2, Maryland Road, Wood Green, N.22. (Tel.: BOWes Park 4281). Senior Medical Officer: Dr. R. C. Greenberg. Divisional Mental Welfare Officer: Mr. W. J. Ward. Mental Welfare Officers: Mr. E. Inglis; Mr. D. L. Richards; Mr. C. Carr; Miss J. E. Maclean. 68 Mental Health Social Worker: Miss C. M. Coups. Psychiatric Social Workers: Mrs. J. I. Jansen; Miss E. Arkinstall. The mental health social worker makes regular visits to the homes of all the sub-normal and severely sub-normal females and males up to the age of ten years and advises on all aspects of the patient's well being and employment in appropriate cases. She submits written reports on her visits so that where necessary the County Medical Officer may take appropriate action such as arranging admission to psychiatric hospitals either on a temporary or permanent basis. Such temporary admissions, of up to eight weeks, are arranged to meet acute domestic difficulties or ill health of mother. The mental welfare officers deal similarly with the sub-normal and severely sub-normal males over the age of ten years. The main duty of the mental welfare officers is the care and in part the after-care of those persons suffering from mental illness including dealing with those requiring compulsory detention in pyschiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act, 1959. Both the mental welfare officers and the mental health social workers transport patients in their cars to and from the psychiatric hospitals. The psychiatric social workers are largely concerned with the after-care and rehabilitation of persons discharged after undergoing treatment either in hospitals or at out-patient clinics but also deal with a similar type of case who may not have had to enter a psychiatric hospital and in cases referred from the National Assistance Board because of chronic unemployment. As regards the general practitioners, they receive via the Middlesex Executive Council, a schedule setting out the information given above and also the procedure under which they may obtain the services of a mental welfare officer outside normal office hours. In addition to the home visiting service, there are junior training schools for the young severely sub-normal and adult training centres for those of sixteen years of age and over. Although at present there 69 are none of these establishments actually sited within the Borough, some Finchley children are transported daily by coach to Hornsey Junior Training School and a few Finchley youths are taken by express coach to Isleworth Adult Training Centre. A therapeutic social club is run under the direction of Miss Arkinstall, Psychiatric Social Worker, for incipient mental cases and for those discharged from psychiatric hospitals who are in need of after-care, at York Park Day Nursery, York Road, Hendon, N.W.9, at 7 p.m. every Tuesday evening. It is the County Council's intention to increase the above facilities and to provide, in addition, hostel accommodation for the mentally disordered living in the community.
