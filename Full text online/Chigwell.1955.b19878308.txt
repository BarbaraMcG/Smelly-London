CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting to you the Annual Report including the report of the Senior Sanitary Inspector, for the year ending 31st December, 1955. VITAL STATISTICS The fall in the birth rate continued, and at 12.8 per thousand of the population, the corrected rate was well below the average for England and Wales (15.0). No significant change occurred in the total (corrected) death rate which, at 8.6 per thousand population compared well with the national figure of 11.8 per thousand, for a population of the same age and sex distribution. Diseases of the heart and circulatory system and cancer continued to be the main causes of death. Although total cancer deaths were the same as in the previous year (80), there were twice as many deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus (25) as in 1954 (13). It is now widely known that heavy smoking, especially of cigarettes, may predispose to cancer of the lung, but this is certainly not the whole story behind the recent increased incidence; air-pollution also undoubtedly has a part to play, as rural areas fare better than towns and industrial areas in this respect. In addition to 3 fatal road accidents, 9 other accidental deaths occurred—an unusually high figure for this District. At least 6 of these might be considered preventable, namely: misadventure at work 3 fall downstairs (female aged 58) 1 coal-tar poisoning (age 3 years) 1 suffocation of a new bom infant 1 Total 6 Total accidents (12) caused more deaths than tuberculosis (10). INFECTIOUS DISEASES There were 28 cases of poliomyelitis during the year, of which 17 were paralytic (including one fatality which occurred at Torquay during a holiday), and 11 were non-paralytic. An epidemic of mild measles occurred during the Spring; only 13 of the 1,176 cases required hospital treatment, and there were no deaths. 2 There was a welcome fall in the number of new cases of tuberculosis, which was 34 as compared with 48 in the previous year. We now have at our disposal the means of entirely eliminating this disease. The key lies in the early diagnosis and treatment, using improved X-ray facilities (including Mass Radiography) and modern drugs—aided by higher standards of living, and vaccination of susceptible persons. It is encouraging to note that the parents of 410 children (=69%) due for B.C.G. vaccination under the Education Authority's scheme gave their consent to the procedure, and those found to be susceptible (315) were duly vaccinated. The value and safety of B.C.G. vaccination now appear to be well established: In their first (1956) progress report to the Medical Research Council, the special committee set up in 1949 to conduct controlled investigations has stated that the incidence of tuberculosis in 14,000 vaccinated children was 0.37 per thousand per annum; whereas in 13,000 tuberculin—negative unvaccinated children, the incidence was 1.94 per thousand per annum. Complications of vaccination were few, and these were chiefly confined to inflammation of local glands or slow healing of the vaccination. It is, of course, not yet possible to give a reliable opinion on the duration of the immunity provided by the vaccine. NEW LEGISLATION The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, which consolidates the 1938 Act and its amending Acts, came into force on 1st January, 1956. The new Act is considerably stronger than the old one and an important feature is the issue of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, which lays down a new higher standard for food premises. SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 and NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Four cases were investigated on reports received. Three of these were found to be old ladies living alone, and in need of some assistance and supervision, but not requiring action to be taken under this Secfion at present. They are being kept under regular observation. The remaining case was, despite a Home Help and other services, living in insanitary conditions and, though only 48 years of age, judged to be incapable of looking after herself or her two children because of infirmity. She refused to enter hospital, and the Council, on my recommendation, therefore applied to the Court for an Order for her compulsory removal to St. Margaret's Hospital, Epping, under this Section, which was granted for a period of 3 months. During this time, the two children were committed to the care of the Essex County Council, and the house and its contents were cleansed etc., under the provisions of Sections 83 and 84 of the Public Health Act, 1936. 3 SANITARY CONDITIONS From the report of the Senior Sanitary Inspector (see Sections C, D and E which follow) it will be noted that the calls upon the time of sanitary inspectors and clerical staff continue to increase, for the following reasons: 1 General increase of population, involving more shops, houses, factories, foodstuffs etc. (For example, the amount of slaughtering for meat for human consumption is almost doubled on the previous year). 2 New duties taken over from the Essex County Council under the Food and Drugs Acts and Shops Acts. 3 New legislation. Inevitably, less time can be devoted to routine inspections and sanitary supervision, and this, together with an increasing fastidiousness on the part of the public, has led to more sanitary complaints,- such as w.c. defects, refuse accumulations, and infestations of mice and insects. Additional staff is the only remedy and this must await the completion of the new accommodation now in course of construction. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H. FRANKS, M.B., B.S., B.Hy., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health.

(i) Water The water supply of the District is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board except for one house in the District where it is drawn from a well. This house is in the ownership of the Conservators of Epping Forest and is situated in the forest a long way from the mains supply. The water is piped and has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. The number of houses is 16,127 and the estimated population at mid-year was 58,790. Two samples of water were taken from tap supplies of the Metropolitan Water Board and the report was satisfactory in each case. (ii) Drainage and Sewerage Both the main works at Luxborough and the small subsidiary at Millers Lane have operated satisfactorily. The Council has received in the latter part of the year and approved in principle a full report by its Consulting Engineers on works necessary to cope with the flow reaching Luxborough and with the overloading of the main Northern Outfall sewer. Gaugings have been taken from which the effects of increasing water consumption per head of population have been disclosed. When provision is made for the remaining development which can take place even with all Green Belt reservations being maintained, it is shown to be essential to lay a relief sewer along the route originally intended for a parallel Southern Outfall sewer, to make cross connections by siphon and pumping, and to reconstruct the screens at Luxborough, the grit channels, sludge digestion plant and sludge drying areas. The five outlying sewage pumping stations have operated satisfactorily. A scheme for the elimination of one of them by the laying of a length of gravity sewer is at present before the Ministry. The condition and capacity of some of the older sewers continue to be likely to present a major problem and the Council's Consulting Engineers have been instructed to report on one extensive affected area. Progress with this and the other schemes mentioned is likely to be materially affected by current financial limitations. 14 2. Rivers and Streams The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-east side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex Rivers Board. The extent of flooding is practically nil and therefore very much less than in former years. 3. (i) Closet Accommodation and Cesspools Number of Cesspools and Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 80 Loughton 12 Number of Earth or Chemical Closets in Houses: Chigwell 39 Loughton 6 Number of Chemical Closets in Caravans: Buckhurst Hill 3 Chigwell 12 Loughton 1 Premises which have earth closets, chemical closets, cesspools and septic tanks are in areas where no sewer is available. Two houses previously drained by a cesspool have been connected to the Council's sewer during the year. Every opportunity is taken to connect premises to main drainage and schemes are in hand with this in view. (ii) Public Cleansing Domestic refuse has been collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and manual staff. The fleet now comprises seven 10/12 cub. yd. "Fordson/Eagle" covered lorries, each drawing a covered trailer. Trade refuse service has been well used by traders, collection being made at a fixed price per bin, allowing one free bin to each premises. Refuse is disposed of by controlled tipping at a tip rented, with levelling, compacting and covering service, from a local contractor. A bulldozer is used for levelling and compacting and for spreading covering material. The area exposed at any time is kept to a low minimum. Measures are taken as and when necessary to keep down flies and vermin. 15 Salvage of paper and rags produced sales of 485 tons. Kitchen waste collected from schools and industrial canteens has been taken to Tottenham Concentration Plant, the total so disposed of during the year being 169 tons. Road gullies (in maintainable streets) have been emptied by mechanical suction and re-sealed with clean water three times during the year by annual contract. (iii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area An outline of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is shown below: Complaints received and dealt with 903 Inspections and visits 6,839 Nuisances abated 396 Informal Notices served 62 Informal Notices complied with 62 Statutory Notices served 13 Statutory Notices complied with 9 Legal Proceedings 2 Summary of Nuisances Drains blocked or defective 177 Defective water closets 24 Defective water supply pipes 14 Nuisances from animals 22 Polluted ditches, watercourses and ponds 11 Accumulation of refuse and defective dust bins 42 Vermin (bugs and fleas) 4 Cellars flooded 1 Insect infestations 43 Bees, wasps and hornets 90 Bats 3 Air pollution 35 (iv) Verminous Premises Four houses were found to be verminous during the year, three were infested with bed bugs and the other with fleas. One was a Chigwell Council house and the other three were privately owned. The number of houses found to be infested in 1951 was 19, 1952—12, 1953—8 and 1954—2, so that the figure given above compares favourably with previous years. Premises were fumigated with "Fumite" and ''Coopers Bed Bug Spray" with very good results. Number of inspections and visits—11. 16 RODENT CONTROL PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 1,548 inspections and visits were made in 1955 as against 1,308 in 1954, and 1,388 in 1952. The reason for the increase is caused by more infestations of mice being reported. Warfarin is still being used and is very successful taking on an average of two weeks to clear each infestation. Zinc Phosphide and Arsenic are still used for baiting the sewers. Treatment of the Council's soil and surface water sewers was carned out as usual during the year, the results being shown below: March 10% Test Baiting October October 1955 1955 1955 Manholes baited 105 300 70 Pre-bait takes 41 11 13 Pre-bait part takes 14 2 24 Poison complete takes — — 8 Poison part takes 24 — 19 Poison or Bait used Arsenic Rusk Zinc Phosphide I think that the rat population is still diminishing but for some reason or other mice seem to be on the increase and more attention will have to be given to keep these rodents under control. 17 SECTION D HOUSING STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1955 Number of new houses erected and occupied during the year: Permanent Houses:— London County Council — Chigwell Urban District Council 68 Private Owners 397 465 Inspection of Dwelling Houses during the year:— 1 (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health and Housing Acts) 692 (b) Number of visits made for the purpose 508 2 (a) Number of dwelling houses (included in subhead [1] above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 Nil (b) Number of visits made for the purpose Nil 3 Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 26 4 Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 62 18 Remedy of Defects during the year without Service of Formal Notices:— Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 62 Action under Statutory Powers during the year:— (a) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936: — (1) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 2 (2) Number of dwelling houses which were rendered fit after service of Formal Notice by:— (a) Owners 2 (b) Local Authority in default of owners Nil (b) Proceedings under Public Health Acts:— (1) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 1 (2) Number of dwelling houses in which defects were remedied after service of Formal Notices by:— (a) Owners 1 (b) Local Authority in default of owners Nil (c) Proceedings under Sections 11, 13 and 25 of the Housing Act, 1936:— (1) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made 8 (2) Number of dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of formal action 1 (d) Number of houses or parts of houses closed under:— (1) Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936 5 (2) Section 10 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 1 (e) Informal Action:— Number of dwelling houses demolished as result of informal action 3 19 Re housing Priority on Medical Grounds 100 requests for priority for re-housing on medical grounds were referred to the Medical Officer of Health for assessment, usually supported by a doctor's written certificate.

All inspections were, as usual, of a surprise nature and the conditions found can, therefore, be taken as normal' to the particular premises. I am happy to state that in all cases the premises and animals appeared to be maintained in a satisfactory manner and that the owners appeared to be willing to accept any advice which I thought desirable to give. During the year, an additional business was opened at Buckhurst Hill, the owner of which is an experienced horseman. This establishment is probably carrying all the horses for which space is available but, although the stables are well filled, there is no undue overcrowding. I append a list of the premises visited, the name of the person in charge and the average number of horses kept. Yours faithfully. Signed: H. E. BYWATER.
