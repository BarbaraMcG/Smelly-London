BOROUGH OF WOOD GREEN ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1962 WM. CLUNIE HARVEY, m.d.dph Medical Officer of Health. Wood 44 BOROUGH OF WOOD GREEN ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1962 WM. CLUNIE HARVEY, md.dph Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Wood Green, N. 22. July, 1962. To THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN and COUNCILLORS of the BOROUGH OP WOOD GREEN. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the annual report for the year 1962. The year ended sadly with Dr. Harvey's sudden illness in October which deprived the Borough of his services for the remainder of the year. Dr. Harvey is still not fit to resume duty and his absence is felt particularly at this time when his wisdom and experience would have been so valuable in the planning of the new Borough. I know that he has the warm good wishes of all members of the Council. The vital statistics for 1962 have varied little from those of last year. The birth rate with 811 live births was 17.07 per 1,000 of population. The death rate was 12.23, slightly higher than last year s figure of 11.3. It is very satisfactory to be able to state again this year that there were no maternal deaths. The Infantile Mortality rate, i.e. the number of infants who died during the first year of life per 1,000 live births, rose from 26.8 to 29. 5, there being 4 more infant deaths this year than last. The statistics over the past 4 years show two trends which appear sufficiently definite to be significant. The birth rate has risen successively each year from 14.2 in 1959, 15.0 in 1960, 15.7 in 1961 to 17.07 this year. This rising birth-rate is taking place generally over the whole country. Less satisfactory and a cause for concern is the trend in the illegitimate birth-rate, i. e. the number of illegitimate births expressed as a percentage of the total live births. In the past 2 years this has shown a 3 sudden and disquieting rise as is evident from the following table:- 1957 4. 27% 1958 5. 83% 1959 5.33% 1960 5.05% 1961 8. 10% 1962 9. 12% It needs little imagination to picture the problems and distress which must arise from this increasing rate. The number of infectious diseases notified during 1962 was 362 as against 867 last year. There were over 500 fewer cases of measles than in 1961, which largely accounts for the difference in the number of notifications. It is of note that the only deaths during the year which were due to notifiable infectious disease were in 3 males aged over 75. This compares with 4 deaths from notifiable infections last year, 3 over the age of 75, and the other over 65. This is a complete and striking reversal of the old high infectious diseases mortality rates which were recorded in the early years of life. No case of poliomyelitis has been notified in the Borough since 1959. Our last notification of diphtheria was in 1947 - 15 years ago. Notifications of whooping cough were 16, a very satisfactory figure and the second lowest on record. Construction is now in progress on 200 dwellings at Cheshunt this creates an extremely happy solution to part of our housing problem. In last year' s report Dr. Harvey made reference to the increasing work devolving upon the Public Health Inspectors. The recent appointment of an extra clerk in the Public Health Department has eased the burden of clerical work to some extent, but the position will be kept under careful review. Health education is a continuous process for the Health Department right through the year. The choice and supply of public posters, library book marks and advice leaflets is constantly under review. The 16mm projector bought two years ago has been put to frequent and excellent use and is a great teaching asset. The office of Home Safety Officer, held by the Chief Clerk in the Public Health Department is no sinecure and Mr. Ingram has 4 completely disregarded "working hours" in this part of his duty. This is a side of our work which is building up each year in importance and urgency. Dr. Harvey's combined appointment of Borough Medical Officer of Health and County Area Medical Officer has ensured over the years close integration of these two functions and similarly the very close and friendly co-operation between the two categories of staff should prove a great asset towards the smooth change over to the new Borough. In conclusion, I owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the Health and Cleansing Committee and would express to them my sincere thanks for their support and kindness - an expression in which I know Dr. Harvey would wish to be associated. I find it difficult to express fully my appreciation of the loyality and support which I have received from Mr. McCauley, and, indeed, every member of the staff of the Public Health Department. Without this, my task in suddenly taking over Dr. Harvey's work would have been difficult indeed. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. R. CAMPBELL, Deputy Medical Officer of Health. 5 BOROUGH OF WOOD GREEN HEALTH AND CLEANSING COMMITTEE Alderman E.E.NICE (Chairman) Councillor C. W. BUCKBY (Vice Chairman) The Mayor, Alderman C. D.

BIRTHS The number of live births registered during the year was 811, which gives a crude birth rate of 17.03 per 1,000 of population, the corrected birth rate being 18.05 the rate for 1961 was 16. 1. There were 23 still-births, giving a still-birth rate of 31.2 per 1,000 births. In 1961 the still-birth rate was 17.3. 7 MORTALITY General Mortality and Death Rate. The net number of deaths accredited to the district was 581, 43 more than in 1961. This gives a crude death rate of 12.2 per 1,000 of the population and a corrected death rate of 13.1 (the rate for 1961 being 10.6). The greatest single cause of this increase was a rise of 35 in the deaths from Coronary Disease and Angina. There was a small but welcome drop in the deaths of cancer of the lung from 36 to 31 but deaths from bronchitis in males have risen from 18 to 28. The heavy toll of life from these two group causes could be considerably reduced, but its reduction involves the most difficult of all remedies - the changing of habits that are set and built in to the way of life. Contributory factors in Coronary Disease are undoubtedly the stress and rush of present day living. A three-mile walk daily would be an excellent prescription coupled with sensible and moderate eating to prevent increase of weight. It is surely an obvious assumption that the heart can do its job more efficiently without an added load of a stone or more imposed upon it just when it is beginning to age. The following table shows the deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus and deaths from bronchitis for Wood Green, over the past 10 years. Deaths from Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus Male Female 1953 19 2 1954 26 8 1955 26 1 1956 24 2 1957 24 1 1958 30 10 1959 27 8 1960 29 11 1961 33 3 1962 28 3 Deaths from Bronchitis 1953 30 24 1954 20 10 1955 36 12 1956 27 17 1957 21 7 1958 20 10 1959 24 11 1960 30 9 1961 18 18 1962 18 10 8 In attempting to prevent the onset of bronchitis and cancer of the lung we are up against a habit - smoking - which is even more deeply ingrained and difficult to eradicate. Only methods of education that carry conviction will succeed in such an extraordinary difficult task. The method which succeeded in the great proportion of doctors was a cold statistical survey which showed clearly how many of their colleagues who were smokers were dying of cancer of the lung. If the same precipitous drop could be effected in those to whom children look for example - particularly parents and teachers - the chances of a drop in smoking would materially increase throughout the whole population. Since smoking is comparable to drug addiction the main effort must be to prevent young people from starting the habit. Addicts may say "This is my business - it concerns my life", but there are few individuals whose life is not precious to someone and whose death does not bring tragedy and irretrievable loss to others. The evidence against smoking is now so overwhelming that most smokers concede it as a cause of lung cancer and would wish to give it up. Clever advertising is probably the strongest factor in defeating the best resolutions and counter propaganda must be extremely skilful to compete with it. The pipe smoker has much more control over the amount of tobacco he smokes since he is not constantly having a tobacco pouch passed to him by his friends. Pacing the tremendous difficulty in eradicating the habit of cigarette smoking could it at least be replaced by the pipe smoking habit - with attractive pipes for ladies! And since it is a more mature habit it might even become more attractive to teenagers who want to be "with it". Smoker s clinics have been started up and down the country and their methods and degree of success are being critically studied. In spite of these rather gloomy comments it must be borne in mind that it is only because so many major causes of death have been eradicated and also that more money is available to spend on cigarettes and a great variety of confectionary that these diseases of the older age groups are rising in importance. With each decade not only are many more infants living to reach their second year, but this second year seems almost like a spring-board to give them a flying start in life so that the loss of life up to the age of 45 is almost negligible. On the basis of 1962 s statistics, of 811 live births 790 babies would survive to reach the second year In Wood Green's total child population from the age of 1 year to 15 years the total deaths were 6 and between the ages of 15 and 45 they totalled 15 Immunisation has played a very large part in this success story but it requires constant vigilence to ensure that it continues at its present high level. Diphtheria and poliomyelitis are still menacing diseases that could return again as a cause of death and crippling. 9 INQUESTS Sixteen inquests were held following the deaths of Wood Green residents during 1962. A further 99 post mortem examinations were carried out without an inquest, 59 of these in the Prince of Wales Hospital which, by arrangement with the Wood Green Borough Council, provides mortuary services. MATERNAL MORTALITY No cases of maternal mortality were reported. INFANT MORTALITY There were 21 deaths of infants under one year of age, which gives an infant death rate of 29.5 per 1,000 live births, as compared with 17 deaths and a rate of 26. 8 in the preceding year. Of the 21 infants who died in Wood Green during 1962, 15 did not survive beyond one month and 14 died in the first week 9 in fact died in the first day. These very early deaths are the hardest of all to prevent. Every infant death continues to be carefully scrutinised. STILL-BIRTHS Twenty-three still-births, 21 legitimate and 2 illegitimate were accredited to the Borough for 1962. This is equal to a death rate of 31.2 per 1,000 births, the corresponding figures for 1961 being 12 still-births with a rate of 17.3. The following table shows causes of death at various ages under one year:- Under 1 week l to 2 weeks 2 to 3 weeks 3 to 4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 3 mths. 3 mths. and under 6 mths. 6 mths. and under 9 mths. 9 mths. and under 12 mths.

It is in this field probably more than in any other that voluntary effort is so vital. We are extremely fortunate in the work that is done in the Borough by the Old People's Welfare Committee. Many of the problems, however, are brought to the Public Health Department and we are then able to call upon the Health Visitors, Home Nurses, Home Help Organisers and Public Health Inspectors to assess the need so that we can estimate how best to render help. The Retired Persons' Advice Clinic was opened at Woodside House on 23rd February, 1962. This clinic is held on alternate Friday afternoons and is staffed by one of the County Assistant Medical Officers, together with a member of the Nursing staff. The sessions are informal and advice is given on health matters and also on hobbies, activities, etc. These are well attended and I believe are fulfulling a very useful function. During 1962 plans went forward for the establishment at Shropshire Hall of an Elderly Persons Work Centre and on 31st December 1962 the organiser was appointed. The Centre was opened in February of 1963 and has proved of such value and popularity that it is hoped to extend this scheme to other parts of the Borough. It seems that there will always be some geriatric problems which are almost insoluble but these additions to the services of the elderly are very welcome. A further great asset is the appointment of a Geriatrician at St. Ann' s Hospital to serve this part of the County. Hospitals Hospital Services available to the residents of Wood Green are as reported in previous years but the appointment of a Geriatrician already referred to has closed what was a very serious gap in the service. 11 Laboratory Facilities As in past years, the Central Public Health Laboratory Service has been of the greatest assistance to us, not only the Central Laboratory at Colindale, but also the Laboratory housed in Coppetts Wood Hospital, where Mr. McGirapsey is the Bacteriologist. I gratefully acknowledge the assistance afforded throughout the year, and the close co-operation which has continued for so many years between the Public Health Department and the Laboratory Service. Summary of the work carried out at the Central Public Health Laboratory for the year as follows - Positive Negative Swabs for Diphtheria bacilli - - Sputa for tubercle bacilli - - Throat and nose swabs 43 Faeces 179 Urine 1 Blood - Others 3 Ice Cream - Water (Swimming Pool) 1 Vaginal Swabs 1 Raisins 1 Chipolata Sausages 1 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 (National Assistance Amendment Act, 1951) SECTION 47:- Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention.

Housing Applications We have continued to receive many letters from private doctors in support of housing applications. These are very carefully considered with the Housing Officer and extra points are awarded according to the circumstances. Unfortunately, only too often an award of even maximum points cannot produce new housing accommodation but a great deal of care and thought goes into this side of our work Smoke Control Areas Work in the formation of smoke control areas under the Clean Air Act 1956 continues The Council's Smoke Control Order No 4 came into operation on 1st October, 1962, This Order relates to an area of 115 acres in extent and comprises 1734 premises in the Bounds Green area, At the close of the year, the Council submitted for approval by the Minister of Housing and Local Government Smoke Control Order No, 5 relating to an area embracing 1772 premises in the Bowes Park area It is proposed that the Order come into operation on the 1st October, 1963 Rodent Control During the year 259 dwellings in the Borough were treated for rat infestation entailing 1 121 visits. In addition 45 business premises were treated for the presence of rats. A further 45 dwellings and 9 other premises were treated for mice and a total of 425 visits were made The Council's refuse tip at White Hart Lane was constantly baited with an anti-coagulant bait and several supervisory visits 15 were made to the adjoining Council allotments for evidence of the presence of rates. The sewers were treated on two occasions for the control of rats during the year and 672 manholes were baited. The baiting consisted of two unpoisoned baits on alternate days, followed by a poisoned bait. For the purpose of sewer treatment the Borough is divided into ten small areas and two gangs of two men each occupy just over three weeks in carrying out the treatment. Co-operation is sought from the Borough Engineer's and Surveyor's Department in this connection. Record sheets are kept of each visit and a return made to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food after each treatment. The following is a copy of the results of both treatments:- RODENT OPERATION (l) Thirtieth Maintenance Treatment April/May 1962 (2) Thirty-First Maintenance Treatment October/November 1962 No. of Manholes Manholes Showing Pre-bait take Complete Pre-bait take Complete Poison take Part Poison take April/ May 672 322 117 0 301 Oct./ Nov. 672 371 195 0 313 Ponds and Rubbish Dumps These are regularly inspected with the object of preventing the breeding of insect pests. The pond in White Hart Lane is emptied and cleansed periodically by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, whilst that at Alexandra Palace is supervised by the Alexandra Palace Trustees. 16 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD (a) Food Premises in the Borough Bakers' Shops 23 Butchers' Shops 38 Cafes and Restaurants 51 Chemists' Shops 15 Confectionery and Sweet Shops 70 Dairies and Milk Shops .. 36 Pried Fish Shops 11 Wet Fish Shops 10 Greengrocers' Shops 48 Grocers' Shops 83 Public Houses and Off-Licences 40 Food Factories 9 (b) Food and Drugs Act, 1955, Section 16.

Three samples of feathers were submitted for laboratory examination and were found to be satisfactory. Pet Animals Act 1951 Under the Act, seven licences were renewed during the year after the premises had been inspected and found to be satisfactory. Establishments for Massage or Special Treatment Five existing licences under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950 were renewed during the year. HOUSING The Borough Surveyor has kindly supplied me with the following figures showing the number of dwellings which have been erected or rebuilt during the year. Council dwellings completed:- 15 flats Pellat Grove 8 flats Williams Grove Council properties in course of construction at end of year:- 52 flats Winkfield & Acacia Roads 52 flats Commerce Road 200 dwellings Cheshunt Housing Estate Private enterprise properties completed or in course of construction- 52 flats- 4 houses. Swimming Baths The figures of attendances at Western Road and Durnsford Road Baths for the past two years are as follows:- Western Road Baths 1961/2 1962/3 Swimming Bath 90,758 86,947 -do- Children (Special) sessions) 529 - Children from Schools 34,841 36,647 Spectators 7, 251 8,047 Slipper Baths 32, 891 31,239 -do- Old Age Pensioners (free) 3,479 3, 909 Steam Bath 97 417 20 Durnsford Road Open Air Baths 1961/2 1962/3 Adults 22,732 15,865 Children 47,460 30,858 Children from Schools 830 583 Season Tickets issued * 564 565 * Attendances of season ticket holders no longer recorded. Samples of water were taken from both baths. The results of the tests were uniformly satisfactory. There is nothing I can add to the remarks which I have made in previous Annual Reports relating to our Swimming Baths being a means of providing health-giving exercises in the open air. The incidence of Plantar warts (verrucas) among schoolchildren continues to be a matter of concern. Although it is quite obvious that swimming baths are by no means the only way in which verrucas can be spread, it is equally obvious that the wet surrounds of swimming baths provide a means of allowing the virus which causes verrucas to pass from one child to another. I am doing all I can to get the co-operation of teachers and parents in obviating the spread of this infection and the Baths Manager and I have the situation constantly under review. Collection and Disposal of Refuse The Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who is responsible for this service, reports as follows - (a) Household refuse is collected weekly by vehicles operated on the relay system. (b) Trade and special refuse is collected as and when required. Six 12 cubic yard capacity Scammell Containers and two Mechanical Horses are used for collection of household refuse, and one Bedford Lorry for trade and special refuse. During the year 1961/62 the total tonnage of refuse collected was 11,898 tons; the income from salvage material amounted to £3, 145. The steam raised by the incineration of the refuse is used for space and water heating at Western Road Baths, 21 PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following table sets out the infectious diseases notified as compared with notifications received during 1961:- 1962 1961 Scarlet Fever 21 15 Diphtheria - - Cerebro-Spinal Fever - - Enteric or Typhoid Fever - - Paratyphoid Fever - - Erysipelas 2 1 Pneumonia 17 43 Acute Poliomyelitis - - Acute Encephalitis - - Puerperal Pyrexia - - Pulmonary Tuberculosis 21 19 Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis 3 6 Malaria - - Measles 232 763 Whooping Cough 16 13 Ophthalmia Neonatorum - - Dysentery 49 4 Food Poisoning - 2 Smallpox - - Meningoccocal Infection 1 1 362 867 Prom the table set out above the following facts emerge:- 1. Scarlet Fever notifications totalled 14 in 1962, a drop of 7 on the 1961 figures. 2. It is now 15 years since the last case of diphtheria was notified in the Borough and 23 years since this was a cause of death. Outbreaks of diphtheria still occur from time to time in different parts of England and Wales but if we can succeed in keeping our immunisation rate at its present very high level we should certainly avoid any danger of such an outbreak in Wood Green. The fact that 92.8% of infants under 2 years of age are protected against diphtheria is very gratifying. The great majority of these immunisations are combined in the triple antigen giving protection against whooping cough and tetanus as well. 3. Measles notifications fell from 763 in 1961 to 232 this year. The type of infection was again very mild. 4. Pertussis notifications were 16 this year- although 3 more than last year, still a very satisfactory figure. Although it is difficult in any one Borough to show statistically the effect of whooping cough vaccination, recently published figures are of great interest. These show that for England and Wales in 1960 and 1961 the total deaths from whooping cough were 64, and of these 64 deaths only 1 occurred in a completely vaccinated child - a child aged 2 years who suffered from epilepsy. 22 Although the death rate from pertussis is low it is such a distressing disease that every child should be protected from it so far as is possible. 5. The incidence of food poisoning and dysentery rose from a combined total of 6 in 1961 to 49 in 1962. All cases of dysentery and food poisoning,particularly salmonella typh-murium infections, are carefully investigated and are fully followed-up wherever the source of infection may lie. This rise from last year's very low level is not significant, this rate is extremely variable and there is a tendency throughout the country for notifications of these infections to rise. 6. No cases of poliomyelitis were notified in 1962. The vaccination rate remains satisfactorily high. The use of Sabin Vaccine was introduced last year, a method of oral vaccination which has superceded the giving of Salk Vaccine by injection, Sabin Vaccine is administered by mouth, the method of administration varying according to the age of the person concerned. It need scarcely be said that this method is proving extremely popular, as after-effects are virtually nil and the disadvantage of a prick eliminated. 7. 24 cases of tuberculosis were notified during 1962, 1 fewer than during 1961. A broad classification of the cases of tuberculosis notified during the past five years in relation to employment was:- 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Clerical 5 4 5 5 1 Manual Labour 2 10 2 1 3 Housewives 9 3 3 3 4 Factory Workers 2 8 11 2 4 Children - 3 3 1 3 Professional Classes 2 3 1 1 4 Domestic Service 1 1 - - - Nurses - - 1 - - Shop Assistants 3 3 1 1 - Armed Forces - 1 - - - Retired Persons - 3 1 3 2 Unclassified 8 5 2 9 3 33 43 30 25 24 Our scheme for the B.C.G. vaccination of school children is actively continuing and is working extremely well. This work is undertaken by the School Health Service. 23 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The number of articles dealt with at the Disinfection Station was as follows:- Articles disinfected 11 Articles destroyed 66 and 2 dogs 12 rooms were disinfected on account of infectious disease. 7 premises were disinfested on account of the presence of vermin, which involved the disinfestation of 37 rooms. 57 premises were treated for infestations of cockroaches, wasps, ants, flies, bluebottles, fleas, beetles and maggots, woodworm, woodlice, moths, bees and silverfish. 93 Library books were brought to the Department during the year for disinfection on account of being in contact with cases of infectious disease MASS RADIOGRAPHY During September Mass Radiography Unit 6A again visited Wood Green after an interval of two years. The number of persons X-rayed at Public Sessions was higher than the previous visit, 2, 856 as compared with 1,323. This may, I feel be fairly attributed to the fact that in previous years the Unit had remained static, whereas on this occasion they visited four different sites within the Borough Leaflets were prepared by the Unit giving details of the public sessions. These were distributed through the usual channels- The utmost publicity was given by the display of banners, newspaper advertisements, posters, window displays and bookmarks. Set out on the following pages are tables showing the number of persons who attended for X-ray together with a table showing the abnormalities discovered. The results are very similar to previous visits. The fall in the tuberculosis rate continues and for the first time the figure for significant tuberculosis (that requiring immediate treatment) was below the average in other areas covered by Unit 6A, 24 MASS RADIOGRAPHY SURVEY WOOD GREEN 1962 MALE FEMALE TOTAL TOTAL NUMBER X-RAYED 2023 2006 4029 Recalled for further investigation 25 28 53 Did not attend for further investigation 2 1 3 LOCATIONS NUMBER X-RAYED MALE FEMALE TOTAL White Hart Lane 179 111 290 Eastern Gas Board 321 166 487 Bowes Park Station Approach 218 188 406 Durnsford Road 129 137 266 Spouters' Corner 1063 1180 2243 Williams Bros., White Hart Lane 72 72 144 Marks & Spencer 41 152 193 TOTAL 1482 2121 3603 GROUPS ATTENDING MALE FEMALE TOTAL GENERAL PUBLIC 1394 1462 2856 ORGANISED GROUPS (Factory, shop, office staff etc.) 629 544 1173 TOTAL 2023 2006 4029 25 MASS RADIOGRAPHY SURVEY (contd.)
