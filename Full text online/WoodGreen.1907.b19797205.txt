Urban District Council of Wood Green. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1907. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Wood Green. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my report on the Health of Wood Green for the year 1907. NEW BUILDINGS, 1907. The total number of dwelling houses in course ot erection during the year was 669. Of these, 375 were completed for occupation, the remaining 294 being incomplete at the end of the year. 4 In addition to the above, the following buildings have been erected:— Factories and Warehouses 4 Stables and Sheds 13 Public Buildings 6 Alterations and additions to existing Buildings 23 Bakehouses 2 Total 48 The total number of plans laid before the Council was 113, of which 90 were approved and 23 disapproved—the approved plans representing 160 dwelling houses, 1 factory and warehouse, 37 stables and sheds, 2 public buildings, 29 alterations and additions, 1 lock-up shop, 2 bakehouses, the construction and sewering of 3 new roads. POPULATION. The total number of completed houses in December, 1907, was 9,502. Allowing 7 per cent. for empty houses, and calculating 5.66 persons to each occupied house, the Population at the end of the year would be 50,017. By a similar calculation, the Population in December, 1906, was 48,047. The mean of these numbers—49,034—would represent the Population in June, 1907, and I have taken 49,000 as the average Population of the District for the present Report. BIRTHS. 1,449 Births were registered during the year, 771 boys and 678 girls, which correspond to an annual rate of 29.57 per 1,000 of the population. 5 DEATHS. 461 Deaths were registered in the District during the year. Through the kindness of the County Medical Officer of Health I have obtained a list of 104 deaths of residents that occurred outside the District, including:— Edmonton Infirmary 33 Tottenham Hospital 13 Great Northern Hospital 7 Children's Hospital 10 St. Pancras Infirmary 2 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 4 Royal Free Hospital 2 King's College Hospital 1 Napsbury Asylum 9 Women's Hospital, Soho 1 Cancer Hospital, Chelsea 2 St. Thomas's Hospital 1 St. Peter's Home City of London Lying-in Hospital 1 Belmont Asylum 1 Holborn Infirmary 1 London Hospital 1 Women's Hospital, St. Pancras 2 Workhouse, Chase Side, Enfield 1 Mount Vernon Hospital, Hampstead 1 S. Ann's House 1 Royal Chest Hospital 1 Charing Cross Hospital 1 King's Cross Station 1 Bethnal House, Bethnal Green 1 Belmont Road Schools, Tottenham 1 Hornsey Isolation Hospital 4 The total number is therefore 565, from which is deducted 12 deaths of non-residents which occurred in the Passmore Edwards Hospital. 6 The corrected number is therefore 553, which is equal to an annual rate of 1128 per 1,000 of the estimated population. The average death rate for the previous 10 years was 11.47. To compare this death rate with that of England and Wales, allowance must be made for the more favourable age and sex distribution of the population of Wood Green. This is done by multiplying the recorded death rate by a "factor for correction" (in our case, 109801), a figure obtained by the Medical Officer of Health for the County by a somewhat elaborate calculation, founded on the figures of last census. The corrected death rate for Wood Green is 12.38 for the year 1907. There were 100 deaths of children under 1 year, which corresponds to a rate of 68 deaths for every 1,000 births. The average for the previous 10 years was 129 deaths to every 1,000 births. The deaths of children under 5 years was 172, which is equal to a rate of 3.51 per 1,000 of the general population, against 3.93 and 3.36 per 1,000 in the two previous years. There were 53 deaths from various forms of Tubercular Disease, 36 of which were from Phthisis, against 35 and 34 in the two previous years. There were 98 deaths from diseases of the Respiratory System, against 64 and 73 for the two previous years. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths from the seven chief Zymotic Diseases of the Registrar-General (Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea) were 52, which corresponds to an annual rate of 106 per 1,000, against 1.76 per 1,000 in 1906. No case of Smallpox or Typhus was notified during the year. SCARLET FEVER. 235 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified with 1 death, against 224 cases with 7 deaths in 1906. 7 DIPHTHERIA. 80 cases of Diphtheria were notified with 8 deaths, against 74 cases with 9 deaths in 1906. The following table gives the number of cases of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever at particular Schools. SCHOOLS ATTENDED. Noel Park. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria.

Mixed 4 3 Private Schools 82 6 No Schools 12 40 TYPHOID FEVER. 11 cases of Typhoid Fever with 1 death were notified, against 16 cases with 1 death in 1906. MEASLES. There were 20 deaths from Measles, against 3 in 1906. In the early part of the year, Measles were very prevalent in Bowes Park, and I found it advisable to close the Bounds Green Road Schools. 9 The Infants' Department was closed from 27th February to the 11th March. The Boys' and Girls' Departments from 28th February to the 11th March. The Schools were thoroughly disinfected, first by fumigation, then the walls, desks, &c., sprayed with Formalin. Measles not being a notifiable disease, I am unable to say how many cases occurred, but the attendance at the School dropped to about 40 per cent of the average. DIARRHŒA. There were 9 fatal cases of Diarrhœa, 7 of which were in children under 1 year, against 43 fatal cases in 1906. It will be noted that there is a considerable diminution in the number of deaths this year of infants under 1 year, which is no doubt due to the cool weather during the Summer. Easter and September were the only months in which we had any very hot weather, and this only lasted a few weeks. The Council engaged on the 2nd December a Lady Health Visitor for a period of three months—too short a time to prove whether her services will be of any value in preventing Infantile Mortality—but are to reconsider the question at the end of that period. WHOOPING COUGH. There were 13 fatal cases of Whooping Cough in children under 5 years, against 9 in 1906. There were 25 cases of Erysipelas notified with no deaths, against 36 with no deaths in 1906. 10 deaths were attributed to Influenza as a primary cause, against 7 in 1906. 10 ISOLATION HOSPITAL. During the year the following 249 cases have been removed to the various hospitals:— Scarlet. Diphtheria. Typhoid Hornsey Isolation Hospital 174 50 6 Enfield „ „ 13 — — Southgate „ „ 6 — — 193 50 6 COST OF ISOLATION. The cost of Isolating Infectious Cases for the year ending 31st December, 1907, was as follows:— £ s. d. Enfield Isolation Hospital 189 0 0 Southgate „ 106 1 0 Ambulance Horse Hire 8 7 6 Hornsey Isolation Hospital Contribution 300 0 0 Maintenance of Patients 2,961 7 2 £3,564 15 8 Less Contributions from Patients 73 14 1 £3,491 1 7 An average weekly payment of £67 2s. 8½d. The average cost per patient was £14 0s. 4¾d. During this year the Committee decided that, before a patient could be admitted to the Isolation Hospital, an agreement must be signed to pay a proportion of the expense incurred in Maintenance (except in pauper cases). This, of course, causes delay in the removal of patients to the Hospital, and the onus of fixing the amount to be paid is placed upon the Chief Inspector, a duty which turns that official into a kind of relieving officer, and was never contemplated, in my opinion, 11 by the Public Health Act. It will be interesting to note at the end of twelve months whether the collection and unpopularity of such charge will be worth the sum received. The pocedure adopted now in removal of patients is as follows : The Notification is received at the office, and, unless it is received from the Parish Doctor in his official capacity, one of the Inspectors goes to the house, taking a stamped agreement with him ; enquiry is made as to the means of the parents, and they are asked to sign for any amount from 2s. to £1 17s. 6d.; this being signed, the Inspector has then to come back to the office and telephone through to the Hospital. If a Notification arrives at the office when the Inspectors are out, it has to wait until one of them return. Fortunately there have not been any particularly urgent cases requiring removal during the year, and I am pleased to say the staff have dealt as promptly as possible with all the cases, and have put themselves to considerable trouble in order to prevent delay. As in previous years, "specimens" of doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever have been sent for Bacteriological examination, the requisite materials being supplied free. AntiDiphtheric Serum has been supplied to Medical Practitioners in urgent cases of Diphtheria, a. supply of the latter being kept at the Town Hall, the residences of the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Sanitary Inspector, so that when the offices are closed no unnecesssary delay may be caused, and this has been found to be a great convenience. Tubes of Anti-Diphtheric Serum supplied 40 Bacteriological Examinations 34 DUST DESTRUCTOR. I am glad to be able to report that the erection of the Dust Destructor, advocated for so many years, is in progress, and will be completed ready for use probably about the middle of March. 12 The Destructor is being erected by Messrs. Heenan & Froude, Manchester, at a cost of £9,475, including the Building, Furnaces, Engine, Dynamo, and Electric Lighting for the Depot, and is being erected on the Moat House Site. There are six cells in two units of 3 cells each, each unit capable of destroying 45 tons of refuse in 24 hours, and evaporating not less than 1 lb. of water per lb. of refuse destroyed, from and at 212° F. The steam will be utilised to work a Mortar Mill, Dynamos, and the Disinfecting Apparatus, and there will be sufficient steam generated to utilise for other purposes the Council may decide. A Bathroom has been provided for the Workmen in connection with the Destructor—a valuable and necessary adjunct—and I trust good use will be made of the same. A cottage is also being erected (not included in the above amount) which will probably be occupied by the Foreman in charge of the Destructor ; a weighbridge will also be fixed, together with an office, so that all materials may be weighed and checked. MEDICAL INSPECTION CF CHILDREN. Section 13 of the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907, is as follows:— 1.—The powers and duties of a Local Education Authority under Part III. of the Education Act, 1902, shall include— (a) Power to provide for children attending public elementary schools, vacation schools, vacation classes, play centres, &c. (b) The duty to provide for the medical inspection of children immediately before or at the time of or as soon as possible after their admission to the public elementary school, and on such other occasions as the Board of Education direct, and the power to make such 13 arrangements as may be sanctioned by the Board of Education for attending to the health and physical condition of the children educated in public elementary schools: Provided that in any exercise of powers under this section the Local Education Authority may encourage and assist the establishment or continuance of voluntary agencies and associate with itself representatives of voluntary associations for the purpose. 2.—This section shall come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1908. The Board of Education have issued memoranda relating to the carrying out of the provisions of the Act and defining the minimum amount and extent of the medical examination that will be required. The Act comes into operation at a moment when no Education Authority in the country has the machinery in readiness for carrying it out, and the Education Committee of your Council will have to consider the best course to take under the immediate circumstances without having the experience of other districts as a guide. I was appointed Medical Officer to the Education Committee in July, and have since periodically visited the Schools and have examined those children who have been pointed out by the teachers as presenting some obvious physical defect, but I have had neither the time nor the facilities for effecting the examination to the extent, nor with the completeness, that will be required in the future. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. The details of the general Sanitary work of the district are appended in the report of your Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Adams, and I am glad to acknowledge his able assistance and the good work of the other members of the Public Health Staff. 14 The following number of Houses were systematically inspected during the year:— Neville Place 19 Commerce Road 17 Granville Road 22 Richmond Road 40 Leith Road 30 Moselle Avenue 111 239 I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C.

To the Chairman and Members of the Wood Green Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report of the Work in this Department during the year ending December 31st, 1907. There has been 117 Complaints received at the office of various nuisances. As in previous years I have included under the head of Special Complaints all nuisances found, except those of House to House Inspection, which appear under that head in another column.

A Post-mortem room has this year been added, and alterations carried out to the Mortuary Building by throwing a glass screen across, providing new roof, ventilation and proper trestles for the reception of coffins, together with new shells, so that bodies can now be viewed by jury and friends, from outside the glass screen, and each body is placed in a shell with a glass front ; thus the viewing of the bodies is relieved from the unpleasantness and gruesomeness which originally existed, and is more in accord with the modern requirements of a building of this character. I need hardly add, that the new Post Mortem Room has been appreciated by those whose unwelcome task it has been to use the same, and to have a separate apartment from the Mortuary for this purpose, is a great improvement on the arrangement that existed up to this year. The position of the Building, leading as it does out of the yard at the rear of the Town Hall, is not all that could be desired, but with the purchase of more land at the rear of the Town Hall grounds, I trust a new Permanent Mortuary, &c., on modern lines will be a thing of the near future. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS ORDER, 1885. There have been six applications to be Registered under the above Order, three in respect to new businesses and three transfer of business, all of which have been granted. 26 Although there are Four Registered Cowkeepers, only three keep Cows. A keeps 4 Cows. B „ 4 Cows. S „ 1 Cow. Two persons were found to be selling Milk without being Registered, but were not proceeded against, as they immediately gave up the Sale of Milk rather than conform to the Council's Regulations. I am pleased to be able to report that it has not been necessary to report any breach of the Regulations by Registered Persons to the Council during the year; but the Council's Regulations were made in the year 1891, and the Committee have under consideration new Regulations, which I trust will have the effect of preventing the Sale of Milk in the "general shop," where all kinds of stock is stored in the same apartment with such an important food as Milk, and I can only reiterate the opinion expressed before, that "Registration" of those who sell Milk is not sufficient, the premises should have to be certified by the Local Authority before Milk could be sold to the Public. I am only surprised that the District Councils (and kindred) Associations do not take the matter up. The number carrying on the Sale of Milk on the 31st December, 1907, were as follows:— FOUR COWKEEPERS. 1. A. R. Abbott. Station Road. 2. R. Blomfield, 57, Commerce Road. 3. J. Gower, Redvers Road. 4.

During the year the Butchers, Fruiterers and Fishmongers Shops have been inspected from time to time, and it is with great pleasure that 1 again acknowledge the ready assistance which the variout food purveyors in the district have given when their premises have been visited. Particular attention has been paid to the Saturday night Market in the High Road, one cannot help remarking of the good quality of the food sold having regard to the price, and which must be a boon to those who have to make small money do for big families. No seizures have been made during the year in the ordinary way. Small piece of Pork was brought to me after Sale, and the circumstances reported to the Committee who directed a strong warning to be sent to the Purveyor selling the same. My attention was directed to another piece of Meat sold by a Butcher outside the District, but upon calling at the house I found the Meat had been buried in the garden. The following articles were surrendered:— 16 Sheeps Plucks. 1 Box of Cods' Roe. 2 Boxes of Rock Salmon. 1 Box of Tomatoes. 1 Box of Kippers. SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND FOOD INSPECTION. There are Five Slaughter Houses in the District attached to Butchers' Shops, as under, viz.:— 29 301, High Road. 103, High Road. 201, High Road. 45, Finsbury Road. 141, Myddleton Road. One Slaughter House has changed occupation during the year, and application was made to the Council for a new Licence, subject to certain alterations being carried out the Council are prepared to License the premises (for which application is made) under the Public Health Acts Amendment Act for a limited term. In connection with this matter, a doubt was expressed by the Applicant whether he had need to apply for a Licence for old premises, and which had been licensed by the Tottenham Local Board; but the case of Goodman v. Sale (High Court, 1907) laid it down that the Licence was to the person and not the premises. This is a most important decision for Local Authorities throughout the Country. As last year, one Slaughterhouse has only been used for occasional killing. Number of Visits to Slaughter Houses, 158. REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. No. of Complaints and Requisitions 13 „ Loads Removed 8360 „ Visits to Carts on District 2100 „ Carts employed 10 It will be noted that 311 more Loads of Refuse were removed during 1907 than the previous year, pointing to the continued growth of the District from year to year. The increase is also, no doubt, due to the fact that householders are recognising the necessity for more frequent Removal of Refuse from the premises, several applications have been received for more than a weekly Collection of House Refuse, but at present a more frequent collection could not be made without a great increase in the cost of Collection. I contemplete the Dust Destructor which is being erected on the Moat House Site and is nearing completion, will facilitate the 30 Collection of Refuse and a bi-weekly Collection may be possible in some parts of the District, but as I intimated last year the opening of the Destructor will mean a re-organisation of the work of the Collection of House Refuse. At present the Refuse is being Shot at the extreme end of the District (toward Tottenham) consequently much time is occupied by the Carts in going to and from the Shoot. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. The following is a list of the Workshops in the District:— Business. No. in District. Visits.

Fifty-three premises have been visited where Ice Cream is made and stored, and a circular left with each occupier as to the provisions of the Wood Green District Council Act, 1903. All the premises visited are Shops from which Ice Cream is retailed in glasses. In three instances we have had to call the occupiers attention to the dirty floors; one case to the dirty state of the yard at rear where the Ice was stored; and in one case to the dirty walls and ceiling of the shop. I am glad to say that upon a re-visit these matters were remedied without having to take any further action. Ice Cream is a comestible in which milk is largely used, and the premises from which it is sold ought to be licensed by the Local Authority as well as by drastic Bye-Laws framed for the carrying on of such business.

The open air Swimming Bath, which was originally constructed in connection with the Alexandra Palace, but which had not been 34 used for some years, was opened by the Council to the Public on the 6th June. The Council recognising the need for a Bath for the District opened negotiations with the Palace Trustees and the Lessees of the Race Course, and entered into an Agreement with them to rent the Bath for a period of three years. An expenditure of ,£479 0s. 0d. was necessary to make a roadway to the Bath, fitting-up dressing boxes, &c., and I am pleased to say the Metropolitan Water Board met the Council in a very fair manner with respect to the supply of water and the cost of supplying the same to the Bath. The Bath was open for three hours on Sunday morning throughout the period, and the numbers who availed themselves of the opportunity of a swim was remarkable. On three Sundays in June there were 174 „ four „ July „ „ 413 „ four „ Aug. „ „ 526 „ five „ Sept. „ „ 374 „ two „ Oct. „ „ 18 The total Number of Bathers from the 6th June to 8th October were 11,184, or a daily average of 105.50. Having regard to the dull, cold weather prevailing over nearly the whole of the period the Bath was open, I think the figures were very encouraging, not only from an educational but from a health point of view. The total receipts were £87 15s. 0d., a charge of 3d. being made for Adults and 1d. for Boys, with Season Tickets at 5s. and 2s. 6d. respectively. The first season being considered an experiment, also as to a difficulty in providing suitable Dressing Boxes, there were not any days set apart for Ladies, the Committee are, however, negotiating for a Building adjacent to the Bath where suitable Dressing Boxes can be provided for Ladies, and I have no doubt should they 35 be successful, they will consider next Season the desirability of setting apart certain times for Ladies. GENERAL. We seem this year to have been troubled more than usual with the drain botcher, I can coin no better word. It appears to me some people think anyone can reconstruct a drain, and I trust the day will come when all men engaged in drain work will have to prove their capability. I can only think this class ot workmen are engaged through ignorance, it cannot be cheapness, for in two instances we have had to have the drains pulled up their entire length and reconstructed a second time; unfortunately this class of men will not or cannot be taught, and the time expended superintending the work where these men are employed is almost incredible. I have to record that Mr. Ainley (one of the Assistant Inspectors) who came to us from Huddersfield on the 5th November, 1906, resigned on the 31st May, going back to Huddersfield to take up duty as a District Inspector. On the 24th July, Mr. Stanbury was appointed to the vacancy. He has had experience in several Districts, and came to us with splendid Testimonials from Ventnor, Isle of Wight. The change of office and reorganisation of the Department referred to in my last Report has resulted in the work being carried on with that smoothness which characterises all well organised machinery, and although the clerical work in the shape of Reports for Committees, Accounts, &c., has been increased there is no diminution in the outside work of the Department, and I find upon looking through Reports for several years back that the amount of work done appears to be much the same year by year, pointing to the fact that it is not rushed one year and missed the next. 36 I must thank the Committee for the confidence they have placed in me during the year past, and trust it may continue, and that I shall always continue to merit that confidence which is so necessary between a Committee and its Officials, if good work for the District is to be done. I have also to thank the Staff which are associated with me in the work of the Department, without their loyal co-operation and help, it would of course be impossible to carry on the work in a manner which I trust has given satisfaction to the Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, A. E. ADAMS, Inspector of Nuisances. 37 COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX.—SANITARY WORK, 1907. DISTRICT OF WOOD GREEN. Inspections.* Notices. Dwelling Houses.
