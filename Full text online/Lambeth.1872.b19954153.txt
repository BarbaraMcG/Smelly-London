In the past year, ending the 25th of March, 1873, 48 Applications have been received for improved Lighting in various parts of the Parish; 35 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new lamps and removals, and 13 were refused. There have been 85 new lamps erected, and 14 removed to positions which increased their utility. The total number of public lamps lighted by the Vestry is 3012— and the cost of Lighting for the year, including the erection of new columns, removals, and other expenses, amounts to £12,811 7s l1d. Periodical experiments with the Photometer have been regularly made; and monthly reports have shewn that the illuminating power and purity of the Gas supplied by the several Companies, have been up to the standard required by the Act of Parliament; although in the case of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, ammonia, in small quantities, is sometimes found to be present.

Gentlemen, I now present the Seventeenth Annual Report on the Health and Mortality of Lambeth, for the year 1872-3, and in so doing it is a matter of congratulation that the district of Lambeth will contrast as favourably as any other in the Metropolis, both as regards the low rate of Mortality, and also the very small amount of Zymotic or Preventable Diseases. I have made my calculations on the Census of 1871, but had I done so on the increase of population since that period, the contrast would be still more favourable. The number of Births registered in the Parish during the year 1872-3 were 8187, of which 2042 were registered iu the first, 1988 in the second, 1947 in the third, and 2210 in the fourth quarters of the year. The Births exceeded those of the previous year by 352. The Deaths during the year were 4675; the excess of Births over Deaths amounted to 3512. This is very satisfactory, as compared with the two previous years. 13 The Death, during the four quarters of the year were as follows First Quarter 1140 Second Quarter 1139 Third Quarter 1098 Fourth Quarter 1298 The Deaths were 754 less than in the previous year 1871-72, and 82 more than the year 1870-71; but we are entitled to deduct from the above the deaths which have occurred in the different public institutions, of strangers brought from different parts of the Metropolis and the country, amounting to 304, 104 of these were deaths at Stock well Hospital, and 200 at St. Thomas,s Hospital. The deaths after these deductions will be 4371. The Births and Deaths during each quarter of the year in each of the Eight Division of the Parish are shown in Table II, from which it will be seen that in Waterloo Road, 1st District, there were 587 Births and 323 Deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd District, 931 Births and 385 Deaths; in lambeth Church, 1st District, 750 Births and 723 Deaths, but of these 361 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, of which 200 were strangers to district; thus materially reducing our death-rate proper; in Lambeth Church, 2nd District, 1716 Births and 997 Deaths, 337 of which took place in the Workhouse; in the Kennington, 1st District, 1498 Births and 771 Deaths; in the Kennington, 2nd District, 1038 Births and 512 Deaths; in the Brixton District, 1241 Births and 779 Deaths, 173 of which occurred in the Small Pox and Fever Hospital at Stock well, and of these 104 were strangers brought from different parts of London: thus reducing the death-rate of Brixton to its usual rale; and in the Norwood District, 426 Births and 185 Deaths, 12 of which occurred in the Childrens' Workhouse. The Comparative Mortality of Lambeth; the entire of the Metropolis; and the South District, is shown in Table III. 14 The mortality of Lambeth still continues to Hear favourable comparison with that of the whole Metropolis, as well as that of the Southern District of which it is part, the result is still more favourable as compared with the previous two years. The four most healthy districts during the year were as usual Norwood, Kennington 2nd, Brixton, and Kennington 1st. The mortality of Brixton being (after deducing the deaths of strangers in the Hospitals, at Stockwell) 172.70 per 10,000 ; in Kennington, 2nd part, 164.00 per 10,000; in Norwood, 130.80 per 10,000; and in Kennington, 1st part, 186.50 per 10,000. The four less healthy districts were Waterloo Road, 1st and 2nd, and Lambeth Church, 1st and 2nd. The mortality in Waterloo Road, 1st, (after deducting the deaths in the Hospital, situate in that district), being 226.10 per 10,000; in Waterloo Road, 2nd, after similar deductions, 204.80 pe 10,000; in Lambeth Church 1st, deductiog the deaths in St Thomas's Hospital, 230.70 per 10,000; and in Lambeth Church, 2nd, after the deductions of those dying in the Workhouse, 184.10 per 10,000. By the same table it is shown that one person amongst every 45.42 living, died in London during the year; one amongst 41.67 living, died in the South District; and one amongst every 43.66 living, died in the whole of Lambeth. In the Waterloo Road, 1st, the proportions were one amongst 42.80 living, died during the year; in Waterloo Road, 2nd, one amongst 46.90 living, died iu the year; in Lambeth Church, 1st, one amongst 25.96 living, died during the year; but here we have St. Thomas's Hospital contributing largely to swell the death-rate, and reduce those living to those who died; in Lambeth Church, 2nd, (including the Workhouse), one amongst 34.90 living; in the Kennington, 1st, one amongst 52.70 living; in Kennington, 2nd, one amongst 59.90 living; in Brixton, (including the Stockwell Hospital), one amongst 44,40 living; and in Norwood, one amongst 66,75 living. The Deaths from Epidemic Diseases during 1872-3 are shown 15 in the table IV; they amounted to 811, and as compared with the two previous years (1121 and 1750 respectively) show a most satisfactory condition of the parish; they were only 17.34 per 1000 of tee whole mortality, whereas during the previous two years they were 24.25 and 21 per 1000. The decreasein the deaths from Epidemic Disease was caused by the fewer number of cases of Small Pox aud Scarlet Fever, as compared with the previous year; they were only 182 of Small pox as compared with 937, and 40 of Scarlet Fever, as against 123. Table V will be seen the number of cases of illness from Epidemic Diseases attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers during each quarter of the year. The total numbers were 582, of which 136 occurred in the 1st quarter, 246 in the 2nd quarter, 107 in the 3rd, and 93 in the 4 th quarter. The greatest mortality was from Small Pox, and occurred in the 4th quarter; the next greatest mortality arose from Diarrhoea and Whooping Cough, in the 3rd and 4th quarters. The total number of canes of Epidemic Diseases attended by the Medical Officer were 582, being 967 less than the previous year. The number and character of Nuisances removed, and the general sanitary measures carried out, will be seen in Table I. The Nuisancer abated or removed amounted to 3220; in addition to these there was a large amount of sanitary work carried out by disinfecting houses and rooms where Small Pox and other contagious diseases existed. The number of houses cleansed, which were in an unwholesome condition, were 473; 241 houses requiring proper drainage, drained; 24 cesspools abolished; 398 obstructed drains remedied; 260 defective drains trapped; 646 houses without proper water supply provided with the same; 136 houses provided with means of ventilation; 30 houses where dampness and foul smells existed 16 remedied; 147 yards of houses repaved and litnewashed, 441 dust bins erected; 303 accumulations of dung, &c., removed; 11 cases of decomposed animal or vegetable matter removed; 23 foul urinals cleansed, removed, or improved; 73 closets provided or improved; 64 dangerous structures removed; 2 trade nuisances abated; 65 lots of swine, consisting of 253 pigs, removed; 22 lota of unwholesome fish, numbering 5251, condemned and destroyed; 2 cases of unwholesome meat, weighing 17 cwt. and 70 lbs., condemned and destroyed; 1 case of illegal slaughtering; 44 obstructed or untrapped gullies remedied ; 4 cases of smoke nuisance abated; 7 cases of animals improperly kept in houses, remedied ; 1 case of unsound fruit, consisting of 108 oranges, seized. In addition to the above 401 houses have been disinfected, in which Small Pox and Fevers have occurred, and various sanitary improvements effected therein ; and in 94 cases articles of bed and bedding, infected with Small Pox and other contagious diseases, were either disinfected or destroyed. The number of Licensed Slaughterhouses visited were 105, Cowhouses 94, and Bakehouses 223, in all of which the usual periodical cleansing and whitewashing was enforced, and many other improvements effected. In order to complete these necessary works 1470 notices were served, and 108 summonses and orders issued. The following have been the cases, in which, on conviction before the magistrates, heavy penalties were inflicted, together with costs :— On the 14th May, 1872, James Curran, Butterman, Lambeth Walk, was fined £5 and costs for exposing for sale 172 lbs. of diseased pork. The fine and costs were paid. On the 24th May, 1872, Edmund Good, an undertaker's man, was fined £5 and costs, or one month's imprisonment, for transmitting infected bedding through the public streets, in South Lambeth. Went to prison in default of paying the fine. On the 8th July, Edward Mac Laren, of 5, Robert Street, 17 Brixton, was fined £5 and costs for illegally slaughtering sheep. I he fine and costs were paid. On the 26th of February, 1873, Elizabeth Gosnell was fined £10 10s. and costs for having houses in an unsanitary condition and noncompliance with sanitary notice. The fine and costs were paid. In my last Report I congratulated the Vestry on the Epidemic of Small pox, which had been prevailing since 1870, being nearly extinrf; and I am happy to report that whilst these pages are patting through the press (August, 1873,) we have been for now more than two months, free from any deaths from this disease, and only a solitary case here and there in the district. I trust that the lesson taught us of the value of Vaccination and Re- vacation may not be lost, and that the authorities with whom the enforcing of this preventive measure rests will not neglect to carry them out to their fullest extent. Whilst there has been much done, there still requires more to be done to bring lambeth into a high Sanitary condition. The three chief requirements are to my mind the following, namely, the Rules and Regulations for the prevention of over Croarding, which up to the time these papers are passing through the press, I have not been able to put in force the erection of suitable Mortuaries, to which the bodies of personsdying from Inleetious and Contagious Diseases can be removed from crowded houses or dwellings; and lastly the establishment of Baths and Wash Houses, especially the latter. I know nothing more objectionable, in a sanitary point of view, than allowing the washing of foul clothes in the dwellings of the poor; and still worse the drying of them in courts and rooms already deficient of free circulation of air and light. Dr. Liddle, the Medical Officer of Whitechapel, in his Quarterly Report for March, 1873, has the following very pertinent remarks on this subject, which are so very valuable, and with which I fully coincide, that 1 have given a short extract, they are as follows B 18 "Although the poor are now bettor supplied with water than they were twenty years ago, the discomfort of a washing day is still the same as it was then, the same custom prevailing, viz.; that of a family occupying only a single room, in which the processes of cooking, personal washing, washing, drying and ironing clothes are carried on. In this single room, while these operations are going on, a member of the family is sometimes lying in bed, suffering from illness, who, being exposed to a damp and offensive atmosphere, which is generated in the room, does not recover so rapidly as he otherwise would, if he were surrounded by a more healthy atmosphere. The result of these inconveniences is, that persons so situated, too frequently become regardless of decency and selfrespect, and consequently have a very limited idea of the pleasure arising from a clean skin, and the wearing of clean clothes. As a step, therefore, in the right direction, I can confidently recommend the establishment of Baths and Wash Houses in every district where the poor reside; and, from the experience which has been gained by the knowledge of the benefit arising from the Laundries in Goulston Street, it may be fully anticipated that, by the reopeuing of that Institution, there will not only be a diminution in the amount of disease, but the rate of mortality will be materially lessened." There is much in the report worthy of being quoted, but I do not feel justified in occupying more space in my Report than I have done with the above extract, which should sufficiently satisfy every candid mind of the benefits derivable from such institutions; and I am satisfied that independent of their Sanitary advantages, in a pecuniary point of view, they would prove a success, and return a fair interest for the money expended. I have every reason to be satisfied with the manner in which the Inspectors have discharged their duties. I remain your obedient Servant M. J. MAC CORMACK, M.B.
