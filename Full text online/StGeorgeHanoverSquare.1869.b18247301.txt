TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, In submitting to you the Annual Report regarding the sanitary state of the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square; for the year ending March 27th, 1869, I have to call your attention, as usual, to the mortality, the sickness, and the means adopted for the removal of nuisances from dwellings. Besides these, two points of public interest are noticed, having reference to the operation of the Workshop Regulation Act, and the suggested improvements of the Serpentine. Births, Mortality, Death-rate, and Sickness. The number of births in the Parish was 2,310, against 2,335, in 1868. The number of deaths registered in the Parish between the 28th of March, 1868, and the 27th of March, 1869, amounted to 1,948, including those of 332 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, 106 in the Workhouse, Mount Street; and 37 in Little Chelsea Workhouse. The total number of deaths shows an increase of 119 in excess of that in 1868 and 1869, which was 1829. The greatest number of deaths happened in the first quarter of the present year, according to the following table:— 6 1st quarter, ending June 27th, 1868, 476 2nd „ „ September 26th, „ 458 3rd „ „ December „ „ 467 4th „ „ March 27th, 1869, 547 Estimating the population at 91,500, the gross deathrate was 21.3; but, deducting the deaths (332), of nonparishioners at St. George's Hospital, the death-rate at home was 17.6. In consequence of the destruction of King Street, Pimlico; Princes Row West—a wretched locality—and of part of Queen Street, and of Ebury Street, about 127 families, comprising 508 persons, have been displaced. The site immediately behind " The Compasses " public house, at the top of Ebury Street, will be partly occupied by five blocks of improved dwellings. The plan provides for ten good shops; and 120 first and second class distinct tenements for mechanics and others. The building has been delayed by some formal proceedings necessary for stopping up an old street and forming a new one 40 feet wide in lieu thereof. New model dwellings are erected in Grosvenor Mews Bond Street; and will shortly be completed. They are planned to contain 10 single room and 10 double room lettings. Gatliff Buildings. In the last Annual Report, I noticed the high rate of mortality which happened with a population averaging about 590 persons in these model buildings situate in Commercial Road, Pimlico. It was also stated that, whatever might be the cause, we should all watch with interest the rate of mortality during the ensuing year. I have now the pleasure of submitting to your notice the following table, which shows a much more favourable result, —in that, with a population of 629, there were nine deaths less than in the preceding year :— 7 No. Dates, 1868. Age. DISEASES. Years. Months. 1 April 16th — 10 Tabes Mesenterica 2 July 14th 3 — Hydrocephalus 3 „ 17th 65 — Consumption 4 „ 22nd 1 4 Teething 6 „ 23rd — 8 Hydrocephalus 6 August 7th — 11 days Diarrhoea 7 „ 25th 74 — General Dropsy,Bronchitis, and Old Age 8 November 18 th 32 — Phthisis 9 „ 18th 50 — ” 10 Jan. 21st, 1869 1 2 Bronchitis 11 Feb. 18th, „ — 9 Scarlet Fever During the same period there were 27 births—18 males and 9 females. Hence the death-rate was only 1.7 per cent., or, 17 per 1,000, in twelve months, instead of 323 per cent., or, rather more than 30 per 1,000 in about ten months of the years 1867-8. It is also worthy of remark that there was only one death from scarlet fever, and that very few of the inmates suffered from that disease, although it was epidemic in the immediate neighbourhood during several months of the year. Zymotic and Other Diseases. Zymotic disease proved fatal to 366 persons—71 in the first quarter of the year, 124 in the second, 101 in the third, and 70 in the fourth. The principal causes of death were as follows:—Small-pox 1 (against 4 in the previous 8 year); measles 27, against 35; scarlet fever 62, or 10 in excess of the previous year ; diphtheria 17; croup 12, against 15; glanders 1, sore throat 5, whooping-cough 47, typhus fever 34, erysipelas 16, metria4; pyaemia rose from 19 to 30, of which 17 were non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital ; dysentery 1; diarrhoea rose from 58 to 89 ; cholera 6, rheumatism 4, syphilis 7, and thrush 3. Tabes and scrofula destroyed 13 persons, consumption 230, lung disease 311, hydrocephalus, convulsions, and teething 128. The deaths from accidents or negligence rose from 44 to 66, 45 of which occurred to non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. Of the parishioners, an infant of 18 months was burnt to death at No. 24, Stockbridge Terrace, and another of 11 months was scalded to death at No. 8, Providence Court, by hot water from a saucepan, which fell from a stove. An infant of 8 days was poisoned by laudanum given in ignorance at No. 10, George Street, Oxford Street. An architect aged 18, a man aged 70, a labourer aged 23, and a bootmaker aged 39, were drowned in the Serpentine—the three first while bathing; and a cab-driver, aged 73, died of suffocation at No. 2, Bell Yard, Mount Street; while eating meat. Murders of infants declined from 8 to 2. A tailor, aged 43, destroyed himself with a knife, when insane. A solicitor shot himself in Kensington Gardens, a coachman poisoned himself with prussic acid in Hyde Park, a carrier took morphia and strangled himself with a handkerchief, and a lady took strychnine in " Battle's vermin killer." Seven persons drowned themselves—three in the Serpentine and four in the River Thames, one of whom was a non-parishioner. The widow of a butler hung herself by a cord fastened to a towel roller, at No. 73, Elizabeth Street. Ten infants also died from causes not specified, or ill-defined. There was one death from intemperance, and 12 from delirium tremens—3 of which were those of non-parishioners. 9 Sickness The Tables of Sickness, which are appended, are not so complete as could be wished, owing to the loss of one of the Report Books for the Western District of the In-Wards. Nevertheless, such information, although imperfect, is extremely useful, as it directs my attention to houses recently infected with zymotic diseases, and enables me to remove their causes or such evils as may increase their virulence. My best thanks are due to Drs. W. Griffith and Webb, Messrs. E. Jay, C. P. Ward, C. Connock, and A. Greenhill, for filling up some of the Returns. Vaccination in the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts. The following Table shows the number of persons successfully vaccinated by Mr. Jay:— Under 1 year. Above.

Bake-houses limewhited 65, out of 87 inspected during May 1868, and 62 out of 87 inspected during November 1868, Frederick Longi.and, Sanitary Inspector. Special Cases. I summoned a Special Committee on June 25th, 1868, to consider a complaint against the owner of No. 6, Chapel Place, Belgrave Square; a marine store dealer. It always seemed to be a very unfit place for carrying on such a business, and was reported upon in July and August 1861, June and September 1865, and in June 1866. The premises are situate immediately behind the house of the complainant, adjoining the back room on the ground floor and under the leads extending from the drawing room ; and illness was caused by carrying on a traffic in putrid bones, skins, foul rags, and kitchen grease, which is commonly offensive when brought there for sale. A magistrate's order was signed for the removal " of about one cart load of bones, the same quantity of rags, and a like quantity of fat, all in a putrid state." I am of opinion that these places should be licensed in the same way as the cow-houses and the slaughter-houses. Proceedings were taken on July 25th, 1868, at the Westminster Police Court, against the Commissioners of the Westminster Improvements for permitting an accumulation of offensive matter to remain in some vaults at the north end of the Vauxhall Bridge Roard, close to Victoria Street. They contained a number of dead dogs, cats, putrid vegetables, and other matter of the most offensive description; 12 which had been for ten years a source of great annoyance to the neighbourhood. Complaints had been repeatedly made to the Commissioners, who cleared the filth out of the vaults, but it soon again accumulated. Ninety carcases of dead cats, which had been skinned, were removed from the vaults on one occasion, and 20 found in the cistern of a house close by. There were 32 of these vaults, 16 of which were in this parish, all of which have been securely enclosed with a fence eight feet high, by order of Mr. Selfe, the magistrate, after the whole of the offensive matter had been removed, and brick rubbish thrown into the vaults. It seems to be a defect in the law that the police should have no power to prohibit persons from throwing down unhealthy refuse in such places, if they are private property. No. 2, Hindon Street, Pimlico. —The owner of this house was summoned on February 23rd, to the Westminster Police Court, under the 8th Section of the Nuisances Removal Act, because " the premises were in such a state as to bo a nuisance and dangerous to health," but he did not appear. I told the magistrate, Mr. Arnold, that there was no water supply to the closet, that the wash-house was out of repair and dangerous, the rain-water pipe defective, and that the walls of an upper room were soaked through with rain, which also penetrated the roof. I was then advised to apply to the Vestry, under the 81st Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, to serve a notice requiring the owner to supply a water-closet, and if he declined to do so they would cause the work to be done at his expense. I wrote, however, first to him, asking him to come or send his agent to ascertain what was required. He sent his agent, and the work has been finished. This case appears to me to show the confusion of our sanitary laws. No doubt the Magistrate felt a difficulty, on referring to the 13th Section of the Nuisances Removal 13 Act, when he did not find such nuisances as I had described. " Some persons," as he said, " might consider them to be merely an annoyance or an inconvenience." Now as the Medical Officers of Health generally proceed under the Nuisances Removal Act, it should be sufficiently comprehensive to protect the public health; but in this instance it was insufficient. And supposing that I had applied to the Vestry, under the 81st Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, that would have compelled the supply of a water-closet only, leaving some of the other evils unremedied. And then the condition of the wash-house would require the Police Act to be put in force to remedy a dangerous structure. Nos. 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, and 193, Buckingham Palace Road.—This was a case of joint drainage, an obstruction of which caused some of the kitchens to be flooded with sewage from 6 to 10 inches in depth. The houses drained into an old brick drain behind; the fall being the wrong way, which prevented any effectual joint drainage. A notice was served, and each house drained separately into the sewer in front. Smoke Nuisance. As I have often received complaints of nuisance, injurious to health, arising from smoke coming from wash-houses, stables, and other buildings not within the scope of the Police Act, I have regretted that the local authority has had no power to prevent it. In such cases persuasion has sometimes availed to abate the nuisance, but not always. I have thought it would be very desirable to introduce in any future Health Bill, requiring amendment, a clause to the effect that wherever a nuisance arises from the smoke of a tenement near to any house, that power be given to the local 14 authority to cause the chimney to be raised above the level of the said house, or to be so raised as to abate the nuisance. Indeed this formed a resolution, which I proposed and was unanimously passed, at a meeting of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health. Slaughter-Houses and Cow-Houses. At the Special Sessions held in the Board Room, Mount Street, on October 9th last, 27 applications for licensing slaughter-houses were made, 2 of which were refused. There were also 11 applications to license cow houses, one of which was refused. It is desirable that 1000 cubic feet should be provided as breathing space for each animal, but from Table No. III., showing the cubic capacity of each cow-house, it may be seen that 2 of them have only about half that capacity. The Serpentine—Hyde Park. In consequence of the impure state of the water, and the increase of deaths from drowning in the Serpentine during the Summer of 1868, I found it necessary to report upon the subject to the Nuisances Removal Committee, and to write to Her Majesty's First Commissioner of Works, asking his Lordship whether any steps were likely to be taken not only to prevent the recurrence of effluvia by proper means, but also the frequency of deaths from drowning, by lessening the depth of the river. I received the following reply:— Office of Works, &c., S.W., 21st Sept., 1868. Sir, I am directed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works, &c., to acquaint you, with reference to 15 your letter of the 16th inst., that the present condition of the Serpentine, and the best means of making and keeping it pure and safe, are now under consideration ; but that it is not intended to undertake any operations of magnitudo until P arliament shall have voted the necessary supplies. I am, Sir, Your obedt. servt., George Russell, Asst. Secretary. C. J. B. Aldis, Esq., M.D. During further inquiries, I also received, through the kindness of Dr. Christian, Surgeon to the Royal Humane Society, Mr. Lambton Young, Secretary, and Mr. H. Williams, Superintendent, some elaborate and interesting statistics in a communication dated 30th October, 1868, which I have much condensed, as follows :— Statement, showing the number of Accidents and, Deaths from Bathing and cases of Suicide which have occurred in the Serpentine during 20 years, from 1844 to 1864— Total number of Bathers rescued 119 Bathers drowned 24 „ „ Suicides „ 120 Suicides „ 120 „ „ „ prevented 43 „ „ of Lives saved 358 Total Lives lost 144 Note.—The cases under the head of " Rescued and Landed" are those bathers who have been seized with cramp, or become powerless from exhaustion, in attempting to swim across the Serpentine, and must inevitably have been drowned but for the watchfulness and promptitude of the Royal Humane Society's boatmen. The cases under the head of " Brought to the Receiving 16 House" are those bathers who have sunk in deep water, and, after the lapse of from 2½ to 4 minutes, have been brought to the surface again by means of the drags, and were treated at the house by the Society's Medical Officer. Statement showing the number of Immersions, Deaths, Broken Limbs, Dislocations, Severe Cuts and Concussions on the Ice during 20 years, from 1844 to 1864— Immersed and rescued, 230; drowned, 4 ; broken limbs and dislocations, 3; severely cut heads and concussions, 148. Note.—Many of the 230 rescued were extremely bad cases, and were extricated from the ice with difficulty. This remark applies to all the parks. One young man in the drowned column lost his life by venturing upon the Serpentine after a 12 hours' frost, at 9 o'clock p.m. The night was dark, and the icemen had been dismissed from duty. He with three of his companions broke through the ice in the middle of the broadest part of the lake. Three out of the four were rescued with much exertion by the resident officers at the receiving house. The remaining three were lost by disregarding the caution put up to mark the dangerous parts of the ice. 17 Serpentine—Hyde Park.

Having received a letter from Mr. Alexander Redgrave, Her Majesty's Inspector of Factories, dated 15th September, 1868, asking for information of the steps "taken for the administration of the Act, and the results of any action taken in the matter," I sent him a Report, dated September 18th, 1868, which was printed in extenso in his Report, ending October 31st, 1868, to both Houses of Parliament. In compliance with a resolution of the Vestry held on the 20th of November, 1867, Mr. Chappell, the Vestry Clerk, supplied me with printed abstracts of the Act, which have been distributed to different workshops, to many of the clergy and schoolmasters in the parish. Soon after I received a letter from the late Sir Richard Mayne, with two communications and papers respecting cases of alleged contravention of the Act, but I did not then take proceedings after having ascertained the truth of the charges, as the parties accused promised to carry out the provisions and to do all that was required. They afterwards broke their promise, and were ultimately convicted. Although I meant urgently to demand a diminution of the hours of work, I did not take advantage of evidence obtained after the first complaint, wishing to carry out this new Act in as conciliatory a manner as possible, rather than excite a strong opposition to that which is essentially good, and conducive to the health of the milliners and dressmakers. The following method was adopted on ascertaining that any of the provisions of this Act had been contravened: Having entered the premises, I took the evidence of the needlewomen as to their hours of work and time of meals. I then inspected the workshops and the condition of the bedrooms as to cleanliness, size, and ventilation. Should the Act have been infringed, I visited and 19 cautioned the employers against doing so in future; and should they have consented to obey the law, proceedings were not taken unless they neglected to fulfil their promise. For many milliners and dressmakers reasonably pleaded ignorance of the law. I have received 58 complaints up to the present time against different establishments in St. George's parish, and although mostly anonymous, still nearly all contained more or less truth. Many of the work rooms were visited several times. I obtained convictions in the following five cases— 1. Miss Eleanor Salmon, dressmaker, No. 49a, New Bond Street, April 29th, fined by Mr. Tyrwhitt, at Marlborough Street. The defendant paid only the costs, as I did not press for a penalty, the Act having just come into operation. 2. Mr. John Verdie, milliner and dressmaker, No. 23, George Street, Hanover Square, May 8th, at ditto, and paid the costs. 3. Mr. B. Studer, ditto, No. 9, Bruton Street, Bond Street, May 27th, at ditto ; 20s. and costs. 4. Francois Frechet, 158, New Bond Street, December 21st, at ditto; 40s. and costs. 5. Miss Harriett Axford, No. 8, Arabella Row, rimlico; August 6th, at Westminster; 20s. and 8s. costs, or 14 days. I found at a house in Lupus Street, 6 young women working in a scullery in the basement, where the chimney smoked so much that a fire could not bo lighted in the winter, and the room being dark they always worked by gaslight. It contained a sink having a trap unsealed by water, with a water-closet adjoining. The cubic capacity was insufficient for six persons, but nine usually worked there, rendering the 20 room almost unbearable. On remonstrating with the proprietor he acceded to my request, that he should provide a cheerful room up stairs, and lessen the hours of work. He provided the room, but as he continued to employ the young women beyond the legal hours—on one occasion before the Alhambra ball, until 12.30 at night, and on another after 4 p.m. on Saturdays—I was compelled to take proceedings. I did not press for heavy penalties as the preceding convictions were the first under the Act in London, and led to my receiving so many letters from various places, that I was compelled to write letters to the newspapers, referring the complainants to their respective local authorities. The steps already taken have greatly diminished the excessive hours of work in this parish for the present, and no doubt the result will conduce to the health and social welfare of the milliners. With regard to the moral aspect of the question, several of the employers have said that I shall " drive the young women into Regent Street." On further inquiry, however, it did not appear that more than two or three employers paid any attention to the moral improvement of the girls. But a good example to the contrary has been shown by a proprietor, whose establishment in the parish I have inspected, without receiving any complaint. He has always been a warm advocate for the Act, and employs a great many young women under its restrictions, with sufficient profit to himself. He sees that the indoor workers have daily exercise in Hyde Park, affords them opportunities for daily prayer, and provides them with sittings in a chapel connected with the Church of England; thus endeavouring to the best of his ability to improve their moral and physical condition. He would not wish me to publish his name; but recording the fact may induce those who think the Act likely to increase immorality to reflect whether they cannot counteract it in 21 the way indicated, subject, of course, to variation of religious principles. Table IV. shows the establishments which have been visited. Gas. Two hundred and fifty-two observations were made during the year upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at No. 40, Parliament Street, No. 73, Bessborough Street, and 78, Cambridge Street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard required by the Act. With respect to purity all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper, except on April 23rd, 1868, when the common gas of the Chartered Company ; on December 23rd, 1868, when the common gas of the London Company; on January 12th, 1869, when the cannel gas of the Equitable Company; on January 20th, March 3rd and 24th, when the common gas of the London Company, presented traces of ammonia. I reported to the Vestry on November 5th, 1868, that, in consequence of the Gas Light and Coke Company's, and the City of London Gas Acts having come into operation, my functions of Gas Examiner of the Chartered Company's Gas had ceased. For, under the 109th section of the former, the Metropolitan Board exercise the same power in the Chartered Company's district outside the City as the Corporation of the City of London do within the City; and the third section of the City Act repeals certain sections of the Metropolitan Gas Act, I860, including that of the appointment of a Gas Examiner by the Local authority, and section 22 44 provides for the appointment of a competent person or persons to be a Gas Examiner or Gas Examiners. A Chief Gas Examiner had already been appointed by the Board of Trade. The following Table gives the average light monthly in sperm candles of all the gases:— Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 22.85 23.16 24.67 Common 15.72 14.41 13.966 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the Gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations and the pressures, with the dates, and the weekly and monthly average illuminating power. I remain, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, C. J. B. Aldis, M.D., Medical Officer of Health, and Gas Examiner. May 6th, 1869. The water supplied by the Grand Junction Company to the In-Wards, and that supplied by the Chelsea Company to the Out-Wards, are analyzed monthly.
