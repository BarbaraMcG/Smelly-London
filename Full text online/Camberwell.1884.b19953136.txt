The watering of the public roads of the parish has been done by the staff and plant of the Vestry, as in previous years. The supply of water being obtained partly from the various water companies and partly from the wells sunk in various roads in the lower districts. The following is an account of the cost of the supply: Source of Water Supply for Road Watering. Length of Road Watered. Cost. Southwark & Vauxhall Water' Company Miles. £ s. d. 53¾ 1,318 0 0 Lambeth Water Company 641 3 11 Kent Water Company 135 0 0 29 Wells sunk in the lower districts of the Parish by the Vestry, and also from the Grand Surrey Canal 35½ 42 0 0 Lewisham Board of Works (Moiety, Sydenham Hill) 57 1 0 89¼ £2,193 4 11 9  Southwark & Vauxhall Co.'s supply Kent Co.'s supply.

The quantity removed was equal to 19,300 cart-loads (or 242 barge-loads). The price paid under Mr. Stephenson's contract (from Midsummer, 1884 to Midsummer, 1885), are as follows:— Per cart-load, delivered direct into barges 2s. Per van-load (= to 1£ cart) do. 3s. PARLIAMENTARY DEPOSITATIONS. For Session 1885. The Surveyor's Report upon the above Schemes is here appended. RAILWAYS. CROYDON DIRECT RAILWAY. This is a proposed Railway from Dulwich to Croydon. Commencing by a Junction with the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, at or near the south eastern end of the passenger platform at their Dulwich Station. Higginson & Vigers, 3, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, S. W., Solicitors. F. C. Rees, 13, Great George Street, S.W., Parliament Agent. Wells, Owen & Elwes, 7, Westminster Chambers, S. W., Engineers. This proposed Railway at its junction with the main line of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, as 12 ted, will run at the rear of the east side of Croxted Road, crossing Acacia Grove and Park Road; it is a reproduction of the Scheme of last year, and it is objectionable for the reasons stated in my Report thereon. The Metropolitan Board of Works is the Authority to be invoked to protect the public interest in respect to this Scheme. Memo.—This Scheme has been abandoned. LONDON CHATHAM & DOVER RAILWAY. (Further Powers). "Railway No. 1" is for the construction of a line from the Shortlands Station, on the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, to a junction to be made with the Company's line at Nunhead Station. The above line will, as far as this parish is concerned, be wholly on the Company's Premises, and will not interfere with any public way under this Vestry's control. "Railways Nos. 3 and 4."—These are identical with the proposition of last year, and were referred to in my then Report to the Vestry, they commence by a junction with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, at a point near to and north of the Northern side of the Brayard Road, continuing in a curved line through property on the east side of Gordon Road, crossing over the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (South London line), near to and crossing Kirkwood Road, near its junction with Hooks Road and Athearn Road, through property on the south side of the latter road, crossing Burchell Road near its dead end adjoining the London Brighton and South Coast Railway aforesaid, also crossing Bidwell Street, and terminating at or near the point 13 described as the termination of Railways Nos. 3 and 4 on the present deposited plans. The usual clauses as regards widths and height of Bridges, Street Frontage Lines, &c., should be inserted in the Bill by the Metropolitan Board of Works. John White, Victoria Station, Solicitor for the Bill. Martin & Leslie, 27, Abingdon Street, S. W., Parliamentary Agents. Memo.—This Scheme has been abandoned. CRYSTAL PALACE (HIGH LEVEL), BEULAH AND BECKENHAM RAILWAY. As far as this Parish is concerned, the proposed works will be wholly within the private premises of the London Chatham and Dover Railway Company, at their Crystal Palace (High Level) Station it therefore needs no special reference. Higginson & Vigers, 3, Westminster Chambers, S.W., Solicitors for the Bill. William Bell, 27, Great George Street, S. W., Parliamentary Agent. Frank C. Stileman, Engineers William Hall, Memo.—This Scheme has been abandoned. BECKENHAM, SOUTH NORWOOD PARK, AND CRYSTAL PALACE RAILWAYS. The works of the above proposed lines, so far as they 14 are in this parish, do not interfere with any road or public way under the charge of the Vestry. Fredk. Clift, 12, Pancras Lane, Solicitor. C. J. Hartley & Co., 2, Princes Street, Great George Street, S. W., Parliamentary Agents. Wells, Owen & Elwes, 7, Westminster Chambers, S. W., Engineers. Memo.—This Scheme has been abandoned. TRAMWAYS. CRYSTAL PALACE, ANERLEY AND GIPSY HILL TRAMWAYS. This is a line of Tramway proposed to run from Gipsy Hill Station, up Gipsy Hill and along Westow Hill to the Triangle, opposite the "White Swan" P. H., and continuing down the Anerley Road. The above portion of this Tramway is within the Parish of Lambeth. From the Triangle, opposite the "White Swan" P. H., it will turn northward on to the roadway fronting the Crystal Palace, generally known as the "Crystal Palace Parade," and its present termination will be opposite the Farquhar Road. This latter portion of road, viz:—from the Triangle to Farquhar Road, is in the Parish of Camberwell, but has not yet been dedicated to and consequently is not repairable by the Vestry. The Crystal Palace Company 15 exercise entire control over the same, except as regards Lighting, which the Vestry provides. R. J. Witty, 10, Old Jewry Chambers, Solicitor. C. J.

Commencing in High Street, Peckham, one chain south-east of milestone at junction of High Street, Peckham, with Rye Lane, and terminating by a junction with the Peckham and East Dulwich Tramways Company's already existing Tramway at the southern end of Rye Lane. This will be a single line, except at a point three chains south of its commencement, i.e., in Rye Lane. This proposed Tramway is a renewal of the application which received a partial sanction in the Session 1882, but which powers lapsed on the 10th of August last. A Schedule of the widths of road and footways is appended. 16 The first point to be noted is the narrow width of Rye Lane, especially nearest High Street, Peckham, and which is indicated on the plan thus:—A ABB; in this length there will be a less width than 9 ft. 6 in. from the kerb to the outer Tramway rail, and at a part of the road where most traffic occurs. Further, it is proposed that the double line for the passing of cars, shall occur at a point about central (in length), opposite the front of Hanover Chapel, there will thus be a double line for about three chains, half the length in Rye Lane and the remainder in the High Street, opposite the "Kentish Drovers" P.H., and immediately impinging on the existing lines of Tramway to and from New Cross. The difficulties to maintain the increasing traffic of this particular locality, subject to the working of the proposed Tramway will be very great, and will require very earnest consideration by the Vestry. This proposed double line could be obviated by an arrangement for a junction (and mutual working) with the present Tramway in Peckham High Street. Another objection to this line occurs at the narrow portion of this roadway, between Choumert Road and Peckham Rye, which has been attempted to be removed by the Tramway Company scheduling property to be purchased for the purpose of this Tramway; this is a spot which it has always been considered advisable to widen; if this be carried out, a junction can be then formed with the recently constructed (but as yet unopened) line of Tramway at the upper end of Rye Lane. 17 SCHEDULE SHOWING WIDTHS OF ROADS AND FOOTWAYS.

Commencing in Lyndhurst Road, at a point in the centre of that road at its junction with Peckham Road, thence passing in a southerly direction along Lyndhurst Road, Chadwick Road, and Victoria Road, and terminating at a point in the centre of Victoria Road, at its junction with Choumert Road. At this point it will join the authorized lines of Tramway (Session 1888), at Choumert Road and Bellenden Road. This will be a single line, with a loop opposite Lyndhurst Square. 18 The general points in reference to this line are much the same as those of last year, which then received much consideration by the Vestry. This may be taken as an alternative line to the Rye Lane route, should the difficulties there be found insurmountable, and it at present appears to point out the only practicable outlet for the East Dulwich District.

Mem.—This is the point of termination of Tramway No. 8. (See notes thereto). As regards these proposed Tramways, Nos. 3 and 4, they may, for all practical purposes, be considered identical with similar applications of last year, and which received full consideration by the Vestry.

PECKHAM AND EAST DULWICH TRAMWAYS. As these Tramway Schemes just enumerated are numerous and probably somewhat confusing in their technical descriptions, I have thought a resume of the past and present schemes of this Company might be usefully appended. As to the East Dulwich Tramways it will be borne in mind that this company have already constructed a line of 1 ramway from the south end of Rye Lane opposite the "Heaton Arms" P. H., along the west side of Peckham Rye, and along East Dulwich Road, and Crystal Palace Road, and Lordship Lane, to the "Plough" P. H. 27 Their present proposals are thus:— Rye Lane. From Peckham High Street, southwards to the "Heaton Arms," P.H., to join the constructed line above mentioned. The powers for this line having lapsed last August, the present application is for a renewal of such powers. Lyndhurst Road. This is a repetition of two previous applications. Its course is from Peckham High Road along Lyndhurst Road to Chadwick Road, turning at a right angle into and along Chadwick Road to Victoria Road, and along that road to Choumert Road, where it joins the two authorized lines, one going along Choumert Road towards Nunhead; the other through Bellenden Road and Maxted Road, towards East Dulwich. It will be recollected that the last mentioned line from the junction of Bellenden and Choumert Roads passes along Bellenden Road, Maxted Road, Nutbrook Street, Adys Road, and Ondine Road to Grove Vale. Oglander Road. This is a proposal for a line (which I understand is eventually intended to supersede that in the Ondine Road), it will pass along Oglander Road, thence through vacant land into Wildash Road, into Grove Vale, and continue westwards to Champion Hill Station, and it will also join (in Grove Vale,) the line authorized through Ondine Road, it will then cross Goose Green at the entrance to Lordship Lane at the East Dulwich Hotel, and continue through Lordship Lane to the constructed line at the junction with Crystal Palace Road, near the "Plough" P.H. Goose Green. A short length of Tramway is also pro- 28 proposed to connect the authorized line at Adys Road, opposite Ondine Road, (crossing Goose Green), with the constructed line at East Dulwich Road, at its junction with Crystal Palace Road. Lordship Lane. It is proposed to continue the present constructed line in this lane, at the "Plough" P.H., southwards to Wood Vale, along Wood Vale and Westhall Road, (passing St. Giles Cemetery) to Forest Hill Road, turning northward down and along Forest Hill Road, and the west side of Peckham Rye, joining the constructed line opposite the "King's Arms" P.H., and East Dulwich Road. Peckham Rye and Nunhead. This proposal is for a line from the point last mentioned, viz:—at "King's Arms" P.H., crossing Peckham Rye, along Nunhead Lane, and the south side of Nunhead Green, along Evelina Road to its junction with Kimberley Road, where it will join the authorised line from Choumert Road to Nunhead Railway Station. Hollydale Road. This is a proposed line from Evelina Road out of the latter authorised line running southwards to near the junction with Queen's Road, and terminating opposite the London Brighton and South Coast Railway Company's station at that spot. Brayards Road. This is a connecting line from the authorised line in this road at its junction with Kirkwood Road, to and joining the last above mentioned proposal. Dulwich Common. This is a renewal of last year's proposal for a line from the Grove Tavern, Lordship Lane, to the College Road, opposite the Mill Pond. 29 The foregoing is a short epitome of the somewhat complicated schemes of this Company, which, I trust, may be of use in assisting a clear comprehension of the whole subject of the East Dulwich Tramways, proposed communications. Memo :—Nos. 2 to 6 inclusive have been withdrawn. SOUTHWARK AND VAUXHALL WATER. J. W. Restler, Engineer. This is a notice (as far as relates to this parish), of the intention of the company, to construct a new service reservoir on a part of the Moore Park Estate, situate between the Honor Oak Road, Forest Hill, and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (next to Westhall Road), which property was lately purchased by Alfred Richards, Esq. The County and Parish Boundaries of Lewisham and Camberwell form nearly the centre (longitudinal) line of the reservoir. The dimensions of the reservoir will be about— 460 feet in length, 320 feet in width. = About 3½ acres. This is wholly on private property. No road will be interfered with. The nearest road (private) being the present dead end of Westwood Park, at a distance of about 3 or 4 chains. The company propose to lay down pipes, purchase property, &c., &c., in the usual manner and also to take power to raise capital by Loan, Shares, &c. I apprehend that the usual clauses which the Metropolitan Board of Works will insist on will be found sufficient for the protection of all public rights. 30 In all these schemes of railways, tramways, &c., it will be necessary that the vigilance of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Vestry should be specially exercised, so that Protecting Clauses both as to Working and Construction may be introduced. The question of the steep gradients on some of these Tramway lines, will form a very important consideration in addition to the various other matters already pointed out. SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY. Notice has been lodged of the intention to apply for an extension of the time allowed by Parliament for the construction of a Line of Railway, "proposed to commence by a junction with the Charing Cross Railway, at or near Gravel Lane, Southwark, and terminating by a junction with the Bricklayers Arms Branch Railway near to St. James Road, in the Parish of Bermondsey." I reported on this Scheme, in December, 1881, and it appears at page 22 of the Annual Report for that year. The Act was obtained in Session 1882. DULWICH PARK. A Plan has been lodged with the Vestry, by the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the laying out of a public park on the Dulwich College Estate. As this matter is at this time receiving the consideration of the Vestry, no further particulars will be required in this report. J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor. To the General Purposes Committee, December Qth, 1884. 81 STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The Vestry decided during the past year to purchase a 10-ton steam roller, from Messrs. Aveling & Co., of Rochester; it is now in full work on the various roads of the parish, in addition to the heavy horse roller which is still continued in use when horses can be spared for the purpose.

The subject of improved lighting of the parish, including improved patterns of lanterns, is receiving the careful attention of the Special Committee appointed for this purpose. The South Metropolitan Gas Company's charge 32 per lamp is now reduced to £3 12s. 6d., subject to a discount of five per cent. The Crystal Palace Gas Company's charge is now £3 19s. 6d. per lamp, also with a discount of five per cent. During the past year the lighting of the parish has been much improved, by reducing the distances between the lamps where found necessary. The prices for the supply and fixing new lamp columns are as under:— South Metropolitan Gas Company, per column and lamp £2 17 6 Crystal Palace Gas Company, per column and lamp (less 5 per cent.) £3 0 0 The following table will show the number of lamps, Companies lighting the same, &c., &c.:— Company providing the supply.

FORMATION OF NEW STREETS. In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts, and the Bye-laws of the Metropolitan Board, plans and sections for the formation of fifteen New Streets were referred by the Metropolitan Board for the opinion of this Vestry. The same were reported upon by the Surveyor, and the Vestry decided to recommend the Board to approve ten of such applications. The Board in each case adopted the Vestry's recommendation. The following is a list of the streets approved by the Metropolitan Board:— Aulay Street, Ossory Road. Limesford Road, Nunhead. Hillsboro' Road, East Dulwich Grove. Beauval Gardens, Lordship Lane. Milo Road, Lordship Lane. St. Aidan's Road, Peckham Rye. Cowan Street, Albany Road, (in extension.) Brookland Street, Wells Street d 34 LINES OF FRONTAGE, PROJECTIONS, &c. The Metropolitan Board of Works also submitted for the opinion of the Vestry 39 applications for lines of Frontage, Projections, &c.. Each case being examined and reported upon by the Surveyor; the Vestry recommended approval of 31 and refusal of 8 cases. The Metropolitan Board of Works subsequently notified its consent to 29 and refusal of 10 cases. DRINKING FOUNTAINS & CATTLE TROUGHS. The several Drinking Fountains and Cattle Troughs in the parish, as under, are maintained by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains Association, the Vestry contributing £5 per annum towards the cost of the water supply.

HOUSE DRAINAGE. This subject continues to receive all necessary attention ; careful supervision of the works have been strictly enforced, and all such drainage is inspected and certified. 308 applications have been received for the drainage of 1049 houses into the sewers and the works in connection therewith have been duly inspected. GULLY CLEANSING. The Gullies throughout the parish are regularly emptied and cleansed by the men employed for the purpose by the Vestry and during the hot summer months they are frequently deodorised and receive special attention according to the state of the weather. The number of Gullies cleansed and disinfected has been 5,078. SEWER CLEANSING. The Local Main Sewers are kept free from deposit and heavy matter by the gang of Flushers in the Vestry's service. The quantity of sewer slop removed during the past year has been 153 loads. All sewers vested in the Vestry are in thorough repair and working efficiently. REMOVAL OF DUST. This work has been carried out as before by means of the plant, horses, &c. of the Vestry. 76 The quantity collected during the past year was 21,222 loads, do. do. 1888—4 20,508 „ Increase in the year 719 „ The cost of the work has been £4,106 10 11 Less amount received for Dust sold 95 12 9 Nett cost for the year £4,010 18 4 Equal to about 3s. 9d. per load removed and barged away. Your Committee notified in last year's Report that an increase of cost in this department must be anticipated, by reason of the necessity for the immediate barging away of the Dust (as collected) from the depot specially provided for that purpose at Glengall Road. This work has been contracted for and all arrangements made, necessary for the complete and speedy removal of this material, and which has been found satisfactory in its operation, but such arrangements have resulted in an increase of expenditure in this department against that of last year which was an average cost of 3s. 6d. per load of collection and removal, after allowing for a portion sold to Brick-makers, &c. Such sale being now at an end and the whole collection having to be barged away at a cost of about 2s. per load, results in the present cost averaging 3s. 9d. per load, as against the above quoted last year's cost of 8s. 6d. PUBLIC URINALS. Four additional urinals have been erected in the sites named below, during the year:— 77 Hill Street, near Canal Bridge. Rotherhithe New Road, near Old Kent Road, at Junction of St. James' Road. Joiners Arms Yard, Denmark Hill. Caspian Street, New Church Road. All these conveniences erected by and under the charge of the Vestry, are kept regularly cleansed by the labourers in the Vestry's employ, the water for flushing purposes being supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, at an annual charge of d£6 each. The following is a total list of such urinals:— 1. Camberwell Road. 9. Peckham Rye. 2. Wyndham Road. 10. Havil Street, rear of Vestry 3. Addington Square. Hall 4. Old Kent Road. 11. Hill Street. 5. Wells Street. 12. Rotherhithe New Road. 6. Southampton Street. 13. Joiners' Arms Yard. 7. Sumner Road. 14. Caspian Street. 8. Peckham High Street. The Vestry have resolved to erect several more of these public conveniences in various parts of the Parish and the arrangements are under negociation. Plans and Estimates have been prepared and the works will be shortly in hand. The Reports of your Medical Officer and Public Analyst are appended, shewing the various sanitary measures carried out in their departments. 79 1884-85. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Gentlemen. In my last annual report I remarked that the year 1883, judged of by its death-rate, was the healthiest year that London had experienced since mortuary returns have been recorded. The year which has just elapsed, judged by the same standard, appears to have been even healthier than 1888. The difference no doubt is small, for the Registrar General makes the death-rate of 1883 to have been 20.5 per 1000, and that of 1884 20.3 per 1000. But the death-rate for 1883 is calculated on the deaths occurring in a year of 365 days; whilst that for 1884 is calculated on the deaths accruing in a year of 53 weeks or 371 days. And hence the mortality for 1884 is relatively more favorable than the estimated death-rates shew. The populations of London, and of the five groups of districts, into which it is divided, as determined at the census of 1881, were as follows:— Table I.—Populations of London & of its Groups of Districts at Census of 1881. London. West D. North D. Central D. East D. South D. 3,816,483 669,633 905,947 282,238 692,738 1,265,927 80 The numbers have increased generally, since that time: and the Registrar General calculates that, in the middle of 1884, the population of the Metropolis amounted to 4,019,361 persons. Table II gives the births and deaths, and the birthrates and death-rates per 1000 in 1884, both for the whole of London and for its several groups of districts.

It will be noted that the death-rate for South London is less than the death-rates for the central and eastern districts; and only a trifle in excess of those of the Western and Northern Districts. I he birth-rates, which were low in the previous year, were still lower in 1884. And it is not improbable, that the extraordinary lowness of the death-rates may be in some slight degree attributable to this circumstance. For children in their first year die in much larger proportion than other persons: and if births fall off, the excessive mortality due to infantile deaths must also diminish. It will be 81 noticed that the birth-rates of the Western and Northern Districts were like their death-rates specially low; and that the highest birth-rates prevailed in the Southern and Eastern Districts. Table III shews the deaths from each of the chief zymotic or infectious diseases in London, year by year, for the last ten years: and, for the year 1884, their distribution among the several groups of districts.

The deaths from Small-pox occurred mainly in the Northern Districts; and those from Measles mainly in the South. The generally more numerous deaths due to the Zymotic diseases in South London are to be explained, not by the unhealthiness of this area, but by the fact that the South London group of Districts comprises a much larger population than any one of the others. Table IV gives the actual populations of the Parish of Camberwell and of its four sub-districts as they were enumerated at the last census; and the populations calculated for the year 1884, on the assumption that the rates of increase of each district and of the parish, that prevailed between 1871 and 1881, have been maintained since. Table IV.—Populations of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. Parish. As estimated at Census of 1881. 5,590 59,104 71,089 50,810 186,593 As estimated for middle of year1884 6,209 72,730 84,266 57,985 220,793 It will be found that the total for the parish, in the last line, does not correspond exactly to the totals obtained by adding up the estimates for the several sub-districts. I he difference is unimportant, and depends on the fact (which renders absolute agreement impossible) that the increase in each district as also that in the entire parish, have been calculated on independent data. I may also repeat the caution, which I have often before expressed, 83 that my estimates of population must be regarded as mere estimates, founded on data which are liable to variations, and therefore themselves liable to considerable error. During the year 1884, 7813 children were born in the Parish of whom 3774 were boys, and 3539 weregirls. Of the total number, 89 were born in Dulwich,2402 in Camber. well, 2744 in Peckham, and 2078 in Saint George's. The births were 380 in excess of those in the year 1883. There was a decrease of 4 in Dulwich: but in every other sub. district there was an increase:—in Camberwell of 198, in Peckham of 117, and in Saint George's of 69.

There is little difference in this respect between the two years; and both shew (what has always been observed) that the birth.rate of Dulwich, is not half that for the whole parish; and it is considerably less than half of that for Saint George's.

The deaths were more numerous than those in 1883 by 350. In Dulwich there was an increase of 13, in Camberwell of 46, in Peckham of 169, and in Saint George's of 122 (see Table IX). Of the 1373 returned from the sub-district of Camberwell, 278 occurred in the Workhouse and Parochial Infirmary, and 77 in the Lunatic Asylums, making a total of 355 deaths which (though included in the mortuary returns of this district) no more belong properly to it, than they do to the other sub-districts of the parish. In order to determine the deathrates of the sub-districts, it is necessary to distribute these proportionately among them. This has been done in Table VII; the last column of which presents the corrected returns. Table VII.—Re-distribution of Deaths among Sub-districts of Camberwell. Deaths returned. Deaths in W.& L.A.

These death.rates are furnished in Table VIII ; which also presents for comparison the death.rates of 1883. Table VIII.—Death.rates in Camberwell & its Sub.Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham.

Parish. 1883 7.8 15.6 16.8 17.4 16.3 1884 9.8 15.5 17.8 18.7 17.1 The death.rates (it will be observed) are all of them a little higher than those of 1888; but the differences are slight, and are probably due to accidental causes, and of no significance. They are all remarkably low. As I remarked last year, they are so low that it is impossible not to suspect the presence of some fallacy. Not improbably my estimate of the population is greater than the actual population: an error which leads to an under.estimate of the mortuary rate. Another cause of fallacy I was enabled to deal with for the first time in my last annual report: that, namely, which arises from the deaths of parishioners in hospitals and elsewhere outside the limits of the parish. For the last two years I have received from the Registrar General's office weekly returns of these deaths. And I have tabulated these supplemental deaths for 1884 in Table X. They amounted to 186; of which 2 were due to Dulwich, 45 to Camberwell, 85 to Peckham, and 52 to St. George's. Two could not be referred to any particular district. The addition of these deaths to those registered within the parish, and with which alone I have hitherto dealt, must necessarily increase the death.rates of the parish and of its constituent parts. Table XI shews both the augmented 86 deaths of the parish and its sub.districts due to this addition, and the augmented death.rates. The latter however (as may be seen by comparing table XI with table VIII) present only a very slight increase and are still exceptionally and gratifyingly low. Table IX, together with the supplemental table X, exhibits in detail the returns of births and deaths for the year, arranged both according to districts and according to seasons. It gives also the ages at death and the more important causes of death. Table XI.—Deaths and Death.rates of Camberwell and its sub.distrtcts obtained by including the 186 deaths which occurred in hospitals and elsewhere outside the parish. Dulwich. Camber. well. Peckham.

I must point out, however, that there is a kind of contradiction between the general lowness of mortality on the one hand, and the ages at death and causes of death on the other. For while the mortuary rates imply unusual healthiness of the parish, the year has been characterised by an excessive mortality among young children, and by a general increase of the death.rate due to zymotic or so.called preventible' diseases. Thus the deaths of children, under one year of age, were 1082, in place of 896 in the year 1888; and the deaths from Hooping.cough rose from 91 to Ii8, those from Measles from 112 to 171, those from Diphtheria from 49 to 78, those from Scarlet.fever from 87 48 to 82, those from different kinds of continued fever from 35 to 40, and those from Small-pox from 19 to 34. Further, owing mainly to the excessive heat of the summer months, the deaths from diarrhœal diseases rose from 122 to 240. The fever deaths included one death from true Typhus, due to a limited outbreak of the disease in Verney Flats, a tenement house situated in No. 2 Ward, close to Rotherhithe. This outbreak was speedily suppressed. But it has been followed a few months later (as I shall shew in my next annual report), by a more severe outbreak of the same disease in another part of the parish. On the whole, however, there can be no doubt that the year 1884 was a healthy year. The work done by the Inspectors of Nuisances during the twelve months ending March, 25, 1885, is recorded in Tables XIV. and XV. During this period 13,629 houses were inspected, and 7,151 re-inspections were made; 3,474 first notices and 131 second notices were served in respect of these inspections; and in 16 cases only was it necessary to summons the persons on whom notices had been served. There is nothing in these returns to which special attention need be called. They indicate the performance of a large amount of sanitary work, but the work is all of the usual unsensational character. In concluding my Report I have to express my high appreciation of the manner in which the Inspectors of Nuisances have performed their duties; and, while congratulating the late inspector, Mr. Samuel Fisher, on his advancement to a higher post in the service of the Vestry, my regret at losing his valuable services as a member of the Sanitary staff. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. S. BRISTOWE. 88 TABLE XII.—ANNUAL MORTALITY RETURN OF ZYMOTIC DISEASES FROM 1856 (inclusive). YEAR. Hooping Cough. Measles. / Diphtheria. Scarlet Fever.

Precautionary Measures. 1.—All areas, basements, cellars, kitchens, and yards should bs kept dry and clean, and if necessary, well lime-whited. 2.—All water closets, sinks, and drains should be kept scrupulously clean, be regularly flushed with water, and have their traps in good order; they should also, if at all offensive, be kept flushed with solution of Sulphate of Iron or Carbolic Acid. 3.—All dust bins should be emptied at least once a week, and no unnecessay or undue accumulations of offensive matters should be permitted anywhere. Such accumulation should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of Chloride of Lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. —All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should be kept clean and well ventilated. 6-—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. 93 Measures to be taken when Small Pox or Fever of any kind is present. 1.—Every person suffering from Small Pox or Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—The patient should be at once seperated, as efficiently as circumstance will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and if possible, should be placed in a top room. A sheet kept wet with a solution made by thoroughly mixing a quarter of a pint of Carbolic Acid, No. 4, with a gallon of water, should be hung up outside the door. 3.—All bed-curtains and other hangings, and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards, should be removed from the room. 4.—The patient's room should be well vetilated, but not needlessly draughty; windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free. A fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. 6.—A basin, containing Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or some of a solution made by dissolving a pound of Green Copperas in a gallon of water, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 94 8.—A pail, also containing solution of Chloride of Lime, or of Condy's Fluid, or of Carbolic Acid, should stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with Carbolic Acid Soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's Fluid : her dress should be of Cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should, before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or Carbolic Acid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disinfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn from a quarter to half a pound of brimstone in an iron dish, supported over a pail of water in the middle of the room, the doors, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. The room should remain closed for twenty-four hours. CAUTIONS. 1-—If any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver therof that he is so suffering, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. —Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, 95 or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering, who so exposes the sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 3.—Any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has conveyed any such sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 4.—Any person who, without previous disinfection, gives, lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things that have been exposed to infection from such disorder, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 5.—If any person knowingly lets any house, room, or part of a house in which a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, to any other person, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfaction of a qualified Medical Practitioner, as testified by a certificate given by him, such person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. 6.—When any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, any Justice may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified Medical Practitioner, or the body to be removed to a mortuary at the cost of the Nuisance authority. NOTICES. 1 —If any Infectious Fever appears in any place information should be at once given at the Vestiy Hall to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspector of Nuisances. 2 —Complaints as to Nuisances should be made 96 personally or by letter to the Inspectors of Nuisances, and as to Non-removal of Dust, to the Dust Superintendent at the Vestry Hall. 3.—Disinfectants may be had gratis on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 4 —A Disinfecting Apparatus has been provided by the Vestry at the Parish Stone Yard, Peckham Park Road, at which bedding and articles of apparel may be disinfected gratis, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 5.—A Mortuary has been provided at Forest Hill Cemetery, whither dead bodies, may be at once removed, and where they may remain until the time of burial, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. Dated 9th day of December, 1876. J. S. BRISTOWE M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 97 1884-85 ANALYST'S REPORTS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital, S.E. June 24th, 1884. To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, During the past Quarter I have examined Thirty-five Milks, and am able to say, with some satisfaction, that only one was adulterated with 12 per cent. of water. I will not say that many have not been tampered with, as the analyses prove the contrary, but none beyond the one indicated, No 44, has been prosecuted. Of Butters I can also give a good record. The eight samples were of fair quality and unadmixed. Indeed I may add that Butters have been greatly improved by the attention that has been drawn to them. Four Lards were also of the nature and quality demanded. Of articles of considerable interest which have been analysed may be noted the Tinned Meat and Soups. They were all of excellent quality. No. 33, was the very best of its kind. Whether the tin which is occasionally so distinctly present is ever in injurious quantities remains h 98 as yet a problem, but the public should be warned that where the tins bulge out before opening, the contents are not fit to be eaten. Another sure sign of degradation of contents, is where the tin on the inside is found to be blackened from the action of sulphuretted hydrogen. Pickles were all good and made from fresh vegetables. In no case was the vinegar adulterated. Of four Mustards, one was found admixed with about 25 per cent. of flour, but was otherwise of good quality. The Coffees, also four in number, were likewise genuine. Lastly, Sweets of different kinds have been analysed. All of them were found genuine. In conclusion I would observe that the signs are all of progress, and I trust that they may continue.— Only two certificates of prosecution in the present Quarter, as against sixteen in the past! I have only now to ask that the Committee will be so considerate as to keep to the numbers agreed upon when the arrangement was made with me. This Quarter there have been 67 analyses instead of 50, besides a certain number of duplicates. Michaelmas, 1884. During the past quarter I have analysed twenty-five samples of Milk. Of these, seven were adulterated with respectively, 12, 10, 8, 9, 40, 7, and 18 per cent. of water. Beside these cases which have been prosecuted, other four have been considerably diluted. Five Butters have been examined. Four of them were of good quality. One, however, No. 114, was one of the worst samples which I have ever met with. Apart from the presence of at least 80 per cent. of fat not butter fat, it was very rancid and unfit for food. 99 Breads, five in number, stood the test of analysis, None of them contained alum, nor any admixture discoverable by the microscope. One was peculiar, in that it contained about 50 per cent. of water—the usual quantity varying between 38 and 42 per cent. As affording an agreeable variety in analysis, five Clarets have been examined. It may be interesting to place the results on record:— 85 92 102 111 116 Alcohol 9.43 8.86 8.07 9.29 8.93 Volatile Acid 0.16 0.14 0.13 0.19 0.24 Fixed Acid 0.39 0.49 0.26 0.32 0.35 Glucose 0.18 0.36 0.20 0.29 0.28 Tannin, colouring matters,&c. 1.08 1.23 0.63 0.66 1.04 Ash 0.41 0.27 0.28 0.38 0.30 Water 88.35 88.65 90.43 88.87 88.86 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 Proof spirit 20.50 19.27 17.58 20.19 19.42 These are wines of the character of vin ordinaire, and all of them fit to drink. When mixed with water, in the proportion of half-and-half, they are exceedingly wholesome, and, when yet more largely diluted, such clarets meet the wants of the time as to real temperance drinks. Assuming an ounce and a half of proof spirit* to be the measure of the quantity capable of being drunk with impunity by an adult in fair health, half-a-pint of such wine as is here given would supply the correct quantity. It will be further observed that these wines contain very little grape sugar (glucose), and are therefore very unlikely to be acescent. The amount of tannin furnishes a pleasant astringent which can be modified to almost any extent by the addition of water. And so also with the acidity which is pleasantly corrected by water. The tartaric acid of *Some distinguished physican mentions one and-a-half ounce of absolute alcohol as the measure. If that quantity be taken as the standard, then one pint of claret, and one quart of ale or porter would furnish the amount. H 2 100 wine, which in the analysis is represented by the term "fixed acid," is present chiefly as bi-tartrate of potash (cream of tartar), and is very wholesome and digestible. Besides the Clarets, three samples respectively, of Ales, and two of Porters, must be mentioned. These contained, in the form of proof spirit, 14, 10½, 10, 11½ and 10½ per cent. Roughly speaking, excluding the first sample of ale with its 14 per cent., double the quantity, or one pint, would furnish the permissible amount of alcohol to such as allow themselves the indulgence. No. 112 must have been from the bottom of the cask, and containing an excessive amount of yeast. One Brandy, two Gins, and two Whiskeys, conclude my list. They were all up to the Government standard. The certificates are all in the hands of our Inspectors. Christmas, 1884. During the past quarter I have analysed fifty-four articles of food and drink. Of thirty-four milks, eight were adulterated with, respectively, 6, 11, 17, 14, 6, 12, 9 and 14 per cent. of water, and a further five with a less quantity. As usual, some of the milks are of such high quality as to further confirm one of my articles of belief, that the standard of Somerset House has tended to increase adulteration. Four Breads and four Butters were good of their kind. Two Porters and two Ales have been examined. One of the latter, No. 168, had a distinctly brackish taste, was very flat, and had an odour not suggestive of much hops. On analysis, it was found to contain 187 grains of common salt. Some of the chloride (common salt is the chloride of sodium) might be supposed to have come from the 101 sugar used, but this cannot be the case, as the amount of actual sodium present corresponds to the quantity of chlorine present. This would be a case in which the brewer could help us. He would know what water he uses, and how much of the salt is attributable to the water. The amount of salt coming from malt and hops accounts for about 3 grains per gallon. The four Sherries answer to their names. No wines are more doctored than sherries. By the method of "plastering," a very sour wine can be rendered drinkable, although the dose of sulphate of potash is sometimes excessive. All these sherries are plastered. but not excessively. When the sulphate of lime (plaster of Paris) is added to the wine containing acid tartarate of potash, the tartarate of lime is separated from the wine, and so much of its acidity removed as to render it more palatable to a perverted taste. The analysis of four spirits completes my list. All of them come up to the alcoholic standard. All the certificates are in the hands of the Inspectors. Lady-day. 1885. The subject of Milk has been an interesting study during the past quarter. Besides such as contained, respectively, 18, 6, 8, 7 and 6, per cent. of added water, no fewer than nine were somewhat adulterated. Two of the milks were extraordinary, as containing cream to the extent of 29 and 34 per cent., so that somebody's milk must have been unfairly skimmed. No. 185, milk, has been strongly contested in the Lambeth Police Court. Not only has it been analysed and approved as genuine by another Public Analyst, but 102 at the request of the solicitor of defendant, Mr. Sedgley's sample was forwarded to Somerset House. This milk was analysed by me on the 31st of January, by Dr. R., on the 14th of February, and by the chemists at Somerset House on the 28th of February. The results were as follows:— Dr. R. Somerset House 31.1.85. 2.2.85. 14.285 28.2.85 Total solids 10.94 10.80 11.17 10.57 Water 89.06 89.20 88.83 89.43 Fat 2.59 2.51 2.68 2.50 Solids, not fat 8.35 8.29 8.49 8.07 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 I had given the milk as containing six per cent. of added water. The verdict from Somerset House was as follows:— "the per centage of fat and of non-fatty solids, after making due allowance for decomposition through keeping, are lower than those found in mixed milks of poor quality. From a full consideration of these and other results obtained, we are of opinion that the milk contained not less than three per cent. of added water." I would again direct attention to the point which I have always contested, viz.:—as to the possibility of a correct judgment of a fresh, to be inferred from a stale milk. I consider myself justified in my opinions when I refer to a case adjudicated in November, 1883. Judging from the fresh sample, I had found nine per cent. of added water: the authorities at Somerset House, after making the addition for natural loss arising from the milk through keeping, gave a certificate that the milk contained 14 per cent. of added water. There is a clause in the Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act, 1879, which requires the Analyst to 103 state, with reference to a perishable article, that no change had taken place in the constitution of the article that would interfere with the analysis. Consequently, except for a rough opinion, we never give a certificate of prosecution in the case of a sour milk. When, however, the analysis of a thoroughly stale milk as in the case under consideration, states the amount of total solids as considerably higher than in the fresh milk, even after a fortnight's keeping, we may infer with certainty, the incorrectness of such analysis. The total solids must decrease on keeping, and afford, to some extent, proof (or otherwise) of the correctness of the original analysis. I am thankful to state that the Magistrate was completely convinced of the correctness of my views as to the milk in its original condition, supported as it was by the Somerset House chemists. Four Breads have been examined. They were decidedly good of their kind, although one sample was deficient in salt. Several Sweet-meats were analysed. The Cough Lozenges were harmless and quite free from any preparation of opium. A sample of Lime-juice, sold as effervescent. was such, but very weak of its kind. Two Port wines, two Sherries, three Whiskeys, and one Brandy require but little comment. One of the sherries was more plastered than the other, and the spirits were all above the standard of the Act. The Ales, three in number, were good of their kind. During the present quarter, ale No. 168, was the subject of a magisterial decision. It was attempted to throw the blame upon the water and the sugar used in the brewing. But when I mention that the water only accounted for five grains and the sugar for a further five grains of common salt, whereas the ale contained 190 grains, the defence did not count for much. 104 The certificates, 55 in number, are all in the charge of our Inspectors. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. The above Reports are submitted to the Vestry. (Signed) J. O. WILSON, Chairman of the Sewers & Sanitary Committee, 1884-85. T.

Roadwork ,, VESTRY CLERK'S REPORT. Your Vestry Clerk begs to report that during the last year, the following questions received the consideration of the Vestry. One of the most recent, and, to the inhabitants of South London, most important, was the movement of acquire a Park, for the free use and enjoyment of he public for ever, at Dulwich. In October last the finance Committee reported to the Vestry that they ?ad had brought under their notice a proposal of the Estates Governors of Dulwich College to give about ? acres of land for this purpose. The Committee Reported that, in their opinion, it was most desirable that the proposed portion of the Dulwich College Estate should be kept as an open space, and they ecommended that Mr. E. Dresser Rogers, the representative of Camberwell at the Metropolitan Board of Works, be requested to further the scheme in every Possible way ; and that the members of Parliament for Lambeth and East Surrey be requested to support, in the House of Commons, any bill which might be introduced by the Metropolitan Board of Works to carry into effect the proposal so wisely made by the governing body of Dulwich College. The recommendations were adopted by the Vestry. Subsequently, Dulwich Park 112 in December, the Secretary to the Estates Governors forwarded a copy of a resolution passed by the Governors, deciding to ask the opinion of the several parishes interested as to offering the land for a park, to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for £23,107 the present nett value of the land as estimated by the College Surveyor. The Vestry thereupon decided to take energetic action in the matter, and arranged to hold a public meeting at the Vestry Hall, in favour of the Park. Messrs. Coote, Lumley, Lassam, Fermor, Faulkner, Walter, Whiteley, and Wallace, were also appointed as a deputation to submit the views of the Vestry to the Charity Commissioners, and to the College Governors. The Vestries of Lambeth and Newington were also asked, and cordially consented, to co-operate; and it was decided to take action independently of the Vestries of St. Luke's Middlesex which—with the Vestries of St. Saviour and Bishopsgate—had decided to support the Estates Governors in the latest decision they had come to on the question. In March in was reported to the Vestry that the Estates Governors were not prepared to receive the Vestry's deputation, and further, that they had instructed their Solicitor to present a petition against the Metropolitan Board of Works' (Various Powers) Bill—which proposed, inter alia, to carry into effect the Governors first offer, as a gift, of the land for the park—with the view of amending the Bill so as to provide "for the sale of Dulwich College lands on terms to be agreed upon." The Board, however, notwithstanding the contradictory action of the governors, and the opposition of the Parish of St. Luke, introduced their Bill into Parliament, and it is earnestly to be hoped that—through the powerful support 113 given to it by the Metropolitan Board, aided by the exertions of Mr. E. Dresser Rogers, the Vestry's representative at the Board: by the valuable assistance of Mr. M. Wallace, Mr. G. C. Whiteley, Mr. J. Walter, and Mr. W. B. Hurst, and other members of the Vestry, and by the cordial co-operation of the Vestry of Lambeth,—the Parish may be congratulated on having acquired a Park for South London. On the 18th of February, on the motion of Mr. Alfred Watton, it was resolved:— "That in the interests of East Dulwich it is necessary that a fire Engine Station be provided, and that the Vestry do support such resolution by application to the Metropolitan Board of Works." The Board were, accordingly, strongly urged to comply with the Vestry's request, but they were compelled to reply, as on previous similar occasions, that—"without expressing an opinion whether or not it may be found necessary, at a future time, to establish a station at East Dulwich" —they were not, at present, in a position to increase the number of Fire Brigade Stations in the Metropolis. In 1883 their expenditure exceeded the statutory limit of income by £7,222 18s. 9d. and the Board had to ask Parliament to ratify their action in incurring this extra expenditure. At the same time the Board had before the House of Commons a Bill to repeal the restrictions in the Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act of 1869, (which limit the portion of the Consolidated Rate applicable for Fire Brigade working expenditure to one halfpenny in the pound on the gross annual value of the rateable property in the Metropolis,) and further, to enact that the Fire Insurance Companies should, in future, contribute 1 Fire Station at East Dulwich a sum equal to one-third of the amount drawn by the Hoard for the same purpose from the ratepayers. The Bill—strongly opposed by the Insurance Companies—was read a first time, but its progress was blocked all through the session, and eventually it had to be withdrawn, without the opportunity having occurred of even proposing the second reading. The result is that the Board is still in the anomalous position of having to expend upon the maintenance of the Fire Brigade more money than can be legally raised for the purpose. Under these circumstances the Vestry have probably to be well pleased that, during the past year, they have been enabled to obtain an instalment of their requirements by inducing the Board to provide telephonic communication between the Fire Brigade Station in Peckham Road, and the Police Station at East Dulwich. Metropolis Management Election (Ballot) Bill. Bills in Parliament.—On the 18th of March, the Vestry had under their consideration the Metropolis Management Elections (Ballot) Bill, the chief objects of which were to provide for the Election of Vestrymen, by a poll taken in the same manner as the poll at a Parliamentary Election, under the Ballot Act, 1872, subject to modification as follows:— (1) The Churchwardens are to provide Ballot Papers and appoint Ratepayers for taking the poll and counting the votes. (2) Every Candidate for the office of Vestryman or Auditor shall be nominated in writing. (3) The Churchwardens shall provide nomination papers. (4) The Churchwardens shall, on the day following the nomination, and at least four days before the day of Election, give public notice of the polling 115 place, &c.; and (5) The Churchwardens shall furnish every polling place with compartments, in which the voters can mark their votes. The Bill was held, by some local authorities, to be objectionable, as likely to lead to great expense, but the Vestry adopted a report of your Vestry Clerk pointing out that this Vestry now incurs the same expense without any attendant advantages. It is now the practice of the Churchwardens, on a poll being demanded, to have Ballot papers printed, and it is not compulsory to use such Ballot papers. It is also the custom to issue placards and notices of a poll having been demanded, and to have them circulated in the ward at great expense, but, owing to the election taking place at eight o'clock the next morning, they are not seen by the ratepayers, who are thus left in ignorance of a poll having been demanded. No compartments are provided, and the secrecy of the ballot is not effected. All these the Bill proposed to remedy, but the great improvement under it would be that time would be given to the ratepayers, after the nomination, before the poll takes place. With a slight amendment— fixing a limited time, within which the poll should be taken, instead of as proposed, specifying "at least four days";—it still appears that the Bill is a very advantageous one, and it is to be hoped it may ultimately become law. This Bill received the consideration and active support of the Vestry, It was promoted originally by the Lewisham District Board of Works, with the object of obtaining increased representation at the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the Vestries and Districts of Paddington, Camberwell, Kensington, Wandsworth, and Hackney, and separate 12 Metropolis Management Acts Amendment Bill. 116 tion for the Lewisham District Board. Subsequently the Bill was amended in the House of Commons, and now proposes to elect to the Board three representatives for the parishes of Saint Mary, Islington; Lambeth; St. Pancras; St. Mary Abbott, Kensington; and the Board of Works of Wandsworth; two iox the Vestries of Camberwell and Paddington, and the Board of Works of Greenwich, Hackney, and Poplar; and to give separate representation to the districts of Plumstead, and Lewisham, and Fulham, and Hammersmith. The Vestry fully concurred in the objects of the Bill, and endeavoured to induce the Metropolitan Board to take charge of it. In conjunction with the Lewisham Board, and the other Boards and Parishes interested a deputation of this Vestry waited upon Sir Charles Mills, M.P. and in compliance with the request of the deputation, Sir Charles Mills, and Viscount Lewisham, M.P. undertook to endorse the Bill, and introduce it into the House of Commons. I here is every possibility of the Bill becoming Law. Gas Lighting. Upon the motion of Mr. Watton a Committee was appointed to consider the subject of the Gas Lighting of the Parish "with regard to its possible improvement, and also as to applying the meter system to this Parish." The following were elected Members of the Committee:—Ward 1, Mr. J. Sugden, Mr. T. Teasdale; Ward 2, Mr. W. B. Hurst, Mr. G. H. Wrigglesworth; Ward 3, Mr. J. Duckett, Mr. A. Middlemass; Ward 4, Mr. C. D. Hayes, Mr. J. O.Wilson; Ward 5, Mr. W. H. Squire, Mr. F. Termor; Ward 6, Mr. A. Watton (Chairman), and Mr. J. Phillips. The Committee have held several meetings, but are not yet in a position to report to the Vestry the result of their investigations. 117 The Special Committee appointed by the Vestry in September, 1883, have continued during the past twelve months, "to watch over all questions relating to the water supply of the parish; to report from time to time to the Vestry, as to the sufficiency or otherwise, for domestic and fire extinguishing purposes, as well as regards the purity and price ; and generally to take such steps, and make such recommendations to the Vestry as the Committee may, in the interests of the Parishioners, deem needful." Last year they presented to the Vestry a full report of their proceedings to date ; this year they have again carried out the terms of their appointment by submitting at various times reports upon the progress of current legislation on the water question ; of the " constant supply " in this Parish ; and upon better supply for fire-extinguishing purposes. With regard to the last of these considerable correspondence was carried on with the Local Government Board, and their attention was drawn to Clauses XXXVII and XLII of the Waterworks' Clauses Act, 1847, which provide for a supply of water "constantly laid on" for the extinction of fires and for other public purposes. It is to be regretted that the Board held that they were not empowered to enforce these clauses for this purpose. Water Supply. Mr. Torrens' concise and effective Bill "to declare that the term 'annual value' in the 68th section of the Waterworks' Act, 1847, shall mean "rateable value" had the active support of the Committee. It is satisfactory to record that the petition presented by the Vestry, to the House of Commons, in support thereof was considered by Mr. Torrens, who presented it, to be of assistance to his object, and, 118 in acknowledging its receipt, he stated:— "I shall certainly ask to have it printed, and, though the circumstances of the Parish of St. Giles as regards water supply by different companies are peculiar, I think their publication, if we can obtain it as a Parliamentary document, will be of substantial use." The Bill is, at the date of this report, passing the House of Lords, and, there is little doubt, will safely pass into law. Mortuary. The special Committee "to consider the question of erecting a Mortuary in a central position of the parish, and to report as to the character of the building, and the probable cost thereof," reported last year that they had applied to the Bishop of Rochester for a faculty to enable St. George's Churchyard to be used as the site for the erection of the mortuary. They had also to report that they had been in communication with members of Parliament to obtain the insertion of a clause exempting mortuaries from the operation of the Disused Burials Ground Bill, then passing into law. Your Committee are now able to add that, on the 22nd of July last, the faculty was granted, there being no opposition. The Committee were also fortunate with reference to the Bill. Mr. Holland, M.P., who had charge of it, was applied to, to insert the exemption clause referred to, and while the Bill was passing through the House of Lords, the concession was made, and the Vestry were, therefore, left in a position to utilize, free of any expenses beyond those of building and foundations, the site originally selected at St. George's Churchyard. The Committee propose now to instruct the Surveyor to prepare working plans, sections, and elevations, for the erection of the mortuary. 119 Only once during the past year has the subject of the London Government Bill come under the notice of the Vestry. This was upon a motion "That this Vestry having considered the clauses of the London Government Bill, 1884, is of opinion that no efficient reform of the Municipal Government of the Metropolis can be accomplished unless due provision is made for the administration of the several Municipal Districts by duly-elected councils, whose duties shall be defined by the Legislature (in a much larger spirit than is disclosed by the clauses relating to District Councils in the present Bill), and acting in connection with a Federal Corporation having jurisdiction over all matters common to the whole Metropolis," and an amendment, "That this Vestry having considered the Bill, is of opinion that no scheme for the self-government of the Metropolis can be satisfactory which deprives the ratepayers of each district, of that direct control over the levying and expenditure of rates, at present exercised by them through their local representatives; and that the Vestry do oppose the Bill." After a protracted debate, the discussion was adjourned, at a late hour, from April 30th to May 5th, and again to May 9th. Both motion and amendment were then negatived, and the following was carried as a substantive motion: "That the Vestry of Camberwell views with satisfaction the introduction of a Bill, 'For the better Government of London, and other purposes connected therewith,' but would recommend that the number and duties of the District Councils should be defined, and those sections modified which seek to adopt the whole of the present members of the Metropolitan Board, as members of the first Council, without election." London Government Bill. 120 It was further decided to forward a copy of this resolution to the Home Secretary, with some remarks upon it to be drawn by a Committee consisting of the following members:—Messrs. Mulley, Squire, Strong, Ballantine, Honywill, Wallace, and Middlemass. Messrs. Teather, Simmons, Middlemass, Wesson, and Turney were also appointed as delegates to a conference on the subject, convened by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and consisting of representatives of the local authorities cf the metropolis. At this conference, a resolution was carried expressive of the opinion that the Bill, if carried out, would be prejudicial to the continued existence of local self-government. The Vestry may be reminded that the Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and read a first time on Wednesday April 8th. The motion for the second reading was not made until Thursday July 3rd, a date too late for it to be possible to carry the Bill through to a successful issue in that session of Parliament. Mr. Ritchie, one of the representatives of the Tower Hamlets, moved an adverse amendment, and a debate took place on the following Friday and Tuesday. On the last-mentioned day, the Government successfully resisted a motion for adjournment, and treating the result of the division as an expression of opinion favourable to the principle of the measure before the House subsequently consented to the adjournment of the debate, and two days afterwards, withdrew the Bill. Redistribution of Seats Act. During the session of this year, Her Majesty's Government introduced into Parliament a Bill 121 led " A Bill for the Redistribution of Seats at Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes." By this Bill it was provided that the Parish of Camberwell should be constituted into a Parliamentary Borough, returning three members,—one for each Division. The passing of this Bill is one of the most important epochs in the history of the Parish of Camberwell, and as the proceedings adopted by the Commissioners, and by the Vestry, may be read with interest in years to come, it is considered of so much importance as to justify a full and detailed chronicle of the different schemes for the division of the Parish into three Parliamentary Districts. To carry the Bill into effect, the Right Honorable Sir Charles Dilke, as President of the Local Government Board, appointed Boundary Commissioners, and issued " Instructions " to them, "that they should inquire as to the Division of the several Counties and Divisions of the Borough to be constituted or affected by the Bill." The Commissioners were directed that in every case where boundaries of the Borough were proposed to be altered, the alterations should if possible, be consistent with well-established limits, such as parochial or other similar boundaries; that all Boroughs shall be proximately equalised, and in the arrangement of the divisions special regard should be paid to the pursuits of the population, and that before the divisions of the Borough have been finally determined, the Commissioners shall advertise the scheme in the local newspaper, and, on a day appointed, hear objections to such scheme. It need hardly be said that this important Bill received the careful attention of the Vestry, and a Special Committee was appointed, consisting of the following 122 members of the three Standing Committees:—Messrs. Honywill, Thwaite, Teasdale, Evans, Smith, Hurst, Cook, Hyde, Jackson, Lumley, Thompson, Middlemass, Wesson, Foster, Linnell, Hazel, Teather, Randall, W. Lyon, J. A. Lyon, Dunn, Wilson, Hayes, Squire, E. C. Davis, Bonsall, Lewin, Dowton, Preston, Dixon, Phillips, Strong, Turney, Sears, Foskett, Wallace, Naylor, Bickerstaff, Borland, Lassam, Faulkner, Sugden, and Walter. Mr. A. Middlemass was elected Chairman. The Committee, in considering the reference, devoted much time to it, but their determination as to the best Scheme for division was much crippled by an intimation that had been given that all Divisions of Boroughs would be based on the census of the population of 1881, and that no Division must have less population than 50,000. The Committee, having regard to their instructions, found it difficult to make a just and fair division for the parish, especially considering the large area of No. 6, or Dulwich Ward, and the great increase of the population of that Ward since 1881, and the certainty of its still further increase. The Committee however finally submitted to the Vestry two Schemes, and the following is a copy of their Report:— THE REPORT of the Special Sub-Committee appointed by the three Standing Committees to consider a Scheme, under the Redistribution of Seats Bill, 1885, for the Division of the Borough of Camberwell into three Electoral Divisions. Your Committee beg to report that, on the8th inst., a letter, addressed personally to the Vestry Clerk, 123 was received by him—from Mr. Howell Thomas, Secretary to the Boundary Commission—stating that the Commissioners were desirous of obtaining such information as would enable them to divide the Borough of Camberwell in conformity with the provisions of the Redistribution of Seats Bill; and further asking to be furnished with a map shewing the boundaries of the Wards and Polling Districts into which the Parish has been divided for the election of Vestrymen. The Commission also asked to be furnished with a copy, as early as practicable, of any scheme for the division of the parish that the Vestry might prepare. Subsequently Major General Carey, R.E., a Commissioner, had interviews on the subject, at the Vestry Hall, with the Vestry Clerk and Assistant Vestry Clerk, and upon his request that all schemes to be considered by the Commission should be sent in not later than the 19th instant, the Vestry Clerk submitted to the three Standing Committees the letter of the Secretary to the Commission, together with the particulars of the Commissioner's interviews, and asked that a Special Committee should be formed by election from the three Standing Committees, to consider the details of the question, and to frame a scheme for the proper division of the Parish, to be submitted to a Special Meeting of the Vestry for their consideration. The Special Committee was accordingly formed, and consisted of twelve members of the General Purposes, twelve of the Sewers and Sanitary, and twelve of the Finance Committee. The Committee met on Thursday, the 15th instant, and, having elected to the Chair the Chairman of 124 the General Purposes Committee, proceeded to consider the question referred to them. The Scheme which had been suggested by the Commissioners, and which was as follows:— WARD. Proposed Title of Electoral Division. Population in 1881. l NORTH CAMBERWELL. 26,704 2 24,106 Part of 5 bounded High Street on the South. 8,353 59,163 4 PECKHAM. 33,461 5 (part of) 29,275 62,736 3 DULWICH. 21,668 6 43,026 64,694 was fully discussed, but your Committee came to the determination that, in dividing the Parish, it was not expedient to disturb the existing ward boundaries. The following Schemes were then submitted to the consideration of your Committee:— No. 1 SCHEME. WARD . Proposed Title of Electoral Division. Acreage. Population in 1881. Estimated population in 1884. 1 26,704 27,000 2 Camberwell 708 24,106 22,704 3 21,668 21,252 72.478 70,956 4 33,461 33,960 5 Pcckham 1,202 37,628 43,632 71,089 77,592 6 Dulwich 2,640 43,020 60,192 186,693 208,740 125 No. 2 SCHEME. Ward. Proposed Title of Electoral Division. Population in 1881.

Your Committee therefore adopted Scheme No. 1, and now recommend it to the Vestry to be submitted at once to the Commission with the proviso that— if rejected by the Commissioners as not in accordance with Section 3 of their " Instructions," which section states that, in dealing with the division of 126 boroughs, the boundaries must be adjusted so that the population in the Electoral Divisions may be " proximately equalised "—the Scheme No. 2 be suggested to the Commissioners as an Alternative Scheme. Your Committee having been furnished with maps and statistics, append for the further information of the Vestry, a schedule showing the population, rateable value, &c., of the parish in 1881, and the estimated population, householders, &c., at the present time. A short epitome of the Redistribution of Seats Bill, and of the Instructions of the President of the Local Government Board to the Commissioners is appended hereto for reference, together with the Scheme and the Alternative Scheme proposed by the Committee. All of which is submitted. (Signed), AND. MIDDLEMASS, Chairman. Dated this 16th day of January, 1885. TO THE ROYAL BOUNDARY COMMISSIONERS. The Vestry of Camberwell desire to submit the following Scheme and Alternative Scheme to the Commissioners—both of which schemes are based upon the principle of not dividing the present Municipal Wards which were established, 80 years ago for Municipal Purposes, under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. 127 No. 1 SCHEME. WARD Proposed Title of Electoral Division. Acreage. Population in 1881. Estimated population in 1884. 1 Camberwell 708 26,704 72,478 27,000 70,956 2 24,106 22,704 3 21,668 21,252 4 Peckham 1,202 33,461 71,089 33,960 77,592 5 37,628 43,632 6 Dulwich 2,540 43,026 60,192 186,593 208,740 It will be seen that this scheme provides for No. 6 (Camberwell and Dulwich Ward), constituting an Electoral Division, although the population of 1881 was only 43,026, but which has now risen to 60,192, and will probably continue to increase, in the same proportion, in years to come—while the rate of increase will be very much greater if a season of commercial prosperity set in, as that would immediately cause hundreds of empty houses to be occupied, and further building to be commenced with activity. No. 2 SCHEME. Ward. Proposed Title of Electoral Division. Population in 1881. Estimated Population in 1884. 2 Camberwell 24,106 57,567 22,704 4 33,461 33,960 56,664 1 Peckham 26,704 64,332 27,000 5 37,628 43,632 70,632 3 Dulwich 21,668 64,694 21,252 81,444 6 43,026 60,192 186,593 - 208,740 128 This scheme provides for the most equal possible division of the population of 1881. Numbers 1 & 5 Wards face each other for a considerable distance in Commercial Road; the character of the entire population in both wards presents the same proportion of middle class and working class, tradesmen, and artisans; and gives a total of population of 64,332. Wards 2 & 4 are exactly the same in their character, and are intersected through their whole length by so much of the Old Kent Road, as lies between St. George, Southwark, and St. Paul, Deptford. The characteristics of the population in both wards are the same, manufacturing and trading such as might be found in any provincial town of 50,000 or 60,000 inhabitants. The total population of these wards is 57,567. Wards 3 & 6 are to the largest extent residential, there being only a few manufactories in each ward, and a number of shops for the convenience of the large suburban population. Of these two wards the population is 64,694. Appended to the Report were Maps shewing the divisions in accordance with the alternative schemes, and also the following statistics:— 129 STATISTICAL INFORMATION AS TO THE PARISH OF CAMBERWELL.

(Signed), GEO. W. MARSDEN, Vestry Clerk 130 A Special Vestry was held on the 11th of January, to consider the Report and to pass such resolutions as might be deemed expedient, the Vestry after much deliberation finally adopted the recommendation contained in the Report, and they were sent to the Commissioners. Subsequently the Commissioners forwarded a Map shewing their proposed division of the borough, and the Special Committee again met and considered it. They requested their Chairman to support the foregoing Report of the Committee, as adopted by the Vestry, before the Commissioners. In accordance with the instructions of the Commissioners a public meeting was held at the Vestry Hall on the 26th of January, "to hear objections to the constitution of the several divisions of the proposed Borough of Camberwell." It was very numerously attended, and after much discussion and several schemes having been submitted, Major General Carey, R.E., the Assistant Commissioner, promised that all the proposed schemes should be submitted to the Commissioners for their careful consideration. The Commissioners determined that the Divisions of the Borough should be based upon a partition of Wards 3 and 5. That portion of No. 3 Ward West of Southampton Street, and South of New Church Road, and Southampton Street, and including the portion South of Camberwell New Road, should be included in the Dulwich Division; the section of No. 5 Ward, from Southampton Street down to Hill Street, and inclusive of the West side of Hill Street to the Canal, and the East side of Commercial Road to, and including, the East side of Southampton Street, should be included in the North 131 Camberwell Division. These arrangements, it will be seen, were subsequently altered by the action of Parliament. On the passing of the Bill through Parliament the Vestry were surprised to find that Mr. Grantham —with the approval of Sir Charles Dilke—had given notice of amendment to add the Hamlet of Penge to the Dulwich Division, and the following letter was received from the Secretary to the Commission : Boundary Commission, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 30th March, 1885. Dear Sir, The subject of the alteration of the divisions of Camberwell consequent on the addition of Penge to that Borough is under consideration. 1 may, however, point out that Mr. Grantham, M.P. proposes to move in Committee on the Redistribution Bill an amendment which, if carried, would divide the Borough as follows : NORTH DIVISION. Population. St. George's West Ward 26,704 72,478 St. George's East Ward 24,106 Camden Ward 21,668 PECKHAM DIVISION. North Peckham Ward 33,461 71,089 South Peckham Ward 37,628 DULWICH DIVISION. Camberwell and Dulwich Ward 43,026 61,676 Hamlet of Penge 18,650 Total 205,243 Sir John Lambert would be glad to be informed of the views of the Vestry as to the proposed k 2 132 divisions before he submits his opinion on the matter to Sir Charles Dilke. Yours faithfully, HOWEL THOMAS. G. W. Marsden, Esq. The Special Committee, to whom the matter had been referred, met to consider this new phase of the question, and made the following report thereon : THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE RE-DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS BILL, 1885 Wednesday, April 1st, 1885. "Your Committee beg to report that, in consequence of an amendment—moved by Mr. Grantham M.P.— having been carried in Committee of the House of Commons,—by which amendment it was resolved to add the Hamlet of Penge to the proposed new Borough of Camberwell,—your Committee met, and fully considered such alteration. " Your Committee had submitted to them statistics, and plans showing the addition of the Hamlet of Penge, and a letter, from the Secretary to the Boundary Commission, received in reply to the request of the Vestry Clerk, for information as to what course the Commissioners intended to pursue in view of the action of the Committee of the House. " Your Committee, after considerable discussion, decided to recommend the Vestry strongly to object to the Hamlet of Penge being added to the proposed Borough of Camberwell, and to further recommend that a Petition should be presented to the House of Commons in support of the views of the Vestry. In 133 the event of the House adhering to the amendment, carried in Committee, your Committee consider that the Vestry should prefer a claim for the Borough of Camberwell to be represented by four, instead of three, Members of Parliament." "Your Committee suggest that the following should be the 'heads' of the Petition to be presented to Parliament:— (i) That the Vestry learn, with deep regret, that it has been resolved, by a Committee of the House of Commons, to add Penge to the new Borough of Camberwell. (ii) That, at the Census of 1881, the population of Penge was 18,650, of Lewisham 41,424, and of Camberwell 186,593. (iii) That by taking away Penge, the population of Lewisham would be 41,424—a number less than that usually adopted in dividing Boroughs. (iv) The addition of Penge would increase the population of the Borough of Camberwell to 205,243, and would render a further division by the Boundary Commissioners necessary. (v) The Vestry objected to the addition of Penge before the Commissioners divided the Borough. (vi) No adequate reasons have been urged for the alteration. (vii) The division to which Penge is to be added will be more than 5½ miles long—longer than the whole Borough as divided by the Commissioners. (viii) It is opposed to the principle of the Bill to mark out so large a district for an electoral division. 134 (ix) The district—with Penge added—would be as large in area as some of the divisions of the Counties. (x) The divisions settled by the Commissioners, were generally approved. (xi) Penge has never been associated with Camberwell for any municipal, parochial, or official purposes. (xii) If Penge were added the total population of the Borough would be 205,243, or sufficient to entitle it to four Members. (xiii) Having regard to the enormous increase of population since 1881, and the further probable increase at the rate of over 20,000 per annum, the claim for a fourth Member is respectfully urged. " The Prayer of the Petition, your Committee suggest, should ask:— (i) That Penge be not added. (ii) That if the House approve of the amendment of the Committee, a fourth Member be given to Camberwell. "Your Committee further recommend that the Petition, as settled by a Parliamentary Counsel, should be sealed at the meeting of the Vestry on Easter Tuesday next; and that the Members for the Borough of Lambeth should be requested to present, and support it. " All of which is submitted. " (Signed) A. MIDDLEMASS, Chairman The Vestry adopted the recommendation of the Report, and a petition was settled by Mr. Leonard 135 Bristowe—with the assistance of statistics provided by your Medical Officer. The seal of the Vestry was affixed to it, and it was presented to the House of Commons by Sir William McArthur, M.P. The information contained in the Petition will be of such interest to the parishioners that it is reprinted here:— To the Honorable the Commons of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled. The HUMBLE PETITION of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, in the County of Surrey, under their common seal. SHEWETH, THAT your Petitioners have learnt with regret that the Committee of this Honorable House, on the Parliamentary Elections (Redistribution) Bill, has been pleased to agree to an amendment to insert in Schedule 4, line 11, of the said Bill "and the Hamlet of Penge," the effect whereof will be to take the said Hamlet of Penge from the Borough of Lewisham as originally constituted by the said Bill, and to add it to that of Camberwell which as originally constituted by the said Bill included only your petitioners' Parish. THAT your petitioners humbly submit that no adequate grounds either of necessity or expediency has been shown for the said amendment. THAT your petitioners respectfully submit that such amendment is open to (amongst others) the following objections, that is to say :— 1. The Hamlet of Penge is included in the district of the Lewisham District Board of 136 Works, and has never been associated with your petitioners' Parish for any purposes, municipal, parochial, or official, and is, moreover, naturally separated therefrom by a range of hills, the Hamlet of Penge commencing on the south eastern slope thereof, and your petitioners' Parish on the north western. 2. There is a strong feeling among the inhabitants of your petitioners' Parish adverse to the said amendment. 3. Your petitioners' Parish, together with the Hamlet of Penge, would form a Borough of unwieldy size and rambling and inconvenient shape, and there is no direct means of communication by railway or otherwise between your petitioners' Parish and the said Hamlet of Penge. 4. The Boundary Commissioners appointed for the purposes of the said Bill, have completed their labours in respect of the division of your petitioners' Parish, and your petitioners have pleasure in stating that the result of such labours has met with general approval among the inhabitants of the said Parish, but the said amendment will render the said labours futile, and necessitate their being performed afresh. THAT your petitioners respectfully submit that the principle which is being adopted in respect of the assignment of boundaries of the Boroughs to be constituted or affected by the said Bill is plainly set forth in the instructions issued to the Boundary Commissioners and signed by the Right Honorable 137 the President of the Local Government Board, " that in every case where the boundaries of a " Borough are proposed to be altered, whether by " extension or otherwise, the alteration should if " possible be consistent with well established limits, " such as parochial or other similar boundaries," and that the said amendment is not in accordance therewith. THAT if the Hamlet of Penge should be included in the Borough of Camberwell, and the Boundary Commissioners should (as having regard to the disposition of the population is probable) be of opinion that the said Hamlet of Penge should be added to the division of your petitioners' Parish (as already proposed by them as aforesaid), consisting of the Camberwell and Dulwich Wards, the division so constituted would be five and a half miles in length (being more than the total length of your petitioners' Parish), and as large in area as some of the divisions of counties, and your petitioners submit that it is contrary to the principle which this Honorable House has adopted that so large a district should be constituted an Electoral Division of a Borough. THAT if the Hamlet of Penge be added to your petitioners' Parish, the total population of the Borough of Camberwell so constituted, will according to the census of 1881 be 205,243, and your petitioners humbly submit that the said Borough ought in that case to return four representatives to this Honourable House, and THAT your Petitioners desire respectfully to bring before the attention of this Honorable House, the great and exceptional increase of population 138 which has been and is still taking place in your petitioners' Parish. The population of the said Parish according to the census returns was in 1851, 54,667; in 1861, 71,488; in 1871, 111,302; and in 1881, 186,593. It appears from the Annual Report of Doctor J. S. Bristowe, F.R.S., the Medical Officer of Health for your petitioners' Parish, that the estimated population at June 1882, was 199,116; and at June 1883, 209,674; and the said Medical Officer states that the estimated population at June 1884, was 220,793, and that in his opinion the rate of increase shown by the figures aforesaid will probably be maintained for many years to come, and that in 1891 the population will in all probability amount to fully 312,815. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the words " and the Hamlet of Penge" may not be inserted in Schedule 4, line 11, of the said Parliamentary Elections (Redistribution) Bill, and that the Borough of Camberwell as constituted thereby may not include the said Hamlet of Penge and that the amendment so agreed to as aforesaid by the Committee of this Honorable House may be reconsidered accordingly, or in the alternative that the Borough of Camberwell may return four members of Parliament instead of three as provided by the said Bill, or that such steps may be taken in respect of the premises as to this Honorable House shall seem meet. and your petitioners will ever pray, &c. The amendment of Mr. Grantham was accepted, but, on the report being brought up in the House of Commons, Mr. Edward Clarke, Q.C., M.P., moved 139 the omission of Penge, and supported it in an able speech. It was, however resolved to add Penge, for parliamentary purposes,to the Borough of Camberwell, in the Dulwich Division, and it was further decided to call the divisions North Camberwell, Peckham and Dulwich respectively, and in this shape the Bill was passed by the House of Lords, and received the Royal Assent. The Parish of Camberwell (with Penge) by the operation of this important Statute is, therefore, for the future, entitled to three representatives in the House of Commons. Many other matters of importance which have, during the past year, received the attention of the Vestry, are more particularly detailed in the reports of the Surveyor and Medical Officer. General. I have now to report with sorrow the death of Mr. W. R. Hillier, whose services to the Parish, as one of the Auditors of the accounts of the Vestry, have on several occasions, been recognized by the Vestry. Death of Mr. W. R. Hillier. Joseph Edwards, who has been in the service of the Vestry since its formation in 1856, and, previously to that, in the service of the Parish for many years, died after a long and painful illness, on the 13th of November last, to the great regret of the past and present members of the Vestry, whose respect he had commanded by his long and faithful service.

Vestry Hall, Camberwell, S.E. July 7th, 1885. Gentlemen, We have to report that we have duly audited and examined the accounts of the Parish, in accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, from the 26th March, 1884, to the 25th March, 1885, both dates inclusive, and we find the same to be correct. The satisfactory manner in which the several books and vouchers have been kept redounds to the credit of the individual officers who have charge of the same, amongst whom we would like to mention, Mr. Rees, Mr. Lord, and Mr. Pitfield, and we have pleasure in testifying to the readiness and uniform courtesy shewn us at all times. It is with regret that we find that our previous remarks in our reports from time to time as to the arrears of rates have apparently been overlooked, we cannot too strongly urge upon the Vestry this question, various suggestions have been made, and your Auditors venture to hope that the matter may now receive proper consideration at the hands of the Vestry. Your Auditors are of opinion that a. great check will be obtained, and a saving effected by way of security, and in the stamps used, if four receipts are issued in the future, instead of two as at present, i.e., poor and general receipts to be separated. 186 We much regret the loss of our late respected colleague, Mr. Hillier, who died during the Audit, he was most assiduous in his attention to his duties.
