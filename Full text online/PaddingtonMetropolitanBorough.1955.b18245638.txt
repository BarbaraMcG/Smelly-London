Vital Statistics There has been no marked variation in the birth rate (17.44), death rate (10.75), or infantile mortality rate (25) to which I need draw your attention. Infectious Diseases It is satisfactory to note that in the ten years 1945 to 1955, the incidence rate of tuberculosis has fallen from 2.5 to 1.6, whilst the death rate has fallen from 0.68 to 0.14. It may be confidently anticipated that both rates may be still further reduced in the next few years with the extension of the B.C.G. immunisation scheme for school leavers, recently commenced by the London County Council. Meantime, the importance of periodic Mass X-ray examination in the older age groups cannot be over emphasised, for the country as a whole shows that some 75 per cent, of the deaths from tuberculosis occur in those over 45 years of age. There was a great increase in the incidence of measles (1956 cases in 1955 cf. 55 in 1954), but the disease fortunately was of a mild form. There was an increase in the incidence of poliomyelitis (26 cases in 1955 cf. 7 in 1954). Although the incidence of this dread disease in Paddington was considerably less than in boroughs immediately adjoining, it nevertheless occasioned us considerable concern. It can only be hoped that the immunisation campaign (which is due to commence next year) will, when sufficient supplies of vaccine become available, lead to the eradication of this scourge, as has already happened with diphtheria. A case of typhoid fever notified to the department illustrates the value of our detailed routine enquiries in protecting the general public from the spread of infection. The patient had been admitted to hospital and diagnosed as suffering from typhoid fever. Enquiries at his home address revealed that the household comprised the patient's wife and child, a cousin and his wife and child, and an adult niece (i.e. 5 adults and 2 children). With the exception of the patient's wife (who had been admitted to the Maternity Ward, Charing Cross Hospital) all members of the household submitted specimens which were found to be negative. However, it was found that the wife had suffered from typhoid fever in Africa about four years ago. Accordingly, Charing Cross Hospital were asked to carry out routine tests, and these disclosed that the wife was a carrier and the probable source of her husband's infection. The maternity ward was closed and appropriate action taken, including the treatment of the carrier by the general practitioner. The cousin, employed as a dining car attendant, was excluded from work and after consultation with the Medical Officer of British Railways, assigned to a non-food handling job. 4 Deaths from " Other Accidents" The death returns reveal that no less than 37 Paddington residents met their death during the year from " Other Accidents," as compared with 10 deaths from motor vehicle accidents and 28 from suicide. An analysis of these other accidents show that 6 deaths were as a result of accidental coal gas poisoning, 7 from accidental drowning, and 3 through clothing catching fire. Of the 37 residents, no less than 12 were over 70 years of age, and none was under five years of age. It is well that attention is now being paid to " Safety in the Home." Our own figures underline the extent to which the aged are affected, and in particular the dangers associated with the gas fire which is now a common feature in many homes. There are, of course, more deaths from accidents in the home than from accidents in the road. Furthermore, it is estimated that medical treatment for victims of home accidents costs the country some £5,000,000 a year. The Sanitary Inspectors and Health Visitors, and the officers and visitors from other associations and voluntary bodies all without doubt contribute their assistance and advice at home visits. There is, however, room for more concentrated efforts in this direction, and publicity by posters, through the press, television, wireless, etc. should continue unabated; and for the aged, a simply worded leaflet (provided at the post office for distribution when pensions are paid) would, I am confident, prove of immense value. Elderly People In my last report I referred to the inauguration of a laundry scheme for the elderly incontinent, and also to a service for the cleansing and bathing of old people in their homes. Both of these facilities have been gratefully appreciated by all concerned, but unfortunately the necessary extension is impossible without an increase in the staff of the department. The closest co-operation of this department continues, both with the Old Peoples Welfare Committee and with the Health Visitors and the Domestic Help Service of the London County Council. This is particularly important in order that the limited number of geriatric beds available in the hospitals should be put to the best use. An urgent need is the provision of appropriate homes for the elderly for those not requiring hospital treatment, and yet incapable of looking after themselves in their own homes. Food and Drugs Act, 1955 and Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 During the year the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 was enacted, and will come into operation on 1st January, 1956. The Food Hygiene Regulations made thereunder where provisions involve alterations to premises and equipment or substantial changes in established trade practices will not be enforceable until 1st July, 1956. Basement Rooms It will be noticed that during the year only 35 basement rooms were closed for human habitation as compared with 233 in 1953. The policy of the Committee since 1954 has been to close only 5 unoccupied basements. In addition, having regard to the extreme paucity of housing accommodation which still exists in this Borough, the Sanitary Inspectors have spent much time in persuading owners to perform minimal works, which although not necessarily resulting in the basement rooms conforming to the Underground Room Regulations, has nevertheless resulted in basement rooms (which would otherwise have been closed) providing reasonable accommodation for the next few years, by which time it is hoped the pressure on housing accommodation in the Borough may have decreased. Also, during the year under review, closing orders were rescinded on 30 basement rooms as a result of works completed to the satisfaction of the Council. Hairdressers and Barbers In accordance with Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, as from 1st January, 1956 the Borough Council will be responsible for the registration and subsequent inspection of hairdressing establishments in the Borough. Reference will be made to this work in my next report. Staff Dr. Mary Lawson who was appointed part-time Deputy Medical Officer of Health on the 16th April, 1952, resigned her appointment on the 30th November, 1955, and was succeeded by Dr. H. S. M. Hadaway, who is also on the medical staff of the London County Council. During the year the opportunity was taken to review the administrative work of the Department. As a result of re-organisation of duties it was found possible not to fill vacancies which had arisen by resignations, etc., and four posts have thereby been deleted from the clerical establishment. Although several advertisements have been issued, unfortunately the Sanitary Inspectors are still three below establishment. This necessarily has had its consequential repercussions on the work of the Department. In conclusion may I express my gratitude for the help and co-operation I have received from the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ??? Medical Officer of Health. 6 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (at 31st December, 1955).— Mrs. E. G. Lane (Chairman) Mrs. H.

These powers have now been included in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 (Section 18). Furthermore, bye-laws prepared for the sake of uniformity in the Metropolitan area by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee— after consultations with representatives of the National Federation of Hairdressers and the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers, Wigmakers and Perfumers—and approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, were adopted by the Council on the 21st July, 1955; as also were the forms of application and certificates of registration. The appointed day for the registration of premises was fixed by the Council to be the 1st January, 1956, after the necessary notice had been given in the local Press. There are 83 hairdressers and barbers establishments in the borough and arrangements are being made for registration and subsequent inspection. MEDICINAL BATHS and DISINFECTING STATION.—The tables below give a summary of the work done at the Medicinal Baths, and by the Disinfecting and Fumigation Operatives.

ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.—In 1953 a recording apparatus was installed at the Welfare Centre, 283a Harrow Road, in connection with the measurement of atmospheric pollution. The results obtained during 1955 are set out below. Month Rainfall in mms. Insoluble deposits in tons per square mile Soluble deposits in tons per square mile S. 0, in mgs. per day per 100 square cms. January 55(22) 12.21(8.93) 15.34(10.61) 5.73(4.38) February 33(51) 8.18(12.62) 11.77(11.88) 4.91(4.26) March 24(48) 11.10(12.21) 9.42(9.73) 5.75(2.97) April 8(4) 7.38(6 46) 4.02(4.53) 2.75(2.04) May 11345) 8.75(11.91) 14.43(5.71) 1.66(1.87) June 48(88) 9.26(6.61) 6.68(11.28) 1.73(1.01) July —(09) 0.38(0.84) 5.20(13.00) 1.14(0.98) August 18(85) 7.28(7.58) 7.04(10.81) 1.35(1.23) September 48(38) 8.22(0.07) 7.88(6.38) 1.87(1.05) October 65(50) 8.73(7.48) 18.23(9.53) 2.92(1.81) November 10(88) 10.81(10.07) 4.80(15.70) 4.75(3.49) December 51(43) 12.86(7.05) 9.83(12.05) 4.25(1.94) Smoke Nuisance.—This nuisance is, more than ever, receiving the close attention of your Sanitary Inspectors. During the year five complaints were received and as a result of the vigilance of the Inspectors remedial action has resulted in these and other instances. Experience has shown that the larger firms and institutions are willing to co-operate to abate this nuisance immediately their attention has been directed thereto, but in some cases the age of the plant is a stumbling block to a satisfactory remedy. Stoking is, of course, an important factor, and the firms are advised on this as also are their employees. Unfortunately, in many instances, there is no continuity of skilled labour, which makes it extremely difficult to obtain the best results. At the present time a Clean Air Bill is under discussion, and it is hoped that, as and when, this comes on the Statute Book the provisions included therein will considerably assist Local Authorities in their endeavours to obtain "clean air" in their respective areas. In the interim, this Council, in conjunction with St. Marylebone, Hampstead and St. Pancras, approached the British Transport Commission to accelerate their plans for modernisation of the motive power on the main lines approaching London. The Commission expressed their willingness to do all in their power to reduce smoke nuisance from steam engines to a minimum and to bear the Councils' views in mind when consideration is given to the gradual change over from steam to diesel traction. FACTORIES.—Following is a table showing the work carried out during the year under the Factories Act, 1937. 16 Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written notices Occupiers prosecuted (i) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 0 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 85(76) 95(56) 2(2) —(—) (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 474(543) 731(607) 14(12) —(—) (iii) Other Premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding out—workers' premises) 8(12) 9(7) —(—) —(—) Total 567 (631) 835(670) 16(14) —(—) 17 Particulars of Defects Number of cases in which defects were found Number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted Found Remedied Referred To H.M.

SHOPS ACTS.—The Shops Acts Inspectors made 1,590(1,686) inspections during the year. No statutory action was necessary, any contraventions found being dealt with informally. PET ANIMALS ACT.—Six (7) licences were applied for and granted during the year. Routine inspections are made to ensure that the conditions attaching to the licences are being maintained. BURIALS.—During the year 45(26) burials and —(6) cremations were arranged under the National Assistance Act, 1948. MORTUARY.—The number of bodies received at the mortuary was 379 (392) and 319 (343) post mortem examinations were made there. CANAL BOATS.—During the year the Paddington Basin and its vicinity was visited on 20(40) occasions and 7(36) boats were inspected. It was not found necessary to serve any formal notices. No (one) child of school age was found to be living on the boats inspected. RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. It relates to the year ended 31st March, 1956, at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. 21 Dwelling Houses All other Property Total Total number of properties in district 24,686(24,255) 4,737(4,686) 29,422(28,941) Number of properties inspected as a result of— (a) Notifications 528(295) 101(105) 629(400) (b) Otherwise 156(405) 36(85) 192(490) Number of properties found to be infested by rats— (а) Major infestation 1(2) —(4) 1(6) (b) Minor infestation 210(191) 50(41) 260(232) Number of properties found to be infested by mice 234(177) 48(42) 282(219) Number of infested properties treated by Council 440(370) 97(86) 537(456) It was not found necessary to serve any notices. Four (5) "block control" schemes were carried out. The sewers in the Borough received two treatments, in January and June. PIGEONS.—Four (3) complaints were received. The complainants were advised on preventive measures by the Sanitary Inspector or referred to the pigeon catcher authorised to operate in the Borough. RAG FLOCK ACT.—Four (5) premises where filling material was being used were on the register at the end of the year. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock is manufactured or stored. Seven (5) samples were taken, all of which were satisfactory. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACTS.—At the end of the year the Register contained the names of 115(115) persons entitled to sell the poisons scheduled in Part II of the Poisons List. DRAINAGE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.—During the year 225(228) plans were deposited for drainage work in existing buildings. Prosecutions are reported under "Legal proceedings." COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—There is one common lodging house in the Borough—a Cecil House—which provides sixty-six beds for women. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and has been satisfactory. Two (—) water supply certificates were issued under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954.—The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 came into operation on the 30th August, 1954. In accordance with the requirements of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the figures below relate to the year ending 31st March, 1956. 22 Dwelling houses which have been the subject of a notice under Part II of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 Dwelling houses which have been the subject of a notice under the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920 No. of applications for certificates 20(95) 6(6) No. granted 13(71) 4(5) No. refused 7(24) 2(1) No. of applications for revocations of certificates 25(13) —(—) No. granted 21(11) —(—) No. refused 4(2) —(—) The effect of the repeal of the bye-laws made under Section 6 of the Housing Act, 1936, and the use of Section 11 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, has been kept constantly under review. As will be recalled, already the bye-law requiring lighting of common staircases is being resuscitated in a London County Council (General Powers) Bill because of the general demand for its re-introduction as a necessary measure to enforce such a provision where necessary. The need for certain of the other provisions covered by the bye-laws which cannot as effectively be required under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 is increasingly making itself felt, and this whole question is being closely investigated so as to ensure that every possible legislative assistance is possessed by your officers to maintain in a reasonably fit condition houses which are let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. BAKEHOUSES.—At the end of the year there were 16 (19) "level" bakehouses and 2(4) "underground" bakehouses in operation. There are also two underground and one level bakehouses which are not at present being used. During the year 145(219) inspections were made. One prosecution regarding cleanliness is reported under "Legal Proceedings." ACCUMULATION OF RUBBISH.—This problem is one which is constantly confronting the Sanitary Inspectors on their districts. Complaints of unsightly conditions due to the deposit of rubbish on vacant land adjoining houses are frequent, and although in most instances no public health nuisance arises it has been possible to get the owners to co-operate and remove the offending debris. This is, of course, a recurring problem, inasmuch as soon as clearance is effected further deposits are made. In many cases steps are taken by the owner to prevent a recurrence by erecting a fence. Even this does not always solve the difficulty entirely but only hides the unsightly rubbish from the passer-by and maybe in time become a harbourage for rats, or alternatively, due to putrefaction, become a health nuisance. 23 Another problem which arises occasionally is the accumulation over a period of years of rubbish in rooms to such an extent as to constitute a public health nuisance. One example of this kind was discovered, following a complaint, in the ground and first floor rooms of a house. Removal was beyond the powers of the tenants as no less than eleven tons of rubbish had to be taken away. Subsequently, the tenants were instructed to have the rooms cleansed. The cost of the removal of the rubbish was charged to the tenants. In this and other similar cases I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Cleansing Department, whose co-operation made the solution of the problem possible. AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS.—There were 159(129) current cases on the records of the Department at the end of the year. One hundred (72) cases were brought to notice during 1955. The women visitors made 1,302(1,622) visits and the male inspectors 66(48) visits during the year. Holiday Home.—During the year 962(979) applications for holidays were received and 654(642) guests were accommodated. Two hundred and forty-six applicants refused the holiday offered (mainly on account of illness or because the dates allocated were too early or too late). In the remaining 62 cases no allocation was made due to death, removal from the Borough, unfitness, or to single rooms or specified dates not being available. Home bathing.—This work is done by the female attendant from the Medicinal Baths and 359(406) baths were given. The figures given here will indicate that within the limits of our resources this service is providing a real need to those who through age or infirmity are unable to fend for themselves. There are isolated difficult cases met with, where the need for personal washing at home is not looked upon favourably by the person concerned, but generally speaking Mrs. Hurley, who carries out this service, is a welcome visitor. Laundry service.—This service continues to justify itself and the District Nursing Association and our Visitors find this facility of considerable help in their efforts to ease the burden of age and infirmity. The number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year was nine (eight). Ten (eleven) people received help from this service during the year. National Assistance Acts, 1948-1951.—The need for speedier action in certain circumstances which could be effected by the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, if so authorised by the Council, provided that the proposed action is supported by another registered practitioner, was felt to be desirable. This aspect was considered by the Public Health Committee and as a result of their recommendation the Council have authorised me to exercise the powers with regard to the removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention prescribed by Section 1 of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. As in the past, the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Committee will be consulted before acting on the authority delegated to me. It was not found necessary to apply to the Courts for a compulsory removal order during 1955. 24 Women's Voluntary Services.—The many and varied activities of the Paddington Women's Voluntary Services are well known, but space will not allow me to cover all of them in this report. However, it is of special interest to record that there are five Darby and Joan Clubs, as follows : Beauchamp Lodge, 2, Warwick Crescent; Methodist Church Hall, Fernhead Road; St. James Church Hall, Sussex Gardens; St. Johns Church Hall, Kilburn Lane; and St. Saviours Church Hall, Warwick Avenue. One Handicraft Club is held at 5, Praed Street, and during the year 2,611 house-bound old people received meals on wheels in addition to 1,117 meals served in the lunch club also at 5, Praed Street. Chiropody.—Four sessions a week are held by the Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee for the aged to attend at the following clinic: Mrs. Baird, 3, Malvern Road, and, where necessary, home visits are arranged. Salvation Army.—The Salvation Army continued their good work. They co-operated with twenty cases in need of immediate help during the year and in each case went along with buckets and brooms and cleaned the rooms and bathed the old people concerned. At their lunch club, 5,824 dinners were cooked and served, and 1,248 delivered to the house-bound. FOOD SUPERVISION.— Unsound food.—Approximately 13½ (11½) tons of diseased or unsound food were surrendered for destruction. Diseased meat is incinerated, other condemned food being disposed of through the normal refuse channels. Bacteriological examinations.—The samples of milk submitted, 100(147) were all satisfactory. Samples of ice cream examined for bacterial content were graded as follows:— Grade 1—10(8): Grade 2—9(5): Grade 3—6(2): Grade 4—8(1). Registrations.—The following registrations were in force at the end of the year under the Milk and Dairies Regulations or the Food and Drugs Acts:— Distributors of milk 124(117) Dairies —(—) Ice cream premises 198(206) Food premises 75(75) Licences.—Licences to sell designated milk in force at the end of the year are given below:— Dealers' principal licences Pasteurised 90(84) Sterilised 123(121) Tuberculin tested 67(62) Dealers' supplementary licences Pasteurised 24(20) Sterilised 28(22) Tuberculin tested 24(20) Food premises.—Following are details of the food premises in the Borough at the end of the year. 25 Food Shops:— Bakers 20(21) Cake shops 23(22) Butchers 61(60) Confectioners 145(112) Chemists 48(51) Fishmongers 22(21) Fried fish shops 11(12) Grocers 45(40) General shops 41(41) Provision stores 123(123) Horsemeat shops 2(2) Domestic stores 20(17) Corn chandlers 2(2) Greengrocers 86(93) Public Houses 106(105) Cider Houses 2(2) Off Licences 57(57) Cafes, restaurants, etc. 137(141) Food Factories:—There are 9(10) food factories in the Borough including 2(2) ice cream factories. Animal Food Dealers:—There is one cats' meat shop in the Borough. Last year there were two. Street Traders:—Coffee stalls 6(6), Fruit and vegetable stalls 28(31), Ice cream stalls 2(2). Inspections.—During the year the two Food Inspectors paid 720(802) visits to restaurants and cafes and 5,402(6,004) visits to other food shops. Sampling.—During the year 600(600) samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. All except one informal sample of beef sausages were reported to be genuine. The wrapper gave no notice that the sausages contained preservative and the amount of preservative was slightly in excess of the legal maximum. Subsequent samples of these sausages were reported to be genuine. HEALTH EDUCATION.—Good use was again made of the posters and pamphlets issued by the Central Council for Health Education, to whom the Council make a grant of ten guineas, particularly those which dealt with Clean Food and Accidents in the Home. Clean Food.—The number of visits paid by the Food Inspectors shown under "Food Supervision" indicates the constant personal contacts made, which are so valuable in maintaining and, where possible, improving the standard of food hygiene. Accidents in the Home.—As has been the practice in previous years, assistance was given to the London County Council in their intensive campaign for the prevention of accidents in the home during the week commencing 14th November by the display of posters and distribution of leaflets on safeguards to be taken which would avoid the causes of so many fatalities, especially to the infant and aged members of the community. I have, however, dealt with this vexed problem more extensively in my introductory letter. Smallpox Vaccination and Diphtheria Immunisation.—The London County Council deal with both these vital preventive measures through the medium of their health visitors. Every co-operation is extended to the London County Council in any publicity undertaken by them. 26 Venereal Disease.—As the Council are no doubt aware, notices giving the facilities available for treatment are permanently exhibited, and additional publicity is given to this subject when requested by the London County Council. HOUSING.— Housing Act, 1936—Overcrowding. (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 297(288) (2) Number of families dwelling therein 302(296) (3) Number of persons dwelling therein 1,236½(1,217½) (Units) (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 100(93) (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 91(132) (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases 375½(522) (Units) (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling- houses have again become overcrowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding NIL The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1955(297) shows an increase of 9 on the figure for 1954(288). Some 100 of these were basement dwellings. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 12(11) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 16(54) were re-housed by the London County Council, 36(39) secured accommodation privately, 23(23) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation, and 4(5) families were re-housed under the Industrial Selection Scheme for New Towns. The practice of sending warning letters to owners and landlords against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding of premises has been abated. Section 61 of the Housing Act, 1936 gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year, the Council issued nine licences under this section of the Act. During the year, a total of 292 families from Paddington were re-housed on London County Council Estates or provided with accommodation in New Towns under the Industrial Selection Scheme. Housing Act, 1949—Improvements and Conversions. Nineteen (fifteen) applications for grants in respect of proposed improvement or conversion of properties were referred to the Department for examination and report. The preparation of these 27 reports involves consultation between the Sanitary Inspectors and other technical officers of the Council as well as interviews on the premises with the architects and owners concerned. Town Planning. Two hundred and eight (ninety-eight) applications to the London County Council under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, for the conversion and altering of premises, change of user and continuation of consent were referred to the Council for examination and comment. As a result of the Council's observations permission was refused for certain basement rooms to be used for human habitation where the rooms did not conform to the statutes and regulations in force in the Borough. Housing Accommodation: Preferential Treatment. During the year 490(659) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for "pointing." This arrangement enables the necessary degree of preference to be given to each certificate as well as bringing to notice sanitary defects which might otherwise have escaped detection and in respect of which no previous complaint has been received. Immigrants from Cyprus and Malta. The Governments of Cyprus and Malta continue to co-operate with the Council in ascertaining the suitability of accommodation offered to would-be immigrants by relatives and friends living in the Borough. In each case a visit is made by the Sanitary Inspector to the premises, and the Government concerned advised as to the adequacy and permanency of the proposed accommodation. This arrangement avoids overcrowding of premises and ensures that the immigrants are adequately housed. Land Charges Act, 1925. Under the above-mentioned Act it is incumbent on the local authority to keep a register of local land charges. Houses included in clearance, improvement and redevelopment areas must be registered, as well as houses subject to repair notices under Part II of the Housing Act, 1936, and houses on which closing or demolition orders have been made. Some 1,514(1,372) inquiries were referred to the Public Health Department during the year asking for details of notices outstanding and orders in operation under the Housing Act. At the same time particulars were called for of sanitary or other notices outstanding on the properties concerned. Housing Enquiries. Some 350(600) communications were received during the year from the Borough Director of Housing, the County Divisional Medical Officer, the County Director of Housing, and from other authorities, requesting information on the housing conditions of persons applying for re-housing on grounds of overcrowding, insanitary conditions and ill-health. Such information enables the enquirer to assess the degree of priority to be given to the applicants concerned. In each case a visit was made by the Sanitary Inspector and a report furnished. 28 New Accommodation. During the year 224 flats were completed at Hallfield, 36 at Creighton House, 113 at John Aird Court, and 12 at Lancefield Court. The following is a list of Council-owned new accommodation:— Pre-war No. of flats Brindley House 8 Dudley House 50 Artesian House 8 Post-war: Fleming Court 48 Queen's Park Court 96 John Aird Court 228 Lancefield Court 24 Philip Court 26 Creighton House 36 Gilbert Sheldon House 40 Portnall House 10 Post-war (cont.)

Five (2) notices were complied with, work was in progress at five (8) premises, and at five (4) premises nothing had been done. Of the fourteen (10) notices served prior to 1955 which remained outstanding, the owners complied with eight (5), default action was taken by the Council in four (3) cases, at one (1) of which work was still in progress at the end of the year. Work was in progress at two (1) other premises. Slum Clearance Programme. The form of proposals for dealing under Parts II and III of the Housing Act, 1936, with unfit houses in the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington, has been forwarded to the London County Council for submission on behalf of both Councils to the Minister of Housing and Local Government as required by Part I of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. A copy of any proposals approved by the Minister is to be deposited at the Town Hall and to be open to inspection without charge during ordinary office hours. Approved proposals will, therefore, be made public in due course. As in the first instance, proposals for the Borough need to be agreed with the London County Council, the Medical Officer of Health has consulted with the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council. It appears to the Borough Council that there are certain areas in the Borough containing a total of 257 houses which ought now to be included in clearance areas. The Borough Council alone deal with individual unfit houses under Part II of the Act of 1936, but both the Borough Council and the London County Council are local authorities for the purposes of the slum clearance provisions of Part III of that Act. Accordingly, it is also necessary to agree with the London County Council, the allocation of slum clearance operations as between the two authorities. The areas referred to above generally form parts of areas of intended 29 local authority development, and the responsibility for dealing with those areas appears to rest naturally with the intending developing authority. At the end of the year, final decision on the allocation of slum clearance operations between the two authorities had not been made. Clearance Areas. The London County Council have declared the Edensor Gardens area and the North Wharf Road area to be clearance areas under Section 25 of the Housing Act, 1936, and decided to acquire the lands in the areas for the purpose of Part III of the Housing Act, 1936, together with adjoining lands which in the opinion of the County Council are reasonably necessary for the satisfactory development of the areas. The compulsory purchase orders will be submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation in due course. Fumigation. Associated Fumigators Limited, under an agreement with the Council, removed and treated the furniture and effects of 51(18) families with hydrogen cyanide gas during the year. The cost of the work was £315(£147). The charge for this work is £10 10s. per van per day. The charge made by the Council to persons whose furniture and effects are dealt with under this agreement is £5 5s. 0d. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation. No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 35(37) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders (Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953) 1(—) No. of houses dealt with' by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted —(4) No persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on thirty (19) basement rooms, and the upper parts of six (3) mews premises. Twenty-eight (34) other basement rooms were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. One prosecution for allowing the illegal occupation of basement rooms closed for human habitation are reported under "Legal Proceedings."
