STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OP WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1958 by T. Standring, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health PREFACE To the Mayor, Aidermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich MR. MAYOr, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Fifty-Eighth Annual Report on the Health of the Borough of Woolwich, the Report being on the lines requested by the Minister of Health. The home population for mid-1958 was 144, 600, compared with 146, 200 in 1957, and 151,100 in 1952, when the highest population figure was recorded since the year 1939. The general health of the Borough remains good. There was only one maternal death during the year, and no deaths from poliomyelitis or diphtheria. Total infant deaths were 13 less than in the previous year, more than half of the deaths occurring being due to prematurity or atelectasis. Total cancer deaths were 509, of which 82 were from cancer of the lung or bronchus, mainly in men in the prime of life. The warnings of the grave danger of this disease resulting from excessive cigarette smoking are not being sufficiently heeded. Other diseases of the chest, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, are also prevalent, as are diseases of the circulatory system, Including blood pressure, arteriosclerosis and other forms of heart disease which accounted for almost half of the total deaths in the Borough in 1958. Motor vehicle accidents resfaltsd in the deaths of 15 Woolwich persons, six being motor cyclists or passengers between the ages of 17 and 25. The variety of the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year can be seen by reference to Table No. 8 on page 15. For instance, more than 3,000 visits were made to the homes of the elderly by the Council's woman 'Inspector, nearly 1,000 visits were made for the Issue of Certificates of Disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957, over 1,200 new houses and flats were inspected with regard to water supply, 1,600 inspections of food premises were carried out, 800 visits to houses for the purpose of the Clean Air Act were made, over 1,100 visits were made regarding drainage defects; 2,400 visits were for rats or mice, and ever 7,000 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors following routine complaints received. Woolwich is not faced with such grave problems of slum clearance as are many of the other Metropolitan Boroughs, nor has the Borough much of an overcrowding problem compared with these other Boroughs. However, there are still a number of slum houses which have been - 2 - awaiting clearance for many years, and this work is proceeding as quickly as possible. Details of the progress made during the year in housing and slum clearance will be found in the body of the report. The work of the Council in the pursuit of cleaner air has already become well-known far beyond the boundaries of the Borough. As part of the Council's policy to make the entire Borough smokeless within the shortest possible time, further smoke control areas have now been declared. Two smoke control areas will become operative in the Autumn of 1959 and two further areas in the Autumn of 1960. Resulting from publicity by the Council on clean air, local interest has been aroused on this subject, and numerous enquiries have been received from householders, not only those living in a proposed smoke control area. The Council's staff had a busy year in carrying out preparatory work for the operation of the first large smoke control area. The Clean Air Act was passed in 1956, and although it would be unrealistic to expect spectacular results in so short a time, nevertheless improvement should be evident within the next three years, when an area of about one-eighth of the Borough should have become smokeless. The importance of wide publicity in the establishment of smoke control areas is appreciated, and to obtain maximum co-operation from those living in a proposed smoke control area personal visits have been made to each householder, who has also been informed in writing of how he will be affected, and although there has been some objection on a subject which concerns the individual so personally, the great majority of the residents so far have been in favour of the principles behind the Clean Air Act. The local health services play a vital part in the life of the community. One of the most important ways in which the preventive health services can assist the general practitioner and the hospital is through continuous health education, by acquainting the member of the public with the range and variety of services available to them, and encouraging them to find out more about health. During the year over 80 sessions were arranged by the Health Department which were , devoted to various aspects of health education, attention being paid particularly to the publicising of the risk of home accidents and clean air. With regard to food hygiene, food handling standards continue to improve, but sound practices are still not sufficiently observed as a routine in all cases. Too often frequent changes of staff militate against this. The Food Inspectors do all they can to educate the food handlers, but the public must be constantly prepared to remark on bad practices. - 3 - Problems connected with our ageing population are increasing. The work of the various statutory and voluntary bodies is being directed at the present time wherever possible in an effort to keep the individual in his own home for as long as possible, and to remain as fit as he can and so continue as a useful and active member of the community. Woolwich is not neglecting its elderly residents. The Council appreciate the needs of the elderly and do whatever they can to improve their lot. Loneliness is still one of the biggest problems. The Council have recently supported the introduction of a second mobile meals van, which will operate entirely in the Eltham area. I am glad of this opportunity of acknowledging the help and co-operation of Members of the Council and other Chief Officers, and also wish to thank the staff of my Department for their valuable assistance during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, ladies and Gentlemen, Tour obedient Servant, T. STANDRING. HEALTH COMMITTEE at 31St December, 1958 THE WORSHIPFUL THE MAYOR (Councillor R.B. Stucke, J.P.) Councillor Mrs. J.E.

The birth rate was 13.85 which, when adjusted to allow for the differing age and sex distributions of the population in various parts of the country, gives the same birth rate of 13.85, compared with the provisional birth rate for London of 19.2 and for England and Wales of 16.4. There were 32 stillbirths during the year under review. MARRIAGES There were 1,143 marriages in the Borough during 1958, of which 793 took place in Churches; the remaining 350 took place at the Woolwich Register Office Of the number of marriages which took place in Churches in the Borough, Registrars of Marriage attended on 159 occasions.

The condition of the water supply during the year was satisfactory both in quality and quantity, and no complaint was received in this connection. Local industries are also supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and in addition supplies are taken from the seven wells still in use, The water from these wells is used for industrial purposes and fire-fighting. The Council's "Baths at Woolwich and Plumstead each draw supplies from a well. Samples of the water were taken from the wells in use for bacterioloigcal examination. The results showed the water to be satisfactory. - 16 - DRAINAGE The Public Health Inspectors supervised the necessary work of repair or reconstruction of the 311 drainage defects which were discovered during the year. Forty-one smoke tests were applied on suspected defective private and combined drains. Of the tests made, 13 proved positive. A test which also proved positive was in respect of a disused drain. This drain was subsequently exposed and permanently sealed off. A total of 32 combined drains were inspected during the year, and of these, five were found to be defective. In the case of the defective combined drains, notices were served under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, on the owners concerned and the work of repair and reconstruction was carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department. The cost of the work necessary was shared between the responsible owners. PET SHOPS Regular inspections of the ten licensed pet shops in the Borough were continued during the year. The shops are licensed annually and 82 inspections were made to ensure that the requirements of the Pet Animals Act, 1952, and the conditions subject to which the licences are issued were being complied with. SHOPS ACT, 1950 The provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to suitability of ventilation, and safeitary &ccommodation, and the Maintenance of suitable temperature in shops is the responsibility of the Borough Council. For this purpose, 433 visits of inspection were made by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. As from the 1st January, 1959, functions relating to the suitability of the lighting, washing facilities, and facilities for taking meals by employees in shops, which until that date have been supervised by the County Council, will also be the responsibility of the Borough Council, and this work will be carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1955 The registration and supervision of sellers of Part II poisons (other than registered pharmacists) is carried out by the Council under the above Act. The number of persons entered on the Council's list at the end of the year was I58. - 17 - LICENSING OF COMMON LODGING HOUSES There is now only one common lodging house in the Borough, at 102, Woolwich High Street, which has accommodation for 22 men. REGISTRATION OF HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS PREMISES The Council has made Byelaws to secure the cleanliness of premises where the business of hairdressing is carried on. All persons carrying on this trade are required to be registered with the Council as well as registering their premises. In this connection four ladies' and three gentlemens' hairdressing establishments were registered in 1958, making altogether 44 gentlemens', 40 ladies' and 13 combined ladies' and gentlemens' premises in the Borough at the end of the year. Regular inspections of the establishments are made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure the cleanliness of both the premises and equipment. PROVISION OF DUSTBINS During the year, 47 notices were served on the owners of premises in the Borough under the provisions of Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, requesting the supply of a dustbin. In one instance a landlord appealed to the Court against the Council's notice. The appeal was dismissed. RODENT CONTROL During the year, 685 complaints of rats and 265 of mice were received, and in addition to the investigation of these complaints the systematic inspection under the "block control "system was continued. A total of 18,350 premises were inspected and or these 14,915 were under the "block control" system. The number of properties found to be infested by rats or mice was 1,542, which included 204 business or industrial premises. Where the cause of the infestation appears to be due to defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is requested to effect the necessary repairs. In this connection the Department carried out 37 smoke tests on suspected defective drains at rat infested premises, and these tests produced evidence of seven defective drains. A total of 31 "block control" schemes was carried out during the - 18 - year. As in previous years the Council continued its practice of arranging free treatment in respect of infestations in private dwellings. A charge is made for treatment carried out by the Council at business or industrial premises. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer's Department two sewer treatments and a test bait were undertaken during 1958. An extended period of baiting was continued, rebaiting being carried out on the first and fourth day, and poison baiting on the eighth day. The bait used was sausage rusk and zinc phosphide with paranitrophenol as the poison. Doubling up on complete "takes" was carried out and when recording poison "takes" each gang of workmen carried poison bait to put down where there had been complete "takes" of poison. The number of poison "takes" in the April treatment showed an eleven per cent. increase compared with the previous treatment. In the October treatment there was an 18 per cento reduction in poison "takes" compared with the treatment in the month of April. This may be accounted for by the heavy rainstorm which occurred on the 5th September which caused surcharging of the sewers and a large number of rats were drowned. WOODWORM AND OTHER PESTS In the course of the year, advice was given to householders, and where necessary, disnfestation carried out, following complaints of woodworm, cockroaches, silver fish, clover-mites, etc. and other pests. Ten infestations of cockroaches, six infestations of clover- mites,, two infestations of ants and one infestation of moths were dealt with by the Department during 1958. Several complaints of wasps nesting in houses or gardens were received and in eight cases, the Department destroyed the nests. Of the 58 houses and the furniture therein treated for infestations of woodworm, 50 were in the ownership of the Borough Council. Charges to the responsible persons for the work mentioned above amounted to £185.10.5d. - 19 - FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1948 TABLE No, 10.

Over 70 per cent. of these outworkers are employed by local firms; the remainder working for firms outside the Borough. Eighty-six outworkers who live outside the Borough are also employed by firms inside the Borough. The Council's woman Public Health Inspector visits the homes of outworkers periodically to ensure that working conditions are satisfactory,, Altogether, 214 such visits were made during the course of the year. WELFARE CP THE ELDERLY There is an increasing number of elderly persons on the Council's list of those requiring periodic visitation. Well over 3,000 visits were made during the year by the Council,s woman Inspector to the homes of elderly persons who were found to need some kind of help. In addition, new cases of persons in need of medical attention or domestic help came to the knowledge of the Department during the year. Assistance was given in a number of cases to Medical Practitioners in the removal of persons to more statable accommodation where the existing home arrangements were not considered sufficient for the needs of the patient. However, it was not necessary to take any formal action in the Courts to obtain compulsory removal in any case. Once again it was found that the greatest need in the majority of these cases was more companionship, either visits to the person's own home or the provision of club facilities. - 21 - The nature of the outwork is as follows:- Type of Work Number of Workers Lampshades 117 Wearing apparel 61 Household Linen 12 Christmas crackers 5 Paint Colour cards 2 Dolls' clothes 1 Cardboard boxes 1 More voluntary work than ever is being undertaken by organisations in the Borough to cater for the need# of the elderly. Mobile Meals Service At the end of the year, on the recommendation of the Old People's Welfare Committee, the Council decided to support the operation of a second mobile meals van. Arrangements were made through the City Parochial Foundation, who had provided the first van in 1955, for the presentation to the Borough of a second van to be operated by the W.V.S. in conjunction with the Council of Social Service, under the same arrangements as in the case of the existing van. The new van is being centred in the Eltham area. Lunch Clubs The Eltham Lunch Club meets on five days a week at the Progress Hallo Owing to the closure of the Plumstead Central Hall at the end of March, arrangements were made by the Council of Social Service with the Borough Council for this Club to meet in future at the Plumstead Baths in a room formerly used for slipper baths which had been suitably adapted. The food supplied to the Club is already prepared by the Borough Council's Catering Department at Plumstead Baths, therefore no question of transport of meals now arises. The Council of Social Service have expressed grateful thanks for the Borough Council's assistance in providing this most satisfactory accommodation. Substantial financial contributions towards these two Lunch Clubs were again made by the Borough Council. Holidays for the Elderly During 1958, 94 elderly folk had a holiday under the Holiday Scheme arranged by the Council of Social Service. Altogether, 48 residents of the Borough took their holiday at Westgate in the Spring, and 42 in the Autumn, and four others went separately to boarding houses. Nearly all those participating were in receipt of National Assistace. Unfortunately, owing to the demand for this service, several applicants had to be refused. Appreciative letters have been received from those taking part. The intention for future years is that, with a few exceptions in cases of age or infirmity, the scheme should normally be confined to persons in receipt of National Assistance. At the end of the year, in view of the above report, the Borough Council decided to increase the grant of money made available for the holiday scheme for the year 1959 from £300 to £345° - 22 - Laundering for Aged and Incontinent The washing of soiled linen may be carried out under the Council's powers contained in Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, which rebates to the cleansing, disinfection or destruction of filthy,, unwholesome or verminous articles. In relation thereto laundering facilities have been provided for elderly patients where other arrangements were not reasonably possibles Altogether 4,375 articles were laundered during the year by the Council's staff at the Disinfecting Station, at which there are facilities for laundry work to be carried out. The number of articles laundered was as follows:- Night attire 530; Sheets l,523; Drawsheets 947; Blankets 47; Pillowcases 142; Towels 614; Miscellaneous 572. THEATRES AND CINEMAS The standard of cleanliness in sanitary conveniences at cinemas was found to be maintained at a fairly satisfactory level. Only once during the year was it necessary to serve an informal notice. RAG FLOCK There are three registered premises in the Borough where filling materials, specified in the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations are used. In the course of the year, ten samples were analysed and satisfactory reports were received in respect of all the samples analysed,, Three of the samples were rag flock, two of woollen mixture felt, two of cotton felt and one each of coir fibre, feathers, and millpuff. During the year the Council renewed one licence for the manufacture of rag flock. BOATING AND PADDLING POOLS AND SWIMMING BATHS During 1958, nine samples of water were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, for bacteriological examination, and 28 water tests for chlorine content and pH reaction were made by the Health Department. The following is the average result of the examinations and tests:- - 23 -  Probable No. of Bacillus Coli per 100 ml. Average pH value Average Free Chlorine Average Temperature Swimming Baths 0 7.66 l.3 74.9 Paddling and Boating Pools 4.22 8.0 0.l5 - LITTER ACT, 1958 This Act makes it an offence to leave, throw, drop or deposit any unauthorised litter in any place in the open air to which the public have access. An offender is liable to a fine not exceeding £10. Local authorities are empowered to take proceedings under the Act, and the Council have decided to take active steps to enforce the Act in the Borough. In addition to the provision of several more litter bins, it has been decided to launch an anti-litter campaign. STREET CLEANSING There are 154 miles of roads to be cleansed. of which 15 per cent. are swept at least once daily, 20 per cent. three to five times weekly, 55 Per cent. twice weekly and 10 per cento once weekly. There are 87 street sweepers employed on the work and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the roads in the shopping areas of Powis Street, Plumstead High Street and Eltham High Street. Approximately 9,500 street galleys are cleansed periodically by mechanical gulley cleansing machines. HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review, 45,959 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 50,960 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and from the Army Barracks. Some 1,928 tons of scrap metal, 299 tons of waste paper and 100 tons of textiles were salvaged, and 1,796 yards of clinker sold during the year, producing an income of £8,86l. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are 19 conveniences for men and a similar number for women - 24 - within the Borough. Hours of opening and closing vary with local requirements - in the town centre the conveniences are open from 5.30 a.m. Generally, however, this service is available between the hours of 6.50 a.m. and 11 p.m. In ail the conveniences the water closets are available without charge. FREE WASHING FACILITIES - PUBLIC CONVENIENCES For the past seven years, the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the publico However, some members of the public still prefer the paid washing facilities which include the supply of a linen towel. The above information on Street Cleansing, House and Trade Refuse and Public Conveniences has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes swimming baths, slipper baths, Turkish Baths, Public Laundry, and the use of the premises for social and sporting activities during the winter. The demand for the improved Public Laundry service at Plumstead Baths continued to grow, and in the year under review 23,939 people attended, against 18,295 for the previous year, and 12,924 in 1955/56. Attendances for slipper baths in the year 1957/58 totalled 125,175. Total attendances at the Baths in 1957/58 were 7099 987 - an increase of approximately 43 per cent. on those recorded in 1950/51. This remarkable increase is due mainly to two factors, (1) the televising of swimming events which has increased the interest in this sport, and (2) the greater importance which Education Authorities are placing on the need for children to be able to swim. As evidence of this, 84,600 children attended at the Baths in organised classes in 1948/49, and in 1957/58 this figure had risen to 165,500. Attendances during the year ended 31st March, 1958, were as follows:- - 25 ° Public Swimming 333,348 Swimming Tuition 7,247 School Swimming 165,500 Slipper Baths 125,175 Turkish Baths 10,356 Public Laundry - Hand Washing 12,699 Machine Washing 11,240 Swimming Clubs 34,775 Schoolchildren - Cricket School 3,96l Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed Persons 5,686 709,987 FLOODING IN THE BOROUGH There was widespread flooding in the Borough following a severe storm with torrential rain on Fridays, 5th Septembers 1.8 inches falling in 40 minutes. Some houses were flooded to a depth of over four feet, resulting in serious loss of household effects, particularly furnishings. Large quantities of debris were cleared by the Borough Engineer's Department and blocked drains cleared by the Health Department. An emergency service was operated by the Council's staff, assistance also being given to householders in clearing the damaged articles and Shop merchandise, mainly damaged foodstuffs. However, within 24 hours of the storm all the choked drains which had been reported to the Health Department had been cleared and left in working order. Also within 24 hours of the storm every known incident of flooding in the Borough had been visited. The worst flooding occurred at Eglinton Road, Herbert Road, Restons Crescent, Plumstead Common Road and Woodbrook Road. The public were advised on the best practical means of drying household effects, and encouraged to do as much as possible themselves. At 75 houses in the Borough, those most severely affected by flood water, two drying maehines, loaned by the R.A.F., were used. The driers were used mainly in the living rooms and were in operation for ten hours each day during the three weeks following the storm. Besides the use of these driers, articles of bedding and clothing were collected by the Health Department staff and taken to the Council's disinfecting station for disinfection and drying. Nearly three tons of foodstuffs were found to be contaminated by flood water, the food requiring destruction The assistance of the Fire Brigade was enlisted to help in the draining of a low lying area of Woodbrook Road, where it is estimated that more than 1½ million tons of water were removed. Altogether, rooms at 260 houses were sprayed by the Health Department staff, rooms at 28 houses were limed, and disinfectant soap was issued to householders of 179 premises. — 26 - The public were generally most appreciative of the service rendered by the Council during this emergency. ELTHAM CREMATORIUM The new crematorium which was built in 1956 on land adjoining Eltham Cemetery is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich and North West Kent Joint Crematorium Committee, comprising the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dart ford and Erith, and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup, and Cray ford. Cremations from other areas are also accepted. During 1958, 2,346 cremations took place at this crematorium which was the busiest crematorium in the South London Area. From the 15th August, 1956, when the crematorium was opened, to the end of December, 1958, a total of 4,755 cremations had taken place, receptions from each district being as follows:Woolwich 1,243; Greenwich 294; Chislehurst and Sidcup 480; Bexley 864; Dartford 291; Erith 283; Crayford 154; other areas 1,146. In connection with cremations in this country, it is interesting to note that of the total deaths in Great Britain the percentage of persons cremated had risen from 3.5 per cent in 1939 to 30.5 per cent. in l958. BURIALS AND CREMATIONS Arrangements were made by the Health Department during the year for the burial of six persons who had died or Been found dead in the Borough, in cases where it appeared that no other suitable arrangements were being made for their burial. Four of the six persons were elderly and in respect of whom a Government death grant was not available. The Council - s expenses in this work during the year amounted to £76, of which almost £46 was recovered from the estates of deceased persons. MORTUARY FACILITIES The Council's Mortuary in Stanbury Street is old and is expected to be demolished in the near future as part of the redevelopment scheme for the St. Mary's Area. Following the concentration of coroner's cases, the Borough Council made arrangements with the Boroughs of Deptford and Lewisham for mortuary accommodation for persons dying in the Borough. HOUSING REPAIRS At the end of the year there were estimated to be 42,448 dwellings in the Borough. The number of dwellings inspected for detects under - 27 - the Public Health or Housing Acts was 3,865, and of these 1,156 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. A total of 903 houses were rendered fit by informal action by the Public Health Inspectors. This informal action included the service of intimation notices. In 300 instances it was necessary to serve statutory notices in order to ensure the carrying out of the requisite work. House-to-house inspections under the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations, 1925, were continued, the total number of inspections in 1958 being 217. OVERCROWDING As a result of complaints of overcrowding by the applicants or at the request of the County Council or the Borough Council's Housing Department, the accommodation occupied by 72 families was inspected,, and reports to the appropriate housing authority were made in each case. Of the 72 families visited, ten were found to be statutorily overcrowded. It is a duty of the Council to give in writing,, a statement of the permitted number of persons in respect of any dwelling, and following applications received from either tenants or landlords for this information, 94 dwellings were visited and measured for this purpose, CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR The Rent Act, 1957, freed from rent control houses and flats above a certain rateable value and allowed limited increases in dwellings still under rent control. If the tenant of a house, after receiving notice of rent increase is of the opinion that the house he occupies Is not in a reasonable state of repair, he may serve a notice on his landlord specifying the defects which ought reasonably to be remedied, bearing in mind the age, character and location of the premises. At the end of six weeks after service of such a notice a tenant may make an application to the local authority for a certificate of disrepair, if the defects remain unremedied or the landlord has not served an undertaking to remedy them or such of them as the tenant may have agreed to accept as sufficient. On being satisfied that the condition of a property warrants the issue of a certificate to the applicant, a notice of the Councils intention to issue a certificate must be served on the landlord. A certificate of disrepair can only be issued by the local authority, if at the end of - 28 - three weeks from the service of their notice the landlord has not undertaken to remedy the delects specified on the Council's notice. Where a landlord gives an undertaking to carry out the necessary repairs the Council, with certain exceptions, must not issue a certificate. If, however, the landlord has failed to carry out his undertaking by the end of six months, then, so long as the delects remain unremedied, the rent must be adjusted in the same way as if a certificate of disrepair had been issued. The Act gives the local authority power to refuse to accept an undertaking by a landlord in certain cases. In cases where a landlord has given an undertaking which has been accepted by the Council, either the tenant or landlord may, if they wish, at the end of six months apply to the local authority for a certificate as to the remedying of defects for which a landlord has given an undertaking. This certificate when granted may be used as evidence that the defects have, or have not, been satisfactorily remedied, as the case may be. Details of the applications received during the year for the various certificates are as follow:- No. of applications for certificates or disrepair 321 No. of applications for certificates of disrepair refused 5 No. of notices to landlords of the Council's intention to Issue a certificate of disrepair 332 No. of undertakings received from landlords and accepted by the Council 209 No. of undertakings received from landlords but which the Council refused to accept 3 No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued 143 No. of certificates issued to landlords as to the remedying of delects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking. 28 No. of certificates issued to tenants as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 31 On the ground that the defects specified on the certificates of disrepair had been remediedp 121 applications for cancellation of the - 29 - certificates were received from landlords or their agents. In 60 instances the Council, on being satisfied that the work had been completed, accordingly cancelled the certificates. It was found in 28 cases that the necessary defects had not been remedied and these applications for cancellation were therefore refused. No appeals to the County Court against any decision of the Council made under the Rent Act were made by either landlord or tenant during the year. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, Monetary grants may be made by the local authority to owners who desire to improve the condition of their property. Applications for Improvement Grants are submitted to the Borough Treasurer and referred to the Health Department for an inspection to be made to determine whether the proposed work will satisfy the provisions of the standard of fitness required by the Act. Sixty-six grants were approved during the year. In addition, 78 visits were made concerning proposed improvement grant schemes and the owners advised. Mary well constructed premises in the Borough lack the modern amenities of a bathroom, internal water closet and a suitable hot water supply, and the majority of applications were in respect of the provision of one or more of these amenities. INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES In addition to the Council's slum clearance work, eighteen individual houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation and not-capable of being made fit at reasonable expense. The Council made Demolition Orders and Closing Orders in respect of the undermentioned properties:- Demolition Orders: 2, 3, 4, Anglesea Avenue 102, Elmley Street 22 and 24, Parry Place Closing Orders: 31, Fenwick Street 16, Parry Plate 33, Richmond Place 79, Sandy Hill Road 7, Church Hill 20, Warspite Road 23, Ann Street 34, Griffin Road 5, Glyndon Road 10,14, Mabyn Road - 30 - A further three individual unfit houses had been represented to the Council at the end of the year for demolition or closure» The Council also made Closing Orders in respect of unfit rooms at a further two houses as follows:- 26a, Passey Place (basement front and back rooms, but permitting use for office purposes) 110, Woodhiil (basement rooms) During the year the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of 21, Merchland Road, 16, Gavin Street (substituting a new Closing Order on the basement rooms), 22, Heverham Road (basement rooms), 106a, Elthaa Road (basement rooms), and 10, Eltham Green (basement rooms). SLUM CLEARANCE CLEARANCE AREAS Further progress was made during the year with regard to the Councils Slum Clearance Programme. Details of the work carried out during this period are as follows:- Ann Street (Nos. 1-4) Areas. I had previously represented to the Council that the houses comprised in the following four areas were unfit for human habitation and should be dealt with as clearance areas. Clearance Orders were made by the Council on the 3rd April, 1957, in respect of these four areas, as follows:- No. 1 Areas 160-170(even), 161-179(odd), and 185 Ann Street, 125-137(odd) Villas Road, 21 and 23 Waverley Road. No. 2 Areas: 3-9 (odd) Brewery Road No.3 Areas 108-134(even), 138-142(even), 109-145(odd), 145a, and 147-155 (odd) Ann Street; 24a, 24b, and 26-34 (even) Glyndon Road; 86-92 (even) and 100, 122 and 124, Robert Street; 83-101(odd), 105 and 107, Villas Road. No. 4 Areas 12 and 14, Glyndon Road. There are 100 dwelling houses in the above -mentioned four areas. In addition, there are approximately 60 properties on adjoining land which are not considered representable but which it is necessary for the Council to acquire in order to obtain a cleared site of convenient shape and dimensions for the satisfactory redevelopment of these - 31 - clearance areas. These added lands include, in addition to dwelling houses, a number of retail shops, a warehouse, coal yard, Doctor's surgery and a public house. The Council are redeveloping this area at a density of about 100 persons per acre. This development constitutes the first stage of the Giyndon Area Scheme. The Minister confirmed these Orders during 1958:- Ann Street (Nose 5-8) Areas: At the end of the year I represented that the undermentioned properties in the Ann Street Area should be considered for slum clearance by the Council, these properties being included in the second phase of the Ann Street Clearance scheme. The properties comprise:- NO. 5 Areas 63 and 63a, Vicarage Road; 86-126 (even), 126a, 128-134 (even) Villas Road. No. 6 Areas 37-45 (odd), 47-57 (odd).

Most of the houses have dampness, together with bulged, fractured walls, leaking roofs and general disrepair. There are 162 houses comprised in these four areas, in which there are some 193 families, comprising approximately 512 persons. London County Council Clearance Areas Pier Road (North Woolwich) Area; This area was declared by the County Council on the 20th May,, 1958, and comprises the following properties:- 238-244 (even) Albert Road; 11-14 (cons.) Mary Rose Street; 186-190 (even) Woodman Street; 13-23 (odd) Pier Road. Polthorne Street Areas: This area comprises Nos. 2-12 (even), 16-42 (even), 11-43 (odd) Ann Street, 6-12 (even), 18-36 (even) and 1-27 (odd) Polthome Street; 2-20 (even) Lenton Street; 1-9 (odd) Foreland Street. The Area was declared by the County Council on the 18th February, 1958. - 32 - Armstrong Plage Area: This area was declared by the County Council on the 1st July, 1958, and comprises the following propertless:17-30 (cons.) Troy Street; 4-14 (even), 3-9 (odd) Armstrong Street; 1-7 (conso), 14-16 (cons.); 19-30 (cons.) Armstrong Place; 21-37 (cons.) Rudd Street; 3-17 (cons.) Whitworth Place. HOUSING PROGRESS The number of dwellings built in the Borough of Woolwich during the year 1958, was as unders:- By the Borough Council 247 By the London County Council 506 By private enterprise 150 Total 903 In addition, at the end of the year, the Borough Council had a further 542 dwellings under construction. Development in the St. Mary's Comprehensive Development Area has continued, and by the end of 1958, 344 dwellings had been completed and occupied, together with eight shops. So far, 528 families, comprising 1,537 persons, have been rehoused from the old properties, and this movement will continue as more new dwellings are completed. A block of eight new Almshouses has been erected by the Woolwich Parochial Almshouses replacing a group of Almshouses in Ropeyard Rails which were ere®ted in 1843. The scheme for 224 one and two-roomed flats on the Middle Park Estate proceeded satisfactorily, and a number of these dwellings were completed and let by the end of the year. Laundry and caretaking facilities are provided, and certain of the dwellings are fitted with a special low bath suitable for elderly or infirm people. The majority of the tenants on this scheme have transferred voluntarily from the larger family cottage properties on other estates. The clearance of temporary dwellings in Abbey Wood has continued and building of the fourth scheme on the Bostall Estate comprising 198 dwellings was commenced. A start was also made on the clearance on the Strongbow Road site at Eltham, the redevelopment of which is expected to start in 1959. Building also commenced at Southend Crescent, Eltham, on the first phase of this scheme, which will provide 83 dwellings. - 33 - The Housing Committee also approved a scheme for improvements to the older properties in North Woolwich, by the provision of bathrooms and modernisation of the kitchens, and it is hoped that the approval of the Minister of Housing and Local Government will be received and enable the work to be put in hand at an early date. In addition to the general housing activities, the Council has rehoused a number of occupiers from requisitioned properties, as all such dwellings are to be released from requisition by the 31st March, 1960. At the 31st December, 1958. there were 9,328 tenancies in properties owned or controlled by the Council, 249 of these being in requisitioned properties. At the end of the year, there were 2,805 applicants on the Housing Register,, compared with 2,913 at the end of December 1957. The information on the housing progress in the Borough during 1958 has been kindly supplied by the Director of Housing. CLEAN AIR Smoke Control Areas The following are details of the existing and proposed Smoke Control Areas of the Councils:- (i) St. Mary''s. This area comprises a total of 26 acres in two parts of 21 and five acres, and there are 455 Borough Council dwellings includedo The first portion is bounded to the north by Woolwich Church Street and Chapel Hill, to the south by the railway line, and to the east by the Sto Mary's Churchyard. The smaller area comprises Council properties on land on both sides of Rectoxy Place and the flats flanking on Kingsman Street. In this area 56 dwellings required some adaptation of their appliances, and the necessary work has been carried outo This Order became operative in October, 1958. It is proposed to extend this Smoke Control Area as redevelopment proceeds, taking in private as well as Council properties. (ii) Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Area. This Area comprises the new Abbey Estate on which there will be 2,515 County Council dwellings when the estate is complete in 1961. The Smoke Control Area comprises 212 acres, including 170 acres for housing development and 34 acres for open space, and became operative on the 1st November, 1958. The houses, maisonettes and flats on this estate are fitted with solid fuel appliances to burn smokeless fuel, and the storage capacity of the dwellings yet to be constructed is being increased to - 34 - take 6 cwts. of fuel. The estate is bounded by the railway line to the south, Harrow Manorway to the east, Sewell Road to the north, and Church Manorway to the west. The Council decided to declare this area as a Smoke Control Area with the utmost expedition in order to ensure that the occupiers of the dwellings would be using smokeless fuel from the commencement of their new tenancies. (iii) Abbey Wood Area. This area contains 1,154 dwellings. The area becomes operative on the 1st October, 1959, and comprises 157 acres, including 74 acres of open space. It is bounded to the south by Bostall Hill and Old Park Road, to the west by Basildon Road, to the north by M.Leod Road and to the east by Knee Hill. This area was chosen as the Council's first large scale Smoke Control Area of predominently private properties as offering an opportunity of gaining experience in the various types of private conversions necessary. (iv) Middle Park Area. This Smoke Control Area of a total of 265 acres, including 57 acres of open land, comprises the Council's Middle Park housing estate of 1,518 houses, with an additional 96 private dwellings. The new properties erectsd by the Council at the junction of Court Road and Middle Park Avenue are also included,, The Minister comirmed this Area at the end of the year, with modifications providing for the division of the area into two parts with separate operative dates. The operative date for the first part of the area comprising that section of the area north east of Middle Park Avenue and the tongue of land between King John's Walk and Court Road, is the 1st October, 1959, and the operative date for the remainder of the Area is the 1st October, 1960, In the Council dwellings it is necessary to convert 1,458 existing Triplex grates to open fires with back boilers, together with the provision of gas ignition, and other necessary incidental works. There are a further 115 conversions in Council accommodation which require the fitting of an approved open fire only with necessary incidental works, including gas ignition. Future Areas (v) Abbey Wood (No. 2) Area. At the end of the year the Council decided to proceed with the early declaration of this Area as a Smoke Control Area to become operative on the 1st October, 1960, and preliminary approval has been requested of the Minister. The Area as approved in principle by the Council is bounded to the north by the North Kent Railway line, to the south by McLeod Road, to the east by the Borough boundary with Erith, and to the west by Basildon Road. It comprises 78 acre, with 1,150 permanent dwellings, of which 119 are post-war County Council houses which already have approved appliances fixed. The remaining properties will require conversions - 35 - involving some 1,600 solid fuel appliances. This area is situated between two already confirmed Smoke Control Areas, and when operative will make one large Smoke Control Area. (vi) Clothworkers Wood Area. The Council also decided to ask the Minister for preliminary approval to the early declaration of the Clothworkers Wood Smoke Control Area. The Area as originally proposed comprised a total of 226 acres, including 100 acres of open space. It was bounded to the south by Shooters Hill| to the east by the Borough boundary to Camdale Roads; to the north by Camdale Road and the rear of the south side of Kirkham Street; and to the west by Garland Road and the Shooters Hill Golf Course. The Council have subsequently extended the Area to include the County Council Bassant Road housing site, and also land adjacent to Garland Road, consisting of post-war Borough Council properties, the extent of the area now being 260 acres. In this revised area some 1,500 dwellings will require replacement of approximately 2,400 solid fuel appliances. A number of older-type Council dwellings are also included. New areas, such as the Glyndon Area, and extension areas, such as the St. Mary's Area, comprising new properties already fitted with approved appliances where little additional work is involved, will be kept in mind by the Council to be declared as Smoke Control Areas at the appropriate time. Publicity. Apart from the last two mentioned future areas, detailed surveys of all these areas have been carried out by Officers of the Health Department, and generally the Council's proposals have been well received. Preliminary discussions have taken place with occupiers, and points involved in the conversion of domestic appliances to burn smokeless fuel discussed and questions answered. On the preliminary survey, information was obtained on the type of fuel at present in use, the adaptations required, the cost, and details of any necessary incidental works, including the installation of gas ignition at the hearth. Each occupier and owner affected is also informed in writing of the procedure to be adopted to obtain the Council's prior approval to his conversion proposals and for obtaining financial assistance. Numerous enquiries have been made- by residents, particularly in the Abbey Wood area, both at the Health Department, and at the Council's appliance demonstration hut, which is at present sited in the Abbey Wood area. It is the Councils practice to hold public meetings in each proposed smoke control area after the declaration of the Order by the — 36 - Council. At such public meetings Members of the Council,, including the Chairmen of the General Purposes, Health and Housing Committees, and representatives on the Borough Council of the area concerned are present, along with the Council's Chief Officers. Two such public meetings have already been held and have been very well attended and worthwhile. The Council is convinced that such meetings play a valuable part in giving an opportunity of correcting any erroneous impressions, and in enlisting the co-operation of those affected® After the receipt of the Minister's confirmation of an Order, all occupiers and owners of property in the area are informed in writing of the general result of the Order., Posterr and press publicity are also used for this purpose. Clean Air Act - Operation of remaining provisions All the remaining provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956 not already in force became operative on the 1st June, 1958. From that date the emission of "dark smoke" from a chimney of any building anywhere became illegal unless contained in such limits or class of case as specified by the Minister by Regulations. The prohibition applies equally to houses, factories, shops, offices, railway engines, funnels of ships, and Crown premises. Regulations have been made allowing certain latitude for such practices as soot blowing, and for a chimney serving two or more furnaces. There are temporary exemptions from strict compliance with section I for existing furnaces and equipment at industrial premises where the local authority is satisfied that it has not been practicable to make the alterations necessary to prevent the emission of dark smoke. All adaptations must, however, be completed by July 1963, i.e. not more than seven years from the passing of the Act. In Woolwich, no such temporary exemptions have been applied for or granted by the Couacil. A survey of industrial premises was carried out in the Borough during the months preceding the 1st June, 1958, and showed that there were 102 factories with furnaces, there being altogether 205 furnaces in the Borough. Twenty-One of the furnaces are concerned with special processes, such as the production of road materials, metal casting and reclamation and refining of non-ferrous metals. The remaining 184 furnaces are in steam raising plant and of these, 107 are large installations. Twenty-two of the factories in the Borough have given rise in the past to some smoke or grit nuisance. A number of installations have been recently converted to oil-firing, which, with proper operation, should not give rise to further nuisance. During the carrying out of this surrey all the large factories in the Borough were visited, and the new requirements of the Clean Air Act discussed with the report in relation to. their individual problems. - 37 - The new requirements were also explained in writing and all the managements invited to approach the Health Department for any further information or assistance required. Only one application for formal approval under Section 3 of the Act to the installation of a new furnace was received during the year, although a number of formal notifications under Section 3 were also received. Smoke Observations During the year 218 smoke observations were made of factory premises in the Borough, and regular observations were also carried out in the operative smoke control areas, at St. Mary's and the Abbey Estate. Smoke emissions from an Abbey Wood factory Several complaints were again received from residents in the Abbey Wood area of emission of smoke and fumes from anneabby Wood factory. Following repeated visits to the factory by the Public Health Inspectors, the firm were informed that the Council intended that the provisions of the Clean Air Act should operate fully throughout the Borough, and that the Council would take all necessary steps to this end. The firm subsequently appointed a speeialist combustion engineer to deal with their problems, and in June considerable improvement was noticeable in the operation of the plant. Three of the four small brick kilns which had been a frequent source of complaint were demolished. However, following further smoke nuisance, notices were served by the Smoke Inspector for smoke accompanied by acrid smell, and for another smoke nuisance from a refining pot. The firm carried out further modifications to their plant during the Summer holidays, and this produced a distinct improvement. Smoke from River Traffic A number of complaints have been received during the year of smoke from river traffic, and as this work is solely within the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority, arrangements have been made with the Port Authority for speedy notification of complaints to be telephoned to their office as and when they are received. Smoke nuisance in Royal Arsenal Following representations by the Council to the Ministry of Supply that serious smoke nuisance was being caused by the burning -38- of explosives during the process of disposal of dangerous ammunition, discussions by Officers of the Council with staff on the site took place, and the Ministry of Supply subsequently notified the Council that alternative disposal arrangements would be introduced immediately, and the burning of T.N.T. would cease forthwith. Smoke Control Areas - Fitting of chimney throat restrictors An allowance was included by the Council in its estimated expenditure for the Abbey Wood Smoke Control Area for the provision of chimney throat restrictors, which are a useful means of increasing fuel efficiency. However, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has refused to allow this expenditure for grant purposes, stating that in his view the purpose of such appliances is fuel economy rather than smokeless combustion, and consequently such expenditure is not normally admissible for Exchequer grant. Representations were then made to the Minister, pointing out that in his Memorandum on Smoke Control Areas the Minister had asked local authorities to ensure that conversion works are carried out in accordance with the British Standards Code of Practice and the methods recommened therein which clearly recommended the fitting of throat restrictors. Owing to the comparatively small additional cost involved, and the increased efficiency, the Council considered that the Minister should be willing to accept this expenditure for the purposes of grant. However, the Minister's view was that such expenditure could not be allowed for grant purposes, although he was prepared to consider any special circumstances which might exist in an individual ease such as evidence of recurring or persistent down-draught. A Deputation from the Council attended at the Ministry, but without success, and the question is being further pursued with the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, who support the Council's views. The matter was also raised by other neighbouring local authorities at meetings held to discuss co-operation on smoke control areas. Meetings with neighbouring Local Authorities The Chairman of the Health Committee, Councillor Mrs. J.E. Carroll, has attended a number of meetings of bodies interested in clean air, including meetings of neighbouring authorities both north and south of the river. MEASUREMENT AND RECORDING OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Monthly measurements of deposits of sulphur trioxide and solid matter are made at five measuring stations situated within the Borough which are maintained by the Council. In addition, the Council have set up three smoke measuring stations where daily readings are obtained. The following table gives details of the monthly readings:- - 39 - -40- TABLE No. 11.

Eighty-two programmes were given to local organisations in their own meeting plaecs in the Spring,Autumn and Winter months. Fifteen visits were made to religious groups, 13 to old people's associations, 27 to political bodies and 27 to other various types of clubs. Fifty sessions were held in the afternoon and 32 in the evening. The average audience showed an increase in size on recent years, but still varied considerably individually from 300 at old people's clubs to 20 at some others. The sessions consisted of either films or an informal talk, or a combination of both,designed to bring out a particular aspect of health education. Of the eighty-two visits, seventy-four were devoted exclusively to films, four to talks and four to talks and films together. Programmes, as in past years, took the form of 20 to 30 minutes of films devoted to health subjects, followed by films of general interest or of special interest to the organisation concerned. Films are carefully selected to appeal to particular types of audience and this policy evidently bears fruit by the continued popularity and requests for revisits for this form of Health Education. The subject matter of the talks varied as in past years, and included "The work of the Health Department", "Infectious Disease", "Old Peopled Welfare", and a subject that is showing an increase in popularity, partly due to the Council's own activities in that direction, namely "Clean Air". Several new organisations were introduced to the Council's Health Education Services during the year, and second visits were requested in most cases with surprise being expressed at the diversity of functions undertaken by the Health Department. LEAFLETS AND LITERATURE Leaflets on a variety of subjects are distributed to the public. Distribution was extended during the year to include - 41 - local general practitioners' surgeries and factories for material to be displayed. Co-operation in this connection was almost unanimous. The use of the Council's libraries and other public buildings for this purpose was continued as in previous years. Posters, as far as possible topical for the time of year, are displayed in various positions. With the Council's increasing activities under the Clean Air Act, 1956, particular attention was given to publicity on this aspect of public health. These measures are dealt with more fully on page 56 of this Report. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED OR OFFERED FOR SALE A total of 1,774 inspections of food premises was carried out by the Council's Inspectors during the year. Details of the registered food premises at the end of 1958, together with numbers of inspections made in the year are as follows:- TABLE NO. 12 Description No. in Borough on 31.l2.1958. No. of Inspections Dairies 1 4 Distributors of Milk 128 171 lce-cream Premises 321 408 Premises where meat is potted, pickled, pressed and preserved 102 169 Premises where Sausages are manufactured 88 51 Premises where fish is cured or prepared for frying 38 31 Wholesale dealer in Margarine 1 1 Restaurants, Cafes and Snack bars 179 291 Industrial and School Meals Service canteens 100 144 Markets 1 Daily Bakehouses 7 15 Itinerant vendors - 13 Non-registered premises - 162 Greengrocery and fish shops - 139 Public Houses 141 165 -42- MILK SUPPLY At the end of the year, one dairy and 128 registered distributors of milk were operating within the Borough. Registrations were also approved by the Council in respect of 29 distributors of milk who distribute milk within the Borough from premises outside. Under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949, a total of 230 dealers' licences and 79 supplementary licences were issued authorising the use of the special designations "Pasteurised" "Sterilised" and "Tuberculin Tested". The percentage of fat content of samples of milk submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis was as follows:- Fat Content No. of Samples 4.5 per cent. and over 2 4.0 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 21 3.5 per cent. and under 4 per cent. 108 3.0 per cent. and under 3.5 per cent. 59 Below 3 per cent. 3 During 1958, 203 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised" milk were subjected to the Methylene Blue test at the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, to assess the keeping quality of the milk. All the samples were reported satisfactory. Of the 209 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested" milk which were taken and submitted for the Phosphatase test to determine the adequacy of pasteurisation, 205 were reported to be satisfactory. The remaining four failed the test. On notification that a sample had failed the Phosphatase test, a further sample from the same source was immediately taken for testing. In all four eases the subsequent samples tested were reported to be satisfactory. Twenty-five samples of "Sterilised" or "Tuberculin Tested Sterilised" milk were submitted to the Park Hospital for Turbidity test and satisfactory results were reported in each case. The tests referred to above are those prescribed in the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949. The practice of taking samples of milk in the course of delivery to schools, hospitals and institutions in the Borough was continued during the year. Of the 16 samples taken, seven were - 43 - submitted for the Phosphatase test, and seven for the Methylene Blue test, all of which were satisfactory., Routine visits to the premises of milk distributors were carried out during the year, and in two cases it was found neeessary to serve notices to secure the remedying of defects. ICE CREAM There were 521 registered ice cream premises in the Borough at the end of the year, of which six were used for the manufacture of ice cream and six for the storage of ice cream. Pre-packed ice cream only is sold from the majority of the registered premises. Routine inspections of all registered shops are made, and during the year twelve defects were found and subsequently remedied following the service of two informal notices. The premises of each new applicant for registration are inspected in order to ensure that they are satisfactory and that the requirements of the Heat Treatment Regulations are fully understood. During the year eleven samples of ice cream were submitted to the Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue Test. The results of the tests indicated that nine of the samples were in Grade I and two in Grade II. PUBLIC HOUSES Of the 141 public houses in the Borough, 29 serve main meals. Routine inspections of all licensed premises were carried out during the year, in particular to ensure compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Altogether 165 inspections were made and it was necessary to serve only three informal notices to remedy defects. FOOD SAMPLING, 1958 During the year ended 31st December, 1958, 703 samples of food and drugs (being 507 informal and 196 formal samples) were submitted for analysis to the Public Analyst. Of these, 19 informal samples and four formal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 3.2 compared with 2.2 in 1957. No private samples were examined during the year. - 44 - The following table gives details of the adulterated samples:- TABLE No. 13 Sample Article Formal or Informal (F or I) Adulteration or Irregularity. 675 Cream I Milk solids content slightly deficient. Also sample contained added ingredients although label stated "Pure Cream". 689 Indigestion Tablets I Contained no proteolytic activity, although the tablets were claimed to contain pepsin and pancreatin, which aid the digestion. 667 Ground Nutmeg I Contained insect fragments. 704 Ground Nutmeg I - „ - 727 Ground Nutmeg I - „ - 141 Blaud's Pills I Misleading label. 172 Bread I Contained part of a dead mouse. 109 Sponge Pudding Mixture I Label misleading 178 Nut Chocolate I Consisted of imitation Chocolate containing broken biscuit but no nuts. 210 Lollipops I Contained snail fragments of glass. 196 Currants I Contained seeds 19 per cent. 187 Cream of Mushroom Soup Preparation I Contained only .8 per cent of fat.

The standstill continued for several weeks, disorganising ail sections of the meat industry, and throughput at the slaughterhouses a as a result, was considerably reduced during this period. Ships bringing meat to London were diverted to the continental ports and the meat was brought to London by air. Consignments of such meat arriving at a coldstore in the Borough were inspected on arrival and without exception were found to be in very good condition,, despite the unusual journey. Details of the carcases inspected at the Garland Road Abattoir during 1958, are as follow:- - 47 - TABLE No. 14 Carcases & Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part, 1958 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed and inspected 8,735 596 851 18,852 27,336 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci) Whole carcases condemned - 1 1 12 40 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 2,585 208 9 2,099 3,958 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci 29.5 35.0 1.1 11.1 14.5 Tuberculosis only Whole carcases condemned 13 11 1 - 2 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 569 139 - - 515 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis 6.6 25.1 .11 - 1.8 Cyaticercosis Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned and treated by refrigeration. 86 - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - LICENSING OF SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND SLAUGHTERMEN There are two licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough, one being the Garland Road Abattoir through which large numbers of animals pass each year. The other, in Herbert Road, has not been used for slaughtering for some years. Eleven slaughtermen's licences were issued during the year by the Council to men working at the Garland Road Abattoir. - 48 - SLAUGHTERHOUSES ACT, 1958 This Act was passed to enable the Minister to make amending regulations recommending minimum standards of construction, lay-out and equipment for slaughterhouses, and to make regulations dealing with cruelty to animals. These regulations were made during the year and will apply to existing slaughterhouses on dates to be appointed by the Minister for each local authority area. OFFENSIVE TRADE - BUSINESS OF SLAUGHTERER OF POULTRY An application was approved by the Council during the year for the extension for a further five years of an Establishment Order issued by the Council in 1948 in respect of the business of slaughterer of poultry at the Woolwich and Plumstead Synagogue. These premises are used for the slaughtering of poultry only on very rare occasions. FOULING OF PAVEMENTS BY DOGS Complaints are received by the Health Department from time to time of nuisance to the public from dogs. The Health Committee have considered the publicity to be undertaken to encourage greater awareness by the public of this nuisance and during the year various publicity has been given to this subject by the Health Department. Future publicity is to include the display of notices on lamp-standards in selected roads adjoining dog walks in the Borough. The notices will be displayed in each road for a month or so and then moved on to another road. Other means of publicity have included the use of postal franking of envelopes, distribution of handbills, and publicity at health education sessions arranged by the Health Departments No prosecution was taken during the year for an offence against the Council's Beylaw, owing to lack of sufficient evidence. UNSOUND FOOD- EXAMINATION Altogether 35,172 articles of food, weighing approximately 60 tons were condemned as unfit during 1958. The majority of these articles, weighing approximately 54 tons, were from the large Abattoir in the Borough. UNSOUND FOOD - COMPLAINTS Forty complaints of alleged unsound food were received by the Health Department from members of the public during 1958. The complaints were ail investigated in detail to ensure that where justified the matter was remedied, and that any defects or malpractices at food premises were rectified. - 49 - Legal proceedings were taken by the Council against the suppliers of a jar of piccalilli found to contain glass, who were fined £3; and against a baker with regard to a mouse found in a loaf of bread, the defendant being fined £2, and £5.5.0d. costs. Other legal proceedings related to a drawing pin in a piece of coconut slice, the hearing being adjourned sine die. A warning letter was issued by the Council to the manufacturers of marshmallow biscuits in which glass was embedded. Complaints also included the following: mould in a meat pie (three cases,), mouldy bread (five cases), mould in a tin of peaches, and in a minced beef loaf, foreign matter in corned beef, in bread (two cases), in ice cream, in a bun and in butter. Other complaints related to "bad" fish (found to be fit for consumption), bristles in meat (found to be meat packers hemp), unfit sausages, alleged unfit Christmas cake (found by the Public Analyst to be fit for consumption), three cases of alleged mice dirts in bread (two of which were found to be charred starch granules, and the third shreds of cooked liver), unfit meat pies, a brass bolt in sausages, a dirty milk bottle, maggots in a jam roll, and dirty in bread (four cases). In a number of these complaints the articles were found to be not unfit. INFECTIOUS DISEASES There were only 864 notifications of infectious disease received during 1958, compared with 1,980 in the previous year, and no serious outbreak occurred in the Borough. Measles totalled 480, compared with 1,384 in 1957, and the number of notifications of pneumonia and whooping cough were halved. DIPHTHERIA There was only one notified case of diphtheria occurring during the year, and this proved to be a case of glandular fever. POLIOMYELITIS I am pleased to report that only two confirmed cases of poliomyelitis occurred, one of which was paralytic in a child aged 12, and the other non-paralytic in a child aged 14. Thirteen other notifications had also been received ef suspected cases, and all had been removed to the Brook Hospital for observation. Revised diagnoses weres Osteo myelitis 25 Otitis media 2} Upper respiratory tract infection 2$ and single cases of Tonsillitis, Pharyngitis, Virus meningitis, Sub Arachnoid haemorrhage, Measles and Arthritis. Although publicity of the County Council facilities for immunisation had been previously on a large scale, following the death - 50 - of Mr. J. Hall, a well-known Association Footballer, large numbers of applicantions for vaccination were reseived from young persons, and with the increasing supplies of vaccine available during the year, many more were vaccinated. DYSENTERY Dysentery notifications were greatly reduced in 1958 after a rather serious outbreak in the previous year in which a hundred cases had been notified. Altogether Medical Practitioners notified 27 cases, 19 of which were confirmed mainly as sonne dysentery. In three instances two or more children in the same family were affected. FOOD POISONING No outbreak of food poisoning came to the notice of the Health Department during the year, and of the 19 single cases notified only one was confirmed.

Ninety-two of the new cases were pulmonary and nine non-pulmonary. In the past eleven years the total notifications of tuberculosis received have been reduced by two-thirds, and deaths from this disease are now only one-fifth of what they were in 1947, Most of the new cases are occurring in men over 40 years of age. Full investigation and treatment of all patients is undertaken by the local Chest Physician and her staff. Clinics are held at Maxey Road, Plumstead, and at Carnecke Gardens, Eltham.

The signatures on these certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a doctor practising within the area. During the year over 500 Certificates were authenticated by me, the majority relating to protection against smallpox. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council Maintains two personal cleansing stations, one being at Plumstead (adjoining the Turkish Baths, Plumstead High Street), and the other at the Lionel Road Centre, Eltham. The number of persons cleansed in 1958 was 1,046 and the number treated for scabies was 116. Details are as follows:- - 53 -  Pre-School Children School Children Adults TOTAL Boys Girls Boys Girls Men Women Verminous Persons Cleansed 27 59 236 579 7 138 1,046 Treatment of Scabies 2 8 28 35 15 28 116 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION During 1958, the Department carried out disinfection of 141 rooms after cases of infectious disease, and 22 of these rooms had been occupied by tuberculous persons. Over 1,000 inspections for verminous conditions were made and 75 rooms were disinfested of vermin. Several requests were received from local residents wishing to dispose of old furniture or bedding, much of which was worn-out or verminous. Thirty such applications were dealt with during the year, and 158 articles were removed to and destroyed at the Plumstead Destructor. Of this total, 30 were mattresses, twelve bedsteads, 37 sets of bedding, 36 items of furniture and 43 other sundry items. Certain countries impose a condition that a Certificate of Disinfection must accompany a parcel of clothing entering the country. Three such Certificates were issued to residents wishing to send clothing to friends or residents abroad. The clothing was disinfected by the Department and small charges were made. Certificates of Hygiene were issued to accompany three consignments of rag-wipers which had been washed, cleaned and sterilised by a local laundry. A firm of clothing exporters asked the Council to disinfect a quantity of clothing before it was exported to Africa. This was done at a small charge. LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service. - 54 - Specimens sent to this laboratory include samples of milk and ice-cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the Abattoirs, and samples of swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the laboratory on behalf of the Council during 19588:- Type of Specimen NO. Examined Food (various) 5 Ice Cream (methylene blue test) 8 Milk (methylene blue, phosphatase and turbidity tests) 233 Water (swimming baths, children's paddling and boating pools and domestic supplies) 40 Processed bovine blood plasma 1 Organs from animal carcases 3 The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the hospital from local clinics, is undertaken by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee at the Brook Hospital and at the St. Nicholas Hospital, General practitioners referred four sputum specimens and one throat swab for examinations, and the hospital carried out 19 other sputum examinations during the year. It is an advantage to all concerned to have a service of this nature conveniently available within the Borough.
