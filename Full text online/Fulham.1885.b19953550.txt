The raising of the level of the surface of this common has been completed, the common enclosed with a post and rail fence, and it now forms a good, though somewhat small, addition to the open spaces in the district dedicated to the recreation of the public for ever. BISHOP'S MEADOW RECREATION GROUND, FULHAM. The Board is still engaged in the work of filling in the ditch and creek and raising the level of this land, so as to bring the surface above the level of high tides, but no definitive scheme has yet been adopted for the embankment of the land, the planting and formation of ground, &c.; and, in view of the dissolution of the Board on March 25, 1886, no plan has been prepared, the Board being of opinion that the matter would be best dealt with by the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, in which body the land will be vested. IMPROVEMENT—BEADON ROAD, HAMMERSMITH. The Board having acquired the various properties required for the improvement of this thoroughfare, the whole of the necessary works have been carried out at a cost of £636. 17s. 10d., and an improvement of great importance effected. IMPROVEMENT — CORNER OF HARWOOD ROAD, FULHAM. Under an agreement with the Metropolitan District Railway Company the Board acquired certain land and c 2 24 premises forming part of the premises known as the Swan Tavern, Walham Green, and proceeded to pull down the stables, build a new boundary wall, &c., and on a portion of the land so acquired to erect thereon a public urinal, which was much needed in this locality, situated as it is at the junction of four roads. The works are in progress, and will be completed by the Trustees. WIDENING OF DAWES ROAD, FULHAM. The negotiations in this matter having, after considerable delay, been brought to a successful termination, the owner of the land and premises acquired for the improvement is proceeding with the work of removing the building and setting back the boundary fence to the line of frontage agreed upon. PARSON'S GREEN LANE, FULHAM (D'SALAT'S ESTATE). The Board has not yet been able to effect this muchneeded improvement, in consequence of the delay caused by disputes having arisen between the builder and the freeholder, but it is hoped that the Trustees will be able to complete the matter during the ensuing summer. SITE FOR WHARF, FULHAM. After having occupied the attention of the Board and Committee for many months, it was felt by the Board to be desirable that the question should be discharged from the books, in consequence of the pending separation of the two Parishes on March 25, 1886, and it was accordingly discharged. CHURCH STREET, FULHAM. The question of carrying out some scheme for the widening and improvement of Church Street, Fulham, has been constantly before the Board, but as yet they have 25 failed in the endeavours to induce the Metropolitan Board of Works to carry out the work as a Metropolitan Improvement. The Board feel that the opening of the new bridge will intensify the existing evil, and, it is hoped, demonstrate to the Metropolitan Board the great importance of making this improvement at the cost of the Metropolis generally. FULHAM NEW BRIDGE. The new bridge is rapidly approaching completion, and is expected to be opened for traffic in May. HAMMERSMITH NEW BRIDGE. The works in connection with the construction of the new bridge at Hammersmith are progressing, but not so rapidly as the public convenience demands. WATER SUPPLY TO DWELLING-HOUSES. The Board had under consideration the question of the hardship often experienced by small householders, lodgers, &c., in consequence of the arbitrary action of Water Companies in cutting off the supply of water; and, having regard to the grave insanitary condition which might, and, in fact, which does arise in consequence of such action by the Water Companies, they resolved as follows:— That in the opinion of this Board the powers of the Water Companies for cutting off water in case of non-payment of Water-rate may be, and are, sometimes used oppressively, and that the Companies ought not to be allowed to exercise such powers without an Order from a Magistrate granted on summons; and, further, that the Borough Members be requested to support Mr. W. M. Torrens, M.P., in his Water Clauses Amendment Bill before Parliament. Copies were forwarded to members accordingly. 26 THE PROPOSED RE-NAMING OF NORTH END ROAD, FULHAM. In answer to the prayer of a very numerously-signed Memorial which was presented to the Board by an influential deputation of residents in North End Road and the neighbourhood, the Board again applied to the Metropolitan Board to re-name North End Road "West Kensington Road." The Metropolitan Board declined to accede to the request, and suggested alternative names, i.e. "Walham Green Road," "Braganza Road," or "Hapsburg Road," but no order has yet been made in relation thereto. TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WIRES. The serious danger to the public arising from the numerous Telegraph and Telephone Wires crossing and recrossing the public thoroughfares has again occupied the attention of the Board, and a Conference of Delegates, representing the various Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, met for the purpose of selecting and consolidating evidence to be given before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, by whom the subject matter was being considered. Mr. E. Bird, Mr. R. L. Cosh, and Mr. J. McLean represented the Board, and the Board deeply regret that no practical result has followed the inquiry, believing, as they do, that the overhead Telegraph and Telephone Wires are a source of great and daily-increasing danger to passengers through the streets. WOOD PAVING, FULHAM. During the year the Board has caused to be paved with wood the line of thoroughfare from the Parish Boundary, at Stamford Bridge, to the Vestry Offices at Walham Green, and great satisfaction has been expressed by the residents on the line of road and others at the completion of this work. 27 In connection with this work the Surveyor presented a Special Report, as follows:— To the Works Committee, Fulham District Board of Works. Wood Paving v. Mac Adam. Gentlemen,—I have carefully considered this question, and have read up such information as I could get on the subject, and present herewith the result of my investigation. I have estimated that the life of a wood paved street of fairly heavy traffic may be taken at seven years, after which time it will be more or less faulty, and it will be desirable, as well as economical, to renew the wood blocks entirely. The old blocks might be used (or the best of them) in bye streets, with the under side brought to the surface, as has been recently done in the eastern side of Broadway and Brook-green-lane. The first cost of paving a street with deal blocks may be taken at 10s. per yard, which is about the average of the tenders for a contract recently taken. If the necessary sum is borrowed, to be paid off in seven annual instalments, with interest at 5 per cent., and adding 1d. per yard per annum for maintenance, &c., the cost per yard for the first seven years will be about 1s. 9d. per yard. (For the exact calculation see appendix.) After the first seven years the renewal will be less, because the concrete foundation at first laid will remain intact, and will merely require a little regulating where it may have become depressed by traffic or occasional excavations, and this second laying I estimate at 7s. per yard, or if the cost thereof borrowed and paid off by seven annual instalments, with 5 per cent. interest and 1d. per yard per annum for maintenance, the annual cost will be about 1s. 3d. per yard. With reference to the propriety of substituting creosoted beech blocks instead of deal, I can only say that the short term of experience we have had with them in the Broadway and between the tram lines in King-street, tends to prove to a great extent the statements made by the patentees of the system in Sunderland; but, without going so far as they do when they say that after thirteen years' wear the blocks show but little signs of deterioration, I think it may fairly be assumed that they will last twelve years, and I estimate the first cost at 17s. per yard. The annual cost, therefore, would be, assuming you can borrow the money and repay the loan in twelve annual 28 instalments at 5 per cent. interest, and adding 1d. per yard for maintenance as before, will be about 1s. 11d. per yard. After the first twelve years (the concrete remaining as before described) the repaying might be done for 14s. per yard, the amount for which borrowed and paid off in like manner at 5 per cent. interest, with 1d. per yard for maintenance, would be 1s. 7d. per yard. Now, as compared with the cost of the maintenance of a MacAdam road, the cost of wood will be seen to be higher in the case of the first cost of paving with deal blocks, and also in both instances with the beech blocks; whilst in the case of the renewal of the deal blocks it will be about the same, as it is estimated the cost for maintenance at the present price of broken granite of a MacAdam road is from 1s. to 1s. 3d. per yard, according to the traffic and also the season. There is, however, another matter which must not be lost sight of, which seems to point in the direction of the economy of wood paving—viz., the cost of scavenging and cleansing. This is a somewhat difficult problem to answer without actual statistics. Moreover, if it were possible to answer it correctly to-day, the altered circumstances and increased difficulty of obtaining slop-shoots would demand a different answer in a few years' time; but in Liverpool such statistics have been taken, and they may fairly be referred to here as affording some reliable information on the subject. In a report on the subject I find the cost of scavenging on creosoted wood with a bitumenous concrete foundation is stated to be 2.7d. per yard per annum, whilst for scavenging MacAdam roads it is said to cost 8d. per yard per annum. This would seem to show that it costs about three times as much to cleanse a MacAdam road as it does a wood paved road. If these figures are worth anything the wood paving is the more economical. There is yet another consideration which affects nearly all ratepayers, some more than others—viz., the comparatively less wear and tear in horseflesh and carriages of various kinds, thus giving an advantage to those who are so fortunate as to be able to keep horses and vehicles, and the still greater advantage to those residing along the line of route where wood is laid, who, without having the expense of keeping horses, &c., have the unalloyed advantages of great diminution in the noise and vibration, and dust from the traffic, as well as freedom from the annoyance of the annual picking up, coating and rolling a MacAdam road. Taking all these things into consideration, I have arrived at 29 the conclusion that a very large number of individuals derive special benefit from wood paving, whilst the remaining portion of the ratepayers who have not these special benefits are not placed at any disadvantage whatever, but after a time become absolute gainers thereby. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED C. BEAN, April, 1885. Surveyor. APPENDIX.

The bridge over the Metropolitan District Railway, known as Gliddon Road Bridge, was completed by Messrs. Gibbs & Flew and opened for traffic early in the year, thus providing an important and much-needed means of communication between the two Parishes and the Board. SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON-PROPOSED SCHOOL AT BROOK GREEN, ETC. The Board had again under earnest consideration the rapidly-growing and burdensome increase in the expenditure of the School Board for London, and learning that tho School Board proposed to purchase a most expensive site at Brook Green, for the erection of a school there, they felt it their duty to put on record their solemn protest against such wanton extravagance with the ratepayers' money, and presented a Petition to the House of Commons, as follows:— To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District in the County of Middlesex under their Common Seal. Sheweth,—That your Petitioners are required by law to cause to be raised the sums of monoy assessed from time to time by the School Board for London upon the Fulham District towards meeting tho expenses of the said School Board. That the attention of your Petitioners has been drawn to the continuous and enormous increase in the amount of tho precepts of the School Board for London. That the rate required for tho purposes of the London School Board in the present financial year from this District is at the rate of l0d. in the £. That the annually-increasing burden imposed upon the Rate- 31 payers is injurious to the welfare of the District and of the Metropolis at large. That in the opinion of your Petitioners one important source of the extravagant expenditure by the School Board is that sites for schools are acquired in positions and neighbourhoods where such accommodation is not required and that enormously extravagaut prices are paid for such sites. That at the present moment the School Board are seeking to obtain a site for the erection of a school at Brook Green, Hammersmith, where, by reason of the valuable nature of the adjacent property the purchase money must of necessity be very high, and where there is but a very small population of the class of persons that would require the advantage of a School Board. That an alternative site at Alexandra Road, Hammersmith, within a short distance of Brook Green, situated in the midst of a teeming population that does require such schools, has been pointed out to the School Board by your Petitioners, and your Petitioners are credibly informed and believe that such could be obtained at much less expense than the site at Brook Green. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House to appoint a Select Committee for the purpose of inquiring into the administration and expenditure of the School Board for London with a view to ascertaining in what respects (if any) the administration of the Board is defective and their expenditure is excessive, and suggesting such remedial legislation as may appear necessary or expedient to prevent an unduly lavish expenditure in future. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order, (Signed) THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. June 2, 1885. And a further Joint-Petition was, presented as follows:— 32 In the House of Commons.— Session 1885. elementary education provisional order confirmation (london) bill. (H.L.) Petition against: On Preamble. So far as relates to and confirms the Provisional Order in respect of Plan No. 3. To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, under their Common Seal, and of the undersigned owners of lands and houses proposed to be affected by the Order which the said Bill proposes to confirm. Sheweth,—(1.) That a Bill (hereinafter called the Bill) has been introduced into your Honourable House from the House of Lords, entitled: An Act to confirm a Provisional Order made by the Education Department under the Elementary Education Act, 1870, to enable the School Board for London to put in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Acts amending the same. (2.) That the Preamble of the Bill states that the Lords' Committee of the Privy Council on Education have made a Provisional Order under the authority of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, on behalf of the School Board for London, and it is requisite that the same should be confirmed by Parliament. (3.) That the Bill proposes to confirm the said Provisional Order, and to enact that from and after the passing thereof as an Act the said Order shall have full validity and force. (4.) That the Bill then states, whereas the School Board for London require to purchase divers pieces of land for the purposes of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, and not having been able to purchase the same by agreement, require to put in force the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Acts amending the same, which apply to the purchase and taking of lands otherwise than by agreement. And, whereas the lands so required to be purchased are set forth in the schedule marked Plan No. 3. And, whereas the said Board have made due publication of the notices, and have duly served the same according to the requirements of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, and have presented a petition to the Education Department, praying that an order may be made authorising the said School Board to put 38 in force the powers of the said Acts with respect to the purchase and taking of lands otherwise than by agreement, in which petition were stated all the matters required by the said Elementary Education Act to be stated therein, and the same hath been supported by such evidence as the said Education Department required. (5.) That one of the schedules proposed to be confirmed and become part of the enacting Bill or Act is as follows:— PLAN No. 3. A piece or parcel of land situate on the north-west of Brook Green, in the parish of Hammersmith (St. Peter and St. Paul), in the county of Middlesex, abutting north and west on a builder's yard, south on gardens of houses in Brook Green, and east on a road leading north from Brook Green, and containing 37,260 square feet, or thereabouts, as the same is described in the Plan No. 3, and distinguished by the Nos. 1 to 16, both inclusive, together will all and singular the messuages and tenements and buildings (if any) now standing or being thereon, with their appurtenances. The names of the owners, lessees, and occupiers of the said piece or parcel of land and hereditaments are as follows:— NAME. Owner. Lessee. Occupier. NAME. Owner. Lessee. Occupier. William Bird - Walter May - Edward Bird - - William Taylor - James Wright - Thomas Prince - William Stevens - John Darin - Charles Begaut - Charles Masters - George Dnubar - Mrs. Mary Death - Henry J. Radley - Robert Binstead - (6.) That the property so scheduled and proposed to be acquired by the School Board for London under the powers of the Confirming Bill is situate within the area of the Fulham District Board of Works, herein called the Fulham District, and your Petitioners, the said Fulham Board, object to the powers proposed to be conferred on the said School Board by the Bill for the following, among other reasons:— (7.) That your petitioners, the Fulham Board, are the local authority charged with the care and maintenance of highways, the sewers, and other multifarious works, the cost of which has to be raised by rates levied upon the inhabitants; that at 34 present almost the entire area surrounding and abutting on Brook Green is occupied by high-class residential houses of high rateable value, contributing largely to the rates of the district, and your Petitioners, the Fulham Board, believe that the establishment upon the proposed site at Brook Green of a Board School will very seriously depreciate the rateable value of the existing houses, and prevent the building of any other houses of the like value in the future, and so seriously affect the best interests of the ratepayers. That your Petitioners, the Fulham District Board, by reason of their intimate knowledge of the condition and requirements of the district, affirm in the most positive manner that a Board School is not required on Brook Green, there being but very few persons resident on Brook Green, or adjacent thereto, of the class to require such accommodation. That the purchase of the site will entail an enormous outlay, and greatly increase the terrible burthen of taxation upon the Ratepayers. That the Ratepayers in the Fulham District have to provide for the School Board, as their contribution for the current year, the sum of twenty-four thousand eight hundred and eighty-six pounds and ninepence, which entails a rate of eightpence farthing in the pound. That your Petitioners, the Fulham District Board, have made the most urgent representations, praying for the abandonment of the scheme. (8.) That your Petitioners, the said owners of lands and premises referred to in the schedule, are owners of other lands and valuable property at Brook Green, and believe that the establishment of a Board School there on the lands proposed will very seriously injure and depreciate the value of the property, and the Bill does not propose to give compensation for such injury. That your Petitioners, owners, lessees, and occupiers of lands and premises abutting on, or near to, the said proposed site, object to the establishment of a Board School at Brook Green, and believe that if a school be built there, it will seriously injure and depreciate the value of their property, and the Bill makes no provision for compensation for such injury. That the preamble of the said Confirmation Bill, so far as relates to the Plan No. 3, the lands therein described and proposed to be acquired under the power of the Bill, is incapable of proof. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the said Bill 35 may not pass into a law so far as regards the Plan No. 3 and the lands therein described, and that your Petitioners may be heard before the Select Committee of your Honourable House to whom the said Bill may be referred against so much of the provisions and powers thereof as relate to Plan No. 3 and the said land, and that your Honourable House may give to your Petitioners such relief as to your Honourable House may seem meet. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order, (Signed) THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. July 22nd, 1885.

The estate known as Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith, being in the market for sale, the question of acquiring the estate for the purpose of a public park was carefully considered by the Board, who placed themselves in communication with the Metropolitan Board, the Corporation of the City of London, and others, with a view of securing the park for the people. The matter is still in negotiation, and the Board hope that the land may be ultimately secured. WEST METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS. In order to meet the growing requirements of the public, the West Metropolitan Tramway Company, 36 Limited, applied to the Board for permission to construct certain passing places in the Uxbridge Road, Hammersmith; and permission was given, subject to the terms and conditions of an agreement between the Board and the Company, as follows:— An Agreement, made the 28th day of October, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, between the West Metropolitan Tramways Company (hereinafter called "the Company"), of the one part, and the Board of Works for the Fulham District (hereinafter called "the said Board"), of the other part. Whereas, by the Southall Tramway Order, 1873, confirmed by the Metropolitan Tramways Orders Confirmation Act, 1873 (No. 2), and hereinafter called the Order of 1873; and the Shepherd's Bush and Priory Road, Acton, Tramway Order, 1876, confirmed by the Tramways Orders Confirmation (Bristol, &c.) Act, 1876 (and hereinafter called the Order of 1876), with both of which Orders was incorporated the Tramways Act, 1870, the promoters of such Orders were authorised to construct certain tramways in such orders, more particularly described in the parishes of Norwood, Hammersmith, and Acton, in the county of Middlesex. And whereas portions of the tramways authorised by the Orders of 1873 and 1876 have been completed and opened for public traffic; and whereas the West Metropolitan Tramways Company, Limited (hereinafter called "the limited Company"), was incorporated and duly registered on the 12th day of August, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, under the Companies Acts, 1862 to 1880, and with the consent of the Board of Trade, purchased the undertakings authorised by the Order of 1873 and the Order of 1876; and whereas by the West Metropolitan Tramways Act, 1882 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 1882), the Limited Company was dissolved, and reincorporated by the name of the West Metropolitan Tramways Company, and by Section 6 of that Act all the property and rights of the Limited Company, including, inter alia, the undertakings authorised by the Order of 1873 and the Order of 1876, were vested in the Company, subject to the provisions of such Act. And whereas, by Section 36 of the Act of 1882, the Company was empowered from time to time after the passing of that Act to make, maintain, alter, and remove all such crossings, passing-places, sidings, junctions, turn-outs, and other works, 87 in addition to those particularly specified in and authorised by the Act as might from time to time be necessary or convenient to the efficient working of the tramways (in the said Act defined to be the tramways, inter alia, authorised by the Order of 1873 and the Order of 1876), or any of them, or for providing access to any stables, carriage-sheds, or works or buildings of the Company, subject to the reasonable approval of the road authority; provided that in the construction of any such works no rail should be so laid that a less space than 9 feet 6 inches should intervene between the said rail and the outside of the footpath on either side of the road if any owner or occupier of premises abutting on the place where such rail is proposed to be laid, by writing under his hand, addressed to the Company, express his objection thereto. And whereas the making of additional passing-places in the Uxbridge Road, within the district of the said Board, would be of great advantage to the public, and would facilitate and accelerate the tramway service ; and whereas the said Board is the road authority for such district within the meaning of the Act of 1882; Now these presents witness that, in consideration of the mutual benefit to accrue to the parties hereto by the carrying out of these presents, the Company, so far as the provisions hereinafter contained are expressed to be performed by it, do hereby agree with each other as follows; that is to say:— 1. The Company may, after giving three days' notice to the Surveyor to the Board for the time being, make, maintain, work, and use the passing-places or sidings in the said Uxbridge Road shown on the plan attached hereto, and for such purposes, or any of them, may break up and interfere with the said road. 2. The Company, its successors and assigns, shall, during the continuance of its or their occupancy of the said passingplaces or sidings, pave, and maintain with 5 inches by 3 inches new Aberdeen granite setts laid on a bed of 6 inches of concrete, such concrete to be composed of six measures of sharp Thames ballast and one measure of Portland cement, the space between and for 18 inches on each side of the rails of the said passingplaces or sidings; and shall also pave and maintain in a similar manner a similar width—namely, 18 inches of the roadway on each side of the rails of the tramway for a length of three yards beyond the extremities of the said passing-places or sidings. 3. The Company shall, in addition, pave the margins of the road between the outside of the paving already agreed to be executed by it and the channels of the road with 7 inches by 3 inches new Aberdeen granite setts laid on a bed of 6 inches of D 38 concrete, composed of similar materials to the concrete used in relation to the said passing-places or sidings. 4. Each passing-place shall be completed within a period of one calendar month from the commencement thereof respectively; and the whole of the works shall be carried out to the satisfaction of the Surveyor for the time being of the said Board. 5. The said Board shall, after the margins of the road agreed as aforesaid to be paved in the first instance by the Company have been so paved by it, for ever after maintain the same at its own expense in good and proper condition. In witness whereof the Board of Works for the Fulhain District have hereunto affixed their common seal, and the West Metropolitan Tramways Company have affixed their common seal, the day and year first above written. PROPOSED ROADWAY TO CONNECT WOOD LANE AND LATIMER ROAD. In consequence of the frequent and, in many cases, fatal accidents to persons, workpeople, and others crossing by way of the Railway to and from Latimer Road, the Board have again made inquiries of the landowners, with a view of suggesting some scheme for the construction of a road to connect Wood Lane and Latimer Road, but hitherto they have not been able to induce the owners to concur in any proposition for an amicable arrangement. IMPROVEMENT OP NORTH END ROAD, FULHAM. The Board were able to make a favourable arrangement with the Midland Railway Company for the setting back of their proposed new Coal Offices to a line agreed upon, upon condition that the path was paved and the addition to the carriage-way constructed and made at the public cost. OAYLEY V. THE BOARD. This was an action instituted by Mr. Cayley, the freeholder of certain land in Town Mead Road, Wandsworth Bridge Road, Fulham, to restrain the Board from shooting dust, offal, or offensive refuse on certain land opposite 39 to the plaintiff's premises, and for damages already sustained. The action was settled upon payment by the Board of the sum of £10 for costs, and an undertaking was given, not to shoot dust, offal, &c.. for the future. cartage scheme.

A Special Report thereon was presented to the Board, as follows:— Board of Works for the Fulham District. Surveyor's Office, Broadway House, Hammersmith, W., 8th day of January, 1886. cromwell road bridge. Gentlemen,— Having fully considered the question referred to me, viz., the proposal to build a Bridge over the West London Railway to connect the Fulham District with South Kensington, and to form the necessary approach roads on either side of the railway, I beg to report as follows:— 1. As to the desirability of such a Bridge.—I am of opinion that it would be of immense value, not only to Fulham and Hammersmith, but to the adjacent parishes westward of this district, and 1 think I may fairly quote a paragraph from my report to the Board, January 5th, 1884, relating thereto :— "The advantages of such a line ot' communication between the Fulham District and South Kensington would be incalculable, forming as it would do, an almost direct road from Hammersmith, by way of the new road on the west side of St. Paul's New Schools (late Red Cow Lane) and Talgarth Road, which terminates in North End Road, nearly opposite the proposed road over the Bridge." 2. Position of Bridge and Approaches.—The Bridge itself is proposed to be about half-way between the Addison Road Bridge and Lillie Bridge over the same lines, and is approached on the Fulham side from a point in North End Road immediately abutting north on the "Three Kings" Tavern by a road 40 feet wide, with an easy gradient to the foot of the Bridge, where the gradient is increased to about 1 in 40. The Bridge itself will also be 40 feet wide, and the descent from the Bridge on the Kensington side will have a rather steeper gradient—about 1 in 30 (this is unavoidable, owing to the intersection of Warwick Road), and terminates at the west end of Cromwell Road West. On the Fulham side, the line of road will not. interfere with or cause the removal of any house property, but on the Kensington 44 side a number of houses will have to be taken down, and I am informed that satisfactory arrangements have been made, and an agreement entered into between "the Promoters of the Bill," which has received Parliamentary sanction, and Lord Kensington, the ground landlord. 3. Construction of Bridge, 8fc.—I have not had an opportunity of seeing any design for the Bridge, nor am I aware that any such has been actually made; but 1 have seen the Parliamentary Estimate in detail, prepared by the engineers, Messrs. Galbraith & Church, and from it I am enabled to say that the construction will be a wrought-iron Girder Bridge, in two spans, one of 150 feet, and the other 72 feet 6 inches, and altogether consuming some 430 tons of wrought-iron, and some 120 tons of cast-iron, the latter chiefly in columns, pannellings, copings, &c., and by the other details in said Estimate, I am enabled to say that every point seems to be well considered and calculated to form an excellent Bridge and good approach roads on either side. 4. Estimate of Cost, Sfc.—I have, as before stated, examined the detailed Parliamentary Estimates with the several prices affixed thereto, and also the estimated cost of the purchase of houses and lands required, and, in my judgment, they have been well considered, and may be accepted as a fair and just estimate of the cost of the proposed works, and I do not think the amount likely to be exceeded:— The estimated cost of houses and lands, after making allowance for resale of surplus land, is £19,387. 0s. Od. The estimated cost of the Bridge proper, is 12,011. 8s. 6d. The estimated cost of the approach roads, is 5,374. 9s. Od. Total £37,372. 17s. 6d. I am, gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ALFRED C. BEAN, Surveyor. cromwell road bridge. Gentlemen,—After conferring with the Surveyor upon the subject of your reference calling for a report as to the powers, &c., of the Board to give effect to the prayer of the memorial 45 presented to the Board on the 11th November, 1885, when an influential deputation attended, and the Rev. J. Macnaught urged upon the Board the importance of carrying into effect the powers of the Act obtained in 1884, and constructing the Bridge and approach roads as improvements, the cost of which should be borne partly by the Metropolis and partly by the District, which would derive a large benefit from the opening up of a direct line of communication between South Kensington and Fulham. The Act empowers the Board to enter into agreements with the undertakers for: — The construction of the Bridge and Roads, or any of them, or any part thereof respectively, and of the works connected therewith respectively, or any of them. The acquisition and appropriation of lands and property for the purposes of the works by the Act authorised, and any incidental matter. The Board is empowered by the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, 1862, with the previous consent in writing of the Metropolitan Board, to make, extend, widen, alter, or improve streets, and to raise on loan the sums necessary to defray the expenses, or to contribute and join with the Metropolitan Board, or any other body or persons, and the Metropolitan Board is empowered by the original Act, to make, &c., or to contribute and join with other persons in making such improvements. The period fixed by the Act for the compulsory purchase of lands is limited to three years (from 3rd July, 1885), and, having regard to the great importance as to the matter, it is advisable to consider whether it would not be desirable to obtain from Parliament some extension of power so as to permit of the effective working of the provisions of the Act. I am, gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS EDW. JONES, Clerk to the Board. The Board much regret that, owing to the great difficulties surrounding the question, no progress has been made even with the preliminary arrangements, but a committee of owners of property and residents in 46 West Kensington are considering as to a scheme to be submitted. list of new streets taken to by the board—march, 1885, TO march, 1886.

Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Hammersmith, Telephone No. 8,539. May 21, 188G. To the Trustees of the late Fulham District Board of Works. Gentlemen,—In accordance with the 43rd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 & 26 Vic. c. 102, it is my duty to present to you an annual report on the health of the Fulham District for the past year. My report will, as usual, deal with the vital statistics for the year ending January 2, 1880, and with the sanitary action taken by the late Board during the financial year ending on the 25th of last March. The Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment Act, 1885, having dissolved the Fulham District Board of Works, this is the last report on the health of the Fulham District which I shall have the honour of presenting. If we review the work performed by the late Board since the year 1877, and consider the progress that has been made in the sanitary administration of the District during the same period, I do not think we can come to any other conclusion but that a great work of improvement has been carried out, and that a vast amount of good work has been done to improve permanently the sanitary condition of the two parishes. Daring the last nine years (the period of my holding office) over 30,000 sanitary proceedings have been taken, having for their object the improvement of the sanitary condition of the District. So groat has been the progressive improvement in the sanitary administration that, during the last year of the Board's existence, there was actually quite as much sanitary action taken 79 in one week as was performed in a whole year prior to the year 1877. Although I can look back upon the period with some slight gratification, I regret very much to say that I cannot do so with feelings of pleasure. Nine years of sanitary work has taught me that a Medical Officer of Health who tries to perform his duties is sure to be subjected to constant annoyances. I do not think that there is any other officer who will be certain to get so badly treated as will a Medical Officer of Health who performs his duty. The Fulham District comprises an area of 4,003 acres. In the middle of last year its estimated population was 168,240 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three sub.Districts—namely, Fulham, which is the parish of Fulham, and St. Peter's and St. Paul's, which together constitute the parish of Hammersmith. These three sub.Districts are hereafter designated as Fulham, St. Peter's, and St. Paul's. Fulham contains an area of 1,766 statute acres, St. Paul's 2,102, and St. Peter's 185. In the middle of last year there were 24,000 inhabited houses in the whole District, against 22,500 in the middle of the previous year. On the estimated population in the middle of last year there was at that period an average of 7.01 persons to each house. Of the total inhabited houses in the middle of last year there were 10,000 in the parish of Fulham and 14,000 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 9,000 in the parish of Fulham and 13,500 in the parish of Hammersmith, in the middle of the previous year. During the whole year, therefore, there was an increase of 1,500 in the number of inhabited houses in the whole District. Of this increase there was an addition of 1,000 in the parish of Fulham, and 500 in the parish of Hammersmith. These figures have been obtained from the Yestry Clerks of the two parishes. On the estimated population in the middle of last year there was an average of 42.0 persons to each acre in this District, while in London there was an average of 54"2 persons to each acre. Besides the increase in the number of inhabited houses, a great many new ones have been constructed during the year, and not yet occupied. There are also, at the present time, a great many houses in the course of construction in different parts of the District. deaths. The number of deaths registered in this District during the 52 weeks ending January 2, 1886, .was 2,749—males, 1,381; females, 1,368, being one death to each 61.2 inhabitants, 80 against 2,737 in the previous year, which equalled one death to each 57.7 inhabitants. Deducting 110 deaths of non.parishioners which took place at the West London Hospital, the Western District Hospital at Fulham, and the Fulham Union Infirmary, and addiug 115 deaths of parishioners of this District which occurred in general hospitals and other public institutions in other Districts of London, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners of this District which occurred last year was 2,754, against 2,683, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners which took place in the previous year. The average number of the uncorrected deaths registered in this District during the last 10 years was 2,361. Making due allowance for the increase in the population, the deaths as registered in this District last year were 559 below the decennial average. The annual death.rate, taking the uncorrected deaths as registered last year in this District, was 16.3 deaths per 1,000 persons living, being 3.4 less than the death.rate of London, which was 19.7. The mean death.rate in this District in the last 10 years (1876.1885) was 20'2 per 1,000 persons living per annum, while that in London during the same period was 21*8. The corrected death.rate of parishioners of this District which occurred last year was the same as the uncorrected death.rate. Of the deaths as registered in this District last year, 105 took place in St. Peter's, 1,348 in St. Paul's, and 1,296 in Fulham, against 129 in St. Peter's, 1,249 in St. Paul's, and 1,339 in Fulham in the previous year. The average number of deaths registered in the three sub.Districts during the last 10 years was—St. Peter's, 122; St. Paul's, 1,154; and Fulham, 1,085. There was, therefore, last year, as compared with the last decennial average, and making no allowance for the increase in the population, a decrease of 17 deaths in St. Peter's, an increase of 194 in St. Paul's, and an increase of 211 in Fulham. TABLE I. The following table shows the deaths as registered in the Fulham district and in the three sub.districts in the years 1885 and 1884, also the average numbers in the ten years 1876 and 1885:— District or Sub.District.

The number of deaths of infants at one year of age and under was 823, against 826 in the previous year. Of those last year there were 30 in St. Peters, 395 in St. Pauls, and 398 in Fulhatn, against 32 in St. Peter's, 383 in St. Pauls, and 411 in Fulham in the previous year. The deaths of infants registered in this district last year were equal to 29'9 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and 15.3 per cent. of the total registered births. The deaths of infants at one year of age and under last year in London were equal to 24.5 percent. of the total deaths registered, and 14.8 per cent. of the total registered births. In the three sub.districts the per centages of these deaths to the total deaths and total births, respectively, were, St. Peter's 28.6 and 12.7, St. Paul's 29 3 and 15.2, Fulham 30.7 and 15.6. This mortality rate, therefore, was, as compared with the total deaths and total births, greater in the Fulham district than in London. It was greater in St. Paul's and Fulham than in London both as compared with the total deaths and total births. It was greater in St. Peter's than in London as compared with the total deaths, but less in St. Peter's than in London as compared with the total births, 81. TABLE 11. Locality.

During last year 574 deaths of persons at 60 years of age and upwards were registered in the Fulham district against 499 in the previous year. Of these deaths last year there were 31 in St. Peters, 288 in St. Paul's, and 255 in Fulham, against 37 in St. Peter's, 251 in St. Paul's, and 211 in Fulham registered in the previous year. In the whole district these deaths last year were equal to 20.9 per cent, of the total deaths registered, while the per centage of the same deaths in London was 22.8. The per centages of these deaths in the three sub.districts were, as 82 pared with the total deaths registered in the three sab.districts, equal to 29.5 in St. Peter's, 21.4 in St. Paul's, and 19.7 in Fulham. This death.rate was therefore in this district 1.9 per cent. less than in London. It was lower in St. Paul's and Fulham than in London, and it was greater in St. Peter's than in London. It was lower in Fulham than in either of the other sub.districts. The higher the percentage of these deaths the more favourable is the indication. In districts, however, like the Fulham district, in which the population is greatly increasing by immigration, there is always a very large proportion of young persons among the inhabitants; consequently, there is always a somewhat low percentage of senile deaths as compared with the total deaths registered.

It is satisfactory to be able to record that the death-rate in this district last year was 3.9 below the last decennial average, and 5.5 less than the last decennial average in London, although the density of the population in this district has increased during the last 10 years from 21.8 to 42.0 persons to each acre. TABLE V. The following table shows the mean temperature and the deaths of each sex registered in the Fulham district in each of the quarters of the year 1885 :— Quarter. Mean temperature, Fahrenheit.

The first and third quarters were the periods in which the mean temperature was lowest and highest. The low temperature in the first quarter of the year caused an increase in the number of deaths from lung diseases. The high temperature in the third quarter of the year caused an increase in the number of deaths from bowel complaints. A very high temperature or a very low temperature always causes an increase in the mortality rate. The deaths of males exceeded those of females by 13. The proportion of deaths of males to males living was, however, very much greater than the proportion of deaths of females to females living. The actual number of deaths of males was greater than that of females, although there was a very much greater number of females living than males. The mortality rate of males is always greater than that of females, consequently there is a much greater number of females living than males. 84 BIRTHS. The number of births registered in this district last year was 5,388 (males 2,759 females 2,629) against 5,392 in the previous year. The number of births of males exceeded that of females by 130. The births of males were in proportion to those of females as 104-100. Of the births registered last year there were 237 in St. Peter's, 2,606 in St. Paul's, and 2,545 in Fulham, against 240 in St. Peter's, 2,690 in St. Paul's, and 2,454 in Fulham in the previous year. The average number of births registered in the three sub-districts in the last 10 years was St. Peter's 233, St. Paul's, 2,250, and Fulham 1,859. The births last year in the whole district were at the rate of 30.2 per 1,000 persons living per annnm, being one birth to each 31.2 persons. The birth-rate in London last year was equal to 32.6 births per 1,000 persons living per annum, and to one birth to each 30.7 persons. The births exceeded the deaths in this district last year by 2,639. Estimating that the population has increased 10,515 in the year, 2,639 of this number was due to excess of births over deaths and 7,876 to immigration. TABLE VI. The following table shows the births registered in the three sub-districts in the years 1885 and 1884, also the average numbers in the 10 years 1876-1885:— Sub-district. Year 1885. Year 1884.

Of the so-called zymotic diseases, 538 deaths were registered, against 526 in the previous year, but, deducting the 62 deaths of non-parishioners from zymotic diseases which occurred (58) at the Western District Hospital at Fulham, (1) at the Union Infirmary at Fulham, and (3) at the West London Hospital at Hammersmith, and adding 15 deaths from zymotic diseases of parishioners of this district, which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other districts of London, the corrected number of deaths from zymotic diseases of parishioners of this district which occurred last year was 491, as compared with 474 in the previous year. There was, therefore, last year a comparative increase of 17 in the number of these deaths of parishioners as compared with those in the previous year, but, making due allowance for the increase in the population that has taken place, there was a comparative decrease of 14 deaths from these diseases last year as compared with the previous year. The deaths of parishioners from zymotic diseases last year were equal to 17.8 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 2.9 deaths per annum per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 14.1 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 2.8 deaths per annum per 1,000 persons living. There was, therefore, in this district last year a greater proportion of deaths of parishioners from zymotic diseases than in London, both as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered and with the number of inhabitants. As there is in this district a much larger proportion of poor-class inhabitants than in London, the death-rate from zymotic diseases is always rather higher in this district than in London. Of the 491 (the corrected number of) deaths from zymotic diseases which occurred last year, there were 22 in St. Peter's, against 13 in the previous year; 245 in St. Paul's, against 207 in the previous year; and 224 in Fulham, against 254 in the previous year. There was, therefore, last year, a comparative increase of 9 deaths in St. Peter's and 38 deaths in St. Paul's, but a comparative decrease of 30 deaths in Fulham. TABLE VIII. The following table shows the deaths from zymotic diseases of parishioners of the Fulham district which took place in the years 1884 and 1885:— G 86 Disease. Year 1884. Year 1885.

There was, therefore, last year, as compared with the previous year, a comparative increase of 17 deaths from zymotic diseases. SMALLPOX. During last year 157 cases of smallpox (males 87, females 70) were reported in this district. The cases of smallpox reported in this district during the previous eight years, from 1877 to 1884, both years included, were:- 1877, 328; 1878, 266; 1879, 166; 1880, 51; 1881, 327; 1882, 16; 1883, 0; 1884, 108. The total number of deaths from smallpox of inhabitants of London last year was 1,317. This represents about 13,170 persons attacked by the disease. The number of deaths of parishioners of the Fulham district was 28. This represents about 280 persons attacked. Of the 280 supposed to have been attacked, 157 were reported, and 123 are supposed to have occurred and to have not been discovered by the officers of your Sanitary Department. Estimating that there were 13,170 persons attacked by the disease in London, and 280 in the Fulham district, the proportion of persons attacked per 100,000 inhabitants in London was 322. The proportion of persons attacked per 100,000 in the Fulham district was 178. The 87 proportion of persons supposed to have been attacked by the disease in London was, therefore, nearly twice as large as in the Fulham district. It is more than probable that the energetic course which was adopted by the officers of your Sanitary Department had much to do with the Fulham district being so comparatively free from the disease. It is greatly to be regretted that there is no law to enforce the notification of cases of smallpox, and to ensure the proper isolation of all cases of smallpox that occur. Our efforts to prevent the disease from spreading must be to a considerable extent baffled until a Bill is passed effectually dealing with the matter. Of the 157 cases of smallpox reported last year, there were 50 in the parish of Hammersmith and 107 in the parish of Fulham, against 43 in the parish of Hammersmith and 65 in the parish of Fulham reported in the previous year. During every year of the last eight years in which smallpox has occurred in this district, there has been a greater number of cases of smallpox in the Fulham parish than in the Hammersmith parish, although the Hammersmith parish has by far the greater population. The popular idea has been that the larger number of cases in the Fulham parish has been due to the Fulham Smallpox Hospital. I do not coincide with the popular view of the case. It is my opinion that the presence of the hospital has to a very slight extent increased the number of cases in the Fulham parish,, but the hospital by no means accounts for the large number of cases which have occurred in the parish. The hospital is not at present, and I understand is not to be in the future, used for the treatment of smallpox cases; still, I have little doubt but that the difference in the number of cases in the two parishes will be maintained when smallpox is next epidemic in the district. The 157 cases of smallpox which were reported last year occurred in 89 streets and in 126 houses. In 66 streets the outbreak was confined to one house in each street; 55 cases occured singly in different houses in different streets. In 23 streets there was more than one house infected in each street. Thus, in one street. there were 5 houses infected; in 2 streets 4 houses infected in each street; in 6 streets 3 houses infected in each street; and in 15 streets 2 houses infected in each street. In 108 houses (out of the total of 126) there was only one case in each house. In 17 houses there was more than one case in each house. Thus, in one house there were 6 cases; in one house 5 cases; in 2 houses 4 cases in each house; in 4 houses 3 cases in each house; and in 9 houses 2 cases in each house. Of the 157 cases reported, 140 had been once vaccinated; 17 had never been G 2 88 vaccinated. In one case it was stated that the patient had been successfully re-vaccinated. This is the only instance, out of 1,419 cases of smallpox that have come under my official observation in the last nine years, in which it has been so much as alleged that the patient had been successfully re-vaccinated. This fact is very strong evidence in favour of the theory that re-vaccination has an almost absolute protective influence against an attack of smallpox. The ages varied from one day to 58 years. The average age was 27.5 years. The social positions of the patients were as follows:—2 shoemakers, 14 labourers, 4 wives of labourers, 1 widow of a labourer, 5 daughters of labourers, 4 carmen, 1 wife of a carman, 1 son of a carman, 1 daughter of a carman, 13 female domestic servants, 1 wife of a law clerk, 1 daughter of a law clerk, 1 scaffolder, 1 chimneysweep, 2 plumbers, 1 wife of a plumber, 1 plumber's labourer, 3 carpenters, 2 wives of carpenters, 1 daughter of a carpenter, 1 commercial traveller, 2 drapers' assistants, 1 wife of a fishmonger, 2 bakers, 1 daughter of a laundryman, 5 laundresses, 2 gardeners, 1 stoker at a gas works, 1 milk-seller, 2 railway clerks, 1 lamplighter, 1 artist, 1 barman, 1 wife of a barman, 1 barmaid, 1 foreman of a coal yard, 1 watchman, 1 gasfitter, 1 wife of a gasfitter, 1 widow of a gasfitter, 1 daughter of a gasfitter, 2 wives of painters, 1 daughter of a painter, 1 son of a painter, 1 gentleman, 1 wife of a gentleman, 1 illegitimate son of a gentleman, 1 daughter of a farmer, 1 daughter of a coal vendor, 1 cabdriver, 2 wives of cabdrivers, 2 butchers, 1 wife of a butcher, 1 son of a butcher, 1 wife of an engine-driver, 1 photographer, 1 school teacher, 1 teacher of music, 1 stableman, 4 clerks, 1 coachsmith, 1 apprentice to a lighterman, 1 daughter of a law stationer, 1 zincworker, 1 wheelwright, 1 builder,1 widow of a builder, 1 railway-ticket collector, 1 wife of a railway-ticket collector, 1 apprentice to a grocer, 1 stepson of a publican, 1 errand boy, 1 greengrocer's assistant, 1 needlewoman, 1 potboy, 1 son of a foreman at a brewery, 1 accountant, 1 son of an accountant, 1 porter at a draper's, 1 signwriter, 1 hospital nurse, 1 solicitor, 1 daughter of a coachbuilder, 2 bricklayers, 2 sons of an insurance agent, 3 daughters of an insurance agent, 1 wife of a commercial traveller, 1 daughter of a commercial traveller, 1 railway signalman, 1 son of a hairdresser, 1 wife of a hairdresser, 1 daughter of a farrier, 1 railwaycarriage cleaner, 1 dust contractor, 1 porter on a railway, 1 briclcmaker, 1 nurse, a female sugar-refiner. The total number of deaths of parishioners of this district from smallpox was 28. This gives a mortality rate of 17.8 per cent. 89 of the reported cases. Making an allowance of 123 for the cases that are supposed to have occurred and not reported, there would be a mortality rate of 10 per cent.—the usual mortality rate in this disease. Of the total 157 cases reported, 141 were treated at hospitals and properly isolated, and 16 were treated at the residences of the patients by private medical attendants, and were not reported until after complete recovery. Two cases were removed by the Fulham District Board, 138 by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and one patient walked to the hospital and was admitted. No case was removed by the Fulham Board of Guardians. Of the 138 cases removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 136 were removed at the request of the Fulham District Board; one at the request of the Fulham Board of Guardians; and one at the request of St. Bartholomew's Hospital authorities. 109 cases were treated at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Western District Hospital at Fulham; one at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital at Deptford; one at the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital at Homerton; 28 at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitalship at Long Reach; and two at the Highgate Smallpox Hospital. Of the total 157 cases reported during last year, 89.8 per cent, were removed to hospitals, as compared with 87.0 per-centage of removals in the year 1884. It is probable that the proportion of concealed cases was less last year than in the previous year. No death from smallpox was registered last year as occurring in a private dwelling-house in the district. Of the 50 cases reported in the parish of Hammersmith, 44 were removed to hospitals and properly isolated, and 6 were treated at the patients' homes. Of the 107 in the parish of Fulham, 97 were treated at hospitals and properly isolated, and 10 were treated at the homes of the patients. Thus, of the reported cases in the Hammersmith parish, 88.0 per cent, were treated at hospitals; while of the cases reported in Fulham, 90.7 per cent, were treated at hospitals. I am of opinion, however, that the proportion of cases concealed in the parish of Fulham was greater than in the parish of Hammersmith; also that the difference in the number of cases which occurred in the two parishes was probably due to the larger number of cases concealed in the parish of Fulham than in the parish of Hammersmith. The 16 cases not removed were not reported until after the complete recovery of the patients. It is very satisfactory to be able to state that in every case which was reported last year to your officers before the complete recovery of the patient, your officers were able to procure the removal of the patient to an 90 hospital. It is certainly most satisfactory to be able to report that out of the total 126 houses in which cases of smallpox occurred last year, in only one instance did a second person contract the disease after the first case was reported to the Sanitary Department. All of the houses in which outbreaks of smallpox occurred last year were immediately visited by myself. A strict investigation as to the source of infection was made, and all of the persons residing in the infected house, who did not object to the operation, were at once vaccinated. Where the origin of the disease was traceable to another house in the district, a further investigation was made; and where the case was traceable to a house in another district, the Medical Officer of Health of the district was at once telegraphed to, and informed of the facts of the case. Detailed particulars as to all of the interesting outbreaks of smallpox which occurred last year have been given in my four quarterly reports. It is, therefore, not necessary that I should again refer to them in this report. TABLE IX. The following table shows the number of cases of smallpox that were reported in each of the parishes of the Fulham district during each of the twelve months of the year 1885; also the number of cases that were treated at hospitals, and the number that were treated at the homes of the patients:— Month, Parish of Hammersmith.

CHICKEN-POX. During last year, 10 cases of chicken-pox wore reported in this district against 4 cases reported in the previous year. The 16 cases which wore reported last year all occurred in the parish of Fulham. Five of the cases reported last year occurred in one house at the same time. The 5 patients were seen by a private medical attendant, who diagnosed the disease as smallpox, and certified for the removal of the patients to a smallpox hospital. On July 11 they were all removed by the Metropolitan Asylum Hoard to the Hospital Ship at Dartford. Upon the arrival of the patients at the hospital, the medical superintendent diagnosed the disease as chicken-pox, and ordered that the patients should be immediately taken back to their home at Fulham; all of the patients wore at once brought back. On July 12 1 visited the house, and found that all of the patients were undoubtedly suffering from chicken-pox. SCARLET-FEVER. During last year there wore 112 cases of scarlet-fever (males 51, females 61) reported in this district, against 248, 108, 152, 278, 281, 172, and 125 cases reported in the 7 years from 1878 to 1884. These numbers do not at all represent the actual number of cases that occurred in the district, as a very large proportion of the cases that occur are always treated at the homes of the patients, and never reported at all. The figures may, however, be taken to somewhat accurately represent the proportion of cases that have occurred in the last eight years. Of the 112 cases reported last year, there were 76 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 36 in the parish of Fulham, against 57 in the parish of Hammersmith and 68 in the parish of Fulham reported in the previous year. There was, therefore, last year, as compared with the year previous, an increase of 19 cases in the parish of Hammersmith, and a decrease of 32 cases in the parish of Fulham. The number of deaths of parishioners from scarlet-fever that occurred last year was 14 against 19 in the previous year. In London there were 707 deaths registered from scarlet-fever last year, against 1,444 in the previous year. These 14 deaths which occurred last year, were equal to 0.50 per 95 cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.08 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from scarlet-fever in London last year were equal to 0.88 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.17 deaths per 1,000 persons living. Out of the 14 deaths which occurred last year, in 8 cases no information was obtained by the officers of the Sanitary Department until after the deaths of the patients. The first information that was obtained of these 8 cases was in the death returns. Thirty cases were not reported until after the recovery of the patients. In 21 cases, an offer made by the Fulham District Board to have the patients removed to an hospital was refused. In not one of these cases was the accommodation for the treatment of the patient so bad that a magistrate's order could have been obtained to enforce the removal of the patient to an hospital. Fifty-three cases were treated at hospitals, and 59 cases were treated at the homes of the patients by their private medical attendants. Of the 53 cases treated at hospitals, 44 were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Western District Hospital at Fulham; 43 were removed to this hospital by the Metropolitan Asylum Board, and one by the mother of the patient. Of the 43 removed by the Metropolitan Asylum Board, 40 were taken at the request of the Fulham District Board of Works, and 3 at the request of the Superintendent of Marlesford Lodge. One case was admitted into the Homerton Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylum Board. The patient was removed there by the Metropolitan Asylum Board from the German Hospital at the request of the authorities of the German Hospital. Eight cases were admitted into the London Fever Hospital at Islington; 6 were removed at the request of the occupiers of the houses where the cases had occurred by the Islington hospital authorities, and 2 cases were removed by and at the expense of the Fulham District Board of Works. From the number of deaths that occurred, we may fairly estimate that there were about 280 persons attacked by the disease in this district last year, against 380 in the previous year. If we take into consideration the fact that of the 280 cases supposed to have occurred there were only 112 reported, it is not at all surprising that scarlet-fever continues to be endemic in the district, and that the means adopted by the late Fulham District Board, although very perfect as far as they were able to go, were, nevertheless, not sufficient to stamp out the disease. 96 TABLE XI. The following table shows the number of cases of scarlet-fever that were reported in each parish of the Fulham district during each of the twelvemonths of the year 1885, also the numbers of cases that were treated at hospitals and the numbers that were treated at the homes of the patients.

Scarlet-fever is generally epidemic in London in the latter half of the year, and usually by far the greater number of cases occur during that period. TABLE XII. The following table shows the number of cases of scarletfever reported in each parish of the Fulham district during the year 1885, the date when each case was reported, the number of cases in each street, the number of infected houses, and where the patients were treated:— PARISH OP HAMMERSMITH.

There were 29 cases of diphtheria (males 13, females 16) reported last year, 17 of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 12 in the parish of Fulham, against 28 in the previous year, of which there were 18 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 10 in the parish of Fulham. Of the 29 cases which occurred last year, 8 were not reported until after the recovery, and 10 until after the death of the patients; 19 cases were treated at the homes of the patients, 6 cases were removed by the patients' relatives to the West London Hospital, and 4 cases were removed by the relatives of the patients to St. George's Hospital. The number of deaths from diphtheria of parishioners of this district last year was 21. The deaths from diphtheria of parishioners of this district last year were equal to an annual rate of 0.76 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.12 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants living. The deaths from diphtheria in London during last year were equal to 1.12 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.22 deaths per 1,000 persons living. WHOOPING-COUGH. There were 104 cases of whooping-cough reported last year, of which 46 occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 58 in the parish of Fulham, against 115 cases reported during the previous year, of which 70 occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 45 in the parish of Fulham. The 104 cases which were reported last year were first reported in the death returns. The deaths of parishioners of this district from whooping-cough which occurred last year were equal to 3.78 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.62 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from whooping-cough last year in London were equal to 3.12 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.61 deaths per 1,000 persons living. TYPHUS FEVER. One death was registered as occurring from typhus fever during last year, against no case in the previous year. The case registered as typhus fever last year occurred in the parish of Fulham. From an investigation that I made, I ascertained 100 that the evidence obtainable after the death of the patient was quite against the idea that the patient had had typhus fever. The whole history of the illness indicated a very well-marked case of typhoid fever. the case registered as typhus fever was treated at the homo of the patient, and not reported until after death. the death was equal to an annual rate of 0.04 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and was equivalent to 0.01 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants living. The deaths from typhus fever in London were equal to 0 04 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.01 deaths per 1,000 persons living. TYPHOID FEVER. There were 26 cases of enteric, or typhoid, fever reported last year, of which 14 occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 12 in the parish of Fulham, against 38 cases in the previous year, of which 24 occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 14 in the parish of Fulham.

In one case an offer made on behalf of the Fulham District Board to remove the patient to an hospital was refused. During last year there were 17 deaths from typhoid fever of parishioners of this district. These deaths wore equal to an annual rate of 0.61 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.09 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants living. the deaths last year from enteric fever in London were equal to an annual rate of 0"73 per cent, of the total deaths registered, and woro equivalent to 0"14 deaths per 1,000 persons living. MEASLES. During last year 363 cases of measles (males 187, females ] 76) were reported in this district; 273 of these cases occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 90 in the parish of Fulham, against 218 cases in the previous year, of which there were 23 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 195 in the parish of Fulham. 101 There were 119 deaths from measles of parishioners of this district during last year. These deaths were equal to 4.32 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.71 deaths per 1,000 persons living.

In two cases an offer made on behalf of the Fulham District Board to remove the patients to an hospital was refused, and one case was removed by the Fulham District Board to the Islington Fever Hospital. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. There were 5 cases of simple continued fever (males 2, females 3) reported last year, 2 of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, and 3 in the parish of Fulham, against 5 cases in the previous year, 3 of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith and 2 in the parish of Fulham. All of the cases which occurred last year were first reported after the death of the patients. The deaths last year from simple continued fever of parishioners of this district were equal to 0.18 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 00.3 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths last year from this disease in London were equal to 0.18 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.02 deaths per 1,000 persons living. DIARRHOEA. There were 180 cases of diarrhoea reported last year, of which there were 100 in the parish of Hammersmith and 80 in the parish of Fulham, against 166 in the previous year, of which there were 79 in the parish of Hammersmith and 87 in the parish of Fulham. All the cases last year were reported in the deathreturns after the deaths of the patients. The deaths from diarrhoea of parishioners last year were equal to 6.32 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 1.07 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from diarrhoea in London last year were equal to 3.34 per cent. of the total deaths registered and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.65 deaths per 1,000 persons living. H 102 ENGLISH CHOLERA. There were two cases of English cholera reported last year, both of which occurred in the parish of Fulham, against 13 cases in the previous year, of which 10 occurred in the parish of Hammersmith and 3 in the parish of Fulham. Both of the cases last year were not reported until after the death of the patients. The deaths of parishioners from English cholera last year were equal to 0.07 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to the annual rate of 0.0l deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from English cholera in London last year were equal to 0.1 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0-02 deaths per 1,000 persons living. No case of Asiatic cholera was reported in England during last year. The cases reported as English cholera are only very severe cases of diarrhoea. PUERPERAL FEVER. There were 5 cases of puerperal fever reported during last year, 2 of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith and 3 in the parish of Fulham, against 2 cases in the previous year, 1 of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith and 1 in the parish of Fulham. Four of the cases which occurred last year were not reported until after the death of the patients, and the other case was not reported until after the patient's recovery. The 4 deaths which occurred last year were equal to 0.14 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.02 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from this disease in London last year were equal to 0.4 per cent. of the total deaths registered and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.08 deaths per 1,000 persons living. In all of the cases which occurred in this district last year the nurses who had attended on the patients were written to by myself and warned that they should not attend at any other confinement for a period of one month from the time that they left the houses where the cases had occurred. They were also requested to have their persons and their clothes thoroughly disinfected. ERYSIPELAS. During the last year 12 cases of erysipelas were reported in this district, 9 of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith and 3 in the parish of Fulham, against 4 cases in the previous year, of which there were three in the parish of Hammersmith and one in the parish of Fulham. Of the cases which occurred 103 last year 11 were not reported until after the deaths of the patients. One case was reported before the recovery of the patient. As there was no hospital to which this case could be removed, he was treated at home by his private medical attendant. The 11 deaths from erysipelas were equal to 0.40 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.07 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from erysipelas in London last year were equal to 0.41 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were equivalent to an annual rate of 0.07 deaths per 1,000 persons living. violent deaths. There were 84 deaths from violence, of which there were 59 in the parish of Hammersmith and 25 in the parish of Fulham, against 95 in the previous year, of which there were 68 in the parish of Hammersmith and 27 in the parish of Fulham. Owing to there being a public hospital in the parish of Hammersmith, there is always a larger number of deaths registered as from violence in the parish of Hammersmith than in the parish of Fulham. inquests. There were 208 inquests held in this district last year, of which there were 128 in the parish of Hammersmith and 80 in the parish of Fulham, against 231 in the previous year, of which there were 131 in the parish of Hammersmith and 100 in the parish of Fulham. deaths in public institutions. During last year 381 deaths were registered as occurring in public institutions in this district. Of this number there were 102 in the parish of Hammersmith and 279 in the parish of Fulham, against 345 in the previous year, of which there were 102 in the parish of Hammersmith and 243 in the parish of Fulham. Of the 102 deaths in the parish of Hammersmith, 99 (male 58 and females 41) occurred at the West London Hospital and 3 (males) at the Convict Prison, Wormwood Scrubbs. Of the 279 in the parish of Fulham, 182 (males 84, females 98) took place at the Fulham Union Workhouse, 97 (males 51, females 46) occurred at the Metropolitan Asylum Western District Hospital at Fulham, and one (a female) took place at the Female Convict Prison. The deaths registered as occurring in public institutions in the district included those of non-parishioners. In the corrected number of deaths of parishioners these deaths of nonnarishioners were excluded. H 2 104 uncertified deaths. The cause of deaths in 15 instances was not certified by a registered medical practitioner, or by a coroner. piggeries. During last year 8 legal proceedings were taken against persons for keeping swine in localities unfit for the keeping of swine. In 5 cases the orders of the Board to remove the swine were obeyed, and it was not, therefore, necessary to take any further action. In 2 cases summonses were taken out against persons for the recovery of penalties for having disobeyed the orders of the Board to remove the swine. By the hearing days (after in one case an adjournment) the swine had been removed, and the summonses were withdrawn on the payment by the defendants of £1. 3s. in each case. In one case, that in which swine were kept at 15, Brook Green Road, an undertaking was given that the swine should be removed within a period of three months. The undertaking was given in the first quarter of the year, but on the following October (more than six months afterwards) the swine were still kept upon the premises. The keeper of the swine had a licence to keep cows upon his premises. The Fulham District Board gave him notice that the application for the renewal of his licence would be opposed at the meeting of the Justices at Kensington Sessions on October 20th, unless the swine were removed from off the premises on or before October 19th. The swine were removed by the date specified, and as no more swine have since been kept upon the premises, it has not been necessary to take any further action in the matter. The Fulham District Board had before them a communication from the Metropolitan Board of Works in reference to a nuisance caused by the keeping of swine in Old Oak Lane. The matter was referred to the Sanitary Committee, and I was instructed to report on the subject. At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee I presented a special report in reference to the nuisance caused by these piggeries (see my Quarterly Report, fourth quarter, 1885, pages 21 and 22). The Sanitary Committee referred the communication from the Metropolitan Board of Works, together with my report, to the Fulham District Board. That Board sent up a copy of my report to the Metropolitan Board of Works. licensed slaughter-houses. The whole of the licensed slaughter-houses were kept under a regular quarterly inspection during last year. In the whole 105 district there are 26 licensed slaughter-houses, of which 19 are in the parish of Hammersmith and 7 in the parish of Fulham. At the annual inspection of slaughter-houses, I found that 14 were in a perfectly satisfactory condition, and 12 were not in a perfectly satisfactory condition. The Fulham District Board gave notice to 12 butchers that they would oppose their applications for the renewal of their licences at the meeting of the Justices at Kensington Sessions on October 6th, unless by October 5th they had complied with the requirements of the Board as was specified in the notice. On October 5th it was found that in every case the requirements had been complied with. At the meeting of the Justices at Kensington Sessions, on October 6th, the Fulham District Board did not oppose any of the licences, and the whole of them were granted. licensed cowhouses. The whole of the licensed cowhouses in the district were kept under a regular quarterly inspection during last year. In the whole district there were 26 licensed cowhouses, of which 10 are in the parish of Hammersmith and 16 in the parish of Fulham. In the previous year there were 33 licensed cowhouses in the district—15 in the parish of Hammersmith and 18 in the parish of Fulham—in the third quarter of the year. I inspected the whole of the licensed cowhouses. I found that 8 were in a perfectly satisfactory condition, while 18 were not in a perfectly satisfactory condition. The Fulham District Board gave notice to 18 of the licensed cowkeepers, informing them that they would oppose their applications for the renewal of their licences on October 20th, unless the requirements as specified in the notice were complied with on or before October 19th. By October 19th, 12 of the cowkeepers had complied with the requirements, and the licences were granted on October 20th without opposition. In 6 instances the requirements had not been complied with. In reference to one applicant, whose premises were at 249, King Street West, a written undertaken was given that the requirements wonld be complied with in the course of the next summer. This was explained to the Bench, and the licence was granted on that understanding. In one case the applicant did not apply, and in one case no notice had been given to the Bench. The hearing of these applications was adjourned for fourteen days. In one case—that of Thomas O'Connor, of Greyhound Road—the Fulham District Board opposed the application. The premises had been found to be in a very unsanitary condition. The applicant was found to be keeping 106 30 cows, while his licence was endorsed for only 17, and he had not complied with the requirements of the Board. The Bench, however, granted the licence, notwithstanding the Board's opposition. In one case, that of William Jarvis, of 208, Goldhawk Road, the Board opposed the application, on the ground that the requirements had not been complied with. These premises had never been found to bo in as bad a state as the premises in Greyhound Road, yet the Bench refused to grant the licence. In one case, that of Elizabeth Price, of King Street, West, the Board opposed tho application. The applicant having stated that she was willing to comply with the requirements, the Bench adjourned the hearing of the application for a period of 14 days. At the adjourned meeting of the Justices at Kensington Sessions, the adjourned applications of 6 cowkeepers were called. In one case, that of a Mr. John Keen, the licence was granted. Mr. Keen had not complied with the requirements of the Board; but, as he promised to do so, and as his premises were not in a very bad sanitary condition, no opposition was made to the renewal of his licence by the Board. In reference to three applicants who did not appear on the previous occasion, and who had not failed to comply with any of the Board's requirements, the licences were granted without opposition. In the case of James Bosher, of 253, Latimer Road, and of Elizabeth Price, of 217, King Street, West, none of the Board's requirements had been complied with. The applicants did not appear. On behalf of the Board the licences were opposed, and they were not granted. bakehouses. The whole of the bakehouses in the district were kept under a regular quarterly inspection during last year. There were in the last quarter of the year 132 bakehouses in the whole district, 70 of which were in the parish of Hammersmith, and 62 in the parish of Fulham. At the inspection made in the fourth quarter of the year, 105 bakehouses were found to be in a proper sanitary condition, strictly in conformity with the regulations. In 27 instances they were found to be not in a proper sanitary condition. In every instance where a breach of the regulations was discovered on inspection, a letter was sent to the baker from the Sanitary Department calling upon him to forthwith remedy the insanitary condition. In every case the requirements of the letter were complied with. 107 houses let in lodgings. During last year the late Board made regulations as to the houses let in lodgings in conformity with an order of the Local Government Board. These regulations were made under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the 47th section of the Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, 1874, and were confirmed by the Local Government Board on May 8, 1885. The regulations give, practically speaking, all the power that is required to put the dwellings of the poor in a proper sanitary condition. It will, therefore, in future be the fault of the Sanitary Authority if the dwellings of the poor are not kept as they should be. It should be remembered, however, by the Sanitary Authorities that these regulations cannot be properly put in force without a very large staff of Sanitary Inspectors being employed. It will take at least 12 competent Sanitary Inspectors to attend to the sanitary work of the two parishes if the regulations are properly put in force. I have not, however, the slightest hesitation in expressing my opinion that no time should be lost in putting these regulations thoroughly in force. sanitary work. During last year 3,435 notices were served by your Sanitary Inspector, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances ; and during the same period 3,742 notices (old and new ones) were complied with. During last year the Sanitary Committee ordered 726 conditional summonses against persons for not having complied with notices which had been served upon them. Before any summons was taken out a letter was written to the person against whom the summons had been ordered, informing him that the Sanitary Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he was willing to give an undertaking in writing to forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In most instances the necessary undertaking was at once given. During last year 92 summonses were taken out at the Hammersmith Police-court through the Sanitarv Department. The following is a list of the premises in reference to which summonses were taken out, together with the results of the proceedings:— 108 Situation of Premises. Nature of Offence.

The fines and the costs recovered have been paid into the Accountant's Department. Deducting the costs incurred by the Board, a balance profit of £53. 14s. 2d. was paid into the Board's account. During last year 188 cases of infectious diseases were removed to hospitals by or at the request of the late Board, and during the same period the disinfection of houses and infected articles was, in every instance in which permission could be obtained, carried out through the Sanitary Department in reference to 712 cases of infectious diseases. public mortuary. No further action was taken last year by the late Board towards providing a public Mortuary for the district. This course was a correct one, as the District Board was about to be dissolved. Proper public Mortuaries are, however, urgently required in the two parishes. The two Vestries now incorporated should lose no time in providing proper Mortuaries for the parishes. A public Mortuary should be divided into four separate portions, i.e. :—I. A compartment for the reception and isolation of bodies of persons who have died from infectious diseases. II. A compartment for the reception of bodies of persons who have been picked up in the streets or drowned. There should be a proper reception-room to this portion of the Mortuary for the accommodation of persons who visit the Mortuary for the purpose of identifying the bodies. III. A proper post-mortem room for the autopsy of bodies when such is ordered by the coroner. IV. A compartment for the coroner 112 to hold inquests. The compartment should have a small waitingroom attached for the accommodation of witnesses. During last year the late Board removed one dead body of a person who had died from an infectious disease to the Hammersmith Cemetery. There were two bodies removed by the Board to the temporary Mortuary at the Wharf Chancellors. One of these was removed from the parish of Hammersmith, and one from the parish of Fulham. There were 24 dead bodies brought to the temporary Mortuary at tho Wharf Chancellors during last year; 10 of these were removed from tho parish of Hammersmith, and 6 from the parish of Fulham. Two were taken there as aforesaid by the Late Board, 2 were removed there under an order of a coroner, and 20 were taken there by tho police. public nuisances. During last year complaints were received in reference to public nuisances at the following places:—1. The Carrison Oil Works, Town Mead Road, Fulham (fumes from boiling of oils). 2. Fulham Marshes, Wandsworth Bridge (burning of soft core). 3. Tho Pottery, Fulham (black smoke). 4. Neighbourhood of Queen Street (falling of black particles from the Distillery and Messrs. Cowan's Soap Works, Barnes). 5. Brickfields, Wood Lane (burning of soft core). 0. Bishop's Creek (accumulation of offensive organic matter). 7. Frithville Gardens (carpet beating). 8. Distillery Lane (state of roadway and offensive odour from Distillery and Saccharine Works). 9. Brickfield at tho end of Cobbold Road (burning of soft core). Each of these complaints had immediate consideration. The particulars of each case, and the action taken by tho Sanitary Department, were fully reported in my Quarterly Reports for the year. meteorology. The average mean temperature registered during last year was 480.8 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 90o.2; tho lowest 22°.3. Rain fell on 106 days. The total quantity of rain registered as falling in the year was 24.0 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, N. C. COLLIER, Late Medical Officer of Health, April 20th, 188G. District of Fulham. The Dissopution of the Board. 48 and 49 Vict. Cap. 33. ACCOUNT OF THE PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS AND OF THE LOCAL INQUIRY. A REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TRUSTEES APPOINTED UNDER THE ACT. COPIES OF ORDERS ISSUED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AN ABSTRACT OF ACCOUNTS, ETC. THE SEPARATION OF THE PARISHES. In the month of April, 1885, a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by Lord Lewisham, which provided (inter alia) for the separation of the Parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith. The Board, in the first instance, opposed the Bill, in order to secure due consideration for the interests of the ratepayers, being of opinion that no such alteration of the law should be made until after full inquiry had been had as to the position of the district and the liabilities on mortgages of rates, the probable variation of the incidence of taxation, and the various and important details connected with their administration. After conferring thereon with Mr. G. W. Russell, of the Local Government Board, who in the meantime had taken charge of the Bill and made it a Government measure, and having considered the amendments to the Bill, proposed to be made in its passage through the House, the Board, having regard to the fact that Government, had resolved to push the Bill through, thought it prudent to abandon opposition. The Act, entitled the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885 (48 and 49 Vic. cap. 33), was ultimately passed,and,in pursuance of the powers therein contained, the Secretary of State for the Home Department instructed Major-General C. Phipps Carey to hold a local inquiry, which inquiry was held on Tuesday, the 16th March, 1816. A conference of members of the Board and of members of each of the two Vestries had previously held many meetings, at which, after very careful consideration, was elaborated the Scheme that was laid before the Inspector. In order to make the matter clear, an abstract of the evidence given at the inquiry is printed herewith. 115 The Offices of the Board, Broadway House, Hammersmith. TUESDAY, 16th MARCH, 1886. MINUTES of PROCEEDINGS at a Local Inquiry with reference to the Dissolution of the Board of Works for the Fulham District. Before Major-General Constantine Phipps Carey, R.E., with reference to the Apportionment of the Property, Claims and Demands, and the Debts and Liabilities of the Board. [From the Shorthand Notes of Messrs. Hibbit and Sanders, Selborne Chambers, Chancery Lane.] The Inspector.—Gentlemen, I will read the notice. "The Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885. Fulham and Hammersmith. Whereas the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885, provides for the dissolution of the Board of Works for the District of Fulham and the incorporation of the Vestries of the respective parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and Fulham, from and after the 25th day of March, 1886, and it is provided by Section 7 of that Act that the property, claims, and demands, and the debts and liabilities of the said District Board of Works shall be apportioned by one of Her Majesty's principal Secretaries of State between the said parishes; And, whereas, I, Constantine Phipps Carey, Major-General, R.E., have been directed to hold a Local Inquiry with reference to the subject of the said apportionment. I hereby give notice that I will attend at the office of the Fulham District Board of Works, Broadway House, Hammersmith, on Tuesday, the 16th day of March, 1886, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and will then and there be prepared to receive the evidence of any persons interested in the matter of the said application." I will read the Sections of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act which bear upon this subject. Section 3 provides that, "From and after the 25th day of March, 1886, the Board of Works for the District of Fulham shall be dissolved and the Vestries of the respective Parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and Fulham, shall, from that date, be incorporated, and shall 116 have all such powers, and be subject to all such provisions as if they had been named in Part II. of Schedule A to the said recited Act." The 7 th Section of the Act states that "All Byelaws and regulations made by the Board of Works for the District of Fulham and subsisting at the dissolution of the said Board shall continue in force in the Parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and Fulham, until repealed or altered in accordance with the law applicable thereto. The property, claims, and demands, and the debts and liabilities of the said District Board of Works shall be apportioned by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State between the said Parishes as he shall think fit, and he shall have power to give such directions as may seem to him to be expedient as to the sale and conversion of any of the property of the said District Board of Works, and as to the application of the proceeds or of any part thereof in payment of any of the debts or liabilities of the said Board, including any compensation for loss of office to which any of the Officers of the said Board may, in his opinion, be entitled or otherwise for the benefit of the said Parishes; and, until such apportionment, the claims and demands and debts and liabilities of the said Board shall not, by reason of its dissolution, cease or determine, but shall, with the property of the said Board, vest in such person or persons as the Secretary of State shall direct; and upon such apportionment the said property, claims, and demands, and debts and liabilities, shall, by virtue of such apportionment, be transferred and vest according to the same; provided that such apportionment may be made at one or at several times, and may be amended at any time within one year from the 25th day of March, 1886. The apportionment and directions of the Secretary of State under this Section shall be final and conclusive." Then Section 8, "If any of the Officers in the Service of the Board of Works for the District of Fulham shall, within one year from the dissolution of the said District Board, be appointed to an office in the service of the Vestry of either of the said Parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, or Fulham, the time during which he shall have been in the service of the said District Board shall, in com puting the time of his service for the purpose of superannuation under the Act passed in the 29th year of Her present Majesty, chapter 31, intituled, “An Act to provide for Superannuation Allowances to Officers of Vestries and other Boards within the area of the Metropolis Local Management Act/ be added to the time during which he shall have been in the service of such Vestry." I will now call upon the District Board to furnish me 117 with information as to the area, rateable value, and population of the parishes of Hammersmith and Fulham, and 1 will then suggest that the basis of apportionment should be proposed; and after that a statement of the debts, liabilities, and property, showing the heads under which the apportionment will have to be made. The heads, or groups, will then be considered in detail ; and, finally, the disposal of the officers and employes of the District Board, and the allowances recommended by the District Board, will be considered. Mr. Thomas Edward Jones (Clerk to the Board).—Sir, I have been instructed by the Board to prepare certain information to lay before you to-day relating to the questions you have suggested. I may state that the Board was incorporated by an Act passed in the year 1855, the 18 and 19 Victoria, chapter 120 (section 42). The first meeting of the Board was held on the 5th of December, 1855, in the Vestry Room of the Parish Church, and the meeting adjourned from there to the Fulham Union, the Board of Guardians having offered the use of their Board Room for the purpose, and the newly-constituted Board completed its business there. The first meeting of the Board on these premises—not in this room—the room was not built, was held on the 2nd of April, 1856. When the Board commenced its labours the character of the district was very different from that which it presents at the present time. It was of a semi-rural character, largely occupied by market-garden grounds and nurseries and brickfields, with ill-made roads, illpaved paths, ill-lighted, and very badly sewered—in fact not sewered at all—with covered sewers; there was a number of open ditches running through the district, which conveyed some part of the sewage to the river, the other part being retained in cesspools. The area of the district is 4,003 acres; that is, Fulham 1,716 acres, and Hammersmith 2,287 acres. I propose now, Sir, to give you statistics as to the population and the rateable value, and the growth in the number of inhabited houses, which will show you somewhat the change that has taken place in the character of the district. I hand in a statement. I will only give you the totals at the several dates I quote. In the year 1856, when the Board actually commenced its labours, there were 6,104 inhabited houses, with a population of 36,624 estimated. That population I have estimated in this way. I find from the census returns of 1851 that the actual figures gave an average of six persons per house, with a small addition of persons over that. Therefore, I have taken the 6,104 houses in 1856 as containing six persons, which gives you 36,624 I 118 persons, and the total rateable value at that time was £114,992. In 1861, according to the next census return, there were 6,615 houses inhabited, 128 houses building, and 360 empty. There was a population of 40,058 persons, and the rateable value was £133,720. Now that census return again gives an average of six persons to each house, leaving 188 persons over. In 1871, the date of the following census, there were 10,188 houses inhabited, 504 building, 1,329 empty, with a population of 66,041, and the rateable value was £279,560. The 1871 return gives an average of 6½ persons almost, there being 181 persons less, in 1881 the total number of inhabited houses was 16,355, houses building 1,061, and houses empty 2,365, with a population of 114,811, the rateable value being £545,854. That gives an average population of seven to each house, leaving 326 persons over. In 1886, the present year, I have taken the return of inhabited houses to be the same as we obtained last year from the Vestry Clerks of Fulham and Hammersmith, which gives a total of 24,336 inhabited houses. I have no information as to the number of houses building at the present moment, but there are 2,650 empty houses; and 1 estimate the population at 170,352. In order to arrive at that estimate I have gone back to the last census return of 1881, where I find the average to be seven per house and 326 persons over. I have therefore taken seven as the present average number. Certainly tho density of the population has not, in my opinion, grown less in these last five years. That gives us 170,352 as the present population, with a rateable value, to come into operation on the 6th of April, 1886, according to the Metropolis Valuation Act, of £818,583. You will observe the vast difference between 1856 and 1886; in tho thirty years the population has increased from 36,624 to 170,352, and the value has gone up from £114,992 to £818,583. There is another statistical return which will, perhaps, show you the change in the district. There does not appear to be any early return of the mileage of roads under the care and control of the Board. Of course, Sir, the mileage I am now about to give you does not represent the whole of the roads in the district, but simply the roads under the care and control of and maintained by the Board. In 1877 there were 39 miles of road under the care and control of the Board, with 78 miles of footpaths along those roads, and 11½ miles of footpaths where there were no roads, such as bridle-paths and church-paths. In 1880 there were 47 miles of carriage-way and 94 miles of foot-paths, with the 11½ miles of church-paths and other paths. In 1883 there were 53£ miles of carriage-way, with 107 miles of path—the 11£ miles still stood. In 1886 there are 57 miles 5 furlongs and 119 51 yards (a little more than 57½ miles) oF carriage-way, with 115 miles of paved pathways to those carriage-ways, in addition to church-paths and so on. Of course there are many miles of roads and streets, which we call "new streets"—newly laid out streets—that are not yet taken in charge by the Board. In order to provide the data thought to be necessary to enable the Secretary of State to make the order which he will presently make, the Board put itself in communication with the two Vestries—the Vestry of Fulham and the Vestry of Hammersmith—with a view of preparing some scheme to be laid before you to-day, so as to bring about a settlement, so far as was practicable, of the details, in an amicable manner, and that, I am very glad to say, has been done. The Board appointed a committee of eight members, and invited the Vestry of Fulham and the Vestry of Hammersmith to appoint a like number, thus forming a committee consisting of twenty-four members, who have taken the work in hand, and the result of their labours I shall have the pleasure of laying before you. The names of the gentlemen forming the committee appointed by the Board are as follows—Messrs. E. Bird, T. Chamberlen, R. L. Cosh, G. Brown, A. Glen, T. Hamer, T. 0. Sandell, P. P. Perry; by the Fulham Vestry—Messrs. S. J. Walden, the Rev. J. Morgan, H. Rayment, C. Elkins, W. Janes, J. Dyer, W. H. Smith, W. Davey; by the Hammersmith Vestry—Messrs. W. Mussared, G. S. Edwards, J. A. Smith, J. H. Green, W. Williams, N. Jackson, W. A. Cubitt, and C. C. Cramp. That committee, which I will call the Joint Committee, has held various meetings, and gone through the whole of the valuations, which will be submitted to you. As you are aware, Sir, the Secretary of State is about to appoint some person or persons, under the terms of the Separation Act, to act as Trustee or Trustees, in whom the property, debts, liabilities, and demands will vest at the dissolution of the Board. The names that have been put before the Secretary of State are as follows:—Messrs. E. Bird, G. Brown, T. Chamberlen, A. Glen, W. H. Harris, and P. P. Perry. Those names have been approved by the Vestries. Messrs. Bird, Brown, and Chamberlen by the Vestry of Hammersmith ; and Messrs. Glen, Harris, and Perry by the Vestry of Fulham. The Board has also appointed a large number of gentlemen to attend here to-day, to give you such information as you may require from them, and the Vestry of Fulham and the Vestry of Hammersmith have each appointed certain of their members to attend here to-day, so that you may have the fullest information before you, I 2 120 The Inspector.—The names of those trustees have been approved of ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Yes. The Inspector.—Have you the approval of the Secretary of State ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—No; not at present. I mean that the names have been approved by the two Vestries. I think now I have givenyou the preliminary information that youdesired tohave. The Inspector.—Yes. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I will now go to the consideration of the current accounts of the Board. The Inspector.—Will you take the basis of apportionment? Mr. T. E. Jones:—The basis of apportionment as proposed by the Joint Committee of twenty-four, representing the Board and the two Vestries, is that the liabilities should be apportioned according to the rateable value of the two parishes, the rateable value of the two parishes being, as I have already stated, £818,583, made up as follows: Fulham, £330,674, and Hammersmith, £481,909. That gives this result, that Fulham represents 41.13 per cent, of the total rateable value, and Hammersmith 58.87 of the total rateable value, and it is proposed that the liabilities should be apportioned on that basis. That proposal has been submitted to the consideration of the two Vestries, and they have agreed thereto, as I shall be able to prove to you in due course. I will now shortly explain to you, Sir, the heads under which the accounts of the Board are kept. The accounts of the Board are kept under several heads. I am talking now of the current banking accounts of the Board. No. 1 Banking Account is what we may call the General Working Account, which includes all the receipts upon Precepts for General Rate, for Lighting Rate, for Sewers Rate, and for Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, and the various contributions received on account of those rates. That account, of course, includes all the disbursements made on account of the making and maintenance of roads, paths, and sewers, the widening and improvement of streets, the lighting and cleansing of the thoroughfares, the carrying out of the sanitary work, and, in fact, the whole of the general work in the district. No. 2 Banking Account includes the receipts and disbursements for paving works in new streets. New streets, as you are aware, are streets taken to by the Board, and paved at the expense of the owners of the property abutting upon and forming such streets. The Inspector.—Streets that were private streets ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Streets that were private streets. They 121 become public streets by the action of the Board in taking to them. All streets laid out since the passing of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, are "new streets" within the meaning of that Act of Parliament, and all streets that had not been kept in repair by the local authorities previously to the passing of the Act are new streets, and in addition to that the very oldest road in the district may become a new street by reason of the action of builders going along and converting that which was formerly a lane or a road bounded by hedges and market gardens into a street, that may be treated as a new street, and paved at the expense of the owners of property bounding or abutting thereon. The new streets are classed under three heads. The first head will include new streets where the works have been completed and the accounts for works paid. In these cases the sealed apportionment and sealed plan upon which the apportionment is made would be transferred, and also the settlement of unpaid contributors' accounts whether for unpaid apportionment or the return of surplus money. Under the terms of the Act of Parliament the Board is obliged to keep and make up separate accounts for each new street, and if the amount received on the apportionment, which is based upon an estimate made by the Surveyor to the Board,is found to be in excess of the actual cost of the work, the surplns has to be returned to the owners of the property in the street. If, on the other hand, the amount claimed is found to be not sufficient to meet the cost, the Board has the power of making a further apportionment and recovering the balance of cost. The streets under this head it is proposed should be transferred to the Vestry of the parish in which the particular street may be situated, debiting or crediting the account for the final settlement, as the case may be. Under the second head is classed new streets, in relation to which plans and apportionments have been sealed and notices requiring payment of apportioned costs issued, but in respect of which no contracts for works have been entered into and no work carried out. The sealed plans and apportionments would be transferred to the Vestries, and the collection of apportioned costs and execution of works would be carried out by the Vestry of the parish in which the street might happen tobe situated, crediting the parishin theNew Streets Current Account with theamount received. Of course, payments on account of the settlement might be made from time to time as could be arranged by the Trustees with the sanction of the Secretary of State. The third group of new streets includes all new streets where the constructive works are in the hands of the contractors, or, if the works are carried out, are not yet passed as completed, and the accounts 122 not paid. The works will be carried out and completed under tho care of the Trustees, who will proceed with the collection, of the apportioned costs as rapidly as possible, and as soon as practicable return the surplus contributions, adjust and close the accounts, and hand the streets over to the Vestry of Fulham or Hammersmith as the case might be. That completes the New Street Account. We now come to the No. 3 Banking Account, which is what is called the Permanent Works or Disposal of Loan Account. The Board, as you are aware, obtains from time to time loans for carrying out special works. This is the Loan Account. All amounts received as loans are carried to this account. The account at present includes a sum of £6,700, which has been received for the purpose of wood-paving in the Hammersmith-road. Tho work of laying down that wood-paving is actually in course of progress at this moment. This work will be completed under the direction and care of the Trustees. Any surplus that may remain from that sum of £6,700 will be carried to the credit of the General Rate Account, of course to be dealt with in the final settlement. The amounts received on account of any works included in a Loan Schedule that have not yet been carried out or are not in progress will be transferred to the Vestry of the parish in which the particular work is to be carried out. This account also includes the sum of £5,500, which sum represents two amounts paid by the West Metropolitan Tramways Company in respect of their Hammersmith tramways. £1,000 was paid under the provisions of the Company's Act of 1882 towards the cost of permanent works. This sum is proposed to be treated as a joint asset. Of course, that would be divided between the two parishes in the proportions I have already given, namely, 41.13 and 58 87. There is a further sura of £4,500 paid under an agreement between the Board and the Company to provide in part for the maintenance of wood-paving in King Street West, Hammersmith. The liability for maintaining that wood-paving in Hammersmith will rest solely upon the Hammersmith Vestry. Therefore, it is proposed that £4,500 shall go to the Hammersmith Vestry. No. 4 Banking Account. —This is a Wages Account, with a capital sum of £600, which is drawn upon by myself by cheque countersigned by the Accountant for the payment of weekly wages. The account is recouped by a cheque drawn at each Board meeting for the actual sum of the past fortnight's wages. This account will be finally closed on the 25th of March. No. 5 Banking Account is what we call the "Private Works Account." It is composed of amounts, small or large, as the case may be, deposited by persons who desire permission to erect a hoarding or scaffold-poles, 123 or who desire to make some temporary use of the public highway. The Board demands a deposit of a certain amount in order to meet the cost of any works that may be necessary in making good the path or carriage-way after the applicant's work is done. The account also includes sums that are deposited by persons who apply to have connexions of house drains made to the public sewers. The Board does not allow private persons to make connexions with the public sewers. The Board does the work by means of its own workmen, and an account is kept of each separate connexion and made out upon the completion of the work, and the surplus of the deposit is returned to the depositor. In those cases where deposits have been made and no work has been carried out, the amount will be carried to the credit of either Vestry. In cases where the work has been done, or where work is in course of progress, as soon as it is completed the accounts will be adjusted as quickly as possible and closcd. No new work will be commenced as from last Saturday. We are endeavouring to get this particular class of work all closed up by the 25th of March. In addition to these live current accounts there are certain Trust Accounts. There is a deposit of £1,000 at the London and County Bank held in trust for the West Metropolitan Tramway Company as a guarantee for the maintenance of the Company's lines and works throughout the parish of Hammersmith. This relates wholly and solely to Hammersmith, and will be transferred to the Vestry of Hammersmith. I may state that such interest as may be allowed by the Bank is the property of and received by the Tramway Company. There is also a sum of £250 deposited with Messrs. Glyn, Mills, & Co., in the joint names of George Hopwood and Thomas Edward Jones (myself). This is an amount which is the agreed purchase money for certain land and buildings that have been given up at the "Swan" public-house, Walham Green, to effect a widening and improvement of the highway there. It was desirable to carry out the work as quickly as possible, and the Company were not prepared to convey at that moment; so the money was deposited at their request, and only awaits the conveyance, which is being completed as rapidly as we can get the Company to move. The whole of the banking, current, and deposit accounts will be closed on the 25th of March, and the balance of each account and the deposit will be carried to the credit of the Trustees about to be appointed. The Trustees will cause the accounts to be closed and prepared in proper form for audit, and will cause the abstract to be made and printed, together with the annual reports and returns, and other matters and things, as required by the provisions of 124 the Act of Parliament, 18 and 19 Victoria—the original Act. I now come to the Valuation of the Property of the Board. I present to you a schedule marked B, which contains a statement as to the freehold and leasehold property held by the Board, and includes the following items:—"Freehold Wharf, Chancellor's, Hammersmith, dwelling-house and wall round wharf, and making up surface (bought 18th March, 1868). Disinfecting chamber erected 31st March, 1878." The valuation of that property, as proposed by the Joint Committee, and agreed to by the Board and the two Vestries, appears at a "sum of £5,500. The original cost was £4,093. 12s. 8d. "Freehold land and stables, Union Court, Hammersmith, house, and so on. Land bought 7th February, 1879, buildings completed 1879/' That appears at a valuation of £10,500. The original cost was £12,243. 8s. 8d.—namely £6,000 paid for the land, and the cost of the buildings £6,243. 8s. 8d. You will observe the difference between the amount of the original cost and the present valuation. There is a decrease in the amount of the agreed valuation as compared with the original cost, which comes about in this way. The Board and the Joint Committee are of opinion that the price paid for the land at the time it was bought was excessive, and more than it was worth; but they are of opionion" that the land now is worth the sum of £4,000, which, added to the £6,243, the cost of the buildings, represents £10,243. 8s. 8d., or say £10,500, the agreed valuation. Then we come to these premises:—"Leasehold house, Broadway, Hammersmith; rent £50 per annum. Lease expires March, 1937, including value of Board-room and additions to house and fittings erected November, 1878 ; new Sanitary Office erected, January, 1884, valuation £7,500, the actual cost being £7,590. 14s. £d. Leasehold house and stables, 637, Fulham Road; rent, £105 per annum. Lease expires 29th September, 1936. Offices rebuilt 24th March, 1875, and stable buildings erected August, 1881. Valuation, £1,900. Original cost, £1,976. 12s." Now, Sir, the whole of this property has been inspected by the Joint Committee, and the whole of the facts as to the cost of the land and the terms of the leases, and the cost of the buildings, have been carefully considered. The result was the report and recommendation, with the figures I have already quoted, which was presented to the Board on the 3rd of February last. The Inspector.—The Joint Committee of both Vestries? Mr. T. E. Jones.—The Joint Committee, representing the Board and the two Vestries. A copy of the report, with the figures and the details, was forwarded to the Vestry of Fulham and to the 125 Vestry of Hammersmith, and to each member of the two Vestries, and on the 11th of February the Fulham Vestry approved of and agreed to that valuation. That I propose to formally prove to you presently by calling upon Mr. Foakes, the Vestry Clerk, to produce to you the certified copy of the minutes relating to that matter. The Hammersmith Vestry agreed in a like manner, on the 23rd of February, and that I shall prove formally presently by calling Mr. Cockburn, the Vestry Clerk of Hammersmith. I will now deal with the Moveable Property—the horses, carts, tools, vans, implements, machinery, and miscellaneous stock, and the furniture in Broadway House. The same Joint Committee, with the same care with which they went through the consideration of the valuation of the leasehold and freehold property, inspected and examined and fixed the prices upon all the goods that are contained in the detailed schedules of this moveable property. I have all the details in the room, and can give you each individual item that makes up the group of totals. I hand you a schedule marked C, wherein the furniture at Broadway House appears in the valuation at £913. 7s. l0d. The original cost was £1,141. 14s. 10d. Take off 20 per cent. for depreciation by wear and tear, and you arrive at £913. The cart-horses and nags make a total of £1,835. Each particular horse was valued individually. The Inspector.—Have you the number ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—52 cart-horses and 4 nags. The rolling stock, tools, implements, and so on, at the Walham Green Sub-Office and Depot make a total of £262. 12s.; the same class of goods at the Broadway House Depot, £282. 12s.; the same class of goods at the Wharf, Hammersmith, £33. 2s.; miscellaneous articles at the Stables Depot, £67. 18s.; stable necessaries at Depot, £79. 17s.; machinery, including two steam rollers, £852 ; oils and so on, £36. 15s. 9d.; iron and steel, £33. 17s. 8d.; bolts and nuts, £34. 4s. 11d. There are 48 slop-carts, 28 shoot-carts, 21 dust-carts, 4 water-carts, 2 gully-carts, 2 spring-carts, 1 slopvan, 39 water-vans, 1 stone-'bus, 2 road-sweepers, and 1 snowplough, amounting in value to £2,343; timber, £396. 13s. 3d.; and 2 ambulances at £40 (£20 each), and a cement tester £10, making a sum of £50. This valuation was also submitted in like manner as the valuation of the freehold and leasehold property, and has been approved and agreed to by the two Vestries, as I shall prove by calling the Vestry Clerks. I now come to the question of the Mortgage Liability. The Inspector.—Do you say anything about the proposed apportionment of the miscellaneous goods? 126 Mr. T. E. Jones.—The way in which these goods are proposed to be apportioued is this. The prices have been fixed on the individual articles, and the committee representing the two Vestries will meet, and will select such articles as either Vestry may desire to have. The Inspector.—That is as to what? Mr. T. E. Jones.—The live stock, moveable property, carts, tools, implements, and so on. The committee will say what each Vestry desires to purchase, and the amount as set out in the schedule of prices will be debited to the Vestry in question. I will deal next with the Mortgage Liability resting upon the district as at the 25th of March, 1886. It will be as well for me to state here that all the loans that are raised by the Board upon mortgage are mortgages that are secured upon the whole of the rates levied to meet the Board's precepts within the Fulham District. The amount that has been raised by the District Board during the thirty years of its operations is, of course, a very large one, necessitated by the condition of the district in 1856, and the carrying out of the important works that were indispensable in order to enable it to reach the position which it has reached at the present day. The Board has during the thirty years raised upon mortgage, and expended upon works for the improvement of the district, the sum of £237,436. I will hand you in a detailed list of these Loans. During that same period there has been paid off a sum of £130,392. 12s. 4d., and there is now outstanding £107,043. 7s. 8d. The amount of this outstanding liability is shown in this column [pointing] of the document I now hand in. This matter has been dealt with in precisely the same manner as the other matters that I have referred to as to the valuation of property, and so on. This question of indebtedness was brought under the notice of the Joint Committee and dealt with by them, and reported upon by them to the Board, and carried to the two Vestries; and the two Vestries have agreed to the proposal that the indebtedness should be apportioned, as I before stated, according to the rateable value of the district. That I shall formally prove to you by calling the Vestry Clerks in the same manner as I propose to do in relation to the other matters. Now, Sir, the details in relation to all these mortgages, and the method in which they shall be dealt with will be laid before you by the Chairman of the Finance Committee (Mr. T. Chamberlen), in accordance with the terms of a printed statement that some of these gentlemen have before them, I see. We now come to the Claims for Compensation addressed to you, 127 Sir, that have been received by the Board from its officers and employe's for compulsory loss of office. In all thirty-five claims were made, and they were, as suggested, submitted to the Board for its remarks to be made upon them. The Board in dealing with them divided them into three groups. The first group consists of thirteen officials, who, in the opinion of the Board, are entitled to compensation, and includes Messrs. Thomas Edward Jones, Clerk to the Board; F. W. G. Webb, Assistant Clerk; A. G. Keen, Second Assistant Clerk; W. A. Webb, New Streets Clerk; E. F. Tomkins, Accountant; A. C. Bean, Surveyor to the Board ; H. G. Bean, Assistant Surveyor; W. P. Jones and E. Mitchell, Superintendents of Roads and Works; N. C. Collier, Medical Officer of Health; R. C. Chamberlen and A. A. Croucher, Inspectors of Nuisances; and J. Bessell, Superintendent of Stable Depot. This group, for convenient consideration, may be sub-divided into further groups, some of the officers having been re-employed. The first sub-division includes Mr. F. W. G. Webb, Mr. A. G. Keen, Mr. W. A. Webb, Mr. E. F. Tomkins, Mr. H. G. Bean, Mr. E. Mitchell, and Mr. R. Chamberlen, each having been re-engaged by the Hammersmith Vestry, at a salary equal to or exceeding his present salary. Mr. Collier, the Medical Officer of Health, has been re-engaged by the Hammersmith Vestry, at a salary of £200 per annum, which leaves him with a loss of £150 per annum. Mr. W. P. Jones and Mr. A. A. Croucher have been engaged by the Vestry of Fulham, each at a salary equal to his present salary. That leaves Mr. T. E. Jones (myself), Mr. A. C. Bean, and Mr. Bessell without any appointment, and with total loss of income, and Mr. Collier with a partial loss of income. The Board dealt with these thirteen claims by separate resolutions on the 3rd of March—copies of which I beg to hand in—referring to the thirteen officers whom the Board had declared by resolution to be, in the opinion of the Board, entitled to compensation. I hand you certified copies. The Inspector.—None of these officers are employed? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Oh, yes, as I have already said, some of them have been re-employed. The Board's resolution on the 7th of February last was passed before the Vestries had employed any one. I present certified copy of the Board's resolution in relation to my own claim, in relation to the claim of the Surveyor, in relation to the Medical Officer's claim, and Mr. Bessell's, and the other officers enumerated in that list of thirteen. I present a tabular statement of these several claims, 128 showing the amounts recommended by the Board. The second group of officers as divided by the Board consists of five persons who, in the opinion of the Board, are not entitled to compensation. This group includes Mr. R. H. Davies, the Public Analyst; Mr. T. C. Jarvis, the Junior Assistant Clerk; Mr. H. R. Felkin, Second Assistant Surveyor; Mrs. C. A. Jones, Clerk and Office-Keeper at Sub-Office; and Miss L. Mitchell, Office-Keeper at this Office. I hand you a certified copy of the minute of the Board to that effect, and a tabular statement of the claims in the same form. The third group, as divided by the Board, consists of seventeen persons paid by weekly wages, who, in the opinion of the Board, are not entitled to compensation, and that list includes Messrs. T. Steed, New Streets Clerk; R. H. Meyer, Assistant Accountant; E. Mitchell, jun., Junior in Surveyor's Office; H. T. Percival, W. Parrett, and W. G. Stevens, Clerks of Works; J. W. Marsh, C. F. Weedon, and J. Cosson, Inspectors of Nuisances; W. Hestor, Clerk in Sanitary Office; J. Francis and H. Oatley, Dust Inspectors; C. Fowler, Wharf Keeper; C. Lowe, Messenger; A. Burleigh, Hall Porter; Mrs. E. Ford and Mrs. E. Painter, Office Cleaners. I put in a certified copy of the Board's minute in relation to that matter, and present a tabular statement in the same form as the others. All these seventeen weekly servants whose names I have read to you are under notice to quit the service of the Board on Saturday next, the 20th. The various claims summarised will appear as follows:—Left without office, and with total loss, Messrs. T. E. Jones, A. C. Bean, J. Bessell, Mrs. C. A. Jones, and Miss L. Mitchell. Re-employed, but at a lower salary, Messrs. N. C. Collier (loss of £150 per annum), R. II. Davies (loss of £75 per annum). Re-employed at a salary equal to or exceeding present salary, Messrs. F. W. G. Webb, A. G. Keen, T. C. Jarvis, E. F. Tomkins, W. A. Webb, H. G. Bean, H. R. Felkin, W. P. Jones, E. Mitchell, R. Chamberlen, A. A. Croucher. Of the persons paid by weekly wages, all of whom, as I have before said, are under notice to quit on the 20th, there have been re-employed at wages equal to or exceeding present wages, Messrs. T. Steed, R. H. Meyer, J. W. Marsh, J. Cosson, W. Hestor, J. Francis, 11. Oatley, C. Fowler, C. Lowe, A. Burleigh; while the following weekly servants are left without employment : E. Mitchell, jun., H. T. Percival, W. Parrett, W. G. Stevens, C. F. Weedon, Mrs. E. Ford, and Mrs. E. Painter. I may state for your information, Sir, that there is an action at law pending against the Board at the suit of one Gustav Kemp, 129 of Westcroft Square, Hammersmith, who claims damages on account of the Board having, as he alleges, improperly disinfected his house after the removal of a case of smallpox. Notice that that action will be set down for trial at once was given yesterday. There is also a notice of action which has been served upon the Board by Mrs. Sarah Ruth Lewis, of the "Durrell Arms" London Road, Fulham, who claims damages for what she alleges to be the wrongful removal of a horsetrough from the highway in front of those premises. That notice expires on the 26th of this month. With respect to the books kept, and the documents, papers, and plans that have been received by the Board, it is assumed that the Secretary of State will make some order that the plans and papers and applications for various matters and things that have come under the consideration of the Board from time to time, shall be divided as far as practicable, so that each Vestry may have in its own custody the papers relating to the particular parish, but it is also assumed that the books containing the minutes of the proceedings of the Board and of the various committees, and the books of account of the Board for the district and the various books of record would, by a like order, be placed in the custody of one of the Vestries, giving the right of free access to the other Vestry. Of course, the books cannot be divided. I have comp'eted now, Sir, the statement that I propose to make myself. Mr. Chamberlen, the chairman, as I before stated, of the Finance Committee, is prepared to give you the full details of the financial proposition that is before you. I do not know whether you would like now to take me back into my statement or to receive first the statement of Mr. Chamberlen. I propose to call Mr. Chamberlen and then to call Mr. Edward Bird, who acts as Chairman of the Board, and to call certain other members of the Vestry of Fulham and the Vestry of Hammersmith, and members of the Board, gentlemen with sound practical knowledge of the value of property and of the miscellaneous goods that I have referred to, and of the proposals made as to the apportionment. The Inspector.—Are you going into any details? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Yes, Mr. Chamberlen will go into it fully. It will not be practicable to go into the current accounts of the Board at the present moment. Those accounts, of course, are current now and running. The Inspector.—They cannot be closed till the 25th? Mr. T. E. Jones.—No. The Inspector.—No statement can be made respecting them? 130 Mr. T. E. Jones.—No, nothing further than what I have already stated. Will you let me take Mr. Chamberlen through the proof as I have prepared it? Then, if you please, you could go back to any point upon which further information is desired. I will call Mr. Thomas Chamberlen. The following gentlemen were then called and examined by Mr. T. E. Jones:— Mr. Thomas Chamberlen.—I reside at 18, Bridge Avenue, Hammersmith. I am a member of the firm of Chamberlen Brothers, carrying on an old-established business as builders, a member of the Board of Works for the Fulham District, and for the past six years Chairman of the Finance Committee. I am also a member of the Hammersmith Vestry. I am thoroughly conversant with the proceedings of the Board; I am a member of the Joint (Board and Vestries) Committee; I am owner of a large amount of house property in Hammersmith and the neighbourhood; I have a good practical knowledge of the value of property and of the miscellaneous stock, such as that described and set out in the two schedules already put in evidence before the Inspector. I took part in the work of the Joint Committee in the valuation of the property and stock and in preparing for the separation of the two parishes. I have heard the evidence already given by you (Mr. T. E. Jones), and the statements made, and believe them to be correct. As Chairman of the Board's Finance Committee I have taken great personal interest in this matter, and have personally superintended the work of yourself and of the accountants in the preparation of the printed statements now produced and put in, and marked E, and relating to the proposed apportionment of liabilities, assets, &c. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I will put in the print, Sir. I do not propose to ask Mr. Chamberlen questions upon it. I am about to leave Mr. Chamberlen to give you the full details of that statement in his own manner. Will you do that, Mr. Chamberlen? Mr. Chamberlen.—I do not know, Sir, that I need occupy much of your time. The Clerk has already told you that the outstanding mortgage liabilities, on the 25th of March will amount to £107,043. 7s. 8d. I propose, in the first instance, to deal with the loans chargeable on the General Rate of the district. I may say here, perhaps, that this large amount, the £107,043 7s. 8d., has been borrowed from time to time by mortgage on the security of the rates raised in the district, and the instalments of principal and the interest have been borne by the 131 two parishes in proportion to their rateable value. These loans run over various periods, from one to fifty-five years, and they bear interest at different rates, from £3. 10s. to £5. per cent. per annum. Had the Board not been dissolved the charge for the year 1886—7 on the district General Rate would have been, for principal instalments, £8,529. 7s. 4d.; interest, £2,363. 3s. 11d.; making a total of £10,892. 11s. 3d. The amount of principal outstanding on the General Rate is £66,097. 7s. 6d., and the total future interest payable under the mortgage deeds is £17,101. 16s. 3d. The present value of this total sum, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, represents a present liability of the Board, on General Rate loans of £67,246. 5s. 1d. Most of the loans of the Board are at the rate of 3½ per cent., and we have had to bring the loans at a higher rate of interest down to this 3½ per cent., so that we could get at their actual value. The Clerk of the Board has given you the rateable value of the two parishes, the total being £818,583, and the respective proportion would be:—Fulham, 41.13 per cent., and Hammersmith, 58.87 per cent. Of this sum of £67,246. 5s. 1d., Fulham will be liable for £27,658. 7s. 8d., and Hammersmith for £39,587. 17s. 5d. It is therefore proposed that the following mortgage bonds be transferred to, and made chargeable on, the General Rate of the parish of Fulham. I do not know whether I had better read the list of those loans. The Inspector.—Have the loans been incurred principally on behalf of Fulham? Mr. Chamberlen.—The loans have been incurred on behalf of the district. The Inspector.—They have been incurred on behalf of the district generally, but are they for Fulham? Are the works for which these loans are drawn works done in Fulham? Mr. Chamberlen.—We have endeavoured, as far as we possibly could, to apportion the loans for work done in Fulham to Fulham. The Inspector.—Will you read out the numbers of the loans, and what the loans were actually for? Mr. Chamberlen.—It is almost impossible to divide these loans. Some of the work has been done in Hammersmith, and some in Fulham, and some would come under what we term district charges. The Inspector.—Yon had better read them out, I think. Mr. Chamberlen.—The first loan that is proposed to be transferred to Fulham is one from the Imperial Life Office, marked in the Board's book as Loan No, 11. It is part of that loan only. 132 The other part will be transferred to Fulham when we come to the sewers rate portion. That is dated the 16th October, 1867. It has twelve years to run. The rate of interest is five per cent. The principal outstanding is £1,240, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-87 of £165. 6s. 8d. The present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum would be £1,364. 17s. 8d. Loan No. 21: date of mortgage, December 15th, 1876; rate of interest 33/4 per cent., years to run, 6; principal outstanding, £1,794, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-87 of £360. 13s. 8d.; present value of all principal and interest payments, due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, £1,805. 4s. 9d. Loan No. 24: date of mortgage, February 12th, 1879, Atlas Life Office, rate of interest 4¼ per cent., years to run, 13; principal outstanding, £3,575, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-87 of £426. 18s. 9d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £3,749. 5s. Loan No. 30: date of mortgage, November 19th, 1879, West of England Life Office, rate of interest 4¼ per cent., years to run, 9; principal outstanding £3,000, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-87 of £460. 16s. 8d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £3,137. 17s. 1d. Loan No. 38: date of mortgage, December 23rd, 1881, Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest 3½ per cent.; years to run 46; principal outstanding £920, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-87 of £52. 0s. 6d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £924. 13s. 6d. Loan No. 39: date of mortgage, June 2nd, 1882, Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest 3½ per cent.; year to run, 1; principal outstanding £200, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-87 of £203. 10s.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £200. Loan No. 41: date of mortgage, May 31st, 1883, Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest 3½ per cent.; years to run, 55; principal outstanding, £899, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £48. 9s. 4d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £903. 11s. 5d. Loan No. 43: date of mortgage, October 4th, 1883; Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest, 3½ per cent.; years to run, 28; 133 principal outstanding, £1,866, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £131. 2s. 8d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £1,866. Loan No. 44: date of mortgage, October 4th, 1883 : Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest, 3½ per cent.; years to run, 4; principal outstanding, £1,666, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £468; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £1,666. Loan No. 45: date of mortgage, December, 23rd, 1884; Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest, 3½ per cent.; years to run, 14; principal outstanding, £3,173, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £334. 1s. 6d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £3,173. Loan No. 46: date of mortgage, December 23rd, 1884; Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest 3½ per cent.; years to run, 5; principal outstanding, £1,416, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £328. 12s.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £1,416. Loan No. 47: date of mortgage, December 23rd, 1884; Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest, 3½ per cent.; years to run, 9; principal outstanding, £2,700, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £389. 5s.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £2,700. Loan No. 48: date of mortgage, March 5th, 1885; Metropolitan Board of Works, rate of interest, 3i per cent.; years to run, 5; principal outstanding, £4,583, requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £1,069. 7s. 6d.; the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, being £4,583. The gross total of that is, principal outstanding, £27,032; requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £4,438. 4s. 3d. The present value of the loans discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum would be £27,489. 9s. 5d. The charge to Fulham on £27,658. 7s. 8d., its proportion of £67,246. 5s. 1d., would represent (if the loans had been in a more easily adjustable form) a commencing annual charge of £4,480. 2s. 3d. It is also proposed that the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham pay to the Trustees of the estate of the District Board, in cash or account, the sum of £168. 18s. 3d., being the difference due by Fulham between the amount required from Fulham—viz., K 134 £27,658. 7s. 8d., and the present value of the liability in respect of loans transferred, £27,489. 9s. 5d. It is also proposed that the following mortgaged bonds bo transferred to and made chargeable on the General Kate of the Parish of Hammersmith:— Number of loan, 17; date of mortgage, 10th December, 1874; Provident Clerks' Life Office; rate of interest per cent.; years to run, 9; principal outstanding, £1,575; requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £245. 17s. 6d.; present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, £1,660. 11s. 5d. Loan No. 19: 26th April, 1876; Metropolitan Board of Works; rate of interest, £3. 18s. 6d.; years to run, 5; principal outstanding, £2,830; requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £665. 19s. 6d.; present value of all principal and interest payments duo under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, £2,856. 4s. A Vestryman.—May I suggest that this all appearing in print, and every member of the Vestry having a copy, this should not be read ? The Inspector.—I thought there might be some ratepayers present who had not papers before them. Of course, it is necessary that every member present here should have the information. The Vestryman.—That might be met, I take it, by any ratepayer here present not provided with one of these prints being given one. It would save a good deal of time. Mr. Chamherlen.—Would it answer the purpose if I give you the totals? The Inspector.—I do not wish to take up time. Let that be done. A Ratepayer.—As one of the ratepayers in the Parish of Hammersmith, may I ask that we be supplied with that? I understand that it is quite within our strict right that wc should know, not only the mode of procedure, but also the agreements which have been arrived at. The papers were at once supplied. The Inspector.—Will you read out the totals? Mr. Giiamberlen.—The principal outstanding is £39,065.7s. 6d., requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £6,454. 7s. The present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, would be £39,756. 15s. 8d. The charge to Hammersmith on £39,587. 17s. 5d., its proportion of £67,246. 5s. 1d., would represent (if the loans had been in a more easily adjustable form) a commencing annual charge of £6,412. 9s. You notice that the 135 sum of £168. 18s. 3d. would be paid to Hammersmith, and that Fulham would have to pay that amount. Now we come to the loans chargeable on the Sewer Rate of the district. These loans are repayable by instalments spread over various periods from four to twenty-four years, and bearing interest at rates ranging from £3. 10s. to £5 per cent. per annum, which, had the Board not been dissolved, would have entailed for the year 1886-7 a charge on the District Sewer Rate for principal instalments, £2,969. 12s. 4d.; interest, £1,747. 12s. 8d.; making a total of £4,717. 5s. The amount of principal outstanding is £40,946. 0s. 2d., and the total future interest payable on the mortgage deeds is £13,754. 11s. 9d., making a gross total of £54,700. 11s. 11d. The present value of this total sum, discounted at 3½ per cent. per annum, represents a present liability of the Board on Sewer Rate loans of £43,051. 19s. 10d. Fulham will be liable on basis of rateable value, 41.13 per cent., for £17,707. 5s. 8d.; and Hammersmith will be liable, on basis of rateable value, 58.87 per cent., for £25,344., 14s. 2d. It is therefore proposed that mortgage bonds be transferred to, and made chargeable on, the Sewer Rate of the Parish of Fulham for a principal outstanding of £16,982. 12s., requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £1,851. 2s. 5d., present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent., £17,898. 12s. 2d. The charge to Fulham on £17,707. 5s. 8d., its proportion of £43,051. 19s. 10d., would represent (if the loans were in a more readily adjustable form) a commencing annual charge of £1,940. 4s. 1d. It is also proposed that the Trustees of the estate of the District Board pay in cash or account to Fulham the sum of £191. 6s. 6d. to meet the difference due to Fulham between the amount required from Fulham, viz.:—£17,707. 5s. 8d., and the present value of the liability in respect of loans transferred £17,898. 12s. 2d. As regards Hammersmith, it is proposed that mortgage bonds be transferred to and made chargeable on the Sewer Rate of the Parish of Hammersmith, for a principal outstanding of £23,963. 8s. 2d., requiring a charge for principal and interest during 1886-7 of £2,866. 2s. 7d., the present value of all principal and interest payments due under bond, discounted at 3½ per cent., being £25,153. 7s. 8d. The charge to Hammersmith on £25,344. 14s. 2d., its proportion of £43,051. 19s. 10d., would represent (if the loans were in a more easily adjustable form) a commencing annual charge of £2,777. 0s. 11d. It is also proposed that the Vestry of the Parish of Hammersmith pay to the Trustees of the estate of the District Board, in cash k 2 136 or account, the sum of £191. 6s. 6d., being the difference duo byHammersmith between the amount required from Hammersmith, viz.:—£25,344. 14s. 2d., and the present value of the liability in respect of loans transferred, £25,153. 7s. 8d. To the Statement that has been put in you will find a Summary, and the outcome of that Summary is that Hammersmith will have to pay £22. 8s. 3d., as the difference between the loans taken over by Fulham and by Hammersmith. I may say here, perhaps, that it is advisable that the Secretary of State should apportion these loans, if he agrees to this plan, as soon as possible, for some of the principal and interest will be falling due in April and May next, and unless the award of the Secretary of State is made, the estate of the Board would be liable for the principal and interest amounts to become due, and might have no funds out of which they could pay.* Now we come to the joint assets of the Board. There are certain realisable joint assets of the Board, which it has been proposed by the Joint Committee, and agreed to by the respective Vestries of Fulham and Hammersmith, shall be conveyed at the undermentioned values, viz.:— To Hammersmith: Freehold wharf, Chancellors, £5,500; freehold land and stables, Union Court, £10,500; leasehold house, Broadway, £7,500; furniture, Broadway House, £913. 7s. l0d.; total, £24,413. 7s. l0d. To Fulham: The leasehold house and stables, 637, Fulham Road, £1,900. In addition, there is the live and dead stock. The value of the moveable property altogether is £6,307. 12s. 7d. It will be thus seen that the Trustees of the estate of the Board will receive, in cash or account, from the two Vestries, in respect of the freehold and personal property of the Board, a sum total of £32,621. 0s. 5d., irrespective of the bankers' balances and the sums to be paid over by the Overseers of Fulham and Hammersmith in discharge of the current precepts of the Board, and of the excess (if any) which may have been levied beyond the amount named in such precepts. In addition, the following contributions from the Metropolitan Board of Works, at present outstanding in respect of improvements, will be joint assets, namely, re Gliddon Road Bridge, £800; improvement, Parsons' Green Lane, £120; improvement by Swan Tavern, Fulham Road, £125; improve- * Note by the Clerk to the Board. If the Board had continued to exist, the amount required to meet these payments would have been included in and raised by rates in the year 1886-7. No money has yet been raised to meet these charges, and the respective Vestries will have to raise the amounts by rates in the ordinary way, so that it is really absolutely necessary the Vestries should have the earliest possible notice as to the apportionment of mortgage liability. 137 merit by West Kensington Station, £50; and improvement in Dawes Road, £950. After all the liabilities of the Board on rates or trust accounts have been discharged, either by cash payments or by equitably distributing the future charges between the respective Vestiges, it will be observed that there will be a capital sum left (arising from the above sales of joint property, and represented either by cash or amount due in current account from each Vestry) to divide between the two Vestries, in the proportion of their respective rateable values, namely, Fulham 41.13 per cent. and Hammersmith 58.87 per cent., the result of which will be that Hammersmith will have a net sum to pay in consequence of their buying a larger proportion of property than Fulham, while Fulham will have a net sum to receive. I do not think I can give you the amount of that sum. There is no arrangement made at present as to the moveable property, but as soon as that is done we could give you exactly what it would be. It is then proposed that the settlement of the various accounts as between the two Vestries and the Trustees should be arranged from time to time as circumstances might require. The Trustees might have some sums of money in their hands that they could transfer to the Vestries of Fulham and Hammersmith, and if these Vestries were in want of money the Trustees would not want to keep moneys in their hands that they could fairly part with. The Clerk has already called your attention to the £1,000 paid by the West Metropolitan Tramways Company. It is thought that that should be made a joint asset. It was really paid for permanent works, and Fulham is paying its share of the loans for permanent works, therefore ought to receive its share of the £1,000. The Clerk has also informed you that under an agreement, dated the 1st of May, 1883, the sum of £4,500 was paid by the same Company as a contribution in respect of their Hammersmith Tramways. This sum of £4,500 will be transferred to Hammersmith, having been paid as a part provision for the maintenance of the wood-paving in King Street West; there is also a sum of £150 per annum payable to the Tramways Company under an agreement dated 1st of May, 1883, and under the same agreement the Company pay the Board the sum of £50 per annum; this net liability will be transferred to the Vestry of Hammersmith. The charge of a trust sum of £1,000 on deposit by this Company at the London and County Bank, Hammersmith, in the name of the Board in accordance with their Act of 1881, to secure the proper maintenance of their permanent way, will also be transferred to the Vestry of Hammersmith to hold in trust. The Clerk has already told you the Tramways Company receive the interest on 138 this £1,000. As to the sum of £250 held in trust for the Walham Green Improvement, no doubt that matter will be settled very shortly, and the money will bo handed over to the Railway Company. Then as to the annual contingent charge on the district for existing superannuations. At the present time wo have two officers superannuated—the late Medical Officer of Health, Mr. Burge, £77. 10s. per annum, and Mr. Slater, late Inspector of Nuisances, £14. 6s. per annum. It is proposed that these existing superannuations, and the annuities given as compensation to officers not re-employed by either Vestry, shall be charged on Hammersmith, while Fulham will bo required to pay to Hammersmith its proportion of the share of the liability; any lump sum compensation being provided out of the capital sum arising from sale of properties above referred to. With regard to the contingent liability placed upon the district by the provision of Clause 8 of the Act, 1885, relating to past years of service of officers re-employed, it is proposed that when the claim arises, the non-employing Vestry shall then pay quarterly to the employing Vestry its share of the superannuation that would have been payable to the officer had he been superannuated on 25th of March, 1886, i.e., the 41.13 per cent. or 58.87 per cent. as the case may be. This may not arise at all, because if these officers should leave the service they would not bo entitled to compensation unless they are incapacitated. I think it is almost impossible that wo could arrive at any sum of money which one Vestry could pay to the other to provide for this contingency; but if this is made part of the scheme, if ever it docs arise at all, then as it is set forth in the last clause, the employing Vestry would receive from the other Vestry the share which it would have to pay. Wo have thought it better to set out the names of the officers, so that there may bo no dispute hereafter. The following officers have been re-employed by the Vestry of Fulham:—Messrs. W. P. Jones, R. H. Meyer, A. A. Croucher, J. W. Marsh, J. Francis, T. Steed. And the following officers have been re-employed by the Vestry of Hammersmith:—Messrs. F. W. G. Webb, A. G. Keen, T. C. Jarvis, W. A. Webb, E. F. Tomkins, II. G. Bean, II. R. Felkin, E. Mitchell, N. C. Collier, R. Chamberlen, J. Cosson, W. Hestor, R. II. Davies, II. Oatley, A. Burleigh, C. Lowe, C. Fowler. And the particulars as to years of service, present salary and emoluments, and the amount of superannuation if granted as at 25th of March, is fully set out in Tabular Statement, which is already in evidence. It does not follow because their names are put down hero that they will receive superannuation, but it will bo for the employing Vestry to say in years to come whether they 139 are entitled to superannuation or not, and if in the opinion of the employing Vestry they are entitled to superannuation, the other Vestry will have to pay its share. That amount has been brought out and set down here, as I have said before, to prevent any misunderstanding in years to come. I do not know that I have anything further to say, unless you wish to ask me any questions in reference to the financial matters of the Board. If so, I will do my best to answer them. The Inspector.—This list represents all the officers now who would be re-employed by the Parishes of Hammersmith and Fulham ? Mr. Chamberlen.—Yes, that are re-employed. The Inspector.—No addition would be made to them ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—No, probably not. William John Brown.—I posted a copy of the notice convening this meeting (like the one produced) on the doors of all the churches and chapels, and other places for public notices, in the parish of Fulham. George Lowe.—I posted a copy of the Notice convening this meeting (like the one produced) on the doors of all the churches and chapels, and other places for public notices, in the parish of Hammersmith. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I think, Sir, Mr. Chamberlen has something to add to his statement. Mr. T. Chamberlen.—I should like to add, Sir, that in preparing this statement the incidence of taxation was taken into account, so that in any one year it should not bear more heavily upon Fulham or Hammersmith than it ought to do. You will see that that was a matter necessary to take into account so that the amount could be fairly distributed, and if that had not been taken into account we could not have given a very fair statement. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I propose now to call Mr. Edward Bird, who usually acts as Chairman of the Board, and who is Chairman of the Joint Committee. Mr. Edward Bird.—I reside at Oldfield House, Brook Green. I am a member of the Board of Works for the Fulham District. For the last twelve years I have been Chairman of the Law and Parliamentary Committee. When present at the meetings of the Board I am invariably elected as Chairman of the day. I am also a member of the Hammersmith Vestry. I am thoroughly conversant with the proceedings of the Board and of the Vestry. I was appointed Chairman of the Joint Committee which has had to deal with the whole of the valuations, apportionment of 140 loans, and other matters that have been "spoken of. I was formerly a member of a firm of builders and general contractors, carrying on an extensive business, not only in this neighbourhood, but all over England. I am owner of a considerable amount of house property, and I have a practical knowledge of the value of property and the miscellaneous stock, horses, carts, and so on, such as described in the schedules put in evidence. I have taken an active part in the work of the Joint Committee in preparing the statements and particulars which have been put before the Inspector to-day. I have heard the evidence that you (Mr. T. E. Jones) have given and the evidence that Mr. Chamberlen has given, and I fully corroborate that evidence. I have seen the various exhibits that have been put in,—the statistical returns, the copies of minutes, schedule of freehold and leasehold property, schedule of the moveable property, and of the loans, and the tabular statements, the other matters and things. I believe they are true and faithful statements. I believe that the proposed apportionment and arrangement in settlement of the affairs between the Joint Estate and the two Vestries is fair, and the most equitable one that could be devised. Mr. Charles James Foakes.—I reside at the Vestry Offices, Walham Green, and I am Vestry Clerk of the Parish of Fulham. I produce the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Vestry directing me to attend here to-day. [Certified Extract from Minutes handed in.] I produce the Minutes appointing the eight members to represent the Vestry on the Joint Committee. There are two Minutes, the second one appointing Mr. Elkins instead of Mr. Cordingley, who had resigned. [Certified Extract from Minutes handed in.] I produce the Minutes of Vestry dated 2nd of March instant, agreeing to the Valuation of the Freehold and Leasehold property, and the whole of the moveable property. [Certified Extract from Minutes handed in.] I produce the Minute approving of and agreeing to the proposed apportionment of the loans and liabilities. [Certified Extract from Minutes handed in.] I produce Minutes of the Vestry approving of the valuation of two ambulances and cement tester. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I produce Minute of the Vestry agreeing to purchase the leasehold premises at Walham Green, No. 637, Fulham Road, for the sum of £1,900. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] These Minutes are all dated 2nd of March, 1886. I produce Minute appointing Mr. Harris and Mr. Glen to attend here to-day to represent the Vestry, and a Minute nominating Messrs. Glen, 141 Harris, and Perry as trustees. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I was present at the Vestry meetings where the foregoing resolutions were passed, and the whole matter was considered and discussed before such resolutions were passed, and I may say that the Vestry of Fulham expressed themselves highly gratified with the manner in which the Vestry of Hammersmith had treated them, and a Minute to that effect is entered on the books. Mr. William Poile Cockburn.—I reside at 3, The Grove, Hammersmith, and I am Vestry Clerk of the Parish of Hammersmith. I produce the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Vestry. I produce Minute of the Vestry instructing me to attend here to-day. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I produce the Minute approving of and adopting the Report of the Joint Committee as to the value of the various properties and the apportionment of the Mortgages of the Board, and agreeing to take over at the price named in the Report the freehold wharf and dwelling-house and disinfecting chamber situate Chancellors; the freehold house, stabling, and land situate in Union Court; the leasehold house, board-room, and sanitary office known as Broadway House; and such plant, horses, and so on as may be arranged. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I produce the Minute agreeing to the valuation of the two ambulances and the cement tester. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I produce the Minute of the Vestry nominating Mr. Edward Bird, Mr. George Brown, and Mr. Thomas Chamberlen to act as trustees. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I also produce a Minute wherein the Vestry ask General Carey to take into consideration the actuarial value of past services of the officers of the Board who have been re-engaged by the Vestry. [Certified Extract from the Minutes handed in.] I have been present at the meetings of the Vestry whereat the subject-matter of the foregoing resolutions has been under consideration, and the whole matter was fully discussed before the resolutions were passed. Mr. Richard Lawrence Cosh.—I reside at Netherwood Road. I am a member of the Board of Works, and Chairman of the Board's Works Committee. I am also a member of the Vestry of the Parish of Hammersmith. I am thoroughly conversant with the proceedings of the Board, and I am a member of the Joint Committee. I carry on the business of a builder and timber merchant. I am the owner of freehold property in the district, and I am also a leaseholder of a large number of 142 houses in the district, and have a practical knowledge of the value of freehold and leasehold property and of the miscellaneous property as set out in the Schedules marked B and C. I believe that the prices fixed are fair and reasonable, and that the proposed method of apportionment of liabilities and assets as between the joint estate and the two parishes is a fair and reasonable method of apportionment. Mr. William Williams.—I reside at 2, Benbow Road, Hammersmith. I am a member of the Board of Works and Chairman of the Board's Cartage Committee. I am also a member of the Vestry of the Parish of Hammersmith. I am a member of the Joint Committee, and have taken part in the work of the Committee which has led to the results that have been put before the Inspector to-day. I have a thorough knowledge of the business of a general contractor, and of the value of the property, horses, plant, stock, machinery, &c., as described in the Schedules B and C already put in in evidence, I believe that the valuation put forward is a fair one, and that the scheme is a fair and reasonable one. Mr. Alexander Glen.—I reside at 40, Auriol Road, Pulham. I am a Barrister-at-Law. I am a member of the Board of Works, and Vice-Chairman of the Law and Parliamentary Committee of the Board. I am a member of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, and a member of the Joint Committee. I have taken part in the preparation of the details of the proposals that have been made before the Inspector to-day. I have heard the evidence that has been given by you (Mr. T. E. Jones) and by Mr. Chamberlen as to the financial position and proposals, and consider they arc fair proposals, and that the proposed settlement is a fair and just settlement as between the two Parishes. I would say this with regard to a suggestion that fell from General Carey as to the mode of apportioning those liabilities. General Carey made a remark which suggested the possibility that the loans might have been apportioned between the two parishes according to the locus of the works for which the loans were borrowed. That is a matter which was considered very carefully by the Joint Committee, and they unanimously came to the conclusion that a fair and proper mode of apportioning them would bo that which was adopted—viz., the apportionment according to the rateable value of the two parishes. Now the reason for that, I think, is this; If the dissolution were not to take place, those liabilities would remain apportioned between the two parishes in those same proportions, according to the rateable values; that is to say, the principal and interest of all those loans would bo payable by the two parishes in proportion to 143 their respective rateable values for the time being. Now, the object of the dissolution of the Board was not to make any alteration in the incidence of liabilities between the two parishes, or to create any fresh liabilities; the object was that, inasmuch as the work of the District Board had increased very much, by reason of building operations and so on, it was felt that the time had come when it was desirable that the affairs of the district should be managed by two local authorities instead of one, and it was merely a matter of management that brought about the dissolution, and not the desire to alter the liabilities of the parishes between themselves. Therefore the loans and liabilities of the Board, the Joint Committee considered, ought to be divided between the parishes as nearly as possible in the same proportion as they are divided practically at the present moment, and then that would have to be continued if the dissolution were not to take place. Having adopted that principle, the object of the Joint Committee was to carry it out as nearly as possible, and that has been done by tlie statement which Mr. Chamberlen explained to you. No doubt, it might be practicable to arrive at a different apportionment, according to the locality of the particular works; but that would be extremely difficult, and, in fact, as Mr. Chamberlen said, no doubt in some cases it would be practically impossible to get a fair apportionment in that way; but having regard to the present apportionment and liabilities between the parishes, the Joint Committee were unanimously of opinion that the apportionment according to the rateable values was that which ought to be adopted. Mr. Alfred Cubitt Bean called. Mr. T. E. Jones.—As Mr. Bean is very deaf, Sir, I will ask you to allow me to put his proof into his hands. (To Mr. Bean.) Will you please give tlie Inspector your evidence as to the value of the property ? Mr. A. C. Bean.—I have examined the property as valued, and I think it is a fair valuation. Mr. T. E. Jones.—Mr. Bean has held the appointment of surveyor to the Board for upwards of thirty years, and has a thorough practical knowledge. The Inspector.—He has had previous experience in valuing ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Yes, he has had a very large experience in the valuation of property. Mr. James Andrew Smith.—I reside at 192, Hammersmith Road. I am an auctioneer, house and estate agent, valuer, and surveyor. I am a member of the Vestry of the Parish of Hammersmith. I am a member of the Board of Works, and a member of the Joint Committee. I have had a long and varied 144 experience, ranging over thirty-four years, in the valuation of property of every description. I have taken part in the proceedings that have led up to the proposals which have been made to-day. I have heard the evidence given by you (Mr. Jones) and Mr. T. Chamberlen, and some of the other witnesses. I entirely corroborate that evidence, and believe that the proposals which are before the Inspector are fair and reasonable proposals as between the two parishes. Mr. Thomas Hamer.—I am the proprietor of the George Hotel, Walham Green. I am a member of the Board of Works, a member of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, and a member of the Joint Committee. I have taken part in the deliberations of the Joint Committee, and have been through the valuation of the various articles which are detailed in the statements put in by you (Mr. Jones), and I believe that the prices affixed thereto are fair prices, and that the basis of the proposal which has been made as to the settlement of the affairs of the district between the two parishes is a fair and reasonable one. Mr. Henry Rayment.—I reside at No. 243, North End Road, Fulham. I am a member of the Fulham Vestry, and a member of the Joint Committee. I have taken part in the valuation of the property referred to in the proposals put forward to-day. I have a good knowledge of the value of horses, and I brought that special knowledge to bear on the valuation. I have heard the evidence given by the previous witnesses. I corroborate that evidence, and think the valuations are quite fair and reasonable. I believe that the proposal as to the apportionment is a fair and reasonable proposal. Mr. William Henry Smith.—I reside at No. 8, Barclay Road, Fulham. I am a member of the Fulham Vestry, and a member of the Joint Committee, and have taken part in the proceedings of that Committee. I am a builder and general contractor. I have special knowledge of the various matters and things that have been under the consideration of the Joint Committee as to their values. I believe that the values that have been affixed to them are fair and just values. I believe that the settlement and apportioment which is proposed is fair and reasonable. Mr. Philip Pethick Perry.—I reside at 5, Talgarth Road, Fulham. I am a surveyor. I am a member of the Board of Works, and of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. I am a member of the Joint Committee. As a surveyor I have a practical knowledge of the value of property, and especially within this district. I have assisted in the work of the Joint 145 mittee in arriving at the values which have been put forward today. I believe those values are fair and proper values, and that the scheme as laid before the Inspector is a fair and reasonable proposal. Mr. T. E. Jones.—That, Sir, is the scheme which I was instructed to submit to your consideration to-day, not only by the Board, but with the approval and agreement and sanction and help of the Yestries of the two Parishes—Fulham and Hammersmith—and that is the case which I lay before you, subject, of course, to any questions you may like to put. There are several gentlemen here ready to give you any information you may desire to have. The Inspector.—I should like to have some information about the real property and the moveable stock. Mr. T. E. Jones.—That would be dealt with in this way—the two Yestries will be called together at once to a special meeting in order to depute and authorise certain of their members (probably the gentlemen whom they sent to the Joint Committee), to select the articles that they propose to buy from the common stock, at the prices put down in the detailed schedules. I may say, Sir, as I said before, that I have in the room detailed statements of all the totals that I have given you, with each article priced out. Each Yestry will select that which it wishes to buy, and buy it at that particular price through the Committee which they will appoint. The Inspector.—Do you know when this is likely to be? Mr. T. E. Jones.—That will probably take place at once— within this next week or ten days. It will take some days to give the proper notices for a Yestry meeting, and then we have to give two days' notice for the meeting of the Committee, and that will take up five or six days with purely formal matters, without the Sunday intervening. The Inspector.—With respect to the apportionment of the real property, how is that dealt with ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—The apportionment of the real property is agreed to in the way that has been set out. The Yestry of Fulham have agreed to take the Walham Grreen offices for £1,900, and the Hammersmith Yestry have agreed to take the freehold wharf at Hammersmith, the freehold land and stables in Union Court, the leasehold house here, with the furniture and fittings, representing a sum of £24,413. 7s. 10d., which will stand in account as against the Vestry of Hammersmith in the books of the Trustees of the Joint Estate. 146 The Inspector.—Yes; but will that be apportioned according to the rateable value ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—I take it that will be a matter to be dealt with in account by the Trustees, and it will be accounted for at a subsequent date. You see, at once, that it cannot be dealt with at the present moment. No actual figures representing the state of affairs as it may be when the whole thing is wound up can be given at the present moment, nor even at the present moment can nearly approximate figures be given. The Inspector.—How will each parish raise the money that is required for payment of these things ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—A large' part of the money will have to be raised by Hammersmith. Fulham will have to receive money. Hammersmith will make application in the ordinary course, under the provisions of 18 and 19 Victoria, the original Act, for power to borrow a certain amount of money, to be ascertained, and the amount cannot be fixed at the pi'esent time. The Inspector.—They will have to obtain a loan for the sum required to make good their debts to Fulham ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Yes. The Inspector.—Will a loan of that kind be sanctioned? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Oh, yes. The Inspector.—They will obtain it from the Metropolitan Board of Works. Mr. T. E. Jones.—Probably. The Metropolitan Board of Works will either grant a loan themselves or give power to obtain a loan from other sources. It will most likely be obtained from them at the low rate at which money can be borrowed, namely, 3½ per cent. It is understood, I think, by the Hammersmith Vestry that they will have to raise money. I believe it is clearly understood that there will be a sum of money, whatever that sum may be, to be raised and found by Hammersmith, to hand to Fulham. It comes out of the way in which the property is dealt with, and the exceptional circumstance that the larger portion of the property is in the Parish of Hammersmith, and that Hammersmith Vestry will find it convenient to secure and use that property. The Inspector.—Yes; in that way, of course, if it could be put in the general account; but the question is whether a loan of that kind could be obtained? Mr. T. E. Jones.—In my opinion, yes. The Inspector.—Have you any other remark to make? Mr. T. E. Jones.—I omitted to put in the original claims, Sir, and I now put them in. There are the original claims as 147 warded, with the protests of those officers who think that their claims should be further considered, where the Board have dealt with them by cutting them out. [The claims and protests were then handed in.] The Inspector.—It is a list of the claims of the servants who have been re-employed, but who, at the same time, have not been given compensation. Mr. T. E. Jones.—No, Sir. I produce here and hand to you the original thirty-five claims as sent in by each officer, and the following protests:—one from Mr. Bessell, one from Mr. Collier, one from Mr. Davies, one from Mr. A. C. Bean, one from Mrs. Jones, and one from Miss Mitchell. The Inspector.—Have you the exact list of those officers who are going to be employed ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—It is on the last page of the printed statement (E). [Referring to same.] The Inspector.—There is nothing else ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Nothing from me, Sir. The Inspector.—Is there any gentleman of either Vestry present who wishes to make any remarks ? Mr. A. Perkins.—I am a Vestryman, Sir, and I wish to refer to the late Surveyor of the Vestry, Mr. A. C. Bean. He was employed by the Vestries of Fulharn and Hammersmith as Surveyor for some thirty years, at a salary of £600 a year, and some time ago he was required by the Vestry to devote the whole of his time to the work of the Vestry, and not to carry on a separate practice ; but he declined to do that. He said in that case he should have to find other employment, and that the Vestry would have to find another Surveyor. I think that, as he has therefore had an opportunity of carrying on a private practice in addition to the work of the Vestry, that the proposal to pay him £300 per annum compensation is considerably too high. The question arises, in my mind, whether Mr. A. C. Bean is entitled to compensation under the circumstances, having carried on a separate practice, and not having given the whole of his time to the services of the Vestry. The Inspector.—Is there any other gentleman who wishes to make a remark ? Mr. George Charles Chatwin.—I see, Sir, in Section 8 of this Act, the Metropolis Management Amendment of 1885, itspeaks there of the Secretary of State taking into consideration the superannuation of those servants of the Board who are not re-employed, and it refers there, that it should be taken into consideration under an Act passed in the twenty-ninth year of 148 Her Majesty. Looking over the list of the four servants who are claiming compensation, I notice that two of them were appointed before that Act came into operation. I have not been able to secure a copy of the Act of that year to see whether that Act was retrospective in its action. I think not. I am reliably informed that it was not, and, if it was not retrospective in its action, as to the fact of adding ten years to the service of the gentlemen who claim compensation for that, I submit, with all respect, that the Act does not apply to those two gentlemen. There is another thing that has struck me as being most anomalous with regard to the matter, and it is this. Take the case of the Surveyor of the Board in the first instance. Mr. Bean has been employed for thirty years at a commencing salary of £200 a year. On the 4th June, 1865, his salary was increased to £300 and 3 per cent, commission on New Streets work. On the 7th of March, 1877, it was increased to £500 per annum, the 3 per cent, commission being taken by the Board. On the 20th of December, 1882, it was increased to £000 per annum. He now claims thirty years' service at £600 per annum. At the present time here in Hammersmith we have 6s. 2d. rates running on us. We have 1,700 houses in our parish that are not occupied, and there are a number of applications for extension of time to pay rates. I am reliably informed that the amount of squeezing that is necessary to get the rates out of the people at the present time i3 unparalleled, and here is this matter coming as a further push on to the rates. I submit that it is most anomalous, and that it requires a most earnest protest of every man against this matter, because when these gentlemen were engaged there was no promise made to them that they should be compensated at a certain time, and two have been engaged before this Act in the twenty-ninth year of Her Majesty came into operation. With regard to the Surveyor, I noticed, when he was in the room, that he is no doubt an old decrepit man, and cannot possibly expect to live any great length of time. But let us take the equity of the matter. Suppose the gentleman lives ten years, we shall have to pay him, I notice, or at least his claim is for, thirtysixtieths of his salary of £600 per annum,—that is to say, we shall pay him for ten years one-half of what his salary has only been for the last four jrears. That seems to me to be a most anomalous state of things. Further than that, with regard to that gentleman, I understand from what I have learned in the room, that he has not given the whole of his time to the service of the Board. Now, I will take another case, that of the 149 Medical Officer of Health—a gentleman who, I liave not the slightest doubt, has his own private practice independent of his salary, and he comes on us again, he really having only been in our service a short time by comparison. He was only appointed in 1877, with less than nine years' service. His commencing salary was £150 per annum. In 1878 he gets an increase of £50,in 1879 he gets another £50 increase, and on the 12th of January, 1881, he gets an increase of £100. I take no exception whatever to increasing the amount of his salary if his labours increase and take all his time, but I do take exception, and very decided exception, to this fact, that for four or five years he has got a large increase in his salary, and he claims then to have superannuation allowed him on the amount he has been earning the last three or four or five years for the whole of his time. Here is a medical officer who is really only thirty-six years of age to get what we may suppose to be about £500. Now, Sir, there is the case of the Clerk to the Board. I have been looking over the record and I must compliment the gentleman on the splendid record it is; and I say to my mind it only requires to be known that such a man as he is is out of a berth and that he would get one immediately. (Hear, hear). I am speaking behind City experience and City men—shrewd, sharp, commercial men—bankers' clerks, finance agents, and everything in that line, and I say (and there are three or four of them hearing me) that when a principal clerk loses the management of a business that gentleman announces it on the market. I say in this case it has only to be known, and I am certain he will get another situation. He is forty-five years of age, and are we going to make him a present of £308 a year for life? As a working man, when I used to go round about, and when I come as a small tradesman to look around and see the hard sharp struggle there is to get the money together for the rates, I say each time those of us who could speak and know how to go about the matter interfered and protested in the strongest language we possibly could against the matter. We might assume, looking at the gentleman, that he has twenty-five years' lease of life, and here futurity and posterity, it may be said, is to be taxed to that extent for the services that have been paid for in the past. We have to remember this. We are informed that these gentlemen were subject to a quarter's notice, and where would their compensation have been then? I was particularly struck with this fact, that while those in the receipt of higher salaries have been kept on—I noticed a remark made by the Clerk of the Board, that those at weekly wages were under notice to quit. L 150 say, Sir, with all respect that it only requires that those facts should bo known, and wo should vory soon got this state of things altered. Now, Sir, thero is the other case as to the Superintendent of the Stable Depot. There is a gentleman who has practically loss than six years' servico claiming compensation. What are we coming to? Arc wo to understand that as soon as you got an appointment you are to come on the rates for a portion of your living for ever afterwards ? It seems to mo, Sir, to bo somewhat astounding. The Superintendent of tho Stable Dopot was appointed, I see, at a commencing salary of £200 per annum, with residence, coals, gas, &c. If that salary was not a fair return for his labours, depend on it ho would not havo undertaken it, and I respoctfully submit to you that you should tako into consideration these facts with regard to this matter. First of all, with regard to tho Surveyor and the Clerk, if tlioy are entitled to compensation at all, they were appointed before this Act, tho 29th Victoria, came into force. In tho next plaeo, I shall ask your attention to tho fact with regard to the Surveyor, Mr. Bean, that although ho has been in our service a long time, at tho same time ho has had tho opportunity (and, I havo no doubt, ho has taken advantage of it) of a private practice; and while this £600 has boon paid to him, it has only been paid to him for tho last four years. With regard to the Clerk, well, 1 must confess, having soon tho gentleman, that I attack this with great reluctance, but I do so on principle. Wo soo here, Sir, that for the first twelve months his salary was 13s. per week. He served another twelve months at 20s. He served then 2½ years at 30s. a week, and in 1866 he was given £100 per annum. Now, Sir, allow me to call attention to the fact that there are only seven years thero of the gentleman's services under £100 per annum. He servos four years before he gets another rise, and it has only been since the 12th of January, 1881, that ho has reached his present salary of £500 a year, and yet ho comes before you and claims thirty years' services with ten years added to it, to be taken into consideration by the Secretary of State. With regard to the Mcdical Officer of Health, I may, perhaps, be misinformed, and my information on the matter may bo wrong, but I understand as to this Officer he comes every year and his office is liable to bo terminated. Mr. T. E. Jones.—No. A Vestryman.—It is the Analyst. Mr. Cuatwin.—Then I am misinformed, and I must withdraw that. I understand that Mr. Bean has objected to tho recoinmondation of the Vestry, in which 1 think, personally, 151 they offered to treat him most handsomely, and that he treats it practically now that the Secretary of State is to arbitrate as between him and the Yestries. I think if this matter is put before the Secretary of State, that we can rest this case with a very great amount of satisfaction, and we may very reasonably anticipate that his (Mr. Bean's) demand will not be met with. It is suggested to me that he has not made any application at all to be re-employed, so that he is evidently taking advantage of this fact of being able to retire for the remainder of his life on a very comfortable allowance, to be paid by the ratepayers of this parish. Mr. Cosh.—The previous speaker to the last, Mr. Perkins, is one of the number of gentlemen who were appointed by the Yestry to attend this meeting, and I take it for this purpose it is open to call on the Vestry Clerk of Hammersmith as to what the nature of the appointment was. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I think, perhaps, it would be as well just to set one matter right which has been dealt with by Mr. Chatwin. Mr. Chatwin is confusing the words "compensation" and "superannuation." The Act of 29 Victoria, chapter 31, is an Act that deals with superannuation alone. The claims for compensation are made under last year's Act—the 1885 Act. You will see at once, Sir, that the two things are quite distinct and different—namely, superannuation and compensation. The Inspector.—What basis are the claims calculated on ? Mr. Chatwin.—I am given to understand that the claims are calculated on the Civil Service scheme. Will you allow me to put this? When you enter the Civil Service you understand distinctly that if you complete a certain amount of service you shall be paid a certain amount of superannuation—a pension. That being so, and these gentlemen accepting appointment without that circumstance, I think it most unfair that the Civil Service matter should be brought into the question at all. Mr. T. E. Jones.—In answer to that I may say, speaking for myself individually, that I have worked on for many years for this Board (twenty-seven years since the Act passed) in the full anticipation that I should obtain benefit from that Act. I had a right to expect that, as long as I conducted myself and the business of the Board properly, I should receive consideration under that Act whenever, from any cause; I ceased to hold office; but now has come about a different state of affairs. The Legislature has passed a special Act, which arbitrarily deprives me of my living—(hear, hear)—and under that Act I ask to be compensated—not superannuated. The claims are based, as has L 2 152 been said, on the scale in use by the Civil Service, the onlyscale that was known by which to work them out, and the scale that is adopted and used every day. I can give you particulars of the calculations which have been worked out. I will put them in. The Inspector.—Are they the particulars of those which are actually recommended ? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Yes, and of the others as well—all the claims, with the exception of a few that have been named. Mr. Glen.—Will you allow me to say with reference to a remark which has been made by some gentlemen with regard to Mr. Bean's private practice, that was a matter which was taken into full consideration by the Board, and it was on that very ground that the Board disallowed the claim that he had made, or that was brought forward on his behalf, when he suggested that he should be superannuated instead of compensated. You will remember, Sir, that you suggested to us when we saw you at the Local Government Board some time ago, that the District Board should not superannuate any other officers between that time and the dissolution. The Board has been very anxious not to do that, but to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Secretary of State, who may deal with this question by way of compensation. It was suggested that Mr. Bean, as he was getting somewhat old and infirm, should be superannuated before the dissolution of the Board, and it was suggested that he should have ten years added to his service, which is allowed by the Act of Parliament—the Superannuation Act. The Board then took into consideration the fact that he had been allowed to continue his private practice, and took into consideration the amount of the private practice, and what Mr. Bean had to do; and they came to the conclusion that the justice of the case would be met by not allowing that addition of ten years' service which was allowed by the Superannuation Act, and that the justice of the case would be met by allowing him the balance, which came to £300 a year, and, as was suggested, not by way of superannuation, but by way of compensation; and they acquiesced in the suggestion that the amount of his compensation should be that which he would have received as superannuation, without the addition of ten years' service. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I may say in the case of Mr. Bean it was a distinct understanding between the Board and Mr. Bean, as embodied in the resolutions of the Board when Mr. Bean was appointed, that he should be allowed to hold, and continue to 153 carry on a private practice, in the same way as it was distinctly understood when 1 myself was appointed that I should devote the whole of my time to the service of the Board, as I have done. Mr. Cubitt.—I understand, Sir, that the principle on which the superannuation and compensation were based was approved by yourself? The Inspector.—Not at all; I never approved of anything. Mr. Cubitt.—I understood it was to be based on the Civil Service list; and the Committee certainly have approved these things on the recommendation. I believed fully that you approved of such a scale. The Inspector.—I cannot say I approved of any such scale; it might have been suggested by me at one time, and some little time ago I think the Vestries wrote to me asking what scale would be suggested on which compensation would be allowed. I informed them I had no power of confirming any rules in the calculation of compensation; but I certainly suggested the Civil Service rules as one method, on the distinct understanding that the suggestion could be cancelled at any time by the Secretary of State, he being the real arbitrator. Mr. Cubitt.—If that had been understood by the Committee it would not have been recommended by the Board in the strong language in which it was. Mr. T. E. Jones.—I am sure I can publicly state, as there are many members of the Committee present, the whole facts have been fairly laid before the Committee. (Hear, hear.) I have kept nothing back from that Committee. (Hear, hear.) It was distinctly understood by the members of the Committee that you, Sir, had not recommended anything; but that, in answer to a request, you gave certain information, it being distinctly and emphatically understood by the Committee. I speak these words advisedly, in the presence of the members. It was distinctly understood by them that there was nothing binding on you, and that you did not bind them to this scale, but that it was the scale usually adopted in computing compensation in the Civil Service. I ask to be corroborated by some of the members of the Committee. Mr. Cosh.—I am sure I have much pleasure in corroborating every word that has been uttered by Mr. Jones, that the Committee thoroughly understood what they were doing, and how this scale came before them; that you, Sir, assumed no responsibility, and that the whole responsibility would rest on the Secretary of State; and that this was only a mode by which 154 compensation might be assessed or dealt with by the Board in any recommendations they may have made; and that with regard to the compensation, the Committee were not influenced to the extent of one farthing by the considerations which Mr. Cubitt has just laid before you. I think the result would have been precisely the same. With the exception of Mr. Cubitt—if he was under that impression—I do not think any other member of the Committee was under a like impression. I speak most positively, and I can be corroborated, there is no doubt, by other members of the Committee. Mr. Edward Bird.—I can corroborate that which the Clerk has said, and also the observations made by Mr. Cosh in the matter; and I would beg to remind you, Sir, and gentlemen, that with respect to the two officers whose cases are now being discussed, it would make very little difference to the Board whether the compensation be calculated on the Civil Service scale or upon the Superannuation under the Metropolis Management Act. Mr. Bean, having served thirty years, would be entitled, without any addition of ten years, to the £300 a year under the Local Management Act. It appears by the other tables that he would be entitled to that sum, or a larger sum, inasmuch as the ten years may be added to years of actual service. Therefore, the question seems to resolve itself into this—whether Mr. Bean should have ten years added to his service, or whether he should not. Mr. Chatwin.—My contention is, in regard to the fact of their having recently received higher salaries as compared with the salaries they have received all along, that it is an unfair quotation to compute the length of service on a salary at the higher rate than they have received. That being so, if the Secretary of State has any discretion in the matter I ask you to take a note of this statement. Of course, if this Act of Parliament is to get things settled—cut and dried—we have no locus standi; but if it is not, and the Secretary of State has discretion, I ask you to take note of this statement and to lay it before him for his consideration. The Inspector.—With regard to the mode of compensation, has anything been considered as to how it will be dealt with? Mr. T. E. Jones.—We have not arrived at that yet. The Inspector.—The general principle I mean? Mr. T. E. Jones.—Yes. The Inspector.—In what form? Mr. T. E. Jones.—That has been already stated. The lump sums that have been recommended are proposed to be paid out 155 of the assets of the joint estate; and in reference to the others that are annual charges they would be arranged in this way. The proposal is that one Vestry should undertake to pay for both, so that the officer would not have to go first to one office and then to another to receive the whole of his allowance; and that one Vestry should pay the officer the amount to which he is entitled under the award, and that the Vestry of the other parish should recoup the paying Vestry its proportion of the amount due according to its rateable value. It is set out in the printed statement E, page 4. The Inspector.—Have the Vestries taken into consideration whether the amount of compensation should be capitalised or whether it should be an annual sum? Mr. Bird.—No. Mr. Cockburn.—In reference to a sort of suggestion that something has been kept back from the Committee, I should like to say, Sir, in justice to Mr. Jones, that a printed copy of your letters was sent to every Vestryman of the Parish of Hammersmith. I have a copy in my hand. Mr. T. E. Jones.—You expressly set out there, Sir, that the Secretary of State would have absolute power to alter or vary that scale, and that you were unable to say whether it would be sanctioned. Mr. Foakes.—I have merely to say that I do not think Mr. Jones ought to be accused of having kept anything back. The Inspector.—I do not think that for a moment. Mr. IIamer.—The letters from you, Sir, of the 5th and 8th of February were ordered to be printed and circulated amongst the Vestrymen. Your second letter clearly was meant to point to the fear that some might assume that the data of the compensation had been approved by the Secretary of State. The second letter clearly pointed out that that was not so. Mr. Cosh.—I wish to say two or three words with respect to some observations which have been made by gentlemen respecting the private practice of the Surveyor, Mr. Bean. It may be understood from those remarks that the Board had suffered from the Surveyor being allowed to carry on a private practice on his own account independently of the duties he owed to the Board. I have had for some years experience of the work of the Surveyor and the manner in which he has performed his duties. Mr. Chatwin.—I rise to a point of order. My point is that this gentleman was engaged by the Board on this understanding —that he could undertake private practice, and, that being so, whether he had private practice or not, was not a point for the 156 Board. They simply gave him the opportunity. I ask for your ruling as to whether the amount of private work he had interfering with his duties to the Board has anything to do with the question before you ? Mr. Cosh.—May I go on, Sir ? The Inspector.—Yes. Mr. Cosh.—I was about to observe this, without any reflection on our friend's statement, that some misunderstanding may arise in the minds of some of the ratepayers here assembled, and it is this. That, although your Surveyor was allowed to carry on a private practice, the interests of the Board were in no way prejudiced thereby, and I speak from a personal experience. In many instances they have derived a distinct benefit by estates in which the Surveyor was interested being laid out and improvements having been thereby carried through at the instance of the Surveyor, he prevailing on the private owners to concede those improvements which they were not legally bound to do by law. In respect of the Surveyor's claim, he has served the Board in a very faithful manner, and deserves the high consideration of every member of it, and also of the Secretary of State. The Inspector.—I understand that the Vestries leave it entirely to the Secretary of State to determine as to the manner in which the compensation should be paid; that is to say, whether it should be an annual allowance or whether a lump sum. Mr. Cosh.—I take it that would be so. The Inspector.—Have you any wish now to consider the matter? Mr. Cosh.—I rather fancy in those instances where the income from the superannuation represents large figures that it would be in the interests of the Vestries that they should be made by annual payments; but, in the smaller cases, where the officers are re-employed at a less salary than they have been receiving, I think the compensation to those persons should be made by a lump sum. Take the Medical Officer, for instance. He has been in the habit of receiving £350 a year. He has got an appointment now of £200 a year, and, I take it, the compensation for the loss of £150 a year would be veiy much better paid in a lump sum. Then, taking the case of the Surveyor and the Clerk, whose compensations are something considerable, I think it would be in the interests of the Vestries they should be met by an annual payment. (Hear, hear.) Those are my views, and, I believe, the views of a large number of the Vestrymen of 157 each parish. It might happen that the lives may drop out, and, if they were given a lump sum, the matter is concluded as far as the Vestries are concerned, but, if they drop out in a year or two's time, the Vestries get the benefit. Mr. Chatwin.—I think the Secretary of State has no option in the matter. Mr. Cosh.—Yes, he has. Mr. Chatwin.—I think there is a law which gives him no option in the matter. I think he having decided that they are entitled to a particular amount out of the rates, he cannot commute that. I have not the Act with me, but I believe there is one. I might perhaps say, Sir, that I was struck by the beauty of the argument, that these lives might drop out. The services have been rendered, and the value, if any, has been given. I take it that if we are to argue from that point, that a man in full health is less deserving of the money than when affliction comes, and his life should drop out, it would leave his wife and family unprovided for. Just think of that, Sir! But I think, Sir, that the better plan for us is to hold to the question as we have put it, that these gentlemen are not entitled to the compensation they claim, and leave it for the Secretary of State to deal with the matter; and with regard to that, I think you will find the Secretary of State has no option—that he cannot commute a pension. Mr. George Brown.—I should like to refer to something which has been suggested with regard to the Surveyor. My friend on my right suggests among other things 011 which he is informed, that the Surveyor declined to give the whole of his time to the service of the Board. I recollect that view being discussed at the Board several times. The Surveyor never declined to give the whole of his time; on the contrary, more than once he said, "I will give you the whole of my time if you desire it, if you will compensate me for the loss I shall sustain." That can be corroborated by every member of the Board present, and there are plenty of the members of the Board present now. Something has been said about the Medical Officer and the other officers. To begin with the Medical Officer first: this gentleman has devoted a great deal of his time—how much it is difficult to say—both morning, noon, and night. The day has never been too long for him to do his duty. When smallpox was raging, in the middle of the night he would get up to remove a patient, and, to his credit be it spoken, the district is free from zymotic diseases, although we have a shifting and a very poor population in many parts of our district. He had charge of two parishes, 158 at £350 per annum, and I am one of those—and there are others who think so too—that he was not overpaid; hut, if anything, considering the duty he had to perform, and tho efficient mode in which lie carried out those duties, that he was underpaid. (Hear, hoar.) He is deprived arbitrarily of a part of his income; ho is deprived of ono parish through no fault of his, and by no desire of his, but it is by statute, and consequently ho must submit. Tho gentleman opposite appears to submit that because ho is 36 years old—that seems to be tho principal offence, or the principal ground of his objection to his being compensated—that because he is only 36 years old he should not be compensated for loss of income. That is done by statute. Tho Legislature provides for these things. It is not the Board of Works who docs it, nor is it tho Vestries who do it, it is tho Legislature, in their wisdom, who have provided that in tho case of officers who are arbitrarily deprived of their living, or a portion of it, they should bo compensated; and it seems to mo only fair. Tho Medical Officer is going to stop, and, as we know, to tako service for this parish for £200 a year, and to givo up the other parish. There are those who think, and I think with them, that he is a loser by that arrangement; but he prefers to tako £200, and earn it, than to take compensation unearned. (Hear, hear.) That is the stato of things with reference to this gentleman at the present moment, which is capable of proof. Now, I come to the Clerk, and I say most fearlessly that the man has done his duty, and done it well. (Hear, hear.) I have never heard a complaint made as to the manner in which he has performed his duties; and he is suddenly deprived, for no fault of his, of his office. A circumstance which I nood not narrate hero has rendered it perhaps wise—I think so myself—and it was thought so unanimously by tho men who wero appointed to considor it, that it would be wiso to appoint tho Vestry Clerk to be Clerk of tho Vestry, and so blond tho two offices. Consequently, Mr. Jones is entirely superseded, and his services are not required. Would it be right and fair to deprive him of his income, from no fault and no wants and wishes of his? Would it be fair and right to doprive him of his incomo, as the gentleman opposite has suggested to you ? The feeling of those on this side is that it is right that ho should bo compensated. (Hear, hear.) I think tho gentleman opposite cannot havo calculated very closely tho consequence and tho result of his proposal. It seems to mo fair that tho officers who are still desorving of compensation, having been deprived of their office, should get compensation, and that justice will not 159 be done if they do not; and if the Surveyor, the Clerk, and the Medical Officer are not compensated with others who deserve compensation, I should think the Legislature would not have permitted all these enactments to have been made in the Act of Parliament. Mr. P. P. Perky.—I, for one, certainly should support fair compensation being paid; and I hope the Secretary of State will not take into consideration the views of our friend opposite, with whom I, for one, cannot agree, but that he will think that the enactments are made for the very purpose for which we are now seeking to apply them. (Hear, hear.) Then I should like to say one word in regard to the Clerk. I must say I have known him now about six years. I have been a constant attendant at this Board. I have not had much experience in Boards of Wox*ks—only in this Board—but, generally, I have never found a gentleman so efficient in carrying out the duties entrusted to him as the Clerk of this Board; and I am sure it has been the remark of gentlemen who have been sitting round these tables, as to the manner in which he has got up these statements of the facts and figures which he has put before you. And, as one gentleman said, "I should think the next thing you will do will be to go to the Bar." I am sure Mr. Jones has done his work well. (Hear, hear.) With regard to superannuation or compensation, I think if there is any difference, Mr. Jones is more entitled to it than any other officer. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Jones has arrived at that age when it is hard to start into new life, and into new business which might be open to him as his profession; and if he were to devote all his time to it, whether little or much, certain it is that Mr. Jones must begin life afresh. The office of Clerk to a Board of Works is not vacant every day, and .they are few and far between. There are juniors who step in, and they generally are selected. I think if superannuation or compensation is awarded, that Mr. Jones is more deserving than other officers, however desei'ving they might be. I think Mr. Jones, in the very peculiar position in which he is placed, being suddenly deprived of his living, will have to begin life again, if he does mean to do so, at the lowest or middle round of the ladder, before he reaches the top. I am sure, as far as Mr. Jones is concerned, the Board intended to give him compensation, or pension him. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Perkins.—With regard to a remark of Mr. Brown's I think, with all due respect to him, I am right in saying that Mr. Bean did refuse to give the whole of his time to the work of the Board. 160 A Vestryman.—No. Mr. Brown.—I must ask my colleagues of the Board of Works to speak as to this. Mr. P. P. Perry.—If the gentleman refers to the time when Mr. Bean's salary was altered to £600 a year, I can state distinctly that that was not so. I can say that, on Mr. Bean's salary being raised to £600 a year, there was a suggestion that lie. should give up the whole of his service to the Board. He said:—"I will if you pay me a proper sum," but he could not do it for £100 a year extra, and it was considered that he was entitled to £600 a year irrespective of that. In increasing his salary we took into consideration his private practice. He offered to show us the receipts from it, and we took that into consideration. He said, if we would pay him a certain sum then he would give up his private practice; therefore he did not refuse to give it up, nor did he tell us that the Board would have to get another Surveyor. That is why his salary was raised from £500 to only £600 a year. Mr. Haher.—With regard to Mr. Bean. What occurred was this: seven or eight years ago Mr. Bean refused to give up his private practice, saying it was worth more to him than the practice of the Board. Mr. T. E. Jones.—Those statements may be reconciled, as you will see in a moment, Sir. Mr. Bean, if you like to put it in that way, refused—that is to say, he said: "If you pay me sufficient salary to enable me to give up my private practice I will give it up; but unless you pay me sufficient salary to enable me to give it up, I must continue to hold it." That is really the true statement of the case, and in that way the statements are reconcileable. Mr. Brown.—That is my statement. If I failed to make myself understood I regret it. Mr. Bean never refused. He said, compensate me for my loss and I will give up my practice, and that was on the last occasion. The Inspector.'—Is there any other gentleman who wishes to say anything on this subject? (No reply.) Gentlemen, I will not detain you any length of time, but before leaving, I should like to bear my testimony to the very clear and able manner in which Mr. Jones, the Clerk to the District Board, has prepared this statement this morning, and has also, I think, contributed to the very cordial relations which have existed between the two Vestries. Mr. Chatwin.—I hope Mr. Jones will not take it for a moment in anything whatever that I have said that I wish to detract 161 anything from the value of his services. I am very glad to corroborate them. I did it simply on principle, with a view to try and keep down the rates. The Inspector.—The inquiry will bo adjourned sine die for a meeting to be held as soon as the accounts are settled by the auditors. It may be three months hence, but no date can be fixed. [Adjourned sine die.] On the 19th of March, 1886, the Secretary of State issued an order appointing the following gentlemen as Trustees, viz., Messrs. Edward Bird, George Brown, Thomas Chamberlen, Philip Pethick Perry, William Henry Harris and Alexander Glen. A copy of the order is printed hereunder. A 40,654 21 Whereas, by the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885, 48 and 49 Victoria, cap. 33, it was enacted as follows:— Section 3. "From and after the 25th day of March, 1886, the Board of Works for the District of Fulham shall be dissolved and the Vestries of the respective Parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and Fulham, shall from that date be incorporated, and shall have all such powers, and be subject to all such provisions, as if they had been named in part II. of schedule A to the said recited Acts. Section 7.

THE REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES APPOINTED BY THE ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Under the Provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, 1885 (48 and 49 Vic. cap. 33) as aforesaid. The Trustees held a preliminary meeting on the 25th day of March, and at their meeting held on the 26th day of March, 1886, it was resolved:—That Edward Bird, Esquire, be appointed the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and the following officers were appointed to perform such duties in relation to the several matters as the trustees might require, i.e., Mr. Alfred Cubitt Bean as Surveyor, Mr. Harry Thorndyke Percival, Mr. William Eggleton and Mr. W. Gr. Stephens as Clerks of Works in progress, Mr. Edward Foster Tomkins as Accountant, Mr. Nicholas Constantine Collier as Medical Officer of Health, and Mr. Thomas Edward Jones as Clerk, and it was reported at that meeting that the Clerk had on behalf of the Trustees taken possession of the whole of the property of the late Board under the terms of the said before-mentioned order. At the time of the dissolution of the late Board there were various public works in progress, i.e., paving works in Yeldham Road, Everington Street, Archell Road, Beaumont Road, Dieppe Street, Fulham Park, Hilmer Street, Eli Street, Fulham Park Gardens, Fulham Park Road, Langridge Road, and Fulham Park Gardens. The construction of public urinals at a site opposite the Beaumont Arms public-house at Shepherd's Bush, 164 on a portion of the land acquired for the improvement of the highway opposite the Walham Green Railway Station, on a site at the junction of the Bramley Road and Latimer Road, Hammersmith, and on a site at Gibbs' Green, Fulham, the wood paving of the carriageway of the Hammersmith Road, from Rowan Road to the boundary at the Addison Road Bridge, and other works, all of which with the subsidiary works necessary thereon have been completed. In the month of April the Trustees advertised in the following newspapers, i.e., the Times, the Metropolitan, the West London Observer, and the West London Advertiser, giving notice to all persons having claims against the estate of the late Board to send in their accounts, and the Trustees have reason to believe that there are no claims now outstanding except the accounts connected with the printing and publishing of this Report. HORSE TROUGH AT THE "DURRELL ARMS," FULHAM. Some time before the dissolution of the late Board a horse-trough which stood opposite the Durrell Arms, was removed by direction of the Board and a notice of action was served upon the Board, at the suit of Mrs. Sarah Ruth Lewis, the leaseholder of the premises. The Trustees, after lengthened negotiations, re-erected the old small trough that formerly stood in front of the premises and paid a sum of £50 in discharge of all liability and for costs. ACCOUNTS OF THE LATE BOARD. The Trustees caused to be prepared the Annual Statement and Abstract of Accounts of the late Board, as required by the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts, and submitted them for audit to the ratepayers appointed for that purpose. A copy of the Auditors' certificate will be found in the Annual Report of the late Board printed herewith. 165 DAWES ROAD IMPROVEMENT. This important work of widening the Dawes Road from the entrance opposite Walham Green Church to Rylston Road has been completed; in carrying out the work it was found desirable, in the interest of the public, to make an improvement by an alteration of the line opposite the "Mitre" pubiic-house, and this being agreed upon and carried out assisted in the completion of a work, which, it is hoped, will prove of great public utility. GREYHOUND ROAD—GUERRlER's PREMISES. In January, 1882, the late Board made an offer to the freeholder and to the leaseholder to treat for the acquisition of certain land forming part of the premises occupied by Messrs. Guerrier, and in due course claims were made, but of such a character that the Board did not feel justified in further proceeding with the matter, and after long and careful consideration of all the facts, the Trustees, acting under the advice of counsel, declined to entertain the claims. GREYHOUND ROAD—ST. ANDREW'S ESTATE. The question of carrying out this street improvement was also initiated by the late Board, and an application was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for consent to make the improvement, and for a contribution towards the cost. The Metropolitan Board, in view of the approaching dissolution of the Fulham District Board, directed that the consideration of the matter stand over. In the month of July the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works asking that the Trustees be directed to carry out this Improvement. M 166 Upon the matter coming to the notice of the Trustees, they at once informed the Metropolitan Board that they were willing to carry out the work if they, the Metropolitan Board, saw no legal difficulty in the way. Subsequently the Metropolitan Board gave their consent to the Improvement being carried out, and contributed one half the amount of the purchase money. The Trustees completed the conveyance, and carried out the works required in the making of the new footway, widening carriage way, &c. PARSON'S GREEN LANE—DE'SALAT'S ESTATE. This also was a street improvement, the land for which extending from the corner of Ackmar Road along Parson's Green Lane had been purchased by the late Board, but in consequence of disputes arising between the owner and the lessee (the builder) considerable delay occurred, and it was not until late in the summer that, the Trustees were able to obtain possession of the strip of land that was to be added to the public highway; so soon as possession was obtained, the necessary work of removing the old retaining wall, surplus materials, etc., and the formation and paving of a new footpath, and the widening of the carriageway, with the alteration, widening and improvements of the footpath on the opposite side of the road, were carried out and completed by the Trustees. KEMP'S ACTION This was an action instituted against the late Board by Mr. Gustav Kemp, who claimed damages on account of the Board having, as he alleged, improperly disinfected his house after the removal of a case of small-pox. The Trustees in defence of the Ratepayers had taken every possible precaution to defeat this action, when Mr. Kemp, at the last moment, offered to withdraw the 167 action and to pay the sum of £20 towards the costs incurred by the Board and the Trustees. The Trustees felt it their duty to accept such offer and so close this matter. BISHOP'S MEADOW, FULHAM—RECREATION GROUND. The Vestry of the Parish of Fulham made an application to the Trustees to carry into effect the terms and conditions of the deed of conveyance and lay out this ground, but the Trustees did not feel justified in undertaking such an important work without the express instructions of the Secretary of State. The facts of the case were laid before the Secretary of State, who has directed by order, dated the 3rd March, 1887, that the land in question be vested in the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, a copy of the order is printed herewith. ORDERS BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. In carrying out the duties of their office, in order to bring about a fair and equitable adjustment of the multifarious accounts of the late Board, upon the lines laid down at the Conference held between the representatives of the Board and the two Vestries, the Trustees have been in constant communication with the Home Office, and on the 27th July, 1886, an order of the Secretary of State, apportioning part of the debts, liabilities and property of the Board, was issued and is as follows:— M 2 168 Copy of the Second Order by the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Order apportioning Part of the Debts, Liabilities and Property op the Two Parishes. Whereas by the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885, 48 and 49 Vic., Cap. 33, it was enacted as follows:— Section 3. From and after the twenty-fifth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and eight-six, the Board of Works for the District of Fulham shall be dissolved, and the Vestries of the respective Parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and Fulham, shall, from that date be incorporated, and shall have all such powers and be subject to all such provisions as if they had been named in Part II. of Schedule A to the Act intituled an Act for the better local management of the Metropolis. Section 7. The property, claims and demands, and the debts and liabilities of the said District Board of Works shall be apportioned by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State between the said Parishes as he shall think fit, and he shall have power to give such directions as may seem to him to be expedient as to the sale and conversion of any of the property of the said District Board of Works, and as to the application of the proceeds, or any part thereof, in payment of any of the debts or liabilities of the said Board, including any compensation for loss of office to which any officer of the said Board may in his opinion be entitled, or otherwise for the benefit of the said Parishes; and until such apportionment the claims and demands and debts and liabilities of the said Board shall not by reason of its dissolution, cease or determine, but shall with the property of the said Board, vest in such person or persons as the Secretary of State shall direct ; and upon such apportionment the said property, claims and demands, and debts and liabilities shall by virtue of such apportionment be transferred and vest according to the same : Provided that such apportionment may be made at one or at several times, and may be amended at any time within one year from the twenty-fifth day of March, 1886. The apportionments and directions of the Secretary of State under this Section shall be final and conclusive. And Whereas I, the Right Honourable Hugh Culling Eardley Childers, one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, in exercise of the powers so conferred on me, did by my order of 19 March, 1886, direct that the claims and demands, and debts 169 and liabilities of the said Board of Works for the District of Fulham should, with the property of the said Board, be vested in the following persons—that is to say—Edward Bird, George Brown, Thomas Chamberlen, Philip Pethick Perry, William Henry Harris, and Alexander Glen. Now, I do hereby, in further exercise of the said powers and authority, give the following directions with respect to the apportionment of the claims and demands, and the debts and liabilities and of the property of the said District Board of Works. I. The apportionment of the property, claims and demands, and of the debts and liabilities of the said Board shall be made as between the Parish of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and the Parish of Fulham, on the basis of the proportion of 58.87 to 41.13 being the proportion which the total rateable value of the Parish of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, bears to the total rateable value of the Parish of Fulham. II. As regards the debts of the said Board, such debts as are mentioned in Schedule A hereto are hereby as from the 25th day of March, 1886, apportioned to the Vestry of the Parish of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and shall be chargeable on the rates of such Parish, and all payments of interest and of principal, due from and after the 25th day of March, 1886, shall be paid by the said Vestry; and such debts as are mentioned in Schedule B hereto are hereby apportioned as from the 25th day of March, 1886, to the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, and shall be chargeable on the rates of such Parish, and all payments of interest and of principal, due from and after the 25th day of March, 1886, shall be paid by the said Vestry. And in order to equalise the adjustment of such debts on the basis of apportionment above mentioned, the Vestry of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith, shall pay to the Vestry of Fulham the sum of £22. 8. 3 in respect of such debts. III. (1) As regards the freehold and leasehold properties mentioned in Schedule C hereto annexed, the Leasehold House and Stables at 637, Fulham Road, are hereby apportioned as from the said 25th day of March, 1886, to the Vestry of Fulham, and the several other properties mentioned in the said Schedule C are hereby apportioned as from the said 25th day of March to the Vestry of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith; and the Trustees appointed by my said Order of 19th March, 1886, shall charge to the respective Vestries in respect of the several properties so apportioned to them respectively the respective sums set against such properties in the said Schedule C under the head of "Agreed Valuation." 170 (2) The chattels enumerated in Part I of the Schedule D hereto are hereby apportioned as from the said 25th day of March, 1830, to the Vestry of St. Fetor and St. Paul, Hammersmith, and those enumerated in Part II to the Vestry of Fulham. (3) The Trustees shall bring to account in a common fund to be administered by them the several sums charged to the Vestries, both in respect of the Freehold and Leasehold properties, and of the Chattels apportioned to them, as above directed, with a view to the net residue amount being ultimately apportioned between the Vestries on basis of apportionment above set forth.

From and after the twenty-fifth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, the Board of Works 175 for the District of Fulhman shall be dissolved, and the Vestries of the respective parishes of St. Peter and St. Paul, Hammersmith and Fulham, shall, from that date be incorporated, and shall have all such powers and be subject to all such provisions as if they had been named in Part II. of Schedule A to the Act intituled an Act for the better management of the Metropolis. Section 7. The property, claims, and demands, and the debts and liabilities of the said District Board of Works shall be apportioned by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State between the said parishes as he shall think fit, and he shall have power to give such directions as may seem to him to be expedient as to the sale and conversion of any of the property of the said District Board of Works, and as to the application of the proceeds, or of any part thereof, in payment of any of the debts or liabilities of the said Board, including any compensation for loss of office to which any officers of the said Board may in his opinion be entitled, or otherwise for the benefit of the said parishes; and until such apportionment the claims and demands and debts and liabilities of the said Board shall not by reason of its dissolution, cease or determine, but shall with the property of the said Board, vest in such person or persons as the Secretary of State shall direct; and upon such apportionment the said property, claims, and demands, and debts and liabilities shall by virtue of such apportionment be transferred and vest according to the same: And whereas I, the Right Honourable Hugh Culling Eardley Childers, one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, in exercise of the powers so conferred on me, did by my order of 19th March, 1886, direct that the claims and demands, and debts and liabilities of the said Board of Works for the District of Fulham should, with the property of the said Board, be vested in the following persons—that is to say—Edward Bird, George Brown, Thomas Chamberlen, Philip Pethick Perry, William Henry Harris, and Alexander Glen.
