WH116 BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. REPORT ON The Sanitary Condition OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING- 28th MARCH, 1868, BY JOHN LIDDLE, Medical officer of Heath. PRESENTED TO THE BOARD 27th APRIL, 1868 LONDON. 1 8 6 8. london: PRINTED BY E. J. BATH, 26, HIGH STREET, WHITECHAPEL 1868 REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 2 8th MARCH, 186 8. To the Board of Works, Wlitechapel District. Gentlemen, During the thirteen weeks terminating 011 Saturday, the 28th March, the official returns show that there were registered in the Whitechapel District the deaths of 657 persons, of whom 380 were males and 277 females. During the same period, the births have been 703, viz., 360 males and 343 females. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year the births were 744 and the deaths 629. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 150, viz., 105 males and 45 females. Of the total deaths, 13 were of residents within the district, 86 of non-residents, and 51 of persons who died from the result of accident and from sudden death. Five deaths from Pyæmia, 1 from Diphtheria, and 1 from Fever, occurred in this Institution. The deaths in the Workhouse have been 105, viz., 58 males, and 47 females. The deaths from Epidemic Diseases in this establishment have been 5, viz., 1 from Small-pox, 1 from Diarrhœa, and 3 from Fever. The ages at death in the London Hospital and in the Workhouse, are shown in Table 3 in the Appendix. Epidemic Diseases have been fatal to 89, Small-pox occasioned 8 deaths, Measles 15, Scarlet-fever 9, Diphtheria 3, Hooping-cough 18, Diarrhoea 7, and Fever 29. 4 In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the deaths from Epidemic Diseases were 63, viz., 16 from Small-pox, 3 from Measles, 5 from Scarlet-fever, 1 from Diphtheria, 22 from Hooping-cough, 8 from Diarrhoea, and 8 from Fever. On comparing these returns, it will be seen that a great increase has taken place in the number of deaths from Fever, viz., 8 against 29, while the deaths from Small-pox have diminished from 16 to 8. The deaths from diseases of the Tubercular Class have been 114; of these, 67 were caused by Consumption. Three deaths were caused by Privation, and 2 from Scurvy. Diseases of the Organs of Circulation were fatal to 39 persons, 33 of whom died from Disease of the Heart, 4 from Aneurism, 1 from Pericarditis, and 1 from Hemorrhage. Five children were suffocated in bed, and 1 child died from suffocation, produced by drinking boiling water. Three persons were drowned accidentally. Two persons died from strangulation, 1 of whom was accidentally strangled, and the other was a case of self-hanging. The deaths from Old Age were 27, and from Premature Decay 5. The deaths from Burns and Scalds were 15, and from mechanical violence 33; of these latter, 5 were caused by vehicles in the public streets. The number of Inquests has been 84. In the corresponding quarter of last year the number was 67. The deaths from diseases of the Urinary Organs were 21, of which 9 were attributed to Blight's Disease of the Kidneys; 11 died from other Diseases of the Kidneys, and 1 from Vesico Vaginal Fistula. The mortality of children under 5 years of age has been 231. This is 35.0 per cent. of the total mortality. In the Artillery sub-district the proportion of deaths of children to the total mortality, is 50.0 per cent., and in the Spitalfields sub-district it is 60.0 per cent. The deaths of persons above 80 years of age have been 21; of these, 7 occurred in the Workhouse. The large per centage of the deaths of children in relation to the total deaths, as is shown in the several sub-districts, does not prove that the particular sub-district, in which the proportion of such deaths is the greatest, is the most unhealthy; although, as I have formerly stated, the 6 Unhealthiness of a district is, cæteris paribus, considered to be indicated by the greater proportion ite number of deaths of children. In order, however, to arrive at a more correct conclusion upon this subject, it is necessary to know the number of children living in the particular district, and the proportion it bears to that of adults. Moreover, it may happen that infantile diseases, such as Measles, Hooping-cough &c., may be, at one time, very prevalent and of a severe character, and thus raise the relative proportion of the mortality of children, while, on the other hand, Typhus-fever and other Epidemics, which are more fatal to adults, may prevail, thereby also occasioning a difference in the relative proportion of the deaths of children and adults. In a return to an Order of the Honorable the House of Commons, prepared by the Registrar General, and dated July 24th, 1863, it appears that in the Whitechapel District the proportion of deaths of children under 1 year of age, was 21,541 per 100,000, and that the deaths at less than 5 years of age was 10,365 per 100,000 living of each class referred to. In the whole of London, the proportion of deaths of children under 1 year, was 17,194, and at less than 5 years, it was 7,802 per 100,000 living of each class respectively. It may be here remarked that the Kite of mortality of children under 1 year diminishes month by month during the first year of life, but it is scarcely possible with accuracy to determine their rate of mortality owing to the fluctuations in the number of births, and the annual variation in the fatality of Zymotic Diseases among children. The registration of premature births is also a disturbing element in the calculation. From a Table prepared by the Registrar General, the rate of mortality of infants under one month, is, in England and Wales, 57 per cent., and the mortality between 11 and 12 months 9 per cent., there being a gradual diminution of the rate of mortality in each month of life. In those families whose circumstances enable the parents to devote due care and attention to the health of their children, the rate of mortality under 5 years of age varies from 2 to 3 per cent. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended 4,498 new cases of disease among the pauper population. There are included in this number 52 oi Small-pox, 88 of Measles, 7 of Scarlet-fever, 34 of Hooping-cough, 121 of Diarrhoea, and 199 of Fever. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the total number of cases of illness among the poor was 4,902, including 77 of Small-pox, 9 of Measles, 24 of Scarlet-fever, 109 of Hooping-cough, 160 of Diarrhoea, and 54 of Fever. Not a single case of Cholera has been returned by the Medical Officers during the quarter. 6 The Returns of the Registrar General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the quarter, has been 6.52 inches. During the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the rain-fall was 6.29 inches. The mean temperature of the air has been 41.1°. In the corresponding quarter of last year, the mean temperature of the air was 38.4°. The mean temperature in 52 weeks, ending 20th December, 18G7, was 48.6°, and in 1866, it was 49.9°. The following Table, taken from the Returns of the Registrar General, shows the comparative results during the quarter. LONDON.

The lowest temperature was on Friday, the 3rd January, when the thermometer stood at 22.8°, or 9.2° below the freezing point. TRADES' NUISANCES. It is with a feeling of much regret that I have regularly every quarter to bring under your notice the nuisance from the Refinery Premises of Sir Anthony Rothschild. Complaints still continue to be made of the deleterious effects of this nuisance, and I can bear personal testimony to the truth of these complaints. When the Board has interfered in the matter, assurances have been given by Sir Anthony Rothschild, and his agents, to the effect that, when the several alterations in the construction of the works were completed, the nuisance would be got rid of entirely. The last promise made to the Board was to the effect that, as the premises were then being enlarged, effective measures could, and would be taken to collect the heated acid vapours and condense them, whereby the neighbourhood would be entirely relieved from their noxious influence. The premises have been enlarged, but the nuisance continues to be as bad as ever. 1 Complaints have also been again made of the nuisance from the reburning of animal charcoal on the premises of Mr. Brinjes, in Back Church Lane, and also in those of Mr. Davis, in Rupert Street. Unless Mr. Brinjes adopt further measures for the abatement of this nuisance, it will be necessary to re-commence proceedings against him, and it will also be incumbent on the Board to commence proceedings against Mr. Davis, unless the nuisance on his premises is abated. The nuisance arising from the bone-boiling premises of Mr. Seaborn, in Thomas Street, has also been made a subject of complaint. I have already directed the attention of the Board to this matter, and the Clerk has received instructions to take the necessary proceedings to compel an abatement of the nuisance. Sanitary Work Performed during the Quarter. The following return shows the amount of work done by the Sanitary Inspectors during the Quarter: Number of inspections of houses, as shown in the Official Returns...8820 Houses systematically visited and rooms measured to ascertain their cubic capacity 667 Number of rooms found to be over-crowded, the space being less than 300 cubic feet for each person, reckoning two children for one adult 5 Number of cases of indecent occupation discovered 51 Preliminary Notices served for 1016 premises 619 Compulsory Orders issued 44 Summonses heard at Police Courts 3 Houses in which the rooms or passages have been white-washed 273 Dust-bins provided 59 Privies cleansed or repaired225 Water-butts or cisterns provided or repaired 101 Drains in houses improved, &c. 128 Cesspools abolished 2 Accumulations of dung and other offensive matter removed 192 Area gratings, cellar flaps, &c., repaired 20 Cellars used as dwellings discontinued for such use 7 *Houses closed, the same being unfit for human habitation (the owners preferring to close them rather than carry out the necessary requirements 5 Animals, so kept as to be a nuisance, removed 1 Yards of houses paved or the pavement repaired 160 Number of Special Notices served for registration of houses 30 *During the last year 65 houses were closed, in consequence of their being unlit for habitation, the greater number of these houses belong to the Railway Company, who, upon being served with Notices to put them in habitable repair, either closed them or pulled them down. 8 In addition to this return, Notices have been forwarded by the Inspectors to the Police Authorities of all cases which come under the Lodginghouse Act, and of all dangerous structures, which they have observed in the course of their visitations. The slaughter-houses, cow-houses, and bake-houses, have been specially inspected during the quarter, and, where sanitary improvements have been deemed necessary, Notices have been served on the proprietors. There are 23 cow-houses, 84 bake-houses, and 38 slaughter-houses in the district. WATER SUPPLY. Since my last Report, several additional water-waste preventers have been erected, and there are at the present time 67 of these machines in operation in this district.

These Acts are, first, Adulteration of Food or Drink ; second, the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses Act, 1851; third, an Act to enable the Public Works' Loan Commissioners to make Advances towards the Erection of Dwellings for the Labouring Classes, 1866 ; fourth, an Act to amend the Labouring Classes Dwellings' Act, 1867; and fifth, the Workshop Regulation Act, 1867. The Adulteration of Food or Drink Act gives power to the Yestries and District Boards to appoint analysts. The fourth Section of this Act empowers purchasers of articles of food or drink to have them analysed by the analyst appointed by the Board, on payment to the analyst a sum of not less than two shillings and sixpence, nor more than ten shillings and sixpence. The fifth Section gives power to Justices to have articles of food and drink analysed by any skilled person, as they may appoint, for that purpose. The three Acts relating to the erection of dwellings for the labouring classes, 1851, 1866, and 1867, may be read as one Act. The provisions of these Acts enable Local Boards to borrow money from the Public Works' Loan Commissioners, for the purpose of assisting Local Boards in the purchase of land and buildings, or in the erection, alteration, and adaptation of buildings, to be used as dwellings for the labouring classes, and in providing all conveniences which may be deemed proper in connexion with such dwellings. The Lands' Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and any Act amending the same, except the clauses with respect to the purchase and taking of lands, otherwise than by agreement, are incorporated with these Acts. The Workshop Regulation Act, which is an Act for regulating the hours of labour for children, young persons, and women employed in workshops; and for other purposes relating thereto, has already been brought under your notice in my Quarterly Report for September, 1867. The carrying out the provisions of this Act will entail a considerable amount of additional labour and responsibility upon the Board and its Officers. The duties of the Inspectors will be to inspect the means provided for ventilation in workshops, not specified in the Factory Acts' Extension Act, where a less number than fifty persons are employed, and to see that the nineteenth Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866, is observed, which provides for the keeping of such workshops in a cleanly state, and for their ventilation, in such a manner as to render harmless, as far as practicable, 10 any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the work carried on therein, that are a nuisance, or injurious, or dangerous to health, or so overcrowded, while work is carricd on, so as to be dangerous or prejudicial to the health of those employed therein. Although not specially mentioned in the Act, it will unquestionably be the duty of the Sanitary Officers of the Board to see that there is sufficient privy accommodation provided for the work-people employed in every factory over which the Board exercises jurisdiction. The want of sufficient privy accommodation is fraught with great mischief to the health of all persons working in factories, and particularly to the young. The workshops which will more especially require inspection in this district, are, where the businesses of millinery, tailoring, wax-flower making, shirt making, feather dressing, rag sorting, lucifer-match making, and a few others are carried. In conclusion, I may remark, that the sanitary condition of the houses in this district has, within the last two years, been considerably improved. This improvement has been effected by your having a larger staff of Inspectors, by whose agency not only is the district more frequently inspected, but the work ordered to be done to improve the sanitary state of the poorer localities, is seen to be carried out. The mere superficial inspection of the district and the serving of Notices are of little practical benefit; for, unless the Notices, which the Inspectors serve upon the owners of property to remedy the sanitary defects which have been pointed out to them, are not followed up by repeated visitations, they will be only partially remedied. The recording in books, prepared for the purpose, the defects discovered in the houses of the poor, together with the preparing and serving the Orders to get the defects remedied, necessarily occupies a large amount of the time of the Inspectors. Unless everything required to be done in the way of sanitary improvement be duly entered, and when carried out, properly recorded, the results would not be known, and much of the labour of the Inspectors would be uselessly spent. In order that the sanitary work of the district may be properly performed, it is absolutely necessary that a staff of not less than four Inspectors be employed. If reference be made to the amount of work performed by the Inspectors during the last year, it will be seen that 35,577 visits were made to the poorer class of houses, and 2,773 preliminary Notices served. If each Notice only referred to one house, it is manifest that these visits are important; but it frequently happens that one Notice contains orders for the sanitary improvement of several houses. I have no hesitation in saying that unless all the poorer localities, and the houses which are let out in tenements, are frequently inspected, and the nuisances that are continually occurring therein, either from defective drainage, over-crowding, or from the neglect of periodical white-washing, disease will be engendered, 11 and the rate of mortality will be increased. The rate of mortality in London, and in all other cities and towns, where sanitary improvements have been effected, has materially decreased; and, in the Whitechapel District, a reduction in the rate of mortality has taken place, to the extent of 3 or 4 per 1,000 annually of the population since 1862, notwithstanding the great increase of pauperism in the district. All the public dust-bins, which are 100 in number, and scattered over the whole district, ought to be, and generally are, inspected daily. Not only is it necessary for the health of the district that the public dustbins be emptied daily, but as the Board contracts for the daily removing of the dust and rubbish from them, it is incumbent upon the Inspectors to see that the work is done. Very few complaints have been entered in the public complaint-book since the staff of Inspectors has been increased, but if the Board determine to reduce the number, it may happen that the complaints of nuisances will be of more frequent occurrence, and the work may so accumulate that it will be necessary to have additional assistance in the sanitary department. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN LIDDLE. 15, Great Alie Street. APPENDIX.

REPORT ON The Sanitary Codition OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 27th JUNE, 1868, BY JOHN LIDDLE, Medical officer of Heath. PRESENTED TO THE BOARD 6th JULY, 1808. LONDON. 1868. LONDON: printed by e. j. bath, 26, high street, whitechapel 1868 R E P O R T the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, oh the Quarter ending 27th June, 1868. To the Board of Works, Whitechapel District. Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, June 27th, the births registered in the Whitechapel were 686, viz.: 347 boys and 339 girls. During the same period, the deaths have been 595, viz.: 333 males and 252 females. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the births were 669 and the deaths 533. There is, therefore, an increase in the number of births of 17, and an increase of 62 in the number of deaths. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 117, viz.: 80 males and 37 females. On comparing the mortality of this District with that of others, the deaths in this Institution are always omitted, as patients from several parts of the country, and from nearly all the Districts of London, are admitted to the benefits of this charity. Of the total deaths in the London Hospital, 80 were of nonresidents within this District, 8 of residents, and 29 of persons who died from the result of accident and from sudden death. The previous residences of persons dying from accidents are not always recorded in the returns of the local registrar. 4 The deaths in the Workhouse have been 93, viz.: 56 males and 37 females. The deaths from epidemic diseases in this establishment have been 12, viz.: 4 from measles, 1 from diarrhoea, and 7 from fever. The ages at death in the London Hospital and in the Workhouse, and the mortality in these institutions, for the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, are shown in Table No. 3 in the Appendix. The deaths from epidemic diseases have been 90, viz : 18 from measles, 1 from scarlet-fever, 1 from diphtheria, 19 from hooping-cough, 22 from diarrhoea, 17 from fever, and 2 from choleraic-diarrhoea. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the deaths from epidemic diseases were 76, viz.: 15 from small-pox, 8 from measles, 8 from scarlet-fever, 1 from diphtheria, 22 from hooping-cough, 5 from diarrhoea, and 17 from fever. In London, during this Quarter, there have been registered 39 deaths from cholera and choleraic-diarrhoea. The deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory organs, exclusive of consumption, have been 69. Consumption was fatal to 67, including 7 deaths from that disease in the London Hospital, which is in the proportion of 12 per cent. of the total deaths, and if we exclude from the total deaths the 117 deaths in the London Hospital, then the proportion of deaths is 60 in 478, or 12.5 per cent. The deaths from other tubercular diseases have been 48, viz.: 33 from mesenteric disease, 13 from hydrocephalus, and 2 from scrofula. The violent deaths, including those from accidents, negligence, from suicide, and from murder, have been 33; of these, 3 were of children suffocated in bed, 7 of persons who were scalded or burnt, 1 person was murdered, and 3 committed suicide. One man died from drinking raw gin in large quantities from the gutter in the street. The deaths from diseases of the urinary organs have been 16; of these, 12 were caused by Nephria, or Bright's disease. The deaths of children under 5 years of age have been 252. This is 43 per cent. of the total mortality. The number of uncertified deaths has been 4. The deaths of persons above 80 years of age has been 17; of these, 1 occurred at the advanced age of 96. The number of inquests has been 57, of which 28 were held at the London Hospital. The deaths caused by vehicles in the streets were 4. PAUPER SICKNESS IN THE DISTRICT. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended 4,263 new cases of illness, including 22 of small-pox, 143 of measles, 5 of scarlet-fever, 5 62 of hooping-cough, 30G of diarrhoea, 125 of fever, and 1 of choleraicdiarrhœa. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the number of cases of illness attended by the Medical Officers of the Union was 4,054. The out-door pauper cases of sickness in this District have increased from 11,392 in 1860 to 17,181 in 1867. It is a matter of surprise to me that this fact has not seriously engaged the attention of the Guardians, for I have, in each of my Quarterly Reports, published the number of sick paupers. The returns of sickness are exclusive of the cases in the Workhouse, which, in 1865, were 3,535. In my Quarterly Report for July, 1858, I published a return of the pauper eases of illness in 19 Districts in London, from which it appears, that, with the exception of the large Parish of Marylebone, the cases in the Whitechapel District are not only relatively more numerous than any other Metropolitan District, but are actually so. Thus, it is shown, that the Medical Officers of Saint Pancras, with a population of about 195,000, had attended, in 1857, 1,497 cases less in the year than had been attended in the Whitechapel District, with a population of 78,000. The total number of sick paupers in the Whitechapel District, including the cases in the Workhouse, now exceeds 20,000 annually. The returns of the Registrar General show that the rain-fall in the metropolis during the Quarter has been only 4.22 inches. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 6.27 inches. The mean temperature of the air was 55.1°. The hottest days during the Quarter were Tuesday, May the 19th, Saturday, June 20th, and Saturday, June 27th, when the thermometer in the shade indicated respectively 87.0°, 88.0°, and 88.6°. The following Table, taken from the returns of the Registrar General, shows the comparative residts during the Quarter:— LONDON.

These are not recorded in the books of the Inspectors, unless official notices are served. In addition to this return, the Inspectors report that they have forwarded to the police authorities several notices of dangerous structures, and have also given intimation to them of all the rooms which they have found on a house-to-house visitation, or on private information, to be occupied by more than one family. The Act requires that all rooms, so let, must be registered under the Common Lodging House Act. 8 From the above statement, it appears that 340 houses have been either partially or completely white-washed during the Quarter. This is but a small proportion of those houses which ought to have been limewashed, for, instead of 350, the number should have been about 5,000, or all the houses in the District which are let out in separate tenements. The rules and regulations of the Board respecting houses let as lodging-houses, only go to the effect that such premises are to be lime-whited "as often as occasion shall requirebut the rule ought to have been so framed that all such houses should be lime-whited regularly twice at least in every year, regardless of the appearance of the walls and ceilings, and of the opinion of the Inspectors or of the Medical Officer of Health. As the police regulations concerning registered lodginghouses, in which persons only pass the night, and in which no case of sickness is allowed to remain, require that all the rooms shall be timewashed twice at least in every year, it is the more necessary to enforce a similar provision for those tenements in which persons live, sleep, wash, cook, and die, and in which the corpse is sometimes retained for ten, twelve, or more days. WATER SUPPLY. Since my last Quarterly Report three additional water-waste preventers have been erected in this District, viz.: one in Hanover Court, one in Shorter's Rents, and one in Vincent's Place. There are now 70 of those machines in operation in this District, and I hope that the number will soon be greatly increased; for it is most desirable that the abominably filthy butts, now so general among poor, should be removed, and that in lieu thereof, the poor should have water direct from the main. As there are still remaining upwards of 4,000 unfit water receptaclcs, it is manifest that much more attention must be given to this matter before the water supply is satisfactory, yet I have reason to believe that, from the recent proceedings of the two water companies, which supply this District, they are both willing and anxious to furnish the poor localities with water by means of water-waste preventers; and, further, from a communication I have received from Mr. Edinger, the Superintendent of the East London Company, I infer that it will not be very long before a great improvement will be effected in the mode of supply in the District, which is under his superintendence. TRADES' NUISANCES. The complaints of the nuisance from Sir Anthony Rothschild's premises are as numerous as ever. From my personal knowledge, I can 9 say that the nuisance is increased in intensity. Still, the inhabitants, although continually complaining to the Officers of the Board, seem reluctant to memorialize the Board upon the subject. If they were to do so, the nuisance would soon be suppressed. The re-burning of animal charcoal in some of the factories is a great nuisance, and it has, upon several occasions, been publicly complained of. I am sorry to be compelled to record the fact that another sugar refiner has adopted the plan of re-burning the animal charcoal in a similar manner to that which has been so much complained of; nevertheless, I have the satisfaction of stating that the gentleman, to whom the premises belong, has, at my suggestion, promised to adopt such means as will, most probably, abolish the nuisance. Mr. Sequeika, a most painstaking and industrious Medical Officer of the Union, who had under his care, in 1867, no less than 6,323 sick. paupers, has directed my attention to a subject of great importance as affecting the health of a large class of labourers "employed in certain warehouses in the docks and elsewhere in the District, in which dry goods are stored, especially tea, hemp, jute, indigo, and seeds." Mr. Sequiera says that the irritating dust arising in these warehouses is a source of great suffering and mischief to the men employed therein, producing severe forms of affections of the lungs. Perhaps, my having called public attention to this subject in the present Beport, will be sufficient to induce the dock proprietors and others to adopt such remedial means as will mitigate the sufferings of the men employed therein, either by fixing a fan or other mechanical contrivance, to drive the dust, which arises from the sorting or moving these dry goods, out of the building. COW HOUSES. All the cow houses in the District (23 in number) have been twice inspected during the Quarter. From the reports of the Inspectors, it appears that the undermentioned proprietors have not conducted their businesses in a satisfactory manner, viz.:— George Ayres, Gower's Walk; Isaac Sole, Back Church Lane; Fredk. Brown, Old Montague Street; John Davis, Black Lion Yard; Edward Forster, Pelham Street; Ann James, Spital Street; Thomas Williams, White's Bow, Spitalfields; Edward Benyon, Bell Lane; Daniel Barker, Saw Yard; Bobert May, White Lion Street; Griffith Jones, Royal Mint Street; and W. G. Le Beau, Boyal Mint Street. George Ayres had upon his premises 12 cows, the number allowed by the Board being only 7. Isaac Sole had 34 cows instead of 32, the number allowed. Frederick Brown had 9 instead of 7. John Davis had 25 instead of 24. E. Forster had 20 instead of 14. Ann James had 10 instead of 7, Edward Banyon had 15 instead of 14. Thomas Williams 10 had 7 instead of 5. W. G. Le Beau had 9 instead of 5. Griffith Jones had 21 instead of 15, and he also kept 4 cows in an unlicensed stable. Messrs. Barker, May, Benyon, Williams, and Ayres, have not observed the regulations of the Board, relating to the removal of the dung, from their premises three times a week. The stirring up the dung and carting it away from the premises, where cows are kept, are nuisances, and the longer that the dung remains on the premises, the greater will be the nuisance. Dung, in my opinion, should not be permitted to remain upon any premises for a longer period than two days. Unless proper sanitary regulations are observed by cow-keepers, the license should not be granted. In the minutes of the meeting of the Board of "Works, held on Monday, 14th October, 1867, on the report of the clerk, respecting the result of the applications for slaughter-houses, and for keeping cows, it was resolved that the clerk be directed to "issue notices to the owners of cow-houses, specifying the number of animals for which it was considered by the medical officer each place licensed was capable of containing, allowing 1,000 cubic feet for each, and to give notice that if the number was exceeded, the Board would oppose the grant of future licenses, and in the interim, adopt such other measures as should appear necessary." In accordance with the above resolution, the clerk issued a letter to each cow-keeper in the District, embodying the resolution of the Board, a copy of which letter is printed in my Quarterly Beport for September last. The cow-keepers have, therefore, had ample notice of the requirements of the Board, as regards the number of cows to be kept on each of their premises sought to be licensed; in addition to this notice of the clerk, the Inspectors have, on each visit, warned the proprietors of the consequences of disregarding the regulations of the Board. If, therefore, any of the above-mentioned cow-keepers should lose their license, they will have to blame themselves. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT. Having recently in a Report, which was printed by order of the Board, and circulated among the members, explained the duties that were performed by the four Inspectors, it is unnecessary to occupy your time by again laying the matter before you; I may, however, here remark, that in order to carry out, in an efficient manner, the inspection of the District for sanitary purposes, it is absolutely necessary that all the rooms in every house, which is let out in separate tenements, should be regularly and systematically inspected once, at least, in every three months, so that the Board, and the Medical Officer of health, may be well acquainted with the general condition of the houses in the worst localities. 11 I have, on a former occasion, estimated that out of 8,067 inhabited houses in the District, there are at least 5,000 of them containing about 17,500 rooms, which require a regular inspection, not only for the purpose of ascertaining the sanitary condition of each room, but the number of inmates it contains, so that overcrowding may, as far as possible, be prevented. I may here remark, that I believe I have considerably underestimated the number of houses, which require this regular and systematic inspection. The number is, probably, above 6.000, but say, as formerly estimated, 5,000. In order to accomplish the required inspection of 5,000 houses, it will be necessary for the inspectors to visit daily 64 houses, containing about 224 rooms. A record of the result of each inspection must be made at the time of the visit, in a rough diary, and a copy of all the particulars must be entered in a book prepared for that purpose. Now, supposing that two Inspectors had nothing else to do but to inspect daily 64 houses, containing 224 rooms (some of which are in houses three or four stories high, and, in some instances, the top rooms can only be reached by ascending a dark, ill-ventilated, and sometimes dilapidated staircase), and making notes of the condition of each room, and looking to the state of the yard, cellar, privy, drain, and water supply of each house, the inspection cannot be made in less time than four minutes, on an average, per room; so that, in performing this branch of their duty, each Inspector, supposing that two are employed for this purpose only, would be obliged to work seven hours and a half a day without intermission. The making of an entry in the office of the rough notes from the diary, will probably engage the time of each Inspector for an hour, making eight hours and a half daily. In this calculation I have made no allowance for interruptions and for meals. This amount of work is, I believe, as much, and is probably more, than two Inspectors could do, even supposing them to be young, strong, and active men, more especially when we know that their work is carried on in an unhealthy atmosphere, and amidst nuisances of a disgusting and health-destroying nature. The daily inspection of houses which has been carried out in this District, ever since the formation of your Board, has been productive of the best results; and in order that it may be more efficiently done than heretofore, the services of two Inspectors should be engaged for this purpose only. As regards the other duties which must be performed by the Inspectors, viz.: the hearing and answering complaints, made verbally and in writing; the prompt attention which must be given to every complaint regarding stopped or otherwise defective drainage, either occurring in the poor localities or among the respectable inhabitants of the District; and the daily inspection of the poorer localities, to see that the back yards of 12 the houses, and the private and public privies, and the water supply, are in proper condition. The entire District, I may observe, consists of 406 statute acres, or about two-thirds of a square mile, and having a total length of streets of about 21 miles, and it is principally inhabited by the poorer classes, probably to a greater extent than any other District in the metropolis; and for this reason it requires more attention to be paid to it by the Sanitary Officers; in fact, it is an exceptional District, as is shown by the immense amount of sickness among the paupers, which I have already mentioned, and in consequence, it requires an exceptional mode of sanitary supervision. It, therefore, will not admit of a comparison being made with any other district, as regards the number of Inspectors of Nuisances which is required, more especially when we call to mind that, during the time of the cholera, 40 nuisances, of a recurring character, upon an average, were reported every day at the office of the sanitary department. Further, the Inspectors have to write all the preliminary notices, and make copies of them in books prepared for the purpose. These books are so indexed, that any member of the Board can find, without trouble, the kind of sanitary work that has been done in every poor locality in the District. The Inspectors have also to prepare, and serve, compulsory notices—to regularly visit those premises in which noxious trades are carried on—to make repeated calls at the houses in which sanitary defects have been discovered and notices served for remedying the same, in order to sen that the work has been completed. All houses which require sanitary improvement, and for which notices have been served, must be visited, upon an average, at least four times, before the work ordered to be done is completed. The 23 cow-houses and the 44 slaughter-houses in the District, must be inspected twice at least in every quarter, and a record made of the sanitary condition of each in the prescribed form. The 79 bake-houses must be inspected once or twice in every year. The Inspectors have been instructed by me to visit, daily, the 160 public dust-bins in the District, and as the streets in the District are, as above stated, about 21 miles in length, this Work necessarily takes up a considerable portion of their time. The importance of having the public dust-bins emptied every day, cannot be over-estimated. This was made manifest only a few days ago, when one of the public dust-bins, which the Inspector had found on the preceding day to have been empty, was, on the following morning, filled with offensive matter as to create such a nuisance, that the dust-men engaged in emptying this bin, applied to the office for some disinfecting powder, to enable them to complete the work. 13 The labour, however, of inspecting the public dust-bins, might be removed from the Inspectors, and be made the duty of the foremen of the scavengers. This economical arrangement was suggested to me by Mb. James and Mb. Coward, and it entirely meets with my approval. I have not thought it desirable to burden this Eeport with any further detail of the duties of the Inspectors, but there are many other duties of a less important character, which occupy no inconsiderable portion of their time. I have, however, probably said enough to show that I had fully considered the question relating to the number of Inspectors who are required to perform the sanitary work of the District, when I urged upon the Board not to diminish the number of the staff, but rather to increase the efficiency of it. If the Board agree with me in thinking that the work should be done in the way I have pointed out, they must come to the conclusion that not less than four active young men are required for the purpose. If, on the other hand, they are of opinion that a less amount of work will be sufficient for the exigencies of the District, then, of course, a less number of Inspectors will suffice. I leave the matter, therefore, in the hands of the Board, and will only add that, however small the staff of Inspectors may be, I will do the best I can with it for furtherance of the interest of the Board. Under any circumstances, it would be most desirable to have a clerk, to do the greater part of the writing that now devolves upon the Inspectors, and whose duty it should be to remain in the office during office hours, to take cognizance of complaints, and record the same in books kept for that purpose. In conclusion, I wish to draw your attention to the statement made by one of the Inspectors relating to the number of visits that he had made to houses in the District. It was inferred from his statement that he had made visits to 5 or 6 houses only, and had returned in his fortnightly diary 30. Now this is a mistake. The returns made are in every respect correct, and no more visits to houses have been recorded than had actually been made. The several places visited on each day contain upon an average about 160 houses, but only 5 or 6 in each court or street mentioned were inspected. The total visits making in the aggregate about 30 per day. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 15, Great Alio Street. JOHN LIDDLE, APPENDIX.

REPORT ON The Sanitary Condition OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING- 26th SEPTEMBER, 1868, BY JOHN LIDDLE, Medical Officer of Heath. PRESENT ED TO THE BOARD 12 TH OCTOBER, 18 68, LONDON. 1 8 6 8. E. J. BATH, Printer, 26, High Street, Whiteohapel. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, foe the Quarter ending 26th September, 1868. Gentlemen, In the Quarter that ended on Saturday, September 26th, there were registered in the Whitechapel District, 583 births, viz.: 275 males and 308 females. The deaths during the same period were 638; of these, there were 361 of males and 277 of females. In the corresponding Quarter of last year, the births were 630, and the deaths 570. In each of these Quarterly Returns the deaths in the London Hospital are included. On comparing the returns of births and deaths for the Quarter ending in September, 1867 and 1868, it will be observed that the deaths in the latter period exceeded the births by 55, while, in the former, the births exceeded the deaths by 60. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 137, which is 21.4 per cent. of the total mortality in the District; of these deaths, 96 were of males and 41 of females. Of the deaths in this Institution, there have been 16 of residents within the District, 77 of non-residents, and 44 of persons who died from the result of accident and from sudden death. Excluding the deaths in the London Hospital, the annual rate of mortality has been 25 per 1000. It will be seen, on looking at the Table containing the ages at death in the London Hospital, that 15 children, under the age of 5 years, died in that Institution. The authorities of the Hospital, within the last few years, having devoted some wards for the reception of children suffering from severe disease, it may now be considered a hospital for children as well as for adults. This extension of its benefits calls upon the public for additional support. The deaths from epidemic diseases have been 177, viz.: 2 from small-pox, 13 from measles, 11 from scarlet-fever, 1 from diphtheria, 12 from hooping-cough, 101 from diarrhoea, 29 from fever, and 8 from cholera and choleraic diarrhcea. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the deaths from epidemic diseases were 138. The rate of mortality from epidemic diseases, in relation to the total mortality, has been 30.3 per cent. 4 The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, exclusive of consumption, have been 59; of these, 24 were caused by bronchitis, 27 by pneumonia, and 8 by other diseases of the lungs. Diseases of the heart were fatal to 41. The tubercular class of diseases proved fatal to 125; of these, 75 were from consumption, 46 from mesenteric disease, and 4 from hydrocephalus. Three persons died from privation. The deaths from diseases of the urinary organs have been 9; of these, 4 were caused by nephria or Bright's disease. Diseases of the liver were fatal to 12 persons. The deaths from violence have been 39, from burns and scalds 8, from suffocation in bed (an infant) 1, from drowning 3, and from wounds self-inflicted 1. The deaths from consumption are in the proportion of 11.1 per cent, of the total deaths. The cause of death of a patient in the London Hospital is thus vaguely recorded "exhaustion." The mortality of children under 5 years of age has been 285; this is 44.8 per cent. of the total mortality. In the Artillery sub-District the rate of mortality was 65.1 per cent. The deaths of persons above 80 years of age have been 8; of these, 1 person reached the advanced age of 94. The number of inquests has been 80. In the corresponding Quarter of last year, the number of inquests was 62. Eight persons died from injuries caused by vehicles in the streets. The death of a child 3 years old, was caused by a flower-pot falling on its head. PAUPER ILLNESS IN THE DISTRICT. The Medical Officers of the Union have attended 4,765 new cases of illness out of the Workhouse, including 13 of small-pox, 51 of measles, 17 of scarlet-fever, 23 of hooping-cough, 1,041 of diarrhoea, 113 of fever, and 7 of choleraic diarrhcea. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the number of cases of pauper sickness was 4,263, including 836 of diarrhoea, 41 of small-pox, and 61 of fever. The increase in the number of pauper cases of illness still continues, although the pqpulation, from the pulling down of houses for publio improvements, is decreasing. METEOROLOGY OP GREENWICH. The returns of the Registrar General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the Quarter, has been 4.40 inches. During the corresponding Quarter of last year the rain-fall was 11.40 inches. The mean temperature of the air was 63.9°. In the corresponding Quarter of last year the mean temperature of the air was 59.8°. The hottest day during the Quarter, was on Wednesday, July 22nd, when the thermometer in the shade indicated 96.0°. 5 The following Table, taken from the returns of the Registrar General, shows the comparative results during the Quarter:— LONDON.

In the corresponding Quarter of last year, the deaths in the Workhouse were 71, including 1 from diarrhœa, 2 from fever, and 1 from choleraic diarrhoea. WATER SUPPLY. Although great improvements in the water supply have been effected of late years in this District, yet, from the defective condition of many of the water receptacles in the poor localities, it is far from being in a satisfactory condition, and it will so continue to be until the entire District is supplied direct from the main. In my last Report, I stated that there were 70 water-waste preventers in the District. Since that date, two additional ones have been erected, viz.: one in Duke Street and the other in Union Court, Fashion Street, making a total of 72; but as Trumpet or Crown Court, Whitechapel Road, in which a water-waste preventer had been erected, is now entirely abolished; there are, therefore, only 71 of these machines in the District. TRADES' NUISANCES. The nuisance from the refinery premises of Sir Anthony Rothschil is still complained of by some of the inhabitants in the vicinity of the works. Notwithstanding the numerous complaints, no further means, that I am aware of, have been adopted by Sir A. Rothschild to abate the nuisance. The bone-boiling premises of Mr. Camden, of Mr. Quaintrell, and of Mr. Seaborn, are regularly inspected three or four times a week by myself and the Inspectors, and during this Quarter there has been no evidence that the business of bone-boiling has been carried on to any extent on 6 either of the above-named premises. These several premises are, however, used as store-houses for bones, and when there is a large accumulation of bones in a decomposing state, the smell is very offensive. I have repeatedly informed the respective owners that they must remove the bones every second or third day, and use carbolic acid or chloride of lime to lessen the effluvium from the bones, while they are being carted away. The nuisance is now greatly abated, but nevertheless, it will be necessary to keep a constant watch upon all these premises. COW HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. All the cow-houses and slaughter-houses in the District have been inspected either by myself or by the Inspectors. It appears, that 23 persons have applied for licenses to keep cows, and 39 for licences to slaughter cattle. As regards the cow-houses in the District, 1 may say that generally they are not well conducted. Some of them are badly ventilated, and the proprietors, regardless of my advice, have kept more cows than their premises were capable of holding, consistently with the health of the neighbourhood and the health of the cows. It requires no argument to prove that there must be a limit fixed to the number of cows which should be kept in any cow-shed. The only point wherein a difference of opinion can exist is, that respecting the amount of spaco each cow ought to have in a properly ventilated cowshed. It is estimated by Dr. Letheby that an adult man produces 1,084 cubic inches of carbonic acid per hour, and a cow 14,750 cubic inches, or about 14 times as much. Therefore, if the minimum space of 1,000 cubic feet, which I have suggested, should be allowed to each cow, it surely cannot be considered too large when 300 cubic feet is the minimum space, which can be safely allowed for each man or woman. It must also be borne in mind that in the London cow-sheds, the cows are seldom, if ever, taken out for exercise, but they are confined night and day in the same place, so that the air in these cowsheds, is never completely changed. Moreover, the cows' dung which, in ill-regulated sheds, is allowed to remain two or three days in or near the cow-shed, vitiates the air, and the poor animals are compelled to breathe the air so contaminated. The smell also from the grains and other food supplied to the cows, when kept in the cow-shed, as is sometimes the case, is very offensive, and is injurious to the health of the animals. In short, some of the cow-houses stink abominably. In the District of St. Giles's, there is no cow-shed that has not less than 1,300 cubic feet for each cow. The regulation adopted by that Board is, that every cow-house shall give to each cow a space of 12 x 6 superficial feet, exclusive of gangway and channel, and that the cubic space for each cow shall in no case be less than 1,300 cubic feet, and when there are more than 10 cows in a shed, the dung shall be removed from the premises daily. The minimum space for each cow in the cow-sheds of St. Pancras District, is fixed by the Justices at 1,000 cubic feet. 7 As cow-sheds in crowded neighbourhoods are more or less a nuisance and injurious to the health of the public, all ought to be prohibited which are within 50 feet of a dwelling-house. This regulation has been adopted by the Vestry of Paddington, and the Magistrates gave notice that at the next licensing day the license would be refused for cow-sheds and slaughter-houses within the above-mentioned distance from inhabited houses. In the Parish of St. James, Westminster, cow-sheds are not allowed to exist. It is truly lamentable to find the indifference which is manifested by the majority of the cow-keepers, towards the comfort of the surrounding neighbourhood, by their paying insufficient attention to the sanitary conditions of their premises, as regards cleanliness, the prompt removal of dung, and the number of cows. The cow-keepers appear to be under the impression that, having once obtained their license, which they expect to do as a matter of course, the proceedings before the Magistrates being a mere formality, they can conduct their business in whatever manner they please; but this conduct on their part, if persevered in, will probably lead to the passing of an Act to prohibit the keeping of cows in the Metropolis. The following remarks, contained in a note, at the foot of page viii, in the Third Beport of the Commissioners, appointed to inquire into the origin, &c., of the cattle plague, are important: ''Although the evidence which has been placed before us, shows that the condition of the London cow-houses has been very much improved of late years, chiefly by the exertions of the Metropolitan Officers of Health, it is yet certain that a better system of licensing ought to be adopted. Sanitary regulations are not uniform, are sometimes irregularly enforced, and can only be carried out by threatening opposition to the renewal of the license. In all parts of the Metropolis, the keeper of a cow-shed should be subjected to the same rules, and he should be called upon to show, before he obtains his license, that he is prepared to fulfil the rules. There is still much needed to be done in the way of securing a larger cubic space, more thorough ventilation and drainage, earlier removal of manure, and better supply of pure water." In the minutes of evidence, taken before the Cattle Plague Commissioners, Mr. G. Tegg, a member of the Veterinary College, and Inspector of the Metropolitan Market, stated that, in his opinion, the cows which were kept in close, ill-ventilated places, were most prone to the disease. Before the same Commission, Dr. Ballard stated that, the attacks of the disease bore relation to the cubical space allotted to a cow in the cow-sheds in Islington. In answer to the question of the Counsel, who had been retained in the interest of the cow-keepers, in St. Giles's District, "Do you mean to say that a cow-house and yard is more detrimental to the health of a neighbourhood, than if the same space were covered with poor houses ?" Dit. Buchanan, the Medical Officer of Health, answered "Yes, it positively is so." In concluding this portion of my Report, I avail myself of the opinion of Dr. Letheby, respecting the ventilation of cow-sheds. Dr. Letiieby thinks that 1,000 cubic feet to be a proper space for a cow, not merely for the healthy respiration of the animal, but also for its comfort and cleanliness. The facts, however, which should guide us in this matter, the Doctor says, are these; 8 "1st, That neither a man nor a cow can live with health and comfort in an atmosphere which contains more than 20 parts of carbonic acid per 10,000 of air." "2nd, That the space and ventilation should be such as to receive a supply of 100 times the air vitiated; for if it be less than this, the air becomes foul, and if more, there are unwholsome draughts of air, and the temperature is lowered too much." As regards slaughter-houses, I may remark that it would tend very much to improve the health of the Metropolis, if public slaughter-houses were erected beyond the bounds of the Metropolis, where a proper inspection of the animals could easily be made, and all meat found to be unfit for human food, condemned and destroyed. Mr. Watson, the City Chamberlain of Glasgow, informs me "that no private slaughter-houses are allowed in that city. All the cattle intended for slaughter must go to the three public establishments." Unless an alteration be made in the Building Act of 1844, relating to noxious trades, it will not be lawful, after the year 1877, to slaughter cattle in the Metropolis, at a less distance than 40 feet from a public way, or than 50 feet from a domestic building. The enforcement of this regulation will virtually prohibit the slaughtering of cattle in London. SANITARY WORK PERFORMED DURING THE QUARTER. The folio-wing return shows the amount of work done by the Sanitary Inspectors during the Quarter:— Number of inspections of houses, as shown in the official returns 6,449 Houses systematically visited and rooms measured to ascertain their cubic capacity 142 Number of rooms found to be overcrowded, the space being less than 300 cubic feet for each person, reckoning two children for one adult 2 Number of cases of indecent occupation discovered 11 Preliminary notices served, many of such notices embracing several premises 333 Compulsory orders issued, embracing 117 houses and premises 49 Summonses heard at police courts 5 Houses in which the rooms or passages have been white-wished 91 Dust-bins provided 14 Piivies repaired 20 Privies white-washed and cleansed 38 Water-butts or cisterns provided or repaired 44 Drains in houses improved, &c. 90 Cesspools abolished 9 Houses systematically re-visited 50 Cellars used as dwellings discontinued for such use 8 Yards of houses paved or the pavement repaired 73 Number of special notices served for legistration of 8 houses 8 Slaughter-houses specially visited 39 Cow-houses ditto 23 Bake-houses ditto 83 Copies of Workshop Regulation Act distributed 70 9 Nuisances caused by the accumulations of dung and other offensive matter, and from stopped privies, are very numerous. These are not recorded in the Looks of the Inspectors, unless official notices are served. In addition to this return, the Inspectors report that they have forwarded to the police authorities several notices of dangerous structures, and have also given intimation to them of all the rooms which they have found, on a house-to-house visitation, or on private information, to be occupied by more than one family. The Act requires that all rooms, so let, must be registered under the Common Lodging House Act. On comparing the above return with that of the previous Quarters, it will be seen that the sanitary work performed is, as might have been expected, considerably less. This is accounted for by the staff of Inspectors having been reduced from four to two. So far as the duties of the two Inspectors have been performed, I have much pleasure in stating that I am perfectly satisfied with the zeal and ability displayed by them. ABTIZANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS ACT, 31 & 32 Vict. c. 130. Since the date of my last Report, the above-mentioned important Act has come into operation, which, if judiciously carried out by the several Local Boards, may lead to great improvements being effected in the dwellings of the poorer classes. The 5th clause of this Act renders it compulsory on the Medical Officer of Health to report, in writing, to the local authority, any premises, within his District, that are in a condition or state dangerous to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation; and, upon that report, the local authority shall refer the question to a surveyor or engineer, who shall consider the report furnished to him, and report his opinion thereon to the local authority. Upon the receipt of the surveyor's* or engineer's report, the local authority shall cause copies of both the reports to be given to the owner of the premises complained of, with notice of the time and place, appointed by the local authority, for the consideration thereof, &o. In order that the Medical Officer of Health shall not neglect his duty in making reports upon the unhealthy condition of places within his District, it is provided by the 12th clause of this Act, that whenever any four householders, living in or near to any street by writing under their hands represent to the Officer of Health that in or near that street any premises are in a condition or state dangerous to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation, he shall forthwith inspect the premises, and report thereon; but the absence of such representation shall not excuse him from inspecting any premises and reporting thereon. The consideration of the provisions of this Act, in relation to the pulling down of unhealthy dwellings, ought to compel serious attention to the necessity of preventing, by legislative enactment, the erection of dwellings, which shall not contain, in every respect, the requisites essential to the health of the tenants who may occupy them. As a new Building Act may probably be passed in the ensuing session of Parliament, it is of importance that the sanitary provisions thereof should be well considered; for it is manifestly absurd to pull down unhealthy houses in one locality, and permit houses equally defective in their sanitary arrangements, to be erected elsewhere, • In the Ttli clause the words are surveyor and engineer. 10 The sanitary provisions of the Metropolitan Buildings' and Management Bill, have been frequently commented upon in my Reports to the Board. My last Report upon this subject was addressed to the Committee of Works, and dated February 26th, 1868, which I have here transcribed. "At the last meeting of the Committee of "Works, it was suggested that I should, at the next meeting, lay before them, in writing, a few observations upon the sanitary provision contained in the ' Metropolitan Buildings' and Management Bill,' recently brought into the House of Commons by Mb. Tite and Colonel Hogg, and promoted by the Metropolitan Board of Works. I may remark, in the first place, that the Bill applies only to the Metropolis, and that the several Building Acts now in force are proposed to be wholly repealed, their provisions being re-enacted, so far as necessary and proper, in the Bill. The clauses which relate to public health are arranged under the headings— 1, Ventilation and light. 2, Storing of inflammable articles. 3, Dangerous and noxious businesses. 4, Formation of streets, 5, Buildings in streets. Under the first heading are three clauses, viz.: the 99th, 100th, and 101st. The 99th clause proposes, that every inhabited room shall be at least 7 feet in height.) In my opinion, the height of every inhabited room should be 8 feet. This clause is defective, inasmuch as it makes no provision for the ventilation of the room, either by insisting that there should be a window opening into an open space, and that such window should be so constructed that it might be opened at the top. This clause is further defective in not making provision for placing an open fire-place in every inhabited room. The 100th clause has, unfortunately, been altered from the corresponding clause in the Draft Bill, by the insertion of certain words, which give the appearance of sanctioning the building of houses back to back, and is, consequently, defective ; for health cannot be secured in any house in which there is not a thorough ventilation. Under this clause, it should be enacted that no addition be made to any house which will tend to diminish the minimum space allowed for ventilation and light. Examples having occurred in the Whitechapel District how the provisions of the existing Building Acts have been evaded, by the piecemeal re-construction of houses, provision does not appear to have been made to prevent the recurrence of similar proceedings; neither does it make suitable provision to prevent the alteration of warehouses, stables, or sheds, into houses for habitation, uncontrolled by the Board. And lastly, no provision is made for placing within the curtilage of each dwelling-house, a proper water-closet or privy, and ash-pit, whereby the nuisances now existing in several courts, from public privies and ash-pits; may not be perpetuated. 11 The second heading, viz.: the storing of inflammable articles, contains two clauses, viz.: the 183rd and 184th. In my opinion, the keeping of petroleum and other inflammable articles in any building in London, except in small quantities for the purpose of retail trade, should be entirely prohibited. The third heading: dangerous and noxious businesses. The clauses under this heading are 13, viz.: from the 185th to the 197th, inclusive. Instead of sanctioning the carrying on of dangerous and noxious businesses in the Metropolis, it would be more advantageous to the public health and safety, if the carrying on of such businesses were entirely prohibited; for, owing to the great and increasing facilities of transit now provided in the Metropolis, from all parts of the country, the necessity of establishing such businesses in London has ceased. If, however, it should be deemed advisable to still sanction the carrying on of noxious businesses in London, clauses should be added, so as to bring under the provisions of the ' Nuisances Eemoval Acts ' all businesses from which the fumes of mineral acids escape into the surrounding neighbourhood. The fourth heading: formation of streets. This heading contains 10 clauses, from the 217th to the 226th, inclusive. Some of the provisions contained in these clauses are useful, but their value is nullified by the introduction of the following words, 'except with the approval of the Board.' Moreover, there is no clause limiting the height of buildings in proportion to the width of the streets; and there is no prohibition upon an owner converting an old court, in which sheds, stables, or small workshops exist, into a court with houses on each side and of unlimited height. Tho fifth heading: buildings in streets. Under this heading, there are 8 clauses, from the 227th to the 231th inclusive. The only observation I shall make upon these clauses is the great inconvenience to the public, which is occasioned by allowing buddings to be erected before the streets are properly drained, and the inhabitation of houses before the roads and foot-ways are properly paved. Much of tho present danger to public health, arising from the erection of unhealthy houses, might be prevented, if it were to be rendered imperative upon every builder, before he commenced any new building or enlarged an old one, to give notice to the Local Board, and to lay before it, not only a plan of the drainage of such building, but a plan of its sanitary arrangements ; and if such plans were not satisfactory to the Local Board, then the Board should have the power to prevent the erection of any building in which the sanitary arrangements were not approved of, the party aggrieved having the power of appeal. All the plans and notices received by the Board should be properly indexed, and preserved in the Office of the Board. The question of the utility of the office of District Surveyor, and the payment of him by fees, is well worthy of the consideration of the Board." I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LIDDLE. 15, Great AlIE STREET. APPENDIX.

REPORT ON THE Sanitary condition OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 26TH DECEMBER, 1868, BY JOHN LIDDLE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Presented to the Board 18th Jan., 18G9. London: Printed by T. Penny, 121, Leman Steeet, Whiteciiapel, E. 1869. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR the Quarter ending 26th December, 1868. To toe Board of "Works, "Whitechapel District. Gentlemen, la the Quarter that ended on Saturday, December, 1868, the births registered in the Whitechapel District were 639, viz., 309 males and 330 females. During the same period, the deaths have been 629. Of these 350 have been of males and 279 of females. In the corresponding Quarter of the previous year, the births were 643 and the deaths 599. There has been therefore a diminution in the number of births by 4, and an increase of 30 in the number of deaths. The deaths in the London Hospital have been 132, viz., 95 males and 37 females. Of the total deaths in this institution there were 13 of persons resident within the district, 81 of non-residents, and 38 of persons who died from the result of accident and from sudden death. The previous residences of these 38 persons are not at all recorded. The total mortality of this District is increased by the deaths of residents within the District which have occurred in other hospitals in the Metropolis; but of these I have no record. There were six deaths from epidemic diseases in the London Hospital, viz., 4 from fever, 1 from measles, and 1 diphtheria. The deaths in the "Workhouse have been 108, viz., 61 males and 47 females. The deaths from epidemic diseases in this establishment were 12, viz., 7 from fever, 3 from measles and 2 from scarlet fever. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the entire District have been 84, viz., 1 from small-pox, 13 from measles, 19 from scarlet fever, 3 from diphtheria, 6 from hooping cough, 8 from diarrhcea, and 34 from fever. In London during this quarter there were recorded 8 deaths from cholera and choleraic diarrhoea. Diseases of the tubercular class have been fatal to 104 persons, viz., 1 from scrofula, 28 from tabes mesenterica, 69 from consumption, 5 from hydrocephalus, and 1 from tubercular meningitis. The proportion of deaths from this class of diseases to the total deaths is 16'5 per cent. The proportion of deaths from epidemic diseases to the total deaths is 13 3 per cent. The deaths from diseases of the heart were 35, and from aneurism 3. 4 The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs were 115, viz., 58 from bronchitis, 46 from pneumonia, and 11 from other diseases of the lungs. The deaths caused by child-birth were 4, 2 of which was caused by puerperal fever. The diseases of the urinary organs have been 12; of these, 6 were caused by nephria, or Bright's disease. Convulsions caused the deaths of 26 children, and the deaths of 12 children are thus recorded—atrophy and debility. There were two deaths from stricture of the oesophagus. A man, aged 70, died from gangrene, caused by voluntary starvation. There were 5 deaths from the effects of the excessive use of alcoholic drinks, one of these was that of a domestic servant aged 19 years. There were 6 deaths from syphilis; of these, 4 were of infants. The deaths from violence, including those from accidents, negligence, and from suicide, have been 74; of these 6 were of children who were suffocated in bed, 8 of persons who were scalded or burnt, 1 from drowning, five persons committed suicide, and one man was stabbed in a quarrel with another man—manslaughter. The number of inquests has been 87. In the corresponding quarter of last year the number was 74. The uncertified deaths were 7. All uncertified deaths should be' investigated by a medical practitioner, and when, in his opinion it was necessary for an inquest to be held, the coroner should be required to hold one. The deaths of children under 5 years of age have been 201. This is 31.9 per cent, of the total deaths. The deaths of persons above 80 years of age have been 15; 4 of whom had reached the advanced age of 88. But on the other hand 12 persons died from premature decay under the age of 70, 3 of whom had not reached their 60th year. These numerous cases of premature decay are entirely amongst the poor, and are significant of their unhealthy condition. PAUPER ILLNESS IN THE DISTRICT. The Medical Officers have attended 3891 new cases of illness out of the "Workhouse, including 6 of small-pox, 41 of measles, 25 of scarlet fever, 25 of hooping-cough, 145 of diarrhoea, 149 of fever, and 28 of erysipelas. In the corresponding quarter of last year the number of cases of pauper illness was 4257, including 26 of small-pox, 56 of meales, 22 of scarlet fever, 29 of hooping-cough, 181 of diarrhoea, 130 of fever, and 19 of erysipelas. METEOROLOGY OF GREENWICH. The returns of the Registrar General show that the rain-fall in the Metropolis during the quarter, has been 8.61 inches. During the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the rain-fall was 4.52 inches. The mean temperature of the air has been 45.9°. In the corresponding quarter of last year, the mean temperature of the air was 43.2°. The following Table taken from the returns of the Registrar General, shows the comparative results during the quarter:— 5 LONDON.

During the preceding week, the mean temperature of the air had fallen from 51.8° to 49.7°. TRADES' NUISANCES. The nuisance arising from the Refinery premises of Sir Anthony Rothschild is still as had as it has ever been. No further attempts to mitigate this health destroying nuisance appear to have been made. On the 24th November there was escaping from the roof of the building by the side of Peter's Court, a place densely inhabited by poor people, an irritating vapor iu considerable volume, which was of so suffocating a nature, that the persons living opposite said that it was then, and at other times, so bad that they could scarcely breathe. The Inspector and myself have frequently experienced similar effects while we were in the vicinity of these Works. COW-HOUSES. In consequence of the Cow-keepers not having carried out the instructions of the Board as regards the regulations to be observed in conducting their businesses, it was resolved that, in every case in which such instructions had not been observed, the application for a renewal of the license for keeping cows should be opposed. The cow-keepers however, memorialized the Board on the subject, and it was resolved that a Committee should bo appointed to confer with them respecting the regulations to be made in reference to Cow-houses. At the meeting held in pursuance of this resolution the regulations which had been adopted by the Board were read and discussed by the Committee and the Deputation of Cow-keepers; when the following regulations were agreed and approved by the Deputation. REGULATIONS FOR COW-HOUSES. 1.—Every cow-house shall be paved with flag paving or other noil-absorbent material, set and bedded in cement, with a proper inclination to the foot of the stalls, so as to drain into a channel leading by a fall of not less than 1½ inches in 10 feet to a trapped gulley. 6 2.— Every cow-house shall be provided with a proper trapped drain to convey fluid matter alone into the sewer. 3,— Every cow-house shall be furnished with an adequate supply of water, and bo washed thoroughly at least once a day. 4.— All solid manure and refuse shall be carefully swept up and removed from out of the cow-house twice a day, and the dung shall be removed from the premises of the cow-keeper and carted away at least three times every week 5,— Every cow-house shall be kept in proper condition, and the walls be limewashed at least four times a year. 6.— Every cow-house shall have a sufficient space for each cow, and shall be properly lighted and ventilated. 7,— Every yard, in which a cow-house is situated, shall be well paved with stone or other impervious material, shall be properly drained, and shall be swept, washed, or otherwise properly cleansed daily. As regards the regulation No. 6, the term sufficient space should he considered at a subsequent meeting, when it was agreed that a veterinary surgeon of eminence should he appointed to examine the cow-houses, and whose decision on the number of cows which each cow-house should he allowed to contain should he taken and be conclusive, as between the Board and the cow-keepers. It was agreed by the Committee and the Deputation that Professor Simonds, of the Royal Veterinary College, be appointed as the authority on the number of animals which, in his judgment, should be allowed to be kept in each cow-house. At a further meeting of the Committee and the Deputation, an unopened envelope, with an enclosure from Professor Simonds, was laid before the Chairman, and it was explained, for the satisfaction of the gentletnen of the Committee and the Deputation, that it had been determined such communication should not be opened until the present meeting. The Chairman then opened the envelope; and the Report, which was enclosed, was read. [A copy of which is appended to this Report.] After the reading of the Report it was uuanimously agreed by the several cow-keepers present, that the requirements should be complied with; and they severally undertook to carry out the suggestions and make the several alterations proposed within all reasonable dispatch, and to abide by the directions of the Report as to the number of cows to be kept. It was then resolved that the opposition of the Board to the renewal of the licences be withdrawn upon the conditions agreed to by the cow-keepers. SANITARY WORK PERFORMED DURING THE QUARTER. The following return shows the amount of work done by the Sanitary Inspectors during the Quarter:— Number of inspections of houses, as shown in the official returns.. 5,163 Houses systematically visited and rooms measured to ascertain their cubic capacity 143 Number of cases of indecent occupation discovered 7 Preliminary notices served, many of such notices embracing several premises 298 Compulsory orders issued, embracing 105 houses and premises 40 Summonses heard at police courts 9 7 Houses in which the rooms or passages have been whitewashed.. 199 Dust-bins provided 34 Privies limewhited, cleansed and repaired 86 Water-butts or cisterns provided or repaired 59 Drains in houses improved, &c 84 Cesspools abolished 7 Houses systematically re-visited 41 Cellars used as dwellings discontinued for such use 7 Yards of houses paved or the pavement repaired 80 Number of special notices served for registration of 30 houses 30 Slaughter-houses specially visited 38 Cow-houses ditto 24 Copies of Workshop Regulation Act distributed 70 Animals kept so as to be a nuisance, removed 8 Area gratings, cellar flaps, &c., repaired 10 Cases of the prolonged retention of the dead 1 Nuisances caused by the accumulations of dang and other offensive matter, and from stopped privies, are very numerous. These are not recorded in the books of the Inspectors, unless official notices are served. In addition to this return, the Inspectors report that they have forwarded to the police authorities several notices of dangerous structures, and have also given intimation to them of all the rooms which they have found, on a houseto-house visitation, or on private information, to be occupied by more than one family. The Act requires that all rooms so let, must bo registered under the Common Lodging House Act. The body of a man who died in the London Hospital, was brought to No. 5, Half Moon Passage, and kept in the attic room for 10 days, where the wife and four children lived and slept. On the 24th December a parcel of geese was seized from a shop in the Whitechapel Road and taken to Worship Street Police Court, and was condemned by the Magistrate, as being unfit for human food. It was taken to the knacker's yard where it was destroyed. ARTIZANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS ACT. 31 & 32 Vict., c. 130. On the 5th November last, I addressed a letter, in compliance with the provisions of the above named Act, to the Clerk of the Board of Works, bringing under his notice that certain premises, viz., five houses in Jacob's Court, Castle Alloy, were unfit for human habitation by reason of the defective state of the surface drainage, the insufficient ventilation, and absence of light in the staircases, close and offensive smell in the houses, their dilapidated condition, and from the frequent occurrence of fever in them. This letter, containing a report of the unhealthy condition of these houses, was laid before the Board, and was referred by them to the Surveyor for him to report his opinion to the Board on the subject of my report. On the 19th November, the Surveyor reported to the following effect: that the houses were dilapidated; that the most economical mode of proceeding would be to pull them down and rebuild them; and he recommended that course be 8 adopted, but he added that it might he possible in some degree to remedy the matters complained of. At an interview between the Surveyor and the owner of the houses in Jacob's Court, it was agreed that the repairs and alterations as set forth in writing by the Surveyor should be complied with. DISEASES PREVENTION ACT, 29 Vict., c. XXXV. An Act for the better Prevention of Contagious Diseases at certain Naval and Military Stations has been in operation since October, 1866, and from the reports of the Medical Inspectors at the several stations where such Act has been in force, it appears that the health of the men forming our Navy and Army has been greatly improved. It is therefore a subject well worthy of consideration how far it is possible so to modify the Act as to make it applicable to London and all large cities and towns in the United Kingdom. As there were no less than 442 deaths in London from syphilis, and 1662 deaths from the same disease in England in the year 1866, indicating probably upwards of 44,000 cases in London, and 166,200 in the country generally, and which disease produces the most direful effects upon the population, and may be transmitted from generation to generation, the question of its prevention or even of the mitigation of its severity is a subject deserving the attention of the public, and especially of those persons who are engaged in the prevention and cure of disease. I however, content myself at present with simply drawing attention to this important Act of Parliament, so that the question may be well considered before the legislature is asked to pass an Act with similar provisions to that now in force in certain places which shall be applicable to this Metropolis. This Act is now in force in Portsmouth, Plymouth and Davenport, Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, Aldershot, Windsor, Colchester, Shorncliffe, The Curragh, Cork and Queenstown, but it does not extend to Scotland. ANNUAL REPORT. The number of deaths registered in this District, during the year 1868, has been 2519, and the number of births 2611. The deaths in 1867 were 2331 and the births 2686. The deaths therefore are in excess of those in 1867 by 188 and the births are less by 75. The return of births and deaths for this year are not very satisfactory. The deaths in the Workhouse have been 376 against 331 for the previous year, and the deaths in the London Hospital 536 against 445. In consequence of the pulling down for public improvements within the last two years of about 195 houses,* and the erection of only 9 new ones, it * The following are the places in which houses have, within the last two years, been taken down : Back Church Lane 7, Church Lane 29, Crown Court Eoad Side 14, Colchester Street 25, Great Garden Street 3, High Street 8, Leman Street 2, Plough Street 10, Buckle Street 3, Barley Mow Court 8, Swan Court 10, Sheppy Yard 2, Queen Ann Street 32, John Street 32, Buck's Eow 3, Little Alie Street 7. Houses rebuilt during the same period: Inkhorn Court 1, Glasshouse Street 5, Sugar Loaf Court 1, Chamber Street 2. 9 may reasonably be inferred that the population of this District has diminished. If the population of this District be estimated at 76,000, which is nearly 3000 less than when the census was taken in 1861, the rate of mortality has been during this year 31.6 per 1000, or 1 in 31.3 of all living. In making a comparison however, of the rate of mortality of this District with that of others, the deaths in the London Hospital must be eliminated, which this year amount to 506. Deducting therefore, the deaths in this institution from the total deaths, the rate of mortality is 26 per 1000 or 1 in 39 of all living. PAUPER ILLNESS IN THE DISTRICT. The number of out door sick paupers who have been attended by the Medical Officers of the TJnion has been 17417. This is an increase of 236 on last year's return. Although it appears from Table VI. that the sick paupers are still annually on the increase, yet, I have the satisfaction to remark, that during the last quarter the number has diminished from 4357 to 3891, as is shown in Table I. The large number of sick paupers need not surprise us when the condition of the houses in some of the poor localities is considered; for not only are many of the houses without sufficient ventilation, owing to the want of open spaces at the rear, but the rooms are overcrowded. The result of this state of things is, first ill health and then pauperism. The prevention of disease and its consequence—pauperism— has not received the attention which its importance demands. It is in the unhealthy localities of largo towns that pauperism usually begins and is continued. This may, to a certain extent, be accounted for by the fact that the majority of the inhabitants of the dirty and overcrowded places are both physically and mentally unable to work at such employment as will secure to them the means of honestly supporting themselves and families. Any occupation which does not require much physical exertion is preferred, and hence many of this class take to begging and thieving for a livelihood. Consumption and other forms of mesenteric disease are in these badly ventilated places of frequent occurrence, both among the children and the adults. All such persons must be supported by the poor rate, for they are unable to support themselves. It is therefore to the unhealthy dwellings of the poor that public attention must be directed, and in my opinion, nothing short of the pulling down of the numerous houses situated in the close localities in London, and preventing the persons now occupying these houses from overcrowding other localities, will, in any appreciable degree, diminish sickness, pauperism, and the large criminal class, who congregate in these densely populated places. Immense sums of money have been spent in public improvements by the formation of railways and the making of thoroughfares, but very little has been done by the Government or local authorities to improve the physical condition of the poor by taking clown all houses that have not sufficient light and ventilation. The vacant ground might be sold to parties who would erect more suitable 10 houses on the site, or if parties were not willing to build houses for the poor, the ground should be allowed to increase the width of the public way. The poor are for the most part crowded together in the bye places of large cities and towns, cut off from all association with persons in a superior position of life, and whose abodes are visited only by the parish medical officers, the relieving officers, the sanitary inspectors, and the police. It is very easy but futile to say that the poor, as a class, are so dirty and demoralized that it is in vain to attempt to teach them habits of cleanliness and to give them clean and comfortable homes, and so make this an excuse for doing nothing either to instruct them or to improve their habitations. The fact is that our efforts in these directions have been upon a very small scale, and the result corresponds with our efforts. Much might be done to improve the physical condition of the poor by a frequent inspection of their rooms by a sufficient staff of sanitary inspectors appointed by the local Boards. Every house which is let out in weekly tenements, or which is below a certain weekly rent, should be registered under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, so that the landlord might be held responsible for the cleanliness of the staircases, passages, and domestic conveniences, which are common to all the tenants. I have known women of cleanly habits complain of the indifference of their fellow lodgers to cleanliness, and saying that it was in vain for them to keep places clean ; for no sooner had such places been cleaned, than they were again dirtied. The effect of this labour in vain must be to demoralize persons so circumstanced, and reduce them to the squalid condition of their immediate neighbours. Again, the depressing atmosphere of these crowdcd localities engenders the craving for intoxicating drinks, which, when used, produce only a temporary excitement; and, unfortunately, intoxicating drinks can be readily obtained through the facilities which are afforded by the numerous shops close at hand where such drinks are sold. The efforts of local Boards might be greatly assisted by voluntary associations employing judicious persons in visiting every room which is occupied by the poor in a given district, and in kindly giving advice and instruction to the heads of families as regards cleanliness, education of children, and other matters important to their well-being, and, where necessary, aiding them in carrying into effect their lessons of instruction. This kind of frequent and friendly intercourse with the poor will inspire confidence and respect, and will certainly be attended with beneficial results. The deaths in this District during the year which were caused by tubercular diseases, including consumption, have been 458, which is at the rate of 18 per cent, of the total mortality. Many of these deaths might be prevented by improving the ventilation of the crowded localities. As Billingsgate Market must either soon be enlarged or removed to another site, it would be very desirable that, while benefitting the public by affording them greater facilities in obtaining a supply of fish, an endeavour should be made to improve the health of the whole population of London. This might be done by fixing upon a site which, while in every respect most 11 convenient for such purpose, is at present occupied by ill-ventilated houses, densely packed together, and crowded with poor people, where contagious diseases are of frequent occurrence. As these diseases extend their ravages over a large area, the whole Metropolis would be benefitted by the removal of such fever nests, for it is well known that contagious diseases are not confined to the localities where they originate. A place in every respect suited for a fish market, is that portion of the District situated between Royal Mint Street and St. Katherine Docks, which is now occupied by a dense, poor, and unhealthy population, and where the property, from its bad condition, might be bought at a cheap rate.

The great annual increase, as is shown in the above returns, cannot be explained on the supposition that there has been an increase of the population, for the census returns show that the population of this District, so far from having increased, is less by two or three thousand than it was in 1857.

REPORT OF PROFESSOR SIMONDS, ON THE Com houses, WITHIN THE WHITE CHAPEL DISTRICT, PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD. LONDON. 1 8 6 8: E, J. BATH, Printer, 26, High Street, Whitecliapel. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS, OF THE Whitechapel District. Gentlemen, — I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your instructions, I have inspected the several Cow-sheds in the Whitechapel District, for the purpose of determining the number of Cows which should be kept in each Shed respectively. The conclusions which I have arrived at are based on the impression that the Board is willing to grant licenses for as many Cows to be kept in each Shed, as is consistent with its size, form, and location, due regard being had to its proper drainage, ventilation, and cleanliness. In dealing with this matter, I have borne in mind that sanitary principles require that comparatively a large cubical space should be allotted to each individual animal, and, therefore, I have acted on the information given by the Inspectors as to the dimensions of the Sheds. In one or two instances re-measurements have been made, where such seemed to be required; and in all cases in which an application for a license for a Shed, hitherto unoccupied by Cows, was about to be made, I have ascertained the capacity of the building. 4 It will be seen that in by far the larger number of Sheds the ventilation is defective; and I would suggest that the improvements which are needed be made prior to the licenses being granted. These improvements would be best carried out under the supervision of the Inspectors, as they are in possession of the plan which was proposed for adoption in each case. Taking the Sheds in the order of my inspection of them, I have to suggest that in No. 1, Occupied by Mr. W. G. Le Beau, Royal Mint Street, A license be granted for seven Cows. This place is fitted up for nine Cows, but it has a direct communication with the dwelling-house. It is cleanly kept, and is not crowded upon by surrounding buildings. The roof is somewhat imperfect, but this allows a free passage of air, and hence additional ventilation is not required. No. 2. Shed, occupied by Mr. G. Jones, Royal Mint Street. This Shed is a double one, having a space of five feet between each row of Cows. It is now too much crowded, and requires better ventilation. It is covered with a spanroof which will allow of the ventilation being effected by raised ridge-tiles. The walls are very low, which brings the spring of the roof very close to the heads of the Cows, and for this reason additional openings should be made through the walls, by the insertion of air-bricks here and there. It should not be licensed for more than fourteen Cows. 5 No. 3. Shed, belonging to Mr. R. Roberts. This Shed is in the same Yard as No. 2, and if licensed, will also be occupied by Mr. Jones. The ventilation should be improved by carrying a shaft fifteen inches square through the roof. It may be licensed for six Cows. No. 4. Two Sheds, communicating with each other at a right angle, in the occupation of Mr. J. Moore, Darby Street. These Sheds are not good ones. They will have to be ventilated by four shafts, at least, through the roof. The dung-pit, which is built against the side of Shed No. 2, should be removed to an opposite corner of the Yard. No. 1 Shed may be licensed for five Cows, and No. 2 for three. No. 5. Shed, belonging to Mr. Green, Shorter's Rents. This place is not occupied at present with Cows. It requires to be properly drained, cleansed, and fitted. It may be licensed for two Cows. No. 6. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. G. Ayres, Gower's Walk. The place is cleanly kept, but the ventilation requires some improvement. A license may be granted for ten Cows. No. 7. Five Sheds, in the occupation of Mr. I. Sole, Weavers' Arms Yard. Shed a is situated on right hand side of the Yard. It has a lean-to roof and loft, and is occupied by eighteen Cows and a Bull. It may be licensed for seventeen animals. Although a roomy Shed, its ventilation should be improved by openings in the roof. 6 Shed b. This Shed is opposite to the entrance into the Yard. It has an open frontage, and communicates at a right angle with Shed a. It is fitted up for eight Cows, for which number it may be licensed. Shed c is situated on the left hand side of the Yard. Fourteen Cows stand here, and it may be again licensed for this number. A fourth Shed, d, near the entrance-gate, is, at present, not licensed. It has standing-room for two Cows. The roof is a lean-to one, but of sufficient height. A license may be granted for two. Separated by a narrow passage from these Sheds is a fifth Shed, which has been hitherto licensed for four Cows, but I am informed an objection has been taken against a renewal of the license. The Shed abuts upon the wall of a dwelling-house, the windows of which open a little above its roof. To remove the objection which may arise from this cause, I would suggest that two square ventilators, fifteen inches in diameter, should be constructed so as to open into a horizontal ventilator of the same size, running along the roof from end to end, and having openings only at the extremities. The roof-tiles should also be pointed about half the distance downwards, from the wall of the house. If these improvements are effected, the Shed may be licensed for the same number of Cows as before. No. 8. Shed, belonging to Mr. Crunden, Plough Square. This place is at present without a license, but the owner is anxious to obtain one, should the Board see fit to grant it. The Shed requires improvement and perfect drainage. It also requires good ventilation, which, as it is covered by a loft, can only be obtained by carrying a shaft through the floor and roof. The shaft ought to be placed next the wall, and in the central part of the Shed, so as to be near to the 7 heads of the Cows. It should not be of less dimensions than five feet by two feet, and should be constructed with a dividing board, or diaphragm, in the middle. If these improvements are adopted, the Shed may be licensed for five Cows. No. 9. Shed, occupied by Mr. Barker, Wentworth Street. The pavement of this Shed requires repair. The walls should also be lime-whited. It has standing-room for five Cows, and may be licensed for this number. This Shed is placed in a roomy Yard, and the dung-pit is at a distance from it, but it is not so cleanly kept as it ought to be. No. 10. Three Sheds, in the occupation of Mr. R. James, Bell Lane. Two of these Sheds, a and b, are licensed. A license is sought for Shed c. Shed a requires better ventilation, which will be best effected by placing a ventilating shaft at the further end, near to the wall of the dwelling which adjoins the Shed, and by putting some raised ridge-tiles on the roof. It is a long Shed, and is now occupied by seven Cows. A license may be granted for ten. Shed b joins Shed a, and is so constructed that the Cows stand at right angles with the others. It has standingroom for five Cows, but should not be licensed for more than four. 8 Shed c is situated on the opposite side of a wide passageway or Yard. It is now used chiefly for hay, and is divided into compartments by ordinary wood partitions. These partitions will have to be removed and the Shed properly fitted for Cows. The hay also will have to be kept in the loft over Sheds a and b. When altered a license may be granted for five Cows. No. 11. Two Sheds, occupied by Mr. Barker, Saw Yard. Shed a is not kept so clean as it ought to be. Better ventilation also is required. The Shed is occupied by four Cows, but it may be licensed for six. The ventilating shaft should be placed at the further end of the Shed. Shed b is used for the standing of two Cows, and also for the sale of milk. It has wide doors in front, and is covered by a loft, the floor of which is too close upon the Cows. The use of the place as a milk-shop necessitates the doors being kept open; but for which an opening would have to be made through the loft and roof to secure proper ventilation. The license may be granted for two Cows. No. 12. Three Sheds, in the occupation of Mr. C. Lee, Goulston Street. Shed a is a double Shed. Shed b and c single Sheds. They are cleanly kept and airy, and are licensed for twenty Cows. This number may be allowed in the new license. 9 No. 13. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. T. Williams, White's Row. The situation of this Shed, with regard to surroundingbuildings, is objectionable. The place altogether is too close and confined. Independent of these things, the Shed itself requires a general repair, effectual ventilation, and proper drainage. A ventilating shaft of full three feet diameter, and furnished with a diaphragm, should be carried through the roof, above the adjoining premises. It should be placed in the corner of the Shed, close to a large dung-pit, which is used for some adjacent stables. The removal of the dung from this pit will have to be closely looked to by the Inspector, and disinfectants used from time to time. The Shed is licensed for five Cows, but only two are now kept on the premises ; the rule being to keep five during the summer months. If the Shed is properly cleansed, ventilated, and paved, a license may be granted for five Cows. No. 14. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. Dewey, Crispin Street. This Shed requires much better ventilation. A shaft should be placed in the central part of the Shed. It should not be less than two feet six inches in diameter, and should have a diaphragm running through the middle. The license may be granted for nine Cows. No. 15. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. May, White Lion Street. This Shed communicates with the dwelling-house, and seems not to be kept so cleanly as it ought to be. It also requires better ventilation, which can be effected by fixing a shaft at the further corner of the Shed, under the loft. The license may be granted for eight Cows. 10 No. 16. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. Webb, Grey Eagle Street. Eight Cows used to be kept in this Shed. It is now licensed for five. The ventilation requires to be improved, which can 'be done by some raised ridge-tiles on the roof, and by making openings at the top of each gable. A removal of a few boards, will easily effect this. The license may be granted for six Cows. No. 17. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. Neill, Brown's Lane. This Shed communicates with the dwelling-house, and is a close and confined place. A trap-door has recently been fixed in the roof, which, when open, gives a freer current to the air. A second trap-door also exists, in the place of which a ventilating shaft, furnished with a diaphragm, should be substituted. A license may be granted for two Cows. No. 18. Shed, in the occupation of Mrs. Williams, Brown's Lane. This Shed is a very irregularly shaped one, and for practical purposes, may be viewed as having standing-places for two rows of Cows. The greater part of the Shed is covered by a loft, and some of the Cows occupy stalls which are placed under the floor of a sleeping-room, near to the entrance into the Shed. A ventilating shaft should be carried through the roof, just behind these Cows, and additional ventilation to the whole building should be obtained by the use of raised ridge-tiles to the roof, from end to end. Nineteen Cows used to be kept. It may now be licensed for sixteen. 11 No. 19. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. James, Spital Street. This Shed is covered with a low span-roof, the wall plates being on a level with the heads of the Cows. The place is cleanly kept, and although low and narrow, it has a great length. The windows open into a Yard behind the Cows, but these are easily closed at any time. To effect permanent ventilation, four ventilating shafts should be fixed at equal distances, along the ridge of the roof. It may be licensed for twelve Cows. No. 20. Two Sheds, in the occupation of Mr. E. Foster, Pelham Street. Shed a. This Shed was improved in its general arrangements, and the height added to, after the loss sustained by Cattle Plague. It is now roomy and cleanly kept. A license for fourteen Cows to be kept in it may be granted. Shed b is covered with a loft, the floor of which is too near the Cows, rendering the place close. It may, however, be licensed for six Cows, if two ventilating shafts are carried through the loft and roof, in the central part of the building. No. 21. Several Sheds, Yard, and Premises, in the occupation of Mr. M. Pool, White's Row. Accommodation exists here for keeping from thirty to forty Cows. Ten Cows and a Bull are now in stock. The license is for twenty Cows. It may be renewed. 12 No. 22. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. Watson, Old Montague Street. This Shed is now partly occupied by Horses and Goats, and a portion of the further end is partitioned off for the milk cans. Independent of this, it has standing-room for eight Cows, for which number the license may be granted. A ventilating shaft should be fixed at the opposite end of the one used for the milk cans. The dung-pit which is just outside the Shed, should be partly filled in, so that no accumulation of dung may take place. The pit also requires to be covered with a better lid. No. 23. Shed, in the occupation of Mr. Brown, Old Montague Street. The entrance-passage, which is common to the Shed and the dwelling-house, has been recently covered in, and more space obtained behind some of the Cows. One end of the Shed is fitted with a small loft for hay, the floor of which is too close to the Cows standing under it. Some of the flooring-boards, directly above the heads of the Cows, should be removed so as to obtain exit for the expired air. A ventilating shaft is also required in the middle part of the roof of the Shed. There are ten Cows in stock, but the license should hereafter be for nine. No. 24. Two Sheds, Yard, and other buildings, in the occupation of Mr. J. Davis, Black Lion Yard. Shed a is fitted up for twenty Cows, standing in a row, and has a portion partitioned off for the grain-pit, &c. Three ventilators, at equal distances, should be fixed in the roof. It may be licensed for twenty Cows. 13 Shed b joins Shed a, at a right angle, and is fitted up for eighteen Cows, standing in a double row. It is covered with a hipped roof, and should be ventilated by a shaft, carried through the central part of each hip, and a third one through the middle of the ridge. It should not be licensed for more than sixteen Cows. On the opposite side of the Yard are some buildings which are sought to be licensed. No objection exists to this being done. Shed c, or No. 3, is thirty-five feet long, fourteen broad, and ten high. Existing partitions are to be removed, and the place properly paved and drained. The ventilating shafts are also to be fixed in the roof. The license to be granted for eight Cows. Shed d is eighteen feet long, fourteen broad, and ten high. It is covered with a loft, through which, and the roof above, one large ventilating shaft is to be carried. The license to be granted for five Cows. Shed e is twenty feet long, fourteen broad, and thirteen high. It is partly covered by a loft, through which a ventilating shaft is to be carried, and continued upwards by the end of a zinc building, which projects over the roof. 14 The inspection of Mr. Davis's premises completed my duties; and, in concluding this Report, I would simply observe, that in every instance, I found the Cow-keepers most willing to answer all enquiries, and offering every facility for carrying out the suggested improvements. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient and humble Servant, JAS. B. SIMONDS. Boyal Veterinary College, Camden Town, N. W., Nov. 18th, 1868.
