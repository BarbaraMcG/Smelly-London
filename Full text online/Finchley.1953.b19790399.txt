I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1953. The birth rate has continued its downward trend from the peak which it attained in 1947, but fortunately the death rate has shown a similar tendency. The infantile mortality rate has risen from 11.5 in 1952 to 22.2 per 1,000 live births. The increase was due to 7 more deaths from congenital malformations and premature birth and 4 deaths from pneumonia. Reference to the graph on page 11 will show how the infantile mortality rate has fluctuated from year to year. This is largely due to the fact that the numbers dealt with are comparatively small. I have included certain extracts from the Registrar General's Reports on the 1951 Census and, where possible, I have given comparative figures from the Censuses of 1931 and 1921. Finchley has an older population than the County as a whole and the ratio of females to males is the highest in Middlesex. The information regarding families and housing does not need any comment except to point out that the increase in the number of dwellings occupied by two or more families in 1951 is partly due to requisitioned property and Half-Way Houses. The year was, on the whole, a good one as regards infectious diseases. The number of cases of poliomyelitis (11) was the highest since 1949 and three cases were fatal. Measles was very prevalent but whooping cough and scarlet fever were below the average and no one died from any of these diseases. Once again there was no case of diphtheria. The notifications of cases of tuberculosis have not changed much in recent years, but the number of deaths is the lowest on 3 record. This means that modern methods of treatment are becoming more effective in saving lives but it does not necessarily follow that the number of infectious persons in the population is decreasing, in fact there are some grounds for thinking that the opposite is the case. For this reason it becomes all the more necessary to take every possible precaution against the spread of the disease. The problem of caring for old people in their homes is an ever increasing one. Much is being done by various voluntary bodies but much more help is needed and it is pleasing to learn that steps are now being taken with a view to increasing and co-ordinating all forms of voluntary help for the aged. The work of the Sanitary Inspectors has been as varied and extensive as in past years. The scope of their work is covered in the sections of this Report dealing with housing, factories and work-places, food premises, food hygiene, the Shops Act, heating appliances and the destruction of pests, etc. Their contribution towards safeguarding and improving the public health in such a variety of ways cannot be overstressed. I should like, once more, to express my thanks to all members of the staff of the Health Department for their hard work throughout the year and especially to Mr. Gray, Senior Sanitary Inspector, for his loyal and efficient co-operation. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,478 Population, 1953 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,150 Number of Inhabited Houses (1953) 19,979 Rateable Value (1953) £937,446 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,852 Total Live Births 902 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 12.9 Birth Rate per 1.000 population (England and Wales) 15.5 Total Stillbirths 18 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 19.6 Total Deaths 765 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 10.9 Standardised Death Rate 9.7 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.4 Infant Deaths 20 Infant Mortality Rate 22.2 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 26.8 Neo-Natal Deaths 12 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate 13.3 Maternal Deaths 1 Maternal Mortality Rate 1.1 Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.76 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate 430 432 862 Illegitimate 28 12 40 458 444 902 Birth rate 12.9 per 1,000 estimated home population.

There is no doubt that this is due to immunisation and once again I stress the duty of all parents to ensure that their children are immunised not only in their own interests but in the interest of the whole community as it is only by having a high proportion of the child population immunised that the disease can be kept at bay. During the year 76 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 51 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. In addition, 537 children were immunised with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Four hundred and twenty-four children were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone, and 76 children were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. 18 INCIDENCE OF DIPHTHERIA SINCE 1925 Scarlet Fever There were 69 cases of Scarlet Fever, 24 fewer than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis There were 11 cases of Poliomyelitis, 4 in January and 7 in July to September. Five patients were under 15 years of age and 6 were over. The average age of all the cases was 18 years. All except one had some degree of paralysis. Two brothers suffered from the disease but otherwise no connection between the cases could be traced. There were 3 deaths—all males—aged 31, 27 and 8 years respectively. The Council have granted to the North London Branch of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship the use of the Squires Lane Bath on alternate Sundays for "old" cases of Poliomyelitis. The cases are collected from a wide area by ambulances and cars and they are assisted in changing and also in the water by voluntary helpers. All cases are certified by a doctor to be free from infection. It is evident to anyone who has attended any of these sessions that the patients derive a great deal of pleasure as well as considerable psychological and physical benefit from their visits to the bath. Measles There was an increase in the number of notifications, there being 857 compared with 577 in 1952. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough Whooping Cough was not prevalent to the same extent as in recent years. The notifications numbered 165 in 1953 and there were no deaths. 21 During the year, 600 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Seven children were given "booster" doses of Whooping Cough vaccine. Pneumonia Forty-nine cases were notified in 1953 and there were 39 deaths, 29 of which were persons of 65 years of age and over. Malaria Two cases of malaria in children were notified. They had arrived from the Gold Coast for a short holiday a fortnight previously. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 56. Fifty-five cases occurred at the North Middlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue and the remaining one, at home. Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified: Dysentery 14 Erysipelas 2 Paratyphoid B 1 Typhoid 2 Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was five hundred and sixty. Ninety persons were re-vaccinated. 22 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1953. Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs: Diphtheria Bacilli – 192 Hæmolytic Streptococci 62 Vincent's Angina 2 Fasces: Sonne Dysentery 15 111 Salmonella 8 Protozoa 1 Sputum: T.B. Smear 3 70 Other Organisms 13 Whooping Cough: Cough Plate – 14 Post-nasal Swab 9 113 387 Tuberculosis Eleven persons died from tuberculosis during 1953, giving a death rate of 0.157 per 1,000 population. This is the lowest rate ever recorded. The number of new cases of the disease, on the other hand, has remained fairly stationary in the last few years. There has been a tendency in recent years towards a lower age of incidence of the disease. Last year 8 children of school age, and one under school age, were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs—14% of the total cases at all ages. This is higher than it ever has been in my experience. There is close co-operation between the Public Health Department, the Area Health Department and the Chest Clinic in the constant search for possible sources of infection in new 23 cases of tuberculosis and in trying to stem the spread of infection whenever a source comes to light. When a case occurs in a school a thorough investigation which, in the light of experience, has now assumed a more or less stereotyped pattern is carried out on the following lines:— After consultation with the Chest Physician and the Head Teacher a letter is sent to parents by the Area Medical Officer requesting their permission to have their children patch tested and in the event of the test proving positive to have the children X-rayed. The children are tested in school with the assistance of the Chest Clinic Staff. The families of all positive children are investigated and the children themselves are X-rayed at the Chest Clinic or at the Mobile X-Ray Unit if it happens to be in the neighbourhood. Ail the school staff are also X-rayed. In each case up to now the co-operation of everyone concerned has been complete. The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1944 48 30 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 – 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 1949 41 37 2 4 10 8 1 4 1950 37 21 2 7 9 5 2 – 1951 37 30 2 6 6 10 1 2 1952 43 21 4 6 15 2 – – 1953 29 33 1 2 7 4 – – 24 TUBERCULOSIS (ALL FORMS) Medical Examinations Eighteen persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 25 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme.

These houses were demolished by the Council in connection with a Redevelopment Scheme and the tenants were re-housed. 1208, 1210 & 1212 High Road, N.20. These old cottages, one of which was partly occupied, became dangerous and were demolished by the owners without resort to legal action. Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 15,713. At 577 of the houses and other premises visited, defects 29 or nuisances to the number of 1,854 were discovered, and at the end of the year 1,769 including a number outstanding at the end of 1952 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 223 was in hand and 1,092 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 1,286 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out: Inspections under Housing Acts 20 Special Inspections 3,795 Reinspections 2,831 Inspections of Works in Progress 1,286 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 616 Visits to Slaughterhouses 1 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 25 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 138 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops 539 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 180 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 680 Visits re Rodent Control 4,843 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 125 Visits re Building Licences 1 Visits re Hawkers 37 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 15 Visits to Houses Let in Lodgings 9 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 11 Visits re Heating Appliances—Fireguards 66 Miscellaneous 495 15,713 30 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Premises redrained 7 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 59 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 183 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 430 Length in yards of iron drains laid 15 Manholes provided 76 Manholes repaired 9 Manhole covers provided 50 Intercepting traps fixed 5 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 11 New gully traps fixed 77 Gully curbs provided or repaired 20 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 18 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 14 Water tests applied 225 Smoke tests applied 9 Air tests applied 18 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

It has been found that the home conditions are quite satisfactory. The following table shows, by trades, the number of outworkers residing in the district: Wearing apparel 56 Artificial Flowers 3 Making of cardboard boxes, cards, etc. 2 Brush manufacture 1 Lampshades 1 Cake Ornaments 1 FOOD Food Poisoning Eleven cases of Food Poisoning were notified during the year. There were two minor outbreaks of 2 and 3 cases respectively, and the remainder were single cases. All except one were due to Salmonella Typhi-Murium. There is nearly always a lapse of several days in these sporadic cases between the time that the patient becomes infected and the time of receipt of a notification from the doctor and by the time that the case is investigated by this department no samples of the incriminating articles of food are available. For this reason it was not possible to discover the source of infection in any of these cases. Food Hygiene (1) The number and type of food premises in the Borough: (a) Bakers etc 31 (b) Butchers 46 (c) Confectioners 77 (d) Fishmongers 20 (e) Greengrocers 51 (f) Grocers and Provisions 122 (g) Restaurants, Cafes, etc. 93 Total 440 (2) (i) The number and type of food premises registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938: (a) Sale of Ice Cream 158 (b) Manufacture of Sausages 35 (c) Cooking of hams 4 (d) Pickling of meat 3 (e) Preparation of pickled and preserved food 5 Total 205 39 (ii) The number of dairies registered under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949: 9 (3) (i) Number of Inspections: Eight hundred and forty-four visits were made to registered and various other premises, and improvements have been carried out in a number of cases, as set out below: Accumulations of Refuse removed 1 Additional Sanitary Conveniences provided 2 Artificial Lighting provided in W.Cs. 1 Closed Shop Fronts erected 2 Drains repaired 1 Extractor Fan provided 1 New Food Storage provided 1 New Fuel Store provided 1 New washing facilities provided 5 New Washing Machines installed 1 Notices in W.Cs. re handwashing 4 Offal Bins provided 2 Premises cleansed 6 Premises redesigned and tiled 2 Refrigerators provided 2 Sinks and draining boards provided 4 Sterilizing Sink provided 1 Waterheaters provided 3 (ii) Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops: Notices for exhibition have been supplied to all food shops in the district, pointing out that the presence of dogs is a danger to the health of the public.

(4) Education Activities: Following the poor response to public meetings during the previous year, none was arranged in 1953. 40 Early in the year, consultations took place with the Chairman and Secretary of the Finchley and Barnet Master Bakers, when film strips, relating to Food Hygiene in the Baking Industry were seen and discussed. Subsequently, a lecture was arranged for the Master Bakers in the district, when 18 attended. In the Spring, lectures to classes of senior school children were arranged at five schools. Talks were given by the Sanitary Inspectors, after which films were shown and discussed. The lectures were attended by 227 children. (5) Method of Disposal of Condemned Food: Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared has received special attention. Four new registrations of hawkers were granted during the year. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked up where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. Following such an investigation, one application for registration was refused because of unsatisfactory storage accommodation, but was granted at a later date upon satisfactory storage arrangements being made.

Occasional slaughtering was carried out on permit from the Food Office. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. One person was licensed during 1953. Butchers' Shops There are 46 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. A new cold store was constructed in one shop and another was in course of construction at the end of the year. All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 26. At 24 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps 46 have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. Three bakehouses were closed during the year and one new one was opened. Arising from an investigation into the preparation of synthetic cream, improvements were made in the method of the sterilization of the savoy bags and a box-washing machine was installed at one of the bakehouses. In another bakehouse a new shop front, fittings, sinks and hot water supply were provided. Dairies, Cowsheds and Mii kshops There are 9 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1953, as follows: Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 17 „ „ „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 16 „ „ „ „ „ „ Sterilised 20 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 7 „ „ „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 8 „ „ „ „ „ „ Sterilised 8 Seven samples of Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) milk, eight samples of Pasteurised and eight samples of Sterilised were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. All these samples complied with the prescribed conditions. Food Sampling The following information has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938: 47 List of samples procured in the Borough during the year: Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk 69 – Milk, new 210 30 Milk, hot 12 7 Almonds, Ground 1 – Baking powder 1 – Cakes, various 31 – Chops 5 – Cooked meats 4 – Cream 17 – Crystallised Ginger 1 – Curry Powder 1 – Drugs 5 – Fish, various 9 – Fish Paste 2 – Fish Cake 1 – Garlic salt 1 – Gin 2 – Ham 3 – Herrings in Wine Sauce 1 – Ice Cream 2 – Jams 2 – Jelly 2 – Lemon Barley 1 – Lemon Curd 1 – Marmalade 1 – Marzipan 1 – Meat Paste 2 – Meat Pie 1 – Non-brewed Condiment 4 – Orange Squash 2 – Peas, tinned 2 – Peppermint Cordial 1 – Carried forward 398 37 48 Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Brought forward 398 37 Plums, bottled 1 1 Raspberry Syrup 1 — Sausages, various 16 — Sausage Meat 1 — Self-raising Flour 2 — Sherry 1 — Soup, tinned 1 — Suet 1 — Vinegar 10 — Whisky 14 — White Pepper 1 — TOTALS 447 38 Each of the thirty new milk samples was taken from a churn of farmer's milk delivered to one or other of two milk processing depots in the Borough. Seven farmers were involved. In each case the milk had either a slightly low fat or a slightly low solidsnot-fat content but in no case had water been added and it may be taken that the milk was genuine as from the cow but of slightly poor quality. In each case the farmer was informed of the results and advised how to take action to improve the quality of the milk and the Milk Marketing Board (the purchaser) and the consignee were also informed. The seven samples of hot milk which were unsatisfactory were each obtained from cafes. In one a restaurant proprietor sold hot milk containing 13 per cent added water and was prosecuted and allowed a conditional discharge on payment of £2-2s.-0d. costs. Two unsatisfactory samples were obtained from another restaurant, the owner being prosecuted for 11.6 per cent added water and fined £2-0s.-0d. with £1-1s.-0d. costs. Two samples came from another cafe and these had a fat deficiency and the owner was given an official caution. The remaining two samples came one from each of two other cafes—one had a fat deficiency 49 and the other contained added water. Subsequent samples in each case were genuine and no further action was taken. The unsatisfactory plums sampled were bottled plums labelled ''Victoria Plums" but were in fact Burbank plums. The firm concerned was prosecuted in respect of an offence for falsely describing the plums by label, contrary to the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943 and convicted but granted an absolute discharge. The Public Control Department also reported upon the following matters: Special Designated Milk During the year there were two dealer/processors licensed to use a special designation "pasteurised" in connection with milk processed on their premises and each also, in respect of the same premises, held a dealer/processor's licence to use the designation "sterilised" in connection with milk so treated. Thirty-nine inspections were made of the premises and 109 samples of "pasteurised" milk were procured and 92 samples of "sterilised" milk, of which none was adversely reported upon. Merchandise Marks Acts 1887-1926 Attention has been paid in particular to compliance with the Imported Food Orders made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926 and which require in respect of specified foods that when inter alia they are exposed for retail sale they must bear a clear indication of the country of origin, that is to say either the words "Empire" or "foreign" as the case may be or the specific country of production. One hundred and twenty-four premises were visited and 637 head of poultry, displays of meat, or stocks of apples, tomatoes, dried fruit, butter were examined. Apart from minor infringements dealt with on the spot in only one case— a firm of fruiterers—was a prosecution necessary, there being two summonses, one for not marking the indication of origin on a display of tomatoes, and second, for not marking an indication of origin on a display of imported apples. The firm was fined £1 on each summons and ordered to pay £4-4-0 costs. 50 Labelling of Food Order, 1953 One hundred and seventy premises were visited and 1,312 different articles of food were examined to ensure compliance with this Order. No infringement of substance was discovered. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 158 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Thirty-seven samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls One old wooden structure was demolished during 1953. At the end of the year the number of stalls in the district was two. They have been visited at intervals and action was taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. Fish Friers There were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out. Game Licences Twenty applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. In one case a statutory notice was served regarding the provision of a suitable sanitary convenience. One shop was found to be without sufficient means of heating and suitable gas heaters were provided by the occupier without resort to legal action. 51 Particulars in regard to the shops on the Register are as. follows: Number on Register at beginning of 1953 891 Number closed 11 New shops 46 Number on Register at end of 1953 926 Changes of occupancy 17 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was ten. Swimming Pools In co-operation with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor samples of the water were taken at intervals throughout the summer months. Of ten samples taken all were satisfactory. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is. supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 10 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In addition 1 sample was submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 4 houses serving a population of 10 which are served by stand pipes. Pollution of Streams and Watercourses Further investigations have been carried out regarding the pollution of streams in and adjoining the district and in connection therewith, 157 visits have been made by the Sanitary Inspectors. A number of contraventions and defects were discovered and dealt with. The nuisance usually arises from the improper fixing of soil fittings to discharge into the surface water drains instead of the soil drains. 52 Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Nuisance arising from one chimney was found upon investigation to be due to a defect in the mechanical stoking apparatus. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There is only one trader whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 There was one new registration under the above Act during 1953. making the total number of persons registered in the district 4. All the premises have been inspected. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 The above Act, which came into operation on the 23rd March, 1953, makes provision for the Home Secretary to make Regulations requiring gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters to be fitted with guards and for prescribing for such guards, standards of construction and fitting designed to reduce or prevent the risk of fire or injury resulting from accidental contact with, or proximity to, flames or heating elements. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations, 1953 have now been made and came into operation on the 1st October, 1953. They apply to all newly manufactured appliances including those manufactured abroad but a period of grace until the 1st October 1954 is allowed for the sale of appliances manufactured in Great Britain before October 1953. The Regulations prescribe methods for testing guards, and apparatus has been purchased for this purpose. Sixty-six visits have been made to forty-six premises to ascertain that the provisions of the Act were being complied with and no contraventions were found. 53 Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health". Twelve copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations are carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the sanitary inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instance: Proceedings were instituted against the occupier of premises for failure to comply with a Statutory Notice served under Section 75 of the Public Health Act, 1936 and Section 15 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950 requiring the provision of a dustbin. The Magistrates ordered that the defendant should within 28 days pay the cost of the dustbin supplied (£l-8-6d.) together with 3/6d. costs, fined the defendant the sum of 10/6d. on his failure to comply with the notice and awarded the Corporation £1-1-0d. costs. 54 RODENT CONTROL To simplify the examination of claims submitted by local authorities to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry requires that the Annual Report, which previously has covered the calendar year, should now coincide with the financial claim year (i.e. 1st April to 31st March). The report, on this occasion, therefore, covers the fifteen months' period from 1st January 1953 to 31st March 1954. Complaints and Infestations Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1952 15 mths to 31.3.54 1952 15 mths to 31.3.54 1952 15 mths to 31.3.54 Rats 308 345 223 258 85 87 Mice 154 173 149 160 5 13 Total 462 518 372 418 90 100 Arising from these complaints, 82 additional premises were found to be infested with rats and 29 infested with mice. Twenty-six premises, where poultry were kept, were found to be infested with rats.
