FREDERICK JENNER, General report of Works Executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1870-71. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1870. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, In having the honor of again submitting an abbreviated list of the principal matters that have been the subjects of attention, or the Works that have been executed in my Department, it is not necessary that any detailed description should be appended, as all the matters have from time to time occupied a considerable amount of the time both of the Vestry and the Works Committee. To attempt to give a detailed list of the whole of the various works themselves, such as the locality and quantity of work done, materials used, &c., in the 2018 openings for the public companies, would be manifestly useless. Although a most formidable array of names and figures might thus be presented without much trouble, still I should doubt if any beneficial result whatever could be deduced from the same; it is sufficient to repeat what has so often been stated before, that the care of these openings is among the most urgent and important duties of the Vestry, and that the manner in which that care has been shewn and duty performed, is best understood, and may be best explained by the fact that not only has no accident occurred during the last twelve months, but that no legitimate complaint has been made of neglect on the part of the Yestry or their Officers, and it may be well to add that making good these openings, of necessity takes precedence of almost all other work. 14 It will be seen that very few New Works have been executed, in fact, the only actually New Road completed within the time embraced by the list is Sackville Street, where the surface has been altered from a Pitched to a McAdam Road. It appears from the general state of public opinion, and the necessities of the times, which become more and more urgent every year, that what is called "Pitched" Paving, or Paving composed of Rectangular Cubes of whatever size or shape, is becoming more and more unpopular, from the fact of its being manifestly unfitted for modern requirements and traffic; whether the traffic is great or small, the objections are equally valid. I do not now refer to Mews and places of that description, or to many other classes of streets, but to the general thoroughfares and private streets, where the drawbacks to comfort caused by Pitched Paving seems to be far in excess of their necessity, as it is quite clear that a far more pleasant and safe surface can be secured in its place. The alternative at present lies between ordinary McAdam Roads and Asphalte; both possessing their individual advantages, with this difference, the McAdam to a certain extent is understood, both as to its cost and durability, whereas the Asphalte at present being in its early stage has yet to be tested, and it is most important that those in charge of the Public Thoroughfares should be as clear and as well informed as possible before expending the large sums that are required to execute Asphalte on a large scale, and of course to be of any use it must be on a very large scale indeed. I presume experiments or the result of experiments will be collected as a guide and from the component parts 15 and the way in which Asphalte is laid, Chemical changes may be looked for, which may not be invariably uniform in their symptoms, while in the materials used in a McAdam Road, all Chemical changes are past, and we know exactly what the matenals in the changeless form will do. Making good disturbances after once laying is also an important item. The judicious use of rollers is another subject still requiring a little judgment; in such a Parish as St. James's, steam rollers do not appear to meet the difficulties of the case, as of necessity the horse traffic must be more or less suspended; whether or not horses as a rule can ever be accustomed to them I cannot sav, but the V ' result of our experience here is that for general purposes, not special occasions, a good roller, capable of the weight being adjusted, and drawn by horses is the most useful; and I think for repairs to McAdam Roads, (not forming New), a roller varying from three to seven or eight tons will be found most convenient; fifteen or twenty tons is certainly too much for this purpose. As the use of a roller at all is now an admitted necessity, I trust the Parish of St. James's will soon begin to entertain the idea of providing themselves with one of their own. With these few observations, the subject of the Paving Works may be passed over, nothing special requires any special observations, and the whole of the matters have been so well and completely discussed in the Works Committee from time to time, that such interest as is connected with the matters in question has been felt by those whose duty it is to advise the Vestry as to the Works that should be executed. The next report will I trust, 16 shew a more comprehensive and extended list of Works, especially in Footways and Kerbs which require much attention. In reference to Sewers matters, I cannot with truthfulness report that the Local Sewerage is in such a satisfactory condition as could be wished. A great deal requires to be done with regard to gullies, gulley-drains and ventilation, and the Regent Street Sewerage is still in a most unsatisfactory state, the same uncertainty that has prevailed for years is in force now, viz.: that an accident may at any time happen, and as will be seen, every year something has to be spent to keep things at all straight. But the chief difficulty with which the Yestry will sooner or later have to contend, will be the 12 in. Pipe Sewers, of which there are more than fifty in the Parish, the whole of which will, sooner or later, require to be cleansed or attended to. In the mean time, every attention is given that can be; difficulties are met as they arise, and dealt with as circumstances dictate. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the use of pipes for sewers. When properly constructed, a most expensive process, they answer well, but when done as they are in St. James's, it is all a question of chance how long they keep clear, and as they are certain from time to time to need attention and alteration, perhaps the wisest course is to wait till that time arrives, but when it does come, no delay can be allowed. The sewer in Little Windmill Street is another most unfortunate example of what is called an "error of judgment." As this matter has, however, been thoroughly investigated, studied in all its aspects, and is now in course of re-construction, 17 little need be said by way of further explanation. The whole of the sewers in the Parish that run from east to west will, as long as they remain as they are, require constant attention, from the limited fall they possess. Reference to other of my reports will give some further information on this point: it has been often explained, and is merely referred to here as being one of the most serious duties cast upon the Yestry, and one that never must be lost sight of, in fact, though drains and sewers are out of sight, they can be but seldom out of the minds of those whose duty it is to remember them, as it barely requires any reflection at all to shew the very first rank that should be allowed for such important works, both as regards their construction and maintenance, and from year to year this importance must be increased. The remaining matters referred to in the list require little comment. One Refuge for Foot Passengers has been constructed in the course of the year, opposite the County Fire Office, in Regent Street, and has proved as was anticipated, very useful. No doubt, in time, many more will be constructed, as they have become a necessity where the traffic is so constant and rapid. Several Tablets with the names of streets thereon have been fixed in various localities, as set forth in the accompanying list, and matters of that nature, most beneficial in themselves, have been executed. I cannot close this brief summary without an expression of regret at the failure of the attempt to construct an underground Urinal in Great Marlborough Street. Had it been completed, I am convinced the anticipated annoyance would have 18 been found to have been greatly exaggerated, it would have served as a model for many others, and the advantage of such structures would have been proved. Actually nothing has been done towards providing additional accommodation for that large class who, in London, are compelled to pass their time in the open air, or for those in various stages of ill health. If the Medical Profession were consulted, the statements that could be made and the statistics that could be collected of the disease, injury, and death caused by the want of such conveniences, would I am sure act as such a powerful stimulus in the matter, that a very strong case of alleged nuisance or infringement of delicacy would have to be made out, before the Local Authorities generally would be deterred from building such resorts as their judgment might dictate ; taken on the whole, it stands to reason that the more numerous such places were, the greater the delicacy would become. I still trust something may de done, and considering the time and attention that has been given, and the efforts that have been made by the Yestry of St. James's, it is singularly unfortunate that they should be overpowered by circumstances, or the only circumstance over which they have no control, or cannot overcome, viz., a convenient site. Again thanking the Yestry for the confidence kindly reposed in myself, and the performance of the duties entrusted to me, I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir, my Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, A. P. HOWELL, Vestry Sorbegor. 19 GENERAL WORKS, &c. EXECUTED BY The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March 1870 to 25th March, 1871.

JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE YEAR 1871, BY EDWIN LANEESTER, M.D., LLD, F.E.S., &c. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOE ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. fames’s Mestminster. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, I beg now to lay before you a report on the nature and amount of the mortality in the Parish of Saint James's, Westminster, for the year 1870. This is the sixteenth year of my having held the post of medical officer of health, and the fifteenth annual report I have had the honor of presenting you. I have delayed presenting this report a little longer than usual in order that I might do as I did ten years ago under the same circumstances, present you with some of the results of the taking of the census in your Parish in the preceding April of this year, as I had done that of 1861. The Census of 1871. Although the census of England and Wales in the year 1871 was taken so late as the 3rd of April, the Registrar General has already (July, 1871) published a "Preliminary Report and Tables of the Population and Houses enumerated in England and Wales, and in the Islands in the British Seas." From this preliminary report I extract a few particulars with 28 regard to the Parish of Saint James's, Westminster, which I cannot but think will be interesting to the members of the Vestry. I may perhaps state by way of introduction that the population of London whichin 1861 was 2,803,989,was in 1871 3,251,804, shewing an increase in the interval, between 1861 and 1871, of 447,815 persons. The following table kindly sent me by Mr. Clode of the Census Office, affords a view of the number of houses and population of the Parish at the last census:— Houses and Population at Census 1871, 3rd April. SUB-DISTRICTS. HOUSES. POPULATION. Inhabited. Uninhabited. Building. Males. Females. Total.

It will be seen however, by a reference to the census of London, that in many of the more industrial the population has decreased. Thus the City of London in 1861 had a population of 112,063, but in 1871 this small number of inhabitants had dwindled to 74,732 people. But in all these ten years the business and wealth of the City had increased and it was ascertained a few years ago that the day population of the City was 170,133. Another illustration is afforded by Marylebone which in 1861 contained 161,680 inhabitants, but in 1871 numbered 159,177, being a dimunition of 2,503 inhabitants. The dimunition of particular Districts in the Parish will be seen by the following tables:— Saint James's Square Division. Population in 1851, 11,469 Ditto in 1801, 10,753 Diminution in 10 years, 716 Population in 1871, 10,453 Diminution from 1861 to 1871, 300 This is the wealthiest District of the Parish of Saint James, and the least populated. There are, however, certain streets and courts, which have been over-populated, and the sanitary efforts made to prevent overcrowding may have produced the dimunition of about 1000 of its inhahitants during the last 20 years. 30 Golden Square Division. Population in 1851, 14,139 Ditto in 1861, 13,963 Diminution of population from 1851 to 1861, 176 Population in 1871, 12,855 Diminution from 1861 to 1871, 1,108 The probability is that the decrease of this population has been really larger than the numbers express, as the residents of the Workhouse are included, and within the last three years a number of inmates have been received from the Parish of Saint Anne, Soho, and of which the census in its present form gives no account. Berwick Street Division. Population in 1851, 10,798 Ditto in 1861, 10,608 Diminution from 1851 to 1861, 190 Population in 1871, 10,279 Diminution from 1861 to 1871, 329 Thus in every district of the Parish there has been a diminution, but in the most overcrowded and unhealthy part of it, the Berwick Street district, there has been less diminution than in any other. The above table affords us an indication as to whether the diminution of the population has been in males or females. Females in excess in 1861. Females in 1871. St. James's Square, - 591 less 168 Golden Square, including Workhouse, 1,261 more 1,017 Berwick Street, - - 346 more 179 31 This is a very extraordinary result of the history of the last ten years, for whilst the excess of females in 1861 was 2,098, the excess in 1871 was only 1,028. So that out of the diminished population of 1871, amounting to 1,731 in ten years, 1,070 were females. I know of nothing to account for this diminution of the female population, unless it be the systematic and quiet efforts made by the Vestry to shut up those dens of infamy around the Haymarket, which were chiefly remarkable for being the habitation of women of loose character. The next item demanding our attention in the above census returns is the number of houses in the Parish. Number of Houses. In 1861. In 1871. St. James's Square Division, 1,505 1,545 increase 40 Golden Square Division, 1,238 1,109 decrease 129 Berwick Street Division, 773 727 decrease 46 From this it appears that 135 houses have been destroyed during the last 10 years. Number of Uninhabited Houses. St. James's Square Division, 124 75 - 49 Golden Square Division, - 62 76 - 14 Berwick Street Division, - 50 52 - 2 236 203 Thus, it appears, there are 33 less uninhabited houses in 1871, than there were in 1861. It is very clear that whilst the population has diminished the 32 number of houses occupied has been increased and there must be consequently more room for the inhabitants in the houses they occupy. If we again take the above figures to ascertain the number of people living in each house in the three districts we shall find that on an average there are 7 persons in a house in St. James's Square Division. 12 persons in a house in Golden Square Division. 15 persons in a house in Berwick Street Division. Although we have diminished the number of our population and increased the number of our inhabited houses, I find no district in London so overcrowded as the Berwick Street Division of St. James's, Westminster. It is not as though the houses in Berwick Street were all large houses, as in the St. James's Square Division, but that they are all more or less small houses, nor are all the houses equally populated, for some of them are as sparsely populated as the houses in St. James's Square Division. The real position is that these figures point not to 6 or 8 roomed houses with 15 people in each, but to a number of small houses occupied by from 20 to 40 persons living under circumstances of overcrowding that is unequalled for the same extent, perhaps, in any city in Europe. To reduce Berwick Street Division alone to a standard of 500 cubic feet for 33 each person residing in its small houses would be to eject 3,000 or 4,000 persons from their present residences. Yet such a proceeding must be contemplated if we would relieve the inhabitants from the causes of preventible diseases. Excess of Births over Deaths. The "Preliminary Report" gives the excess of births over deaths during the ten years, from 1861 to 187]. They are as follows:— St. James's Square Division 340 Golden Square Division 146 Berwick Street Division 1,048 1,534 Thus whilst the population has been diminished 1,737 persons, the births have exceeded the deaths by 1,534, so that 3,270 persons must have permanently left the Parish during the ten years ending 1871. General Mortality in 1871. By reference to the first series of tables in the Appendix, which record the nature of the diseases and the number of persons who have died in the year, it will be found that the whole number is 854. This, however, includes the death of 177 persons who have died in the Workhouse in Poland Street. Of the deaths in the Workhouse 38 persons have been brought from the Parish of Saint Anne s, Soho, thus reducing the whole deaths of the Parish of Saint James, Westminster, to 824. c 34 The following is a list of the mortality of different years for the last 15 years. 1856 682 1864 832 1857 712 1865 704 1858 669 1866 769 1859 764 1867 707 1860 723 1861 758 1868 684 1862 727 1869 719 1863 757 1870 824 The average death rate of the Parish for the last .15 years is 737, so that the death rate of the year 1870 exceeds that of the average by 87 deaths. The difference of the death rate in the different Districts of the Parish and at different seasons between the years 1869 and 1870, may be clearly seen by the following tables. Table of Deaths in Districts and Quarters in 1869. • First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Population. St. James's Sq.

It will be remembered that the Fourth Quarter of 1870 was remarkable for the coldness of the weather, and for the setting in of one of the severest frosts that has been experienced in this country for many years. The cold was equally severe and excessive for the Second Quarter of the year where it will be seen the deaths in 1870 were in excess of those of 1869. Reporting to the Vestry on the 14th of April, 1870, I remarked that "the higher mortality, independent of the Workhouse, is found to be due to diseases of the chest, which have been aggravated by the prolonged cold of an unusually severe winter. Death produced by cold is less under the control of the Medical Officer of Health than any other of the common causes of disease. It is mainly due 36 to want of proper warmth in dwelling and sleeping apartments, and want of warm clothing out doors. At the same time it is very obvious from the death returns that it is principally amongst old people and children who suffer from the periodical return of cold during the Autumn and Winter Seasons of the year. I showed in my return however for 1864 that the excessive mortality of that year was due to the exceptional cold of the winter of 1863-4, and that the excessive deaths of that year did not fall exclusively on the young and aged, but upon those who were in the middle period of life. It thus appears that those who have to look after themselves are more likely to suffer than those who are looked after by others. What was true of 1864 I believe to be true of 1870. The following tables shew this: Ages of Death in 1869. Under i Year. | Above 1 and under 5. Above 6 and under 20. Above 20 and under 40. Above 40 and under 60. Above 60. Total.

It will be seen that the excess of deaths between the two years is chiefly in that of persons between 40 and 60 years of age. The deaths in the Workhouse during the last five years has been as follows: 1866 133 1867 136 1868 145 1869 183 1870 182 The deaths of 41 persons from Saint Anne's in 1869, and of 38 in 1870 will account for the increase of mortality during those years. Zymotic Diseases. The cases of what are called Zymotic Diseases are always of interest to the medical officer of health, as it is amongst this group of diseases he has the 38 best chance of exercising his influence for the benefit of the community. I now present a table of the various forms of Zymotic Disease that have prevailed in the parish during 16 years: Table of Zymotic Disease for 16 Years, Name of Disease. 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 187 Small Pox 3 5 .. .. 4 4 1 1 21 .. 2 1 3 2 • • 3 Measles 7 5 13 10 38 8 17 9 24 29 17 19 17 11 14 13 Scarlet Fever and Dipht. 27 16 13 29 31 16 32 66 31 13 20 30 9 31 39 75 Whpg.

Total 130 79 93 70 121 80 109 135 126 100 81 105 88 88 119 136 From this table it will be seen that there were more deaths from Zymotic Diseases in 1870 than in any previous year for 16 years. Having regard to the diseases prevailing it will be found that the mortality is specially produced by two diseases, Scarlet Fever and Diarrhoea. Scarlet Fever. Seventy-six persons died of this disease in the parish during the year 1870, thus one person in every eleven who died in the parish died of Scarlet Fever. This disease is one of the most contagious known. Articles of clothing which have been kept in drawers for upwards of two years have been known to communicate the disease. Letters written in the room where persons lay ill have been known 39 to convey the disease after having been carried hundreds of miles by post. The poison consists of minute germs which being thrown off from the skin, lungs, mouth, bowels, and kidneys, are diffused in the air, and can thus be conveyed from one person to another. These germs can be easily destroyed. They are killed by certain well known disinfectants. If the first case of Scarlet Fever could be discovered in a neighbourhood it would be easy so to treat it that it would be impossible for the disease to spread. But there is no legal obligation on the part of the head of a family or landlord, or a medical man to declare the presence of this disease to the sanitary authority. The consequence is that long before any knowledge of the existence of the disease has been obtained by the Medical Officer of Health, the disease has spread far and wide. If it were not so melancholy, one feels inclined to deride the folly and ignorance of a so-called civilised and enlightened nation, allowing such a cruel and terrible scourge as this to pass over the country without any attempt to control it. With regard to other Zymotic Diseases, the Legislature has put forth feeble efforts to disarm them of their power. Special acts are put into force to disarm cholera of its deadly grip upon the community; and a half-hearted Legislation seeks to do something in a bewildered way to prevent Small Pox, but nothing is done to prevent Scarlet Fever. In 16 years we have lost 479 persons by Scarlet Fever in Saint James's, Westminster, and in 40 Great Britain not less than 100,000 persons have been sacrificed to this disease in the same time. Where one person dies of this disease, from 10 to 20 get it and get well. It is vain to calculate the mere pecuniary expense of such a curse, but every one can make something like an approximation to the cost of such a waste of human life, and form an opinion of the vast benefit of a legislation that should put a stop to this disease. Diarrhoea. Whilst Scarlet Fever is an example of a highly contagious form of Zymotic Disease absolutely dependent on a specific poison for its propagation, Diarrhoea is a form of Zymotic Disease which is never contagious, except when it precedes an attack of true Asiatic Cholera. Diarrhoea is, however, mainly dependent for its origin on preventible causes. It is produced by impure water, sour milk, decomposing food, and an atmosphere contaminated by germs of organic matter arising from decomposing vegetable and animal substances. Hence it is constantly present with us during the hot seasons of the year, and may to a certain extent be controlled by cleanliness, and avoiding all forms of contaminated food and drink. The majority of the cases recorded in this parish in 1870, occurred during the third quarter of the year, and in the Berwick; Street Division, the most overcrowded district. As a warning it should never be forgotten 41 that where persons are most predisposed to Diarrhoea, there they are most liable to be attacked with Cholera. General Theory of Zymotic Disease. The nature of contagious diseases and the laws of their propagation are very little understood by the population generally, and that is why they frequently pursue an unrestrained course, both in our country and town populations. A Zymotic Disease is one that is produced by some special or general poison, the germs of which being introduced into the blood are capable of so altering the qualities or character of the blood as to cause disease or death in the system. In order, however, for these poison germs to act, there are two other conditions necessary, and these are that the person acted on should be predisposed to take the poison, and that there should be a medium of transit for the poison to the person infected. 1. The Poison. The poisons of Zymotic disease are of two kinds, special and general. The special poisons are those which produce specific diseases. Thus the poisons of Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Typhus Fever, and Cholera, are special poisons, and when introduced into the system will produce no other diseases, but that of the body from which they come. They are like the seeds of plants which only produce the kind of plant from which they come. Under the microscope, these poisons present themselves under the form of minute cells 42 and molecules from 1-5,000th to 1-10,000th of an inch in diameter. These minute cells are easily distributed through water and through the air. They may thus be taken into the human body, and set up in the body into which they enter, the same sort of disease as exist in the body from which they come These poisons have a vitality of their own, and are capable of growing and multiplying out of the body in which they were first generated. Thus it is that the excretions from the bowels of a single person having contagious Cholera are capable of infecting large masses of water, and engendering disease in those who drink it. It is not improbable that all the organic poisons have the same power of increase in the air on damp substances or other proper soils. In this respect they resemble the spores of mushrooms and toad-stools which being diffused through the air alight upon some soil adapted to their growth, where they spring up and multiply, the spores which are diffused again for further multiplication. The atmosphere of all overcrowded and unventilated rooms where persons are ill with Zymotic Disease is crowded with these germs ready to alight on persons and things presenting a proper soil for their growth. It is in this way that the germs of organic poisons differ from mineral poisons. A crystal of arsenic or corrosive sublimate does not grow and multiply either outside or inside the body. In the same way vegetable poisons as morphia and strychnine cease to multiply at once they are removed from the 43 plant which produced them. It is thus that the germ-poisons of diseases are much more active and destructive than other kinds of poison. Another peculiarity of these germ-poisons is that their life may be destroyed by certain external agents. Thus it has been found that a certain amount of heat will destroy the life of these poisons. It has been found that the exposing the germs of Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, and other contagious diseases to the temperature of boiling water (212 degrees Fahrenheit), will destroy the poison of these diseases. It is true that recently some doubt has been thrown on this statement, but at auy rate the cases are so exceptional where there has been any reason to doubt the disinfecting effects of boiling water, that there could be no excuse on that ground for refusing to subject all infected linen to a temperature of 212 degrees. In the Parish of Saint James's, Westminster, and in many large towns in England, disinfecting apparatus have been erected, where a temperature much higher than that of boiling water can be secured. It should, however, be remembered that for all temperatures below that of 212 degrees there should be an expectation of the non-destruction of the poison in proportion to the lowness of the temperature to which the clothing and furniture employed in such chambers may have been submitted. Germ-poisons may be also destroyed by being brought into contact with certain substances which destroy their life and activity at ordinary 44 peratures. These substances are variously called disinfectants, antiseptics, and deodorants. The most ordinary of them, and Nature's own disinfectant, is the oxygen gas of the atmosphere. In the form of ozone, which exists in all pure atmospheres, it attacks decomposing animal and vegetable matter, and seems to have the power of oxidising germpoisons in the air. Hence the importance of fresh air in rooms at all times, whether disease is present or not. Pure water also contains oxygen gas, and the tendency of water is to destroy all germ-poisons that are put into it. It constantly happens, however, that all the oxygen of water is exhausted by the impurities it contains, and then the water is no longer capable of disinfecting, but becomes a source of contamination and the means itself of conveying poison. We had a familiar instance of this in the parish of Saint James's, Westminster, in 1854, when the water from the Broad Street pump became contaminated with cholera poison, and destroyed hundreds of persons who drank it, with Cholera. I examined the water of this pump six weeks after, and found only minute quantities of organic matter of any kind. It contained, however, Carbonic Acid Gas, and Salts of Nitric Acid, which had undoubtedly been formed by the oxidating agency of the oxygen in the water, and which was deficient at the time of the Cholera poisoning, from the excess of organic matter, and deficiency of oxygen gas. Some of the disinfectants ordinarily recommended 45 contain the form of oxygen called ozone, and in destroying the germ-poisons act by decomposing or oxidising the poison compound. This is the case with Condy's Disinfecting Fluid which contains ozone, and acts by oxidising the poison and rendering that innocuous which had before been injurious. Another agent which acts in the same way is Chlorine. This element is a gas, and is applied in several ways. It can be easily made from common salt which contains Chlorine, by mixing Chloride of Sodium—common salt — with Peroxide of Manganese and Sulphuric Acid, Chlorine is evolved from, this mixture, and poisonous germs in the air are thus effectually destroyed. One of the oldest remedies for the destruction of poison-germs is Sulphurous Acid. This gas is evolved by the burning of Sulphur. It was this gas which Ulysses employed when purifying the places in which he had destroyed the lovers of Penelope. Euryclea. " Sulphur brought and fire, When he, with purifying steams, himself Visited every part, the banquet-room, The vestibule, the court." The Compounds of Chlorine, with the metals, are also disinfectants. These compounds are well-known, and Chloride of Zinc (known as Burnett's Disinfecting Fluid) Chloride of Iron, Chloride of Alum, (Chloralum) and Chloride of Sodium (common salt) are all used at the present day for the purpose of destroying poison-germs. Sulphate of Iron, Sulphate 46 of Copper, and Sulphate of Zinc, are all destructive of the life of poison-germs, and are employed as disinfectants. One of the most powerful agents in the destruction of poison-germs is Carbolic Acid. This agent is found in tar, kreosote, and other substances which are known for their power of destroying the life of poisongerms. Carbolic Acid is now sold in various forms, and can be most easily employed for the purposes of disinfection. There are other agents which are capable of destroying all forms of germ-poisons, and from this statement it will be seen that mankind has in its possession a powerful host of means by which these destructive pests of human life may be combated and destroyed. Besides the poison-germs produced by special agencies, and producing specific diseases, there are another set of poison-germs which are given off from decomposing vegetable and animal matters. These are the germs which, escaping from our dustbins, ash-pits, drains, cesspools, sewers, privies, and water-closets, on being taken into the stomach and lungs, or allowed to accumulate on the open surface of wounds, are capable of producing the diseases known as Diarrhoea, Dysentery, Typhoid or Drain Fever, Erysipelas, Pyaemia, and the like. These germs are constantly present, to a greater or less extent, in the air of houses, streets, and cities, they produce a vast amount of disease and death, and are more particularly destructive in over-crowded 47 and badly-ventilated rooms, and amongst the densely inhabited districts of our large cities and towns. The activity of these poisons may be destroyed in exactly the same way as the more active specific poisons of which I have just spoken. They are oxidised and their vitality destroyed by fresh air and pure water containing oxygen. The same disinfectants may be employed for their destruction. These germs are constantly given off from privies, drains, and water-closets, and the various kinds of disinfectants of which I have spoken should be constantly used in those places where these germs are given off. Carbolic Acid, Chloralum, Sulphate of Iron, &c., should more especially be used in the summer season for the purifying of all accumulations of putrefying and smelling matter One of the most effectual means of destroying these germs and hastening their decomposition, is the covering them with common garden mould. On this principle earth closets have been recommended where water-closets cannot be employed. Ten years ago I expressed my conviction to you, that a more economical and effectual way of dealing with the sewage of our towns, would be to mix it at once with earth, and thus render it easily available as manure. Since then this plan has been adopted in many parts of the country with perfect success. The power of mould or garden soil, to render innocuous these poison-germs, seem to reside in the power which the particles of the soil have of introducing Oxygen to the poisonous agent, and thus of 48 decomposing it. It is the same property which gives to charcoal the wonderful power it exercises as a disinfectant. I know of nothing which acts so powerfully as a deodorant on the dead human body as charcoal. Two or three pounds introduced into a coffin will at once take away smell, and render tolerable that which would otherwise be almost unbearable. I mention this especially as I know of nothing that is so disgraceful to our civilisation as the way in which our dead are kept in fully occupied dwelling houses. Not the slightest effort is made to take away the smell of the decomposing body, or to prevent the inhabitants of the house from taking disease. Do what we can, the dead body in a house, especially in summer, is always " a nuisance injurious to health," and ought to be dealt with by the sanitary authority Decency and prudence both dictate that dead bodies should be removed from amongst the living. This fact has been impressed upon the legislature, and they have given ample powers to local authorities to provide public mortuaries; but except those which are connected with our Workhouses, I do not think that there are a half-a-dozen mortuaries in all London to which a dead body could be removed previous to interment. 2. The predisposed body. On some persons the poison-germs take no effect. In the London Fever Hospital and the Small Pox Hospital, the nurses who attend upon the sick seldom or ever take the disease. The sewers man works from six to eight 49 hours a day in the public sewers of a city, and is never attacked by any serious disease. Numbers of persons live daily amongst the most inconceivable abominations of filth and self-neglect, and yet have comparatively good health. It is very clear, therefore, that some persons do not suffer from the action of these poisons. We cannot always account for this, but this fact we know, that persons who have had certain forms of contagious disease do not have the same forms after. Thus those who have had Scarlet Fever or Small Pox do not as a rule have it again. In this way we can appoint persons to attend the sick from any particular disease, who have had that disease and will not take it again. We say they have no predisposition to take the disease. Now one of the greatest preventions of one of these contagious diseases, Small Pox, was discovered by Jenner. He found that persons might have a modified form of Small Pox called Cow Pox imparted to them which would prevent their being predisposed to take Small Pox. This is probably one of the greatest discoveries ever made by the ingenuity of man, and has saved more lives than all other discoveries put together. If such a discovery could be made for every other kind of contagious disease it would be the means of putting an end altogether to the dire brood of contagions. Unfortunately all people do not believe in Jenner's discovery, and neglecting to be vaccinated Small Pox rages amongst them as though Jenner s 50 discovery had never been made. There can he no doubt, however, that it is the solemn duty of every State, and of every community of individuals to screen themselves and their neighbours from the liability to take Small Pox, and to get rid of at least this one of the dire sisters that produce disease and death. With these exceptions we can point to no absolute law that gives certain pre-emption from the effects of the morbid poisons to which I have drawn attention. There can be no doubt that other things being equal, that the healthiest individual will be the one that is least likely to fall under the influence of any of the poisons enumerated. We find that as a rule where—adults as well as children —are well fed, well clothed, well -washed, and have plenty of fresh air they are least likely to contract any kind of disease. It is amongst the poor, the half-starved, the dirty, the half-clad, and overcrowded that all forms of Zymotic Disease crop up, and run their ghastly course. They are for ever a warning that man is living contrary to the laws of his healthy existence, and that something is wrong in his mode of life. This state of body is not more an indication that the sanitary laws of a country are deficient, or that sanitary authorities neglect their duty, as that people are grossly ignorant of the first conditions of their physical existence, and have never been taught the A B C of a healthy life. 3. The medium by which organic poisons are 51 mitted. A man may look at a dead body through a pane of glass and see it, but not smell it. An unvaccinated person may look at a Small Pox patient through a window, and not take the disease. These cases show that unless the poison of a diseased body is conveyed by some proper medium no disease is set up. Now the most common media for the conveyance of the poison germs of disease are air, water, and lood. There are some poison germs which can only be communicated by contact, such is the poison of hydrophobia and the forms of venereal diseases, but of these nothing need be said here. The air of the atmosphere is the great source of the transmission of germ-poisons. Hence the necessity of attending to its conditions where Zymotic Diseases are present. I have already spoken of the necessity of renewing the air of sick rooms and this may be done to an extent to prevent all poisoning from diseased bodies. Thus in our large hospitals where there is plenty of space it is found that contagious diseases do not spread from bed to bed should a case of such disease accidently break out. The current of air in a room will always carry the germs of poison in the direction in which it is moving, and clergymen and the occasional visitor to the bed side of the sick should always approach them from the side of the room from which the current of air is setting. It is found that damp states of the air are more likely to convey poisons than dry states. At the same time it should be recollected that during dry 52 atmospheres the poison germs may be dried without their vitality being destroyed, and may be taken up as dust in the atmosphere, and conveyed to great distances. Instances are related by medical men in the East Indies of the poison of Cholera being conveyed in this way. The power of the air of the atmosphere to convey germ-poisons is one of the great sources of domestic disease in London. Whilst the water closet system secures the removal of all these poison germs which can be destroyed or removed by water, there is another set of these germs which get into the air of the drains and sewers. Now the air goes up these passages whilst the water flows down, hence if not properly trapped our drains receive impure air from the sewers, and the houses receive impure air from the drains. This should be avoided at all hazards, In the first place drains should never run through a house, but all refuse should pass directly into drains outside the house, and in the next place there should be upcast shafts from drains and sewers outside all houses, to allow the impure air to go into the atmosphere. Any amount of impure air outside a house is much safer than a very small quantity of bad air inside. The next thing that conveys poison germs is water. Painful as may be the thought there seems really very little water supplied to the inhabitants of England that is not open to the charge of being liable to convey poison-germs. Our rivers receive the refuse of towns, and the washings of highly 53 manured lauds, and but for the filtration the water undergoes by water companies would certainly more often produce disastrous effects than they do. The Thames has on several occasions conveyed the poison of Cholera to the houses of persons supplied by it. Many other towns have suffered in the same way. Water supplied from wells is equally open to suspicion. It frequently happens that a cesspool or a drain in a churchyard communicates with the shallow springs of wells and contaminate the water. This is especially the case with the poisons of Cholera and Typhoid Fever; but all the poisons of Zymotic Diseases appear to be capable of being conveyed by water. Even when water is delivered in a tolerable state of purity by the water companies it may be stored in butts and cisterns so imperfectly that organic matter gaining access from without may render the water unfit to drink. Our water closets are often supplied from the same cisterns that afford drinking and washing water. The result is that the impure air from the drain ascends into the cistern, and contaminates the water. We have had deaths from Choleraic Diarrhoea in Saint James's, Westminster, from this cause. Under these circumstances whenever water is at all open to suspicion, it should be boiled, and filtered through an animal charcoal filter before it is drunk. It is to be hoped that every parish in London will avail itself of the powers given them under the Metropolis Water Bill of 1871, to compel the 54 Water Companies to give a constant instead of an intermittent supply, This would at once get rid of the base and disastrous system of storing the water in cisterns and butts, and remove a fruitful source of disease and death, and destruction of property. Food of various kinds can be the means of conveying the germs of Zymotic Disease. Thus recently in Islington it was shown by Dr. Ballard that Typhoid Fever was conveyed to various families by means of milk supplied from a dairy where the milk pails had been washed in water from a well that communicated with the drains of a house where Typhoid Fever prevailed. In another recent instance a whole district of a town supplied with milk from a farm house was infected with Scarlet Fever On enquiry it was found that Scarlet Fever prevailed at the farm from which the milk came, and that several persons had milked the cows before they had got well of Scarlet Fever. Bread and other kinds of food handed by sick persons, or persons in attendance on them, have been taken by others, and the disease has thus been reproduced. This is especially the case with Cholera and Typhoid Fever, but is more or less true of all other Zymotic Diseases. The fact is, persons not ill should not eat in the rooms where Zymotic Diseases exist, and the food that has been handled or tasted and not required by the sick should be at once destroyed. If the germ-poisons can be thus easily conveyed by air, water, or food, they can be much more 55 easily conveyed by contact. Only those who nurse and who are not predisposed to take the disease should touch the patient, and all persons who are predisposed should he prevented embracing, kissing, or otherwise coming in contact with the diseased body. Conclusion. I might have extended these general remarks, but I hope I have said enough to show you the nature of one set of enemies with which we have to deal. When we consider their insidious nature, their extensive existence, and the ease with which they are diffused, we may, perhaps, congratulate ourselves that they are not more destructive than they are. At the same time it should be recollected, that our knowledge of the laws of the nature of these diseases is much more accurate than formerly, and that we now know enough to show us that more active and intelligent sanitary legislation would be of the greatest possible benefit. What we want is Imperial and compulsory Acts of Parliament for the removal of the sources of disease and death, and not local and permissive measures. At the same time, it is quite useless to pass Acts of Parliament unless people are prepared to employ them and act under them. This can only be done by teaching the people, both high and low, the laws by which health and strength may be secured, and disease prevented 56 from laying low the youth and strength of the country. It is not for me to show you, but it is for every one to calculate, the wealth of health, and the enormous loss sustained by preventible disease and death. I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. APPENDIX CONTAINING PAGE 1. Table of Causes of Death 58 2. Report of Sanitary Inspector's "Work 62 3. A.
