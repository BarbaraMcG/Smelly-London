Sou 29 Borough of Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, FOR THE YEAR 1004. G. Millson. Medical Officer of Health. London: T. Cornell & Sons, Commercial & General Printers, 63, Borough Road, S.E. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Eighteenth Annual Report on the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1904. The year under consideration has been somewhat uneventful. With the exception of Measles there has been no particular outbreak of infectious disease. Indeed, it has been a record year for the small amount of notifiable disease. The death-rate of the year for a Borough so crowded as Southwark must be considered satisfactory. The summary of the sanitary work carried out shows that the Health Staff has been energetically and usefully employed. A few changes have taken place among the ward inspectors, some of them having secured more lucrative appointments in other Boroughs. I beg to thank the Public Health Committee for their support, and the staff in general for their assistance in this highly interesting work. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. TABLE OF CONTENTS. AGE.

The deaths under one year of age to 1,000 births for the last ten years were as follows: 1893 178 1899 199 1894 163 1900 192 1895 201 1901 168 1896 192 1902 166 1897 187 1903 148 1898 190 1904 174 6 POPULATION. During 1904 the population of the Borough has been unusually migratory. This change has not been confined to a portion of the Borough, but has been present in every district. The extensive re-housing schemes now being carried out and affecting fully 6,000 persons, must of necessity exert a disturbing influence on the remainder. I have no doubt many of the dislodged inhabitants have found a resting place in other wards. The population of the Borough during the year may not have declined to any amount by the re-building operations on the Clandon Street and other areas, yet the most casual observer must have noticed a great change in the appearance of the Borough during the last year or two. There has been a tendency for the better-to-do residents to remove to the outskirts of our big city where house rent is less and accommodation better. The increased means of locomotion recently provided has made this possible. Only a few years ago it was exceedingly difficult to find a house unlet, indeed, such was the demand for accommodation that persons desiring to rent a house had to wait for months before they could be suited. Much of this has changed. At the present time the supply of houses more than equals the demand for them in all classes of tenements. With regard to the rents paid in the Borough for single rooms; in the northern part, the rent of one room is from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per week. This price increases as one travels westward, from 3s. to 4s. or 4s. 6d. These prices are for unfurnished rooms. Furnished rooms are generally from 1s. to 1s. 6d. more. In the cheaper model dwellings rents are 1s. 9d., 2s. and 3s. for single rooms, according to the floors. In other well-known buildings a single room and scullery let for 4s. 3d., and two rooms for 6s. to 6s. 6d., according to the floor. On one of our large estates the usual two-room tenement is 6s. 6d., and a three-room tenement 8s. 6d., whilst on another property the charge is 9s. and 9s. 6d. for three rooms and a scullery. In Southwark the slum question is largely solving itself. Owners of such property find that the repairs called for by the sanitary authority are such a heavy expense, that little, if any, profit falls to the share of the owner. A large extent of insanitary house property has been closed, and in many cases pulled down, from this cause alone It is a serious question for owners of insanitary property whether it would be better to rebuild the small houses on the same site in the very crowded parts of the Borough, or to build warehouses. I think the latter, where the frontage is a good one, is likely to be more remunerative to the owner, as small 7 house property in the more densely crowded parts will in future be occupied more and more by the casual labourer class, whose destructive tendencies are so well known.

Information as to registered births is now sent on weekly to the medical officers of health by the district sub-registrars. It is hardly to be expected that the machinery for the proper and full use of this information will be set up at once, that must come by degrees, but I have no doubt that before long the excessive infantile mortality will receive much more attention than it has hitherto had. For the present, on receipt of the weekly returns of births we deliver into the hands of the individual mothers printed directions, "How to feed and bring up a Baby.'' There are as well, two lady inspectors, part of whose duty it is to make inquiries in relation to infants. 9 BIRTHS. The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1904, was 6,557, of which 3.283 were males, and 3,274 females. This represents a birth-rate of 31.5 per 1.000 inhabitants.

The number of deaths registered in the Borough for the year under consideration, was 3.746, of which 2,015 were males and 1,731 females. This shows a reduction of more than 15.0 per cent. on the average deathrate for the last ten years. Of the 3,746 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,116 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 406 belonging to Southwark, and 710 to other boroughs of the Metropolis. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,133. Of this very large number as many as 662 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 27.1. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 20 0 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1904, as against 18.1 for the year 1903. 14 TABLE 4.

The deaths in the hospital cases were 11, a mortality of 2.8 per cent. 27 cases were treated at home, with one death, a mortality of 3.7 per cent. DIPHTHERIA. This disease has not been quite so prevalent during the year under consideration, but the cases were more virulent. The deaths numbered 26 as against 23 for the year 1903. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 281, in comparison with 354 notified in 1903. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 9'2. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.13. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

In the cases treated at home it can hardly be said to be the practice to employ the Antitoxic serum which has so reduced the mortality in diphtheritic patients in the hospitals. Such is the benefit that has attended this treatment in the hospitals, that in the poorer districts health authorities can not be relieved from a certain amount of opprobrium when they refuse to supply this remedy gratuitously to the medical men of the district. Just as in vaccination there must be individuals who from what is called conscientious scruples refuse to believe in anything of the kind, yet happily they are few in number. The best results we know, are obtained from the application of the serum as soon after the onset of the complaint as possible, and in a full dose. As a prophylactic in households where virulent cases have arisen it should be more extensively used. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year, numbered 18, as against 23 for 1903. The total number of cases notified was 92 for the present year, and 122 for 1903. 39 The percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 19.5. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.09. Deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years: 1895 23 1900 39 1896 26 1901 18 1897 21 1902 23 1898 20 1903 23 1899 32 1904 18 Of the 92 cases notified, as many as 77 were removed to hospital, with 13 deaths, a mortality of 16.8 per cent. 15 cases were treated at home, with 5 deaths, a mortality of 33.3 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 83.6. DIARRHAEA. The deaths during the year from this disease was 282, as against 197, 169 and 222 for the three preceding years. This increase was due to the excessive infantile mortality from summer diarrhæa in the third quarter of the year. The deaths from diarrhæa in the third quarter were 234. Much of this heavy mortality was due to the comparatively hot and dry autumn months, and the dirty and unsatisfactory quality of the food supplied to infants. The hand-fed baby in Southwark has but a very slender chance of being present at its first anniversary. The annual rate per 1,000 living was 1.36. Deaths from diarrhæa during the last ten years: 1895 205 1900 233 1896 214 1901 222 1897 300 1902 169 1898 306 1903 197 1899 260 1904 282 In every case of death from diarrhæa the house was examined, and the history of the case in regard to the feeding of the infant (when such deaths occurred in infants) was reported upon, together with the cleanliness of the home and the habits of the parents. The following directions will be issued in the summer to prevent as far as possible infantile diarrhæa. 40 BOROUGH OF SOUTHWABK. Infantile Mortality. Summer Diarrhæa is one of the most fatal of diseases for infants. It chiefly occurs in hand-fed babies, and is mainly due to improper feeding, and the dirty condition of the home. With proper care the baby ought not to die from the complaint. In London alone nearly 5,000 deaths, and in Southwark 282 deaths, were due last year to Diarrhœa. To prevent much of this excessive mortality mothers should be strongly urged to breast-feed the baby until it is seven months old. A baby so fed does not need and should not be given other food during that period. It is found that breast-fed babies almost entirely escape this Summer Diarrhæa. When the baby must be hand-fed the best cow's milk should be procured, as that is the only reliable substitute for breast milk. The milk when brought into the house should be at once boiled, and either kept in a glass stoppered bottle, or in a vessel well covered so as to protect it from dust contamination. Diarrhæa being a dirt disease, it is absolutely necessary that the home should be kept free from dust and dirt, and the rooms properly lighted and ventilated. All refuse should, as far as possible, be burned, or if that cannot be done it should be kept in a well covered bin in the yard, and the bin emptied regularly. All articles of food, especially in hot weather, should be sound when purchased, and anything the least offensive should not be eaten. All water if not taken from the main supply pipe should be boiled before it is drunk, and the cistern in which it is stored kept cleansed and well covered. G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. TYPHUS FEVER. No death has occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 191, as against 83, 164, and 161 for the three preceding years. The two wards most affected were those of St. Michael and St. George. 41 These two wards have a bad reputation in regard to excessive infantile mortality, especially from the zymotic diseases. They head the list in Measles, Whooping Cough and Diarrhæa. As I have so often pointed out in my annual report much of the mortality from these three diseases arises from the ignorance, carelessness, and dirty habits of the inhabitants of those wards. Printed instructions have as usual been distributed throughout the Borough as to the feeding of infants, the management of cases of Measles and Whooping Cough and various other matters. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.92. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1895 198 1900 116 1896 192 1901 161 1897 184 1902 164 1898 145 1903 83 1899 171 1904 191 WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 118, as against 68, 114 and 98 for the three preceding years. The wards of St. George, St. Michael, and All Saints, in the order named, head the list of mortality. The annual rate per 1,000 living was 0.57. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1895 122 1900 120 1896 140 1901 98 1897 126 1902 114 1898 93 1903 68 1899 146 1904 118 SMALL-POX. During the year 1904, 28 cases of Small-pox were notified. There was one death in a male, aged 62 years, an inmate of Christchurch Workhouse. There was no particular interest in connection with any of the cases. The disease showed no disposition to spread beyond the house in which the case occurred. All contacts were immediately vaccinated and when disinfection was completed were allowed to resume their ordinary work.

The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 2.36. Deaths from Phthisis during the last Ten Years:— 1895 533 1900 571 1896 490 1901 516 1897 520 1902 550 1898 565 1903 496 1899 621 1904 489 The voluntary notification of Phthisis was adopted in this Borough in November, 1902. The notifications for the year 1904 were 323, and for 1903 207. During the whole time this voluntary notification of Phthisis has been in vogue everything in connection with it has worked smoothly. No complaints have been received from either the patient, or the friends, or the medical man in attendance of undue interference on the part of the officers engaged in this work. The weekly disinfection of the rooms and the periodic steaming of the bedding have been continued as in former years. With the experience gained by this voluntary notification one is forced to admit that, although beneficial, it falls far short of what is required in order to accurately estimate the amount of the disease in the district for the application of a remedy. This can only be obtained by adding it to the list of notifiable diseases. The public, if not quite ready for this at the present time, are fast approaching to the condition of mind of thinking this compulsory notification as necessary. All the steps taken in the ordinary official management of the cases have been continued as usual in the year under consideration. 45 TABLE 20.

In the autumn of the year under consideration the excessive deathrate from Summer Diarrhæa and allied intestinal complaints induced the Public Health Committee to appoint a sub-committee to consider the whole question of infantile mortality, and the steps that could be taken either by the establishment of creches, or municipal milk depots, the issuing of more literature on the subject, or any other means to control or lessen it. The following report was made to the sub-committee. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The energetic steps that are now being taken in different parts of the country to check the enormous mortality of children under one year of age, together with the evidence recently given before the Committee on Physical Deterioration, have quickened the conscience of the nation to a condition of affairs calling for the closest inquiry and attention. The tables appended to this report clearly show a vast waste of life in the tender and very early months of infancy. It may be said that the statistics prepared by Dr. Tatham at the Registrar General's Office, prove that we are in no worse position in regard to this matter of Infant mortality than we were thirty years ago. That may be so, but it is no great consolation to think that if we have not gone back, we have certainly made but little progress in a period when the improvement in all other sanitary matters has been so pronounced. The period in which the greatest infant mortality occurs is the third quarter of the year, that is during the hottest months. The past summer which has been comparatively hot and dry shows that "weather" exercises an immense influence on this mortality. This is in accordance with our experience for many years past, for in the years and decades when the temperature was high and the weather dry a high death rate has been present, whilst with a low temperature and wet weather there has been a low death rate. The deaths in infants which had rarely been more than 40 for the fortnight, for the first six months of this year, as seen in my report to the Council, rose during the three fortnights of the latter part of July and the whole of August to 79, 123, and 59 respectively. The same excessive mortality occurred in the other London boroughs and in the rest of the country. In Table 25 of the Registrar General's Annual Report is given the following decennial figures for England and Wales, covering the whole period of registration. 47 England and Wales. Period. Mean annual infantile death rate. Period. Mean annual infantile death rate. 1838-42 152 1871-80 149 1842-50 154 1881-90 142 1851-60 154 1891-1900 154 1861-70 154 This return shows that the infantile death-rate has been slightly less during the last thirty years than in a similar period immediately preceding. It might also be said that the period covered by the report has been marked by the employment to a much larger extent than formerly of persons in factories, and the disposition of more of the country people to flock to large towns. All these conditions have to be duly considered. The death-rate for England and Wales which has fallen from 23.3 per 1,000 in 1846-50 to 17.7 in 1896-1900, points to the great improvement that must have taken place in the health conditions under which the people have lived. Although at the present moment many grievous defects still exist in the social machine, we are bound to acknowledge that the food of the people is better than it was in the middle of the last century. The sanitary conditions and the cleanliness of the people generally have also improved. The birth-rate which was 32.6 in 1841-50 had declined to 28.8 in 1898-1902. This decreasing birth-rate does not tend to lower the infant rate. It acts all the other way. The families of the lower classes in our borough are just as large as ever they were, the restriction occurs in the healthy lower middle class, many of which are fully able to support and bring up large families, but at the same time are unwilling to exercise the selfdenial that is necessary to do so. It regard to Southwark specially, the accompanying statistics show that our borough, if not the worst in the metropolitan death and infant rates, is generally among the three placed at the bottom of the scale. The wards that are particularly bad in their infant rate are St. George, St. Michael, St. John, and All Saints'. I have prepared tables of birth and death rates for London, and the several Metropolitan Vestries and Boroughs covering a period of ten years 1893-1902. I have also submitted tables of infant mortality for England and Wales, London and the various vestries and boroughs together with many of the chief large towns of England. A glance at these tables will at once make apparent the importance of this subject of Infant Mortality. 48 Tables 30 and 31 show the great excess of infant deaths among illegitimate children and especially those in large towns. One third of the total infant deaths (legitimate and illegitimate) occur under one month of age, and more than 65 per cent. of these die within the first week of life. It is therefore seen what an enormous mortality there is in newly born infants. London. In Males 1 in every 6.6 legitimate births die under one year. „ Females 1 „ 8.5 ,, „ „ „ Males 1 ,, 3.4 illegitimate „ ,, ,, Females 1 ,, 3.7 ,, ,, Rural.

In Males and Females 1 in every 6.0 legitimate and illegitimate births die under one year. The table which Dr. Tatham has prepared of the causes of death of infants during two periods, 1873-1877, and 1898-1902, is highly interesting and instructive. It will be seen that in the period taken the total infant deaths have not materially diminished, yet under the individual heads considerable changes have taken place. The deaths from the usual fevers, with the exception of Measles, have declined. There has been an increase in Pneumonia, which is coincident with an increase of that disease in the general population. The most marked feature of the table is the large increase in diarrhœal diseases (including gastro-enteritis and enteritis) in premature birth and in congenital malformations. These latter two diseases pointing to a falling off in the physical condition of mothers The large increase of deaths under the head of Diarrhæa is far too large to be materially explained away by any suggestion that many of the deaths formerly returned as Convulsions and Atrophy are now and have been for some time past certified as Diarrhæa. Diarrhæa in infants is dependent on morbid causes, frequently the consequence of inflammation brought about by the direct irritation of the intestinal mucous membrane by improper feeding. The gross ignorance that prevails among mothers, especially of the poorer classes, as to the 49 proper feeding and bringing up of a baby, causes much infant suffering, and if not premature death, serious and often permanent enfeeblement. Death in such cases is usually the result of Gastro-Enteritis, or even starvation. The enormous and sudden increase in Infant Diarrhæa at the approach of hot summer weather points strongly to an infectious origin. This increase generally coincides with an elevation of the earth's temperature. It is rare to see Diarrhæa assuming an epidemic form in rural districts or outside of large towns. Milk is undoubtedly the chief medium by which the germs find their way into the alimentary canal. The absence of Diarrhæa in some of the rapidly fatal cases strongly confirms the septic nature of the disease. To prevent this infantile diarrhæa, mothers should, where possible, be induced to suckle the baby When this is impossible, as it is in certain cases, humanized cow's milk in bottle, and sterilised, should be given, as ordinary milk in liable to decompose, especially in hot weather and when little attention is given to the proper cleansing of the vessel in which it is stored and to the feeding bottle. Particular care should be given to the keeping clean of the cowsheds, and to strict cleanliness in the milking operations, especially during hot weather, the cooling of the milk before transit by rail, the proper storage of the milk at the place of distribution and at the home, the distribution of sterilised (humanised) milk, the issue to mothers of instructions how to feed and bring up the baby, the visiting of the home by lady visitors, and to the general attention to the sanitary state of the home and surroundings. The statistics appended to this report clearly demonstrate the extent of the waste that is going on under the head of infant mortality. The causes tending to this grave condition are: (a) hereditary taint, (b) employment of mothers late in pregnancy and too soon after childbirth, (c) decrease in breast feeding, (d) defective milk supply, (e) parental ignorance and neglect, (f) the drink habit in the parents, (g) overlaying of infants, (h) overcrowding in the dwelling, (i) insanitary conditions The general remedies are the better housing, better feeding and the moral and intellectual elevation of the masses. To attain these desirable objects Milk Depots and Creches should be established for the proper feeding and care of infants. Leaflets should be widely distributed giving instructions to mothers, who cannot suckle 50 their children, on the way to feed them. The providing of means of amusement in order to counteract the attraction of the public house, the restriction of grocers' licences for the sale of wine and spirits, the energetic enforcement of the provisions of the Pood and Drugs Act, a crusade against the increase in the drink habit among women, the prevention of overcrowding, and the removal of all insanitary conditions in the district. Improper feeding of Infants. The ordinary artificial foods are not suitable for the feeding of young infants. They are deficient in the proper quantity of fat and do not possess the anti-scorbutic quality found in ordinary milk. In selecting a substitute for the mother's milk, the cheapest and best is sweet and fresh cow's milk diluted with water, and strengthened by the addition of a small quantity of cream and sugar. It is, however, almost impossible in a large town to procure and keep ordinary milk sweet and fresh for the baby's use. In warm weather, especially, it rapidly turns sour and becomes when administered a veritable poison to the infant. The souring of milk in hot weather can be prevented by sterilising it whilst sweet and sound, and supplying it in stoppered bottles. Each bottle should contain one " feed," and should not be opened until immediately before it is given to the baby. At Infant Milk Depots supplying this sterilised milk 63 bottles are supplied each week at a cost of 1/6. The daily supply of nine bottles is given out each morning. The first depot for the supply of this sterilised milk for infants was originated by Dr. Leon Dufour of Fecamp, in 1894. Afterwards similar places were opened in Paris and other French towns. The first depot in England was started at St. Helen's followed by others at Liverpool, Ashton-under-Lyne, Dukinfield, Leith, Bradford, Leeds, Sheffield, Battersea and other towns. Lambeth is on the point of organising a milk depot in the crowded part of its borough. Dr. McCleary has described the working of the Battersea Depot. He says: "The method of working an Infants' Milk Depot varies to some extent in these towns. The method employed in the Battersea Depot is as follows:- The milk is supplied by a local dairyman and arrives in the early morning. It is guaranteed free from chemical preservatives, and to contain not less than 3.25 per cent. butter fat. The first process is the modification or humanization. Three modifications are employed. The first contains two parts water to one of milk, seven ounces of cream and seven of lactose being added to each gallon of the mixture. This modification is given to infants under three months old. The second 51 modification, which is given to infants between three and six months old, consists of equal parts of milk and water, with five ounces of cream and lactose added per gallon. The third consists of two parts milk to one of water, with three ounces of cream and lactose added per gallon, and is given to infants over six months old. The milk having been modified, it is bottled, and the number of bottles and the quantities contained are set out below:- No. Age. No. of Bottles per day. Amount per Bottle. Amount per day. 1 Below 2 weeks old 9 1½ oZ 13½ oz. 2 Between 2 weeks and 2 months old 9 2 ½oz. 22½ oz. 3”2 and 3 months old 8 3 oz. 24 oz. 4”3and4 „ 7 4 oz. 28 oz. 5 ”4and5 „ „ 7 4½ oz. 31½ oz. 6”5 and 6 „ 7 5 oz. 35 oz. 7 „ 6 and 8 ,, ,, 6 6 oz. 36 oz. 8 „ 8 and 12 „ „ 6 7 oz. 42 oz. After bottling, the stoppers are closed and the bottled milk is heated by steam and kept at a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit for from 5 to 10 minutes. It is allowed to cool, and is then supplied to the consumers. Each mother on first coming to the depot is given a leaflet of instructions as to the proper method of using the milk. The method is very simple ; when feeding time arrives, all She has to do is to place the bottle, unopened, in some warm water till the milk has reached body temperature. The bottle is then opened, a small teat put on the mouth, and the baby takes its milk from the sterilised bottle direct. The use of the long tube feeding-bottle is obviated.018” It is necessary that the depot should be under medical supervision. A small shop should be rented with a shed behind to be converted into a room to contain the steriliser and the engine. There must be a yard. The rooms required would be the shop for distribution, the scullery and kitchen fitted with a bottle washing tank and brushes. Here the empty bottles could be stored. In the shed above-mentioned the bottling and sterilising of the milk would take place. In one of the best managed depots a manageress and an assistant are only employed at a salary of £30 each with free quarters over the shop. The cost of the appliances requisite to start a milk depot on a moderate scale would be about £150. Further capital expenditure would depend upon the required alterations in the house. The total expenditure should not exceed £350. The annual expenditure will depend upon the 52 amount paid for rent, rates and taxes. In connection with many depots there are branches where the milk is delivered for sale on a commission of 5 per cent. This plan is said to work very well in certain towns. The delivery of the milk to the branch agents is made by a small milk dealer at a cost of 15/- a week. It is well known that Battersea Borough Council incurred the responsibility and started a milk depot which has been attended by the very best results. It is up to the present almost impossible to say what will ultimately be the effect on the infant mortality of that borough, but the outlook is exceedingly promising in that respect. Battersea so far has been surcharged the small annual deficit arising on the undertaking, but this has always been remitted by the Local Government Board. In the event of the Council not wishing to run the risk of any surcharge, I think it is possible, if the Council will become patrons of the scheme, to institute and carry it on without any cost to the Council. I feel strongly that the time has arrived for some action being taken to check this grave state of affairs, and rather than see the abandonment of this milk depot scheme, I am prepared to plead the absolute necessity of something of that kind in this district of Southwark before the charitable public. In my last annual report to the Council 1 have referred to the difficulty experienced by us in finding out where the infants are born, in order that instructions might be sent on the subject of the feeding of the baby and other matters. The extract is as follows:- Infant Mortality. "The Sanitary Authority at the present time holds pretty much the same position in relation to Infantile Mortality, as it did to infectious disease before the Notification Act came into force." " The supervision of infant life cannot be exercised officially unless information is given to the Authority of the locality of the births. At least it cannot be satisfactorily done except by the expenditure of more force than is likely to be allotted to it. Application has been made to the Registrar General, and to various other officials to allow the local registrars to furnish to the medical officer of health this information, but unfortunately without any good result. I believe the answer of the Registrar General to the request is, that in giving this information he would find it difficult to obtain the registration of many of the illegitimate births. This is similar to the stock argument before the notification of infectious disease was adopted. It has since been abundantly falsified, as no one has ever objected to notification of infectious disease, and I feel 53 satisfied no objection would be made to the locality of the births being supplied to the Medical Officer of Health. The Registrar General has advised the petitioning of the Local Government Board in regard to this matter." Deaths of Infants from " Overlaying." Number of deaths in England and Wales from this cause during the last ten years was 15,009. In the year 1900 the deaths in the same were 1,774. In London the deaths from " overlaying " in 1900 were 615. „ „ „ „ in 1901 „ 511. ,, „ „ ,, in 1902 „ 588. The poorer districts are those most affected. Drink is the chief cause, the mothers being the offenders. In countries where the mothers are sober this cause of death is unknown. Note.- Since this report was written the locality of the births has been supplied to Medical Officers of Health. G. B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health.

The object is (1) The better provision of the means of disinfecting bedding and articles of clothing after dangerous infectious disease, under Sections 59, 60 and 61 of the Public Health (London) Act of 1891. (2) The carrying out of the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act of 1897 and (3) The carrying out of the Sections 24 to 26 of the L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1904, relating to the cleansing and purifying of filthy and verminous rooms and contents. The present means of disinfection is inadequate to properly carry out the provisions of Section 60 Sub-section 5 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It is not only inadequate, but at times very costly, when both stations are in use as they frequently are at the present time. With our present mode of disinfection serious injury is being done to the bedding and clothing submitted to us for disinfection. The stains which could easily be removed from the articles by washing before the articles were placed in the chamber, become permanently fixed and cannot be removed by any subsequent washing. This permanent injury to clothing and bedding is a very serious matter to the poor people of our district. We do compensate persons for this damage from time to time, but hardly one in a hundred makes any complaint. The necessity of a laundry in connection with disinfecting stations is now generally acknowledged. Of course it would be impossible to provide anything of the kind at Manor Place, as there is no room for anything of the kind there. With regard to the cleansing of persons which is a duty placed upon the local authority, we have discouraged as far as possible persons applying to us, as we have not the means for carrying out the purposes of the Act. When it is impossible to avoid disinfecting and cleansing a verminous person and his clothes, we have been compelled to use the Reception House in which to treat him. In many of the boroughs, rooms, both for males and females have been provided for these persons, and many hundreds have availed themselves of the provision. In a district such as ours there is a great want of such accommodation. Since the cleansing and purifying of filthy and verminous rooms have been placed upon the Council by the L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, the school authorities in particular have forwarded many cases that have had to be dealt with, besides those we are daily finding out ourselves. The Council can hardly be aware that we have no accommodation for the officers, who are employed in the stripping of rooms and in the other processes of disinfection, bathing and cleansing themselves before going home. As a protection to outside people with whom they come into contact this is obviously on economic grounds very much needed. 75 TABLE 36 MORTUARIES.

The Council resolved on the 27th April, 1904, that the Medical Officer of Health should be empowered to grant certificates every three months to the occupiers of the Eating Houses and places where food was prepared for sale, to the effect that the premises were in a cleanly and satisfactory condition, when such was the case. It is considered that such a certificate will be a great incentive to the occupiers keeping the premises in a highly creditable state. The form of certificate that is being used is as follows:— "Certificate for the three Months ending BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Medical Officer of Health's Report as to the structural condition and cleanly state of Bakehouses, Eating Houses, and other places where food is prepared. I certify that on was visited and found to be in a clean and good structural state. Dated Mcdical Officer of Health. The Council of the Borough have directed that a three monthly report of the condition of all places where food is prepared shall be made."

I have to submit a report on the condition of the stables of the Borough, and as to the desirability of the registration of them. There are 521 stables in the Borough in which are accommodated 7,152 horses. The largest number is found in St. Mary's Ward, whilst the smallest number is in St. George's Ward. With regard to the number of horses accommodated in each ward, the number in Trinity far exceeds that of any other ward, the smallest number being in St. Peter's Ward. This small number in St. Peter's Ward is partly accounted for at the present time by the extensive rebuilding that is now going on on the Clandon Estate. The litter that is used is peat in 73 stables, straw in 373, and wood chips in 75 The method of storage is in a waggon in 31, a brick receptacle in 244, a cage in 87, and in 159 there is no receptacle. The condition of the receptacle was good in 287 cases, fair in 50, and bad in 25. With regard to the frequency of removal, 176 had the manure removed every day, 195 every two days, 93 every three days, and 57 once a week. The condition of the manure was not foul smelling in 501, 97 and foul smelling in 20. 503 stables were properly paved and drained, while 18 were not drained. The ventilation was good in 520 stables and only bad in one. In 362 stables watercloset accommodation is provided for the workmen, whilst 159 stables, where no men are employed, had no such accommodation. 1094 men are employed in connection with the stables. The stable accommodation necessary for the comfort of a horse in well-appointed stables is 100 square feet of floor space. Many of the stables in the Borough, among which are those belonging to the Borough Council, Messrs. Tarn & Co., and other firms employing a large number of horses, are found to have this 100 square feet. The greatest transgressors in regard to restricted accommodation are, speaking generally, the omnibus and cab proprietors, the stables of whom have rarely more than between 50 and 60 square feet of floor space for each horse. The number of stables affording less than 50 square feet per horse is 22, 30 stables have between 50 and 60 feet, 71 stables between 60 and 70 feet, 62 between 70 and 80 feet, 46 between 80 and 90 feet, 58 between 90 and 100 feet, whilst 232 stables have accommodation of over 100 square feet per horse. With this splendid accommodation for the large portion of horses in the Borough, both in the way of floor space, the good structural condition of the stables, the ventilation, the watercloset accommodation for the work people, and the attention paid to the removal of manure, I hardly think it is necessary to proceed with any recommendation for the registration of the stables in the Borough. 98 99 table 44.

On September 30th, 1903, I reported on the necessity of more attention being paid to food stuffs when imported into the Borough. With that object I advised the Public Health Committee to recommend the Council to appoint two sanitary inspectors having special food qualifications to undertake the supervision of all food landed at the various wharves, together with the general examination of all articles of food stored or exposed for sale throughout the whole of the Borough. In advising the appointment of two sanitary inspectors, whose whole time should be devoted to this work, I had no intention of casting the least reflection on the officers who now perform this work in the various wards. I believe that all the inspectors do their best in this matter but the detection of unsound food in my opinion is such a special and intricate affair that it requires the whole care and attention of an officer, and is not likely to be well done by an officer engaged in remedying ordinary nuisances, and in carrying out the multifarious duties devolving upon the general inspector. The Public Health Committee did not support my suggestion to increase the staff of inspectors, but agreed to divide the two wards of Christchurch and St. Saviour by a line running down the middle of Southwark Street and Stamford Street, giving to one inspector all the portion to the north of that line, including the streets, warehouses and wharves on the river bank, whilst to the other inspector the inland streets on the south side of the line were allotted. This division of work has been in operation during the year, but in my opinion the supervision of the landing and the examination of food stuffs in the warehouses require the entire services of one inspector who ought not to be required, as at present, to devote a portion of his time to ordinary house inspection. The inspection of food in the other parts of the Borough is left to the ordinary inspector, and naturally with very poor results. Police Court Proceedings in regard to Unsound Food. Proceedings have been taken during the year 1904 in relation to the following seizures of unsound food:— Leo Search, 142, Camberwell Road, exposing for sale upon a stall in Westmoreland Road a quantity of unsound beef: fined £1 and 2s. costs. Charles Levy, exposing for sale at 188, Borough High Street a quantity of unsound pears: summons dismissed, the magistrate remarking that "pears so soon go bad." Herbert Speechley. exposing for sale at 181, Borough High Street, four unsound geese : fined £4 and 2s. costs. Frederick Challis, exposing for sale at 1, Westmoreland Boad, two unsound rabbits : fined £5 and 2s. costs. Thomas Hornsby, exposing for sale in the Borough Market, three baskets unsound plums: fined £4 and 2s. costs. 106 TABLE 48 Inspections of Food at Wharves.
