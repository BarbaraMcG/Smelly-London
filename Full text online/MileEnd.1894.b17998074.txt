ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE PUBLIC HEALTH, AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1894, BY THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. London: printed by e. s. wheatley, 176, mile end road, E, 1895. THE THIRTY-NINTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1894. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old. Town. Gentlemen, The year 1894 having closed it now becomes my duty as your Medical Officer of Health to issue an Annual Report of the health of the Hamlet for this period, in accordance with the order of the Local Government Board under which I hold my appointment. For the information of the many new members of the Board I may mention that I have had the honour of presenting to the Vestry eight previous Annual Reports. In drawing out an official statement of this kind it is of the greatest possible moment that the statistics of population, by which all deductions are made, should be as accurate as possible; I find that in a number of Reports previous to the last census the population of Mile End was much over-estimated. That the population of our Hamlet has increased by leaps and bounds it is only necessary to refer to the figures of the five last census which were as follows: 1861—73,064; 1871—93,146; 1881—105,573; 1891—107,565; it will be seen by this data that during the last ten years the increase was not so great as any ten years previous a result no doubt due to the fact that the whole area of our district has now been built over. The population for the middle of the year 1894 is estimated as 108,242 this calculation is arrived at by logarithims, a very accurate method during intercensal periods, and on these figures the Rates of Mortality are based in the ensuing pages. 4 BIRTH AND DEATH-RATE. The Births registered during the fifty-two weeks of the registration year were 4,022; giving a Birth-rate of 39·5 per 1000. Table showing Birth and Birth-rate for the last ten years:— Years. Birth. Birth-rate. 1885 4010 35·9 1886 4028 35·9 1887 4034 35·6 1888 3954 34·0 1889 3964 34·0 1890 4006 35·1 1891 4109 38·2 1892 4035 38·2 1893 4186 38·2 1894 4022 37·5 It will be seen by the above table that the Births in our district are as nearly as possible the same in this year as they have been in any one year for the last ten years and this is nearly double the death-rate. DEATH AND DEATH-RATE. The number of Deaths that occurred during the past year was 2,282, giving a death-rate of 21·1 per 1,000 per annum, that of the Metropolis being 17.4 for the same period, whilst that of the Eastern District was 21·8; the Deaths included in this number are those that have taken place in Public Institutions such as Hospitals, Asylums, in various parts of the Metropolis outside our district but who belong to the Hamlet, the number of these were during the year 413. On reference to the tables of Mortality it will be seen that the Deaths which took place from zymotic diseases were slightly higher this year, and is accounted for by the increase in the number of cases of Measles that were fatal, last year the death-rate was 0.3 per 1,000 whilst this year it is 1.4 per 1,000 from this disease. I have compiled Table on page 5 on the same basis as the one introduced into my last year's Report, with this addition, that I have been enabled to give the results for four years, which is more valuable that an isolated year; this Table it will be clear to all of you is for the purpose of comparing the mortality in this district with that of London, and also with that of the neighbouring parishes whose class of population and the conditions under which they live are somewhat similar to Mile End. It will be thus seen that the Infant Mortality of the Hamlet compares very favourably with London as a whole and also with the adjoining districts. RETURN AS REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD.

During the year we have had forty-two cases of this disease notified, these all occurred between January and June and seemed to be a continuation of the slight epidemic that was more or less with us throughout 1893. It is singular that there were only seven cases under twelve years of age, whilst a large per centage were over twenty years, all the cases but six were removed to the Hospital Ships. They occurred as follows: 4 in January, 3 in February, 4 in March, 7 in April, 14 in May, and 10 in June. Three of the cases in January occurred in the EastWard, and were traced as taking the infection from others that took place in this locality in December of last year. All the other cases were located in various parts of the district, every possible enquiry was made in each case as to origin of contagion, and measures were adopted to prevent the spread of the disease. Three cases occurred in one house, and two of them were tailoresses going out to work, notice was at once given to the employers, and especial enquiry from time to time was made to see if others from this establishment contracted the disease, but no other cases occurred. The lodging house, Mile End Road, was responsible for five cases, the bedding and rooms were disinfected and the latter closed for one month; the police, who at that time had these places under their regulations, co-operated with us to prevent the spread of the disease. One of the above cases I found sitting on my door step with the Small Pox rash well developed, this occurred soon after the outbreak at the before-mentioned establishment, he complained to me that he could not gain readmission owing to his being unwell, I promptly conveyed him to our Shelter in Globe Road, for a few hours whilst the ambulance was procured. I may here mention that this Shelter was of great use to us during this epidemic, several families were removed there whilst their houses were properly disinfected. With regard to vaccination it was extremely difficult to find out if the adults had been vaccinated, in the seven cases under twelve, three of them were unvaccinated, whilst four were believed to be vaccinated. The disease was in almost all the cases of a mild type and only caused death in four instances, all of which were unvaccinated. SCARLET FEVER. The number of cases of this disease notified during the last twelve months was 578, about half the number notified in 1893. The epidemic was present during the whole of the year and spread over the whole of London, the Northern districts being most severely attacked; at one period the pressure became so great on the Fever Hospitals that a number of cases which would otherwise have been removed had to be treated at their homes, happily this was only for a short time. The disease in our district was of a very mild type, and was so evenly spread over the whole of the Hamlet that it was found impossible to trace it to any definite source, although the fact of the mildness of the 9 disease always facilitates the means of spreading the infection, as parents become much more careless in allowing the children that are well to mix with the sick; no doubt the congregation of large numbers of children in schools is one of the greatest factors in disseminating the disease. During the year my attention has frequently been called to children "peeling" whilst attending, school; it is scarcely necessary for me to add that in such cases prompt measures were taken to secure isolation. In the case of infectious diseases occurring amongst children who are attending public schools, in this district I am glad to say, we get the most cordial co-operation of the school teachers, in preventing the spread of the disease, and to this end we have lately adopted a plan by which the school teachers are informed when disinfection has been carried out by us, in order that the children living in the infected houses may again resume their studies DIPHTHERIA. Diphtheria occupies a notable position amongst zymotic diseases, and it is a fact that it shows a tendency to increase its ravages in spite of advances in sanitation. There is no epidemic disease as to its origin about which there has been so much speculation, we are aware that during the last five years it has made rapid progress in densely populated towns, especially in every district of the Metropolis. It has been sought to be shown by some from the fact that a larger proportion of new streets, courts, etc. being paved than formerly, that the ground air is more readily drawn into the houses and so helps to cause this disease, by others it is supposed to be due to faulty drainage, polluted water, and various other theories have been put forward, but up to the present no satisfactory cause has been discovered; we know that bad sanitary conditions are favourable for its spread, and that the condition of school life is largely the cause of its propagation; its greatest victims are between the age of three and ten, and no doubt many children who although able at the time to attend school have already the disease upon them and so contaminate others; if we are at present somewhat in the dark as to its cause, we are now able to say that the disease is one of a fungoid nature and that the bacillus has been identified; as to its treatment, it is believed that we are on the eve of a discovery, or I should say confirming the discovery of Professor Behring of Berlin, who has found that the inocculation of "antitoxin" into patients suffering from Diphtheria is a specific for the cure of the disease. The College of Surgeons have given a large amount of money and the Asylum Board authorities have placed their Hospitals at the di posal of the investigators, and before long we shall know the results, which judging by what we hear up to the present time will probably be regarded as one of the greatest discoveries of the age. In this district we had 325 cases notified during the year, of which 82 died, 101 of the cases were treated in Hospitals. Enquiries were set on foot as to the sanitary condition of the homes of these patients, and the drains were tested in 263 instances, in 10 87 of these they were found to be defective. Enquiries were also made as to the schools that the children (if any) in the house attended, and the school authorities notified; we were not able in any of the cases to trace them to this source of propagation. The disease was not confined to any one particular portion of the district, but spread over the Hamlet, the Charts will show the cases as they were notified to us week by week. SANITARY WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE YEAR. During the last two-and-a-half years we have been engaged in carrying out a thorough house to house inspection, which is the only real manner in becoming thoroughly cognisant of the condition of any particular district. This work will be seen to be of vital importance to the health of the Hamlet. It is not the first inspections which take such a large portion of the officer's time as the constant reinspection which is necessary in order to ensure the work being carried out in a proper manner after the Vestry notices have been served, this work, however, has been most diligently carried out by the Inspectors, who have the welfare of the Hamlet at heart, and I must add have used great discretion and tact in order to get the Hamlet into its present condition. A large amount of time has been spent by them in having drainage works carried out on the most modern principals, by constantly superintending the same and testing when completed; although this method of carrying out the work is more costly in the first instance to the owner, yet it is of such a permanent character that the result more than repays the essential outlay; the old manner of botching drainage work has almost died out, and well for the householder it has. From the table appended will be seen in detail the work accomplished, and also the proceedings that were found necessary to be taken against those persons who neglected to carry out the orders of the Vestry. I may here say for the information of the new members the orders which are recommended by the Sanitary Committee and appear on the Agenda at each meeting, represent but a very small proportion of the houses inspected, as under the Public Health Act when a house has been inspected, whatever requires to be done, the owner is made acquainted with by means of a written intimation detailing the nuisance found to exist, this in the majority of cases is sufficient to get the nuisance abated; if on reinspection nothing is done, the matter is brought before the Board and dealt with by them. It will thus be seen that every latitude is given to property owners before extreme measures are taken. In some cases, I regret to say, it has been found necessary to take proceedings, and in every instance the Magistrate made the necessary orders for the works to be carried out. I must not omit to state that the number of complaints received during the past year from householders was less than in previous years, numbering 597, each complaint was the subject of a special enquiry, and on investigation it was found that only 490 of these had any connection with my department.

Hitherto there has been a great lack of uniformity in the laying of house drains; over and over again the Inspectors experiencd great difficulties in getting the work carried out as they would wish, this was pointed out to the Sanitary Committee, who went into the matter, with the result that Regulations were formulated and adopted by the Vestry; they are modelled on the lines of the Bye-laws of the County Council, and contain all the latest and best known methods of laying and amending drainage work; they also provide that all drainage work, except where new connections are made to the sewer, shall be supervised by the Sanitary Officers. From the table of the work carried out by Inspectors it will be seen that a large amount of this work has been accomplished, all new drains that are put in under the Inspectors' direction, are inspected and tested whenever possible with the water test before being covered in; and in connection with this matter I may also state that we have now Ordinance Maps, on which all new drains are set out, showing their exact position, etc. This constitutes a valuable record and one that will ultimately prove exceedingly useful to my department, and also to property owners throughout the Hamlet. In my Report of last year I devoted considerable space to the Ventilation of Sewers, and also to the efficient Trapping of Gullies. The former has been engaging the attention of experts both in the provinces and in London, and it is to be hoped some efficient means will be found to carry out this necessary matter in the near future. With regard to the latter subject it is entirely in the hands of the Vestry. Last year some few gullies having a proper water seal were laid down to try their efficiency, as far I know they have been found to act well, it is very desirable that the Vestry should increase their number and gradually replace the ones now in use, which have been found to allow sewer gas to escape into the streets, and as many can testify during last summer were very obnoxious to the passenger traffic; as my department is responsible for the health of the district, it is my duty to point out to the Vestry this evil, which is intensified in the warmer weather, especially in narrow streets where sewer gas is directly blown into the houses. SEIZRE OF UNSOUND FOOD. It is some years since an important seizure of unsound food was made in the district, although the Inspectors and myself are constrntly on the alert. On February 6, acting on information that damaged Melons were being sold on Mile End Waste 19 to children, I immediately went and found a man selling off a cart Melons at one penny each. I examined a number that had been sold, and after satisfying myself they were unfit for human food, I seized the whole cart load, 24 cases, each case containing 12 Melons, and had them conveyed to the Thames Police Court, where they were all condemned by the Magistrate. I reported the matter to the Vestry, who ordered a summons to be taken out against the seller, this having been done he was subsequently fined 20/- and 2/- costs. In November, acting on information the Inspectors and myself proceeded to a house in Old Church Road, where some unsound food was suspected of being secreted. I demanded admission, which was refused, observation was kept on the premises by one of the Inspectors whilst a Magistrate's warrant to enter the premises was applied for and granted, we then found 140 tins of Preserved Pineapple, 100 tins of Condensed Milk, 12 tins of Tomatoes, and 18 tins of soup, these were all seized and conveyed to the Police Court, then they were condemned as being unfit for human food, the matter was reported to the Vestry and a prosecution ordered to be taken, this was done and after a number of adjournments the Owner was fined £5, and the Wholesale Seller of the Condensed Milk was fined £20. WORKSHOPS. The inspection of Workshops in our district has been carried out in the same manner as it was last year, it will be remembered that in my last Report I gave a detailed statement showing the location of each Workshop and date of the inspection and the result of such inspection. I am glad to say that they are all now in a very fair sanitary condition, and the occupiers show their desire to conform to the law both as regards general cleanliness of the premises and also in not allowing overcrowding to take place, it has only been necessary to take proceedings in one instance, with the result that the occupier was ordered to abate the overcrowding and fined £2 and costs. During the past year a number of new Workshops have been built and are now added to our register, whilst several which consisted of one room only and termed domestic Workshops have been abolished. The majority of the Workshops are situated in the West Ward their principal trade being tailors and slipper makers. Dr. Hamer in his report on the sanitary condition and administration of Mile End Old Town in reference to the Workshops says " The great improvement which has been carried out in these places cannot fail to have most important and far-reaching influences," and referring to the provision of separate w.c. accommodation for persons of the two sexes states " that the law relating to this matter is now systematically enforced." 20 BAKEHOUSES. The subject of the sanitary condition of the London Bakehouses has come prominently before the public during the past year; it was mentioned in Parliament and the matter was referred to the Local Government Board who issued a circular to the various Sanitary Authorities, calling their attention to their obligations under the Public Health Act, 1891, with reference to the frequent inspection of these places in their particular districts, and desiring that they should cause the Acts relating to Bakehouses to be enforced. The attention of the County Council was called to the subject and their Medical Officer was instructed to prepare a report on the same, this was done, and the Council after considering it, was of an opinion that the present law should be amended so as to make it compulsory for all Bakehouses to be licensed annually by the Council. Their can be no doubt that there needs more uniformity in the construction of these necessary buildings and also that in future underground Bakehouses should be prohibited. It is quite evident from what has appeared in the press on this subject that the Local Authorities do not sufficiently exercise the powers bestowed on them by the Legislature ; that the Local Authorities who are at present charged with the enforcement of the Acts relating to Bakehouses are the proper Bodies to deal with them I think there is much to be said in favour of, and if sufficient Inspectors were provided in each district there would be no difficulty. The Public Health Act, 1891, made he Local Authorities responsible for the enforcement of Sanitary conditions of Bakehouses, since that time we have made periodical inspections into all Bakehouses in our district, and this year one could not help being struck with the marked improvement that had taken place; of necessity numerous notices have had to be served, which have been followed by frequent inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors and myself, who I may here say have given valuable assistance to the occupiers as to alterations, etc., in improving both the ventilation and sanitary conditions generally. In the table following will give some idea of the manner in which the work is carried out, of course it does not nearly represent the whole of the inspections made to these premises but sufficient for the purpose intended; recognising how important it is that bread, the main article of food for rich and poor alike, should be made under the most perfect sanitary conditions we have directed our energies to carry out that principle. 21 LIST OF BAKEHOUSES IN THE HAMLET OF MILE END OLD TOWN.

A letter was received from the London County Council on June 7th last, stating they had deputed one of their Medical Officer of Health to enquire into the Sanitary condition of the Hamlet, and asking for the co-operation of the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry; your Sanitary Committee directed a reply to be sent, stating that the Sanitary Officers would be prepared to do so. During the months of July and August the enquiry by Dr. Hamer took place. I may here state at once that every facility was given this Officer by the Sanitary Inspectors and myself to carry on the investigation and in October last a Report was received from the County Council detailing the result of such inspection. It is prefaced by the Senior Medical Officer of Health of the Council (Mr. Murphy), giving a resume of what led to such enquiry ; and it appears to have been determined on solely by reason of the Annual Report of the Jewish Board of Guardians for the year 1893, which, as Mr. Murphy states, raised questions as to the adequacy of the Sanitary Staff of this Hamlet. " En passant I may state that the Report in question, viz. : the Jewish Board, deals exclusively with a very small portion of our district, not a twelfth of the Hamlet, and this twelfth inhabited by Russian and Polish Jews, whose misfortune it is not to have been brought up in a civilized manner, and whose habits are filthy. It will therefore readily be understood, that the condition of this part of the district could not bear as favourable a comparison as that of other parts of the hamlet which is principally occupied by our more fortunate brethern." The first part of the Report of Dr. Hamer reiterates the very interesting facts as set out in the Census Report and appears in my Annual Report for 1892, as to population, tenement, dwellings, etc., and also Mr. Booth's instructive conclusions from his observations on the people and their modes of employment, etc., in his great work published a few years ago. In the second part of the Report, Dr. Hamer deals with " Sanitary Circumstances," beginning first with the water supply, he regards this as satisfactory ; next, taking inspections carried out in 507 houses in Mile End (which inspections were made in houses in various parts of the Hamlet most likely by reason of their ancient structure and closely built courts, etc., to show sanitary defects) he finds that in 32 per cent. of the premises visited there were sanitary defects; a very small per centage indeed, taking into account that many of these were broken closet seats, defective rain water pipes, and other minor things more or less of a trivial character, easily remedied, but which are common to every district in London; and here I should like to quote from Dr. Hamer's Report, he says : " In the Sanitary Committee Report of the Jewish Board of Guardians for 1893, it is stated that the 29 Committee's Inspector visited 298 houses, and as a result found 61 per cent. of the houses visited defective, whilst the corresponding per centage obtained as a result of my inspection was 32 per cent. This discrepency is at first sight startling, especially in view of the close correspondence of our results in the case of Whitechapel, I could not fail to note the very large number of instances in which improvement had been effected in Mile End houses during the last two years." The discrepancy to which Dr. Hamer aludes is not at all to my mind startling, and if Dr. Hamer had followed up the complaints of the Jewish Board as we have done he would have found that a large proportion of the " Sanitary defects " were in many instances not nuisances within the meaning of the Public Health Act, 1891. Speaking of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, Dr. Hamer says, that I have made considerable use of the procedure of this Act, to the great advantage of the district. On inspection of the Bakehouses, he states they were clean and well kept, and the Sanitary laws were enforced. Regarding his inspections of the Workshops, Dr. Hamer states, the great improvement which has been carried out in these places cannot fail to have most important and far reaching influences. Most of the Workshops are as the majority of you are aware, are situated in the West-Ward, which is the district where nine-tenths of the inspections were made by the Jewish Board. Dr. Hamer says about this part of our district—" The great alteration which has been effected in the condition of the West-Ward of Mile End, affords striking testimony to the care with which the method of dealing with these places has been thought out and to the energy and ability with which it has been carried into execution by the Inspectors." In that part of the Report dealing with the Houses let in Lodgings, Dr. Hamer states, that a large per centage of the houses in Mile End are of this class, that is let to members of more than one family, and that if all these are placed under the Bye-laws relating to the same, it would undoubtedly necessitate the increase of the Sanitary Staff. I may here state that we have a large number of these houses under the Bye-laws, and more will be registered as occasion arises for it, but the necessity of doing so to any very large extent does not to my mind seem warranted at the present time. The whole tenor of Dr. Hamer's Report conclusively shows that the Report of the Jewish Board, which led to this enquiry, was grossly misleading and highly coloured ; the fact of an independent report of this kind having been made by such a skilled officer as Dr. Hamer enhances its value, and the favourable conclusions which he arrives at as a result of such inspection, must be a source of considerable satisfaction to the Vestry.

Under this useful Act, it will be seen from the previous tables a number of houses have been placed under its influence, the houses that were dealt with were those that were unfit for human habitation and which could be treated more effectually under this Act than under the Public Health Act; the proceedings were taken under Section 30 which provides as follows:— " It shall be the duty of the Medical Officer of Health " of every district to represent to the Local Authority of " that district any dwelling house which appears to him to " be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be " unfit for human habitation." There are also ample powers under this Act of dealing with small insanitary areas, and I much regret that this has not been taken advantage of up to the present with the area known as Lomas Buildings, in my last year's Report, referring to this area I stated: " I have brought this matter repeatedly before the Sanitary Committee and at the present time details are in course of preparation with a view of a scheme being submitted to the Vestry." In February this year these buildings were surveyed by the Sanitary Committee, and it was resolved " That it be referred to the Surveyor to make the necessary enquiries to report and submit estimate of cost of dealing with Lomas Buildings " under Part II. of the above Act. In April the Surveyor reported that he and the Medical Officer of Health had considered as to the best means of dealing with these buildings and had come to the conclusion that it would be best to acquire the property pure and simple, and gave details as to cost. It was resolved that I should confer with the Medical Officer of the Council upon the subject, I did so and reported to the Committee in May, the result was that a conference was held with the Housing Committee of the Council who subsequently visited the premises with our Sanitary Committee and agreed that it was desirable to demolish the buildings. On the 25th October a letter was sent to the Council stating that if the Council would make an adequate contribution towards the cost, the Committee would recommend the Vestry to deal with this area as suggested. On the 14th November a reply was received stating if plans and estimates were submitted they would consider the matter. The Surveyor has now submitted the necessary plans. I have dealt with this matter at some length in order to acquaint the Vestry the exact position we are now in as regards this area and also the difficulty in carrying a small scheme like this into execution, I can dnly hope that before next year this filthy area may be cleared as in its present condition it is demoralizing to the surrounding inhabitants. I may add that these buildings have been a source of trouble to us for years, every house has been dealt with under the Public Health and other Acts but owing to their structural position and surroundings they constitute an insanitary area and onght to be dealt with as a whole under this Act. 33 MORTUARY. The subject of providing a Mortuary of our own has been a contentious one for many years. I have drawn up a number of Reports urging its necessity but the fact that one existed on the Guardian's premises, and that this body allowed the public to use it was sufficent to shelve the question on numerable occasions when the matter was brought forward. The Public Health Act, 1891, explicitly states that every Sanitary Authority shall fit up and provide a proper place for the reception of dead bodies. In 1893 I brought up a special report on the subject and showed the urgent necessity of its provision by reason of several deaths from infectious diseases having taken place in the hamlet, and no Mortuary being available the bodies had to be kept at their homes. The matter however, was allowed to drift until the County Council made such urgent representations during this year, that the matter was thoroughly gone into and it was decided by the Vestry to build a Mortuary. The question of sites was a much vexed one and finally that in the rear of the Vestry Hall was decided upon; when this fact became known a deputation from the immediate neighbourhood waited upon the Vestry to protest against its location, as they were afraid that it would be prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, they were informed however these fears were groundless, the Vestry therefore adhered to its decision. In company with the Sanitary Committee I visited a number of Mortuaries in various parts of London, and the information acquired was most valuable, and the outcome of these visits resulted in the Mortuary in its present form being built, which I am glad to say it is now nearly completed. I feel sure that it will be a great boon to the inhabitants, especially those who have to serve as jurymen, as by the arrangements made they will be enabled to view the bodies through a glass window, and so will obviate the necessity for entering the chamber of death which so many justly object to. A special room has been constructed for the better holding of Post-mortem examinations, a want much felt by the Medical Practitioners in the Hamlet. Provision is also made for deaths arising from infectious disease a separate well ventilated room being built on the latest modern principles for the purpose. COW-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. It may not be known to many of the present members of the Vestry that the County Council is the Licensing Authority for these buildings. The owners are required to apply annually for the licenses and also to send copies of such application to the Vestry, which has the power to object to any of the licenses being granted where the premises are in an insanitary condition. The County Council Bye-laws having come into operation during this year, the inspection of these buildings was a matter of much importance on account of structural alterations becoming necessary in almost all of them, in order to conform with these Bye-laws; 34 we served a copy on the owner of every Cow-house and Slaughter-house in our district, and on our inspecting them somewhat later we found with two exceptions the necessary alterations carried out. These two cases were reported to the Vestry who authorized objections to be taken at the meeting of the Licensing Committee of the Council, in one case the application was not proceeded with, the license therefore lapsed, in the other instance Mr. Twaits attended in support of the Vestry's objection which was upheld by the Council. I am pleased to say that we found them generally to be kept in a cleanly condition; the practice of keeping numbers of animals in such crowded localities as our own is to be regretted, as however cleanly they are kept, whenever the periodical removal of manure takes place it becomes a source of considerable nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood; with regard to the Slaugliter-houses the same may be said of them and their is no doubt that public abbatoirs such as are in use in Continental cities are much to be preferred. SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The majority of these necessary places have been a long time a standing reproach to the various sanitary districts in and around London, which are at times a nuisance and an annoyance to the pedestrian traffic ; for a number of years the Sanitary Committee of this Vestry have regularly brought forward a proposal to build one or more underground conveniences in various parts of the Hamlet, but the Vestry have always rejected the proposals and so the matter has been shelved; this year however the proposition was again brought up to the Board by the Committee, at about the time when the unemployed agitation was acute, and the Vestry resolved on building one of these places at Mile End Gate; this has proved a wise step for although it has only been in operation a few months it is almost self-supporting and has been the means of sweeping away one of the greatest eyesores in the district. It is to be hoped that before long the Vestry will go thoroughly into this matter and gradually displace the existing above ground urinals. A visit to any of the present urinals say on a Saturday night would convince the most sceptical of the necessity of carrying out this improvement for the public welfare. I have now, gentlemen, given you a general outline of the work that is being carried on in my department ; I must thank the members of the Vestry collectively and individually for the support always given to the Sanitary Officers and myself in carrying out a work which it is our pleasure to be engaged in. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health.
