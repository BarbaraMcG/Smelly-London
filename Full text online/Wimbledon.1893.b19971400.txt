WIM 045 URBAN SANITARY DISTRICT OF WIMBLEDON, COUNTY OF SURREY. Report of the Medical Officer of Health Fop the Year ending December, 31st, 1893. Urban Sanitary District of WIMBLEDON County of Surrey. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH For the Year ending 31st December, 1893. WIMBLEDON: Printed by edwin trim, homefield road, and hill road. Report of the Medical Officer of Health For the Year ending 31st December, 1893. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1893. It is with great satisfaction I have to state that the death-rate remains at a very low figure. There have been 780 births (381 males, 399 females), 363 deaths (163 males, 200 females). This gives a birth-rate of 27'8, and a death-rate of 12 9 per thousand per annum, taking the population at 28,000 (the estimated population to middle of 1893). Influenza caused 20 deaths against 18 last year and 17 in ] 891. There has been no excess in the number of deaths from Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and other diseases of the respiratory system. Scarlet Fever has been epidemic and caused 3 deaths. Table A shows for the last year and the three preceding years the births, deaths, death-rates, and the deaths at certain ages, and from specified causes. Table B shows the differences between the number of cases notified and the deaths from these diseases. Table C shows the death-rates from Zymotic Diseases for the last 8 years. The death-rate from Zymotic Diseases during the year was 2.03 and indicated a higher mortality from these diseases than there has been for any of the years shewn in table C. The number of deaths from Zymotic Diseases during the year was 57, viz:—Measles, 5; Scarlet Fever, 3; Whooping Cough, 1; Diphtheria, 3; Membranous Croup, 1; Influenza, 20; Diarrhœa, 16 Erysipelas, 2: Puerperal Fever, 6. 4 TABLE A. 1893 1892 1891 1890 Births 780 738 711 689 Deaths 363 333 334 287 Death-rates 12.9 12.8 12.8 10.62 DEATHS— Under 1 year 107 90 76 75 „ 60 years 166 124 159 121 Above 60 years 90 119 99 91 From Measles 5 3 0 11 „ Scarlet Fever 3 0 1 0 „ Gastric Fever 0 0 0 0 „ Small Pox 0 1 0 0 „ Diphtheria 3 8 7 5 „ Diarrhœa 16 8 11 1 „ Whooping Cough 1 4 10 0 „ Enteric Fever 0 0 1 0 TABLE IB.

Thirty-seven cases were notified during the year and 3 proved fatal, against 17 in the preceding year and 8 deaths. Most ot' the cases were extremely mild as will be understood by the small percentage of deaths, and it is a question whether many of the cases notified were Diphtheria at all. At nearly all the houses from which these cases were notified the drains were found to be very defective and were remedied. With regard to the fatal cases, the first occurred at 27, High Street, in June, a boy aged 5 years, the drains were in a deplorable state and were put in order. The second case was in July, at 49, The Broadway, a girl aged 9 years. The drains at this house were also very bad and there was a leakage of sewer gas into the house. New drains were laid. The third case occurred in October, at No. 67, Nelson Road, a girl aged 12 years, she was attended by no medical man but was seen after death by Dr. Brushfield who stated that in his opinion the girl had died from diphtheria. The drains at this house were found to be in good order, and there was no evidence as to how the disease had been contracted. The bodies of the three fatal cases were removed as soon as possible to the mortuary, and the rooms from which they were removed were disinfected without delay. SCARLET FEVER. Scarlet Fever has been present during the whole year. The greater number of cases occurred in the months of July and October (see table 2). In all 294 cases have been notified of which 166 were treated at the Infection Diseases Hospital, and the remaining 128 at their own homes. All the cases treated at the Hospital recovered, but there were three deaths among those treated in their own homes. The spread of the disease was doubtless due to dissemination from the Schools (2 of which were closed during a part of the year) and un-notified cases. Several cases were found at school 6 in the peeling stage, and others had been running about the streets. The neglect of precautionary measures in many cases was owing to the extremely mild form of the disease, and many parents were not aware that their children had contracted it until desquamation began. With regard to the fatal cases. The first was registered in October, a boy aged 6 years, who was found to be peeling at the Trinity Schools. He was sent to his home in Hartfield Crescent, and there died a few days afterwards. Two deaths were registered in December, one a boy aged 1 8/12 years from No. 11, Griffith's Road, where there were 2 other cases in the house. And the other a girl of 18 months from Avondale Villas where there had been 3 other cases. TYPHOID FEVER. Sixteen cases we notified but no deaths occurred from this disease, against 7 cases notified last year, and no deaths. No cases occurred in the months of January, March, May, June, and October, and there was a fairly even distribution of the cases over the remaining 7 months. Six of the cases were imported from other districts. One (a woman) contracted the disease through nursing her child. There is some evidence of polluted drinking water in three cases. Five were probably due to defective drainage, and one could not be satisfactorily accounted for. Some of the cases were severe, but as already stated, none proved fatal. SMALL POX. Twenty-one cases of Small Pox were notified this year, but there were no deaths, against 5 cases notified last year and 1 death. The first case occurred at No. 30, Gladstone Road, in februa^, a youth aged 18 years. This was attributable to the youth having assisted his father (who was an undertaker) in the removal of two corpses of persons who had died from Small Pox in the Kingston Infirmary. All precautions were taken, the young man removed to the Hospital, the house disinfected, and the other members of the family re-vaccinated. 7 In May 2, cases occurred at No. 6, Hubert Road, a girl aged 16 years and a boy aged 2½ years (a nephew of the girl). The girl contracted the disease at Mortlake, where she had been staying to nurse her sister's children, as her sister had been sent to the Hospital with Small Pox. On her return to Wimbledon she was taken ill and sent for a medical man, who pronounced her to be suffering from Small Pox. She was sent to the Hospital without delay, the house disinfected and the other members of the family vaccinated. Eighteen days afterwards her nephew was found to have contracted the disease and was at once moved into the Hospital. Another case occurred in May at No. 13, Denmark Road, a young woman, aged 25 years. She contracted the disease from an uncle, who was discharged from the workhouse at Kingston on the 22nd May, and came to Wimbledon to lodge. Not feeling well he again applied for admission to the Workhouse Infirmary at Kingston on the 29th, and called at his niece's bouse the same day before going to Kingston, when, on his arrival, he was found to be suffering from Small Pox. Every precaution was taken to prevent the spread of the disease. A case occurred at No. 5, Wilton Road, in September, a gentleman aged 31 years. It was an imported one, but could not be satisfactorily traced. He was removed to the Hospital, and all proper precautions were taken. A case occurred in October, at the Durnsford Road Infectious Diseases Hospital, a boy aged 8 years, who had been admitted 3 days before, from Norman Road, suffering from Scarlet Fever. How he contracted the disease could not be ascertained, but it is thought that he probably caught it at a meeting to which he had been taken. The result of this case (being admitted into the Scarlet Fever Wards), was that 13 of the Scarlet Fever patients contracted the disease, and no patients could be admitted, or none discharged for some time. Fortunately all recovered, although there were one or two serious cases. 8 Two mild cases occurred in December, at No. 64, Alexandra Road, but could not be traced. Both were removed to the Hospital, the other members of the family re-vaccinated, the house disinfected, and all proper precautions were taken. PROPOSED ISOLATION HOSPITAL Plans were prepared by the Surveyor, for the proposed Isolation Hospital, containing 2 12-bed pavilions, and 1 10-bed pavilion, with 2 and 3-bedded wards, together with the Administrative Block, to be erected on a site adjoining the present Hospital, Durnsford Road. These plans were laid before the Board on the 1st February, 1893, and approved, and the Local Government Board Enquiry, held by Dr. Deane Sweeting, on the 10th November, 1893. Subsequent to this, the Local Government Board have required Mortuary, Laundry, and Disinfecting Chamber to be added to the scheme, similar to those originally proposed by the Surveyor. The Board are now awaiting the sanction of the Local Government Board for this scheme. During the latter part of September, Scarlet Fever increased to such an extent, that it was necessary to erect an additional Hospital Tent, similar to that erected last year. The new tent (No. 2) is erected some 15 feet away from the old one. Several improvements have been made in the arrangements. The Lavatory tent attached, is larger, (about 10 feet by 8 feet) both the walls and roofs being double. The floor under the closet, washbasin and bath of this tent has been concreted. The tent for the reception of patients is heated by a No. 3 self-contained saddleboiler, with 2 rows of 4 inch cast iron pipe. Both the Hospital Tents have been fitted with windows in the side, which provide sufficient light, and add to the comfort of the patients, who are enabled to see what is going on outside. The Board decided on the loth November, to erect without delay, a Corrugated-iron Hospital, for the reception of Small Pox patients. It is much to be regretted that this building was erected in such haste, and that the details were not considered by 9 the Surveyor. This building contains 2 wards, 26 feet 6 inches by 17 feet, separated from' each other by a central portion, containing a Nurses' room, 11 feet by 11 feet, and a small ward 11 feet by 12 feet. The outer ends of the larger wards communicate with small additions, containing a bath-room, water-closet, and slop-sink. At a distance of 9 feet from this Block, a small Administrative Block is situated, containing kitchen, 2 bedrooms, wash-house, bath, water-closet, and store. It is to be regretted that the consideration of proper Hospital accommodation, has been so far delayed as to necessitate temporary measures, which are most unsatisfactory, and occasion great anxiety on the part of those responsible for the buildings, and the treatment of patients therein.

There are 22 retail bakehouses in the district, and these have been inspected twice during the year, when one was found to have a defective roof which admitted the rain-water, and 3 required cleansing and whitewashing. The usual notices were served in each case, and were complied with. The other bakehouses were found to be in a satisfactory condition. NUISANCES. A great many nuisances have been abated as will be seen in the summary accompanying this report. Defective drains and water-closets have been the chief cause of complaint. Entirety new drains have been laid to 155 houses and at several other houses the drains have been repaired; a good deal of drain-work is at the present time in progress but will be accounted for in the report for 1894. I think it well to mention that the following groups of houses have been re-drained:— 11 houses North Road. 6 „ Handford Row. 10 „ Church Road. 6 „ South Road. 4 „ Gilbert Road. 11 „ Deburgh Road. 13 „ Hartfield Crescent. 4 „ Merton Road. 8 „ Dundonald Road. 5 „ Russell Road. 8 „ Dry den Road. 6 „ Pelham Road. 5 „ High Street, Merton And many others. 11 I cannot close my report without testifying to the great zeal Mr. Mayne has shown in assisting me in the greatly increased duties necessitated by the Scarlet Fever Epidemic and the lack of Hospital accommodation, which entailed constant visiting at many houses where fever was being treated, and to see to the thorough disinfection of those houses to prevent their acting as a fresh nucleus for the spread of the disease. By his assiduous attention to these duties I consider he materially helped to stamp out the long continued epidemic. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, E. POCKL1NGTON, M.O.H. 12 NOTES ON TABLES 3 AND 4. Note 1. Medical Officers of Health of "Combined Districts" must make a separate Return for the District of each Sanitary Authority. 2. Medical Officers of Health acting for a portion only of the District of a Sanitary Authority should write, in the heading of the Table, the designation of the division for which they act. 3. The words "Urban," "Rural," or "Metropolitan" must be inserted in the appropriate space in the heading, according as the Sanitary Authority for the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The " Localities" adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population; such as parishes groups of parishes, townships or wards. As stated at the head of the first column in each Table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 5. The deaths which have to be classified in this Table (A), and summed up in the horizontal line of "Totals," are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, e.g., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which corrections apply, may appear in the text of the report or in supplementary tables. Area and Population of the District or Division to which this Return relates. Area in Acres 3,173. Population (1891) 25,758. In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables 3 and 4, attention has been given to the notes endorsed on the Tables. 13 TABLE 1.
