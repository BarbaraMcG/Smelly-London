I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for *935 on the health of the Borough. The report has been compiled on the lines indicated by the Minister of Health in Circular 1492 dated the 18th October, 1935. The whole of the vital statistics are very favourable. There have been no deaths from diphtheria, measles or whooping cough, the Infantile Mortality rate and the Maternal Mortality rate are both low, while the death rate for tuberculosis, 0.37 per 1,000 population, is the lowest ever recorded. There has been a slight decrease in the general death rate, and more than half the total deaths were of persons over 65 years of age. For the first time for many years there has been a distinct increase in the birth rate. I am definitely of the opinion that the RegistrarGeneral's estimate of the population is too low. I wish to express my thanks to Dr. Russell, Mr. Franklin, and all the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal co-operation and assistance throughout the year. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. TURNER. 3 SOCIAL CONDITIONS.

The Registrar-General estimates that on the 30th June, 1935, the population of the Borough was 62,660, which is an increase of 968 over the previous year. During the past two years the number of inhabited houses has increased by 1,400, while during the same period the Registrar-General estimates that the population has increased by only 1,520. It is well known that a large proportion of the new dwellings are occupied by immigrants into the Borough, and I have no doubt that the population in June, 1935, was not less than 64,000. The natural increase, or the excess of iive births over deaths, was 151, which is the highest for many years. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered during 1935 was 807, an increase of 95 over the previous year. This is the highest number since 1921, and it would appear that the very low birth rate which has prevailed for a number of years is definitely rising. The birth rate is 12.88 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 11.54 in 1934—a very substantial increase. The birth rate for England and Wales was 14.7. Thirty-five illegitimate births were registered as compared with 29 in 1934. The number of still births registered was 26, giving a rate of 31 per 1,000 of all births. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in 1935 was 656, two less than in the previous year. This gives a crude death rate of 10.47 as compared with 10.67 in 1934. The age and sex distribution of the population of Finchley differs to some extent from that of England and Wales as a whole, and in order to get a comparable death rate a factor is provided by the Registrar-General. When the crude death rate is multiplied by this factor a 5 ised death rate is obtained. The factor for Finehley is 0.98 and the standardised death rate is 10.26 compared with 11.47 for England and Wales. There has been a marked decrease in the number of deaths from tuberculosis, a slight decrease in deaths from cancer, and a substantial increase in the deaths from heart disease. It is interesting to note that no less than 53% of the total deaths were of persons over 65 years of age, 42% over 70, 28% over 75, and 16% over 80, a definite indication of the healthy state of the community. The comparatively large number of deaths from diarrhoea (17) is largely accounted for by the outbreak in Nazareth House, to which I referred in my last report. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Once again the Infantile Mortality rate is largely vitiated by infant deaths which occurred in Nazareth House, no less than 10 out of a total of 39 having occurred in that institution. The rate for Finehley children is 35.94 per 1,000 live births as compared with 40.73 in 1934. This is a very satisfactory figure. If the Nazareth House children are included the rate is increased to 48.33. The rate for England and Wales is 57 and for London 58- There were 10 deaths of illegitimate children, and as many as 9 of these were Nazareth House children. This gives a totally misleading mortality rate of 285.71 per 1,000 illegitimate births. POOR LAW RELIEF. During the year 556 families were in receipt of outdoor relief, and the total amount expended on such relief was £8,311 15s. 2d. Six hundred and sixty persons were admitted to the Wellhouse Hospital, and of these 147 were admitted to the Lying-in Ward. 6 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1935.

Hospitals, i. Tuberculosis (County of Middlesex Scheme). I am indebted to Dr. Tate, the County Medical Officer, for the following information :— ' Under the County Council's Scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis 570 beds are reserved for the institutional treatment of residents in the County of Middlesex, viz. :— Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Number of Beds Type of Case Adults. Children. Male. Female. Middlesex County 129 129 64 Sanatorium & 8 Council Sanato- observation rium, Harefield. (children). Middlesex County 9 7 — Observation.

Surgical Tuberculosis. The County Council has six beds for children reserved for its use at the Victoria Home, Margate. In all other cases, pulmonary and surgical, application for admission is made to one or other of the existing institutions approved by the Ministry of Health for the treatment of tuberculosis. 12 2. Maternity.—There is a well-equipped lying-in ward in the Wellhouse Hospital, Barnet. One hundred and forty-seven Finchley cases were admitted to this ward in 1935. 3. Children.—A grant of £20 per annum is paid by the Local Authority to the Royal Northern Hospital, and in return the staff of the hospital see cases of difficulty referred to them by one or other of the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres. 4. Infectious Diseases.—Cases of the common infectious diseases are admitted to the Finehley, Hornsey, Wood Green and Friern Barnet Joint Isolation Hospital at Muswell Hill, N.10. The hospital contains 150 beds, and during the year an up-to-date and well equipped operating theatre has been added. The Medical Officer of Health of Finehley is Medical Superintendent of the hospital. Cases of Puerperal Fever and Ophthalmia Neonatorum are admitted to the North Western Hospital and St. Margaret's Hospital respectively, by arrangement with the London County Council. 5. Smallpox.—The provision of hospital accommodation for cases of Smallpox is undertaken by the County Council, and by arrangement with the London County Council all cases are admitted to that authority's hospital at Joyce Green, Dartford. 6. Other Hospitals :—(a) The Finehley Memorial Hospital contains 72 beds and receives annually a grant of two hundred pounds from the Local Authority. The Local Education Authority has arranged with the Memorial Hospital for the operative treatment of elementary school children suffering from adenoids or from enlarged tonsils. 13 (b) The Wellhouse Hospital, Barnet. This is a modern institution of 200 beds belonging to the Hertfordshire County Council and admitting cases from this part of the County of Middlesex. During 1935, 660 Finchley cases were admitted to this hospital. Other Institutions. 1. Unmarried mothers :— A grant of ten guineas per annum is paid by the Council to the Hornsey Deanery Association in respect of unmarried mothers admitted to their institution. 2. Illegitimate Infants and Homeless Children :— Wright-Kingsford Home, 120 children. Nazareth House, N.2, 45 children. These Homes are in no way supported by the Local Authority. Ambulance Facilities. (a) Infectious Cases.—Arrangements nave been made by the Joint Hospital Committee with the London County Council for the conveyance of all cases of infectious disease from their homes to the Joint Isolation Hospital. (/?) Non-Infectious and Accident Cases.—The Council provide a Motor Ambulance for the conveyance of non-infectious sick and cases of accident. During the year the ambulance was called out in connection with 271 street accidents and 428 private cases A sum amounting to £291 was recovered from the various users. Mortuary. During the year I reported to the Public Health Committee that the present mortuary had become inadequate, and that owing to the development of the area as a housing estate the position left much to be desired. 14 A site near the new Fire Station has been acquired and provision has been made in the estimates for the current year for the erection of a new building-. During- 1935, 54 bodies were received at the mortuary, and of these 7 belonged to the Urban District of Friern Barnet. Clinics and Treatment Centres. Name and Situation. Nature of Accommodation.

The Finchley District Nursing and Benevolent Society provides three nurses for attendance upon the sick poor of the district. The Society has indicated its readiness to co-operate with the Local Authority should the need arise. No financial contribution is paid to the Society by the Local Authority. The Finchley Women Citizens' Association have instituted a scheme whereby families can have the services of a visiting nurse on the payment of an entrance fee of 5/- and an annual subscription of 10/-. The home nursing of cases of infectious disease is not undertaken by the Local Authority apart from what the health visitors are able to do in the course of their routine visits to the homes. Midwives. During the year 11 midwives notified iheir intention of practising within the area, and they attended 80 cases in the capacity of midwife and 46 cases as maternity nurse. No midwives are employed or subsidised by the Council. Legislation in Force. Details were set out in the report for 1934 and it is not considered necessary to repeat them. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water. With the exception of a few houses which are supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board the district receives its water supply from the Barnet District Gas and Water Company. The water, being derived from deep wells, is pure and wholesome but has a high degree of hardness. The supply has been adequate. 16 Removal of House and Trade Refuse. House refuse is collected weekly and removed by S.D. freighters to the Council's destructor situated at the Sewage Disposal Works. In the early summer a number of flat dwellers complained that a nuisance arose from putrifying material in their dustbins which, as a rule, are placed in close proximity to their doors or windows, and on this account the Council decided to make a collection twice weekly from a number of flats in the Borough. Trade refuse is collected on payment. Schools. In a number of the Council's schools improvements have been carried out in the urinals and water closets, and representations have been made to the managers of certain non-provided schools to carry out some much needed improvements. The arrangements for the supply of drinking water are gradually being improved and modern fountains are being installed. Swimming Baths and Pools. There is an indoor bath, with slipper baths, situated at Squires Lane, and there are two open air pools on the Glebe Land. The indoor bath was opened in 1915 and is 75 feet long by 25 feet wide. There is adequate dressing accommodation, and during the winter months the water and the hall are heated. Purification of the water is carried out by filtration, aeration, and chlorination. The filtration plant is barely adequate, and the turnover is not sufficiently frequent. A new filtration plant is being installed during the current year, and this will ensure that the water will attain a high degree of bacterial purity. * 17 The attendance of bathers during- 1935 numbered 52,988. There are twelve slipper baths divided into two departments for males and females respectively. The main open air pool was opened in 1932. It is 165 feet long by 80 feet wide, and is ten feet deep at the diving end. The water is purified by filtration through an adequate and up-to-date plant, aeration by means of cascades, and sterilised by the chloramine system. During suitable weather the pool is frequented by large numbers of bathers, and even at the busiest times during the summer, samples submitted to a competent analyst for chemical and bacteriolocal examination have proved that the water at all times closely approached the purity of drinking water. The children's pool adjoins the main pool and was opened in 1934. It is oval in shape, and its greatest depth is 3 feet 6 inches. Purification is on the same lines as at the main pool, and samples have been entirely satisfactory. The attendances at the two pools in 1935 numbered 165,896. 18 THE PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Diphtheria. The incidence of Diphtheria remained low in 1935 when there were 29 notifications as compared vvith 30 in 1934. The disease was comparatively mild, and for the first time for many years there is no death to report. Twenty-eight cases were removed to hospital. A supply of anti-toxin is kept at the Public Health Department for the use of general practitioners, but very little was used. Immunisation against Diphtheria. For a number of years the incidence of Diphtheria in Finchley has been very low, and on this account there has been little opportunity for children to develop natural immunity against the disease. It seemed to me very probable that, should Diphtheria break out in the Borough, a very large number of children might become infected owing to their lack of immunity, and I therefore reported to the Public Health Committee that I considered it advisable to offer to parents the opportunity of having their children immunised. The Committee agreed, and it was decided in the first place to concentrate on those children between the ages of 2 and 8 years attending the Council's Welfare Centres and the Elementary Schools. In certain areas it has been found that when Diphtheria is not prevalent it has been difficult to get parents to tak an interest in immunisation, but I am glad to say that this has not been the experience in Finchley. Letters setting out the value of immunisation, together with consent forms, were distributed in the Junior and Infant Schools and at the Welfare Centres, and up to the time of writing this report the response has been excellent, especially in the case of schools in which 60% of the children under 8 years of age have been immunised. Previous schick-testing has been dispensed with, and each child is given three injections at intervals of a fortnight. At first the immunising agent used was T.A.M. but, 19 as the result of a number of fairly severe local reactions and a few cases of sickness, I changed over to T.A.F., which, although a little more expensive, has given rise to no disturbance at all. During 1935 it was considered advisable to immunise as many children as time would allow, and for that reason subsequent schick-testing was postponed and is at present being carried out. The number of immunes is proving to be very high. I wish to thank all the Head Teachers concerned for the great interest they have taken in the scheme, and for their very valuable assistance, which has gone a long way towards making it a success. The following table shows the number of children dealt with from May to December, 1935.

Scarlet Fever continued to be prevalent in 1935 when 171 cases were notified as compared with 175 in 1934 and 158 in 1933. On the whole the disease was mild, although there were three deaths. One death was that of a woman who developed septic Scarlet Fever and was nursed at home, the second was that of a boy who died of toxic Scarlet Fever 20 a few hours after admission to hospital, while the third was that of a boy at a boarding school outside the Borough who was admitted to a hospital with Diphtheria where he contracted Scarlet Fever and died of Meningitis. One hundred and seventeen cases were admitted to hospital. Enteric Fever. Three cases of Enteric Fever were notified in 1935. One was a case of a maid who was not diagnosed until she had been admitted to the Wellhouse Hospital, and a child in the same house contracted the disease from her. Both were cases of Paratyphoid B. The third case was a boy who was admitted to the Isolation Hospital, and although he showed all the typical signs of Enteric, including a relapse, his blood persistently gave a negative result to the Widal test. Pneumonia. The number of notifications received was 45, and the number of deaths 35. Measles. Only three cases of Measles were known to have occurred in 1935, and there was no death. Whooping Cough. Whooping Cough was not prevalent in 1935 and there was no death from this disease. Influenza. Influenza was fairly prevalent in the early months of the year, but was not of a severe character. Ten deaths were attributed to this disease. Erysipelas. Seventeen cases were notified and there were 2 deaths. Smallpox. No case of Smallpox occurred in 1935. 21 Vaccinations. No primary or re-vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917. Bacteriological Work. The bacteriological work for the district is carried out at the Joint Isolation Hospital, and during 1935 the following specimens were dealt with :— Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria 52 824 876 Pulmonary Tuberculosis 8 54 62 Enteric Fever 3 4 7 Other specimens 1 4 5 950 Disinfection. Three years ago I reported to the Public Health Committee that I was of the opinion that the disinfection of rooms after the ordinary infectious diseases was of no value, except where the house was dirty or verminous, and that the practice might safety be stopped. The Committee agreed, and the experience of the past three years has definitely confirmed my opinion.

I have received many reports as to the excellence of the material contained in "Better Health," and I am satisfied that the small expenditure incurred in distributing this publication is amply justified. 23 25 26 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES DURING THE YEAR 1935.

During the year 45 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified comprising" 24 males and 21 females. Twelve non-pulmonary cases were notified, comprising 3 males and 9 females. There were only 18 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with 30 in 1934, and 5 from non-pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with 4 in 1934. This gives a total of 23 deaths from all forms of tuberculosis, 9 males and 14 females. The death rate for the disease is 0.37 per 1,000 of the population, which is the lowest that has ever been recorded for the district. In 22.7% of the cases dying from tuberculosis no previous notification had been received. Dr. Dobson, the Tuberculosis Officer, has been good enough to supply me with the following figures Number of patients Diagnosed as non-tubercular 66 examined for first Diagnosed as tubercular 33 time during 1935 Undiagnosed and under observation 1 Number of tubercular cases transferred into district 4 Number of cases suffering from tuberculosis examined at the dispensary dur- in 1935 162 Number of cases under observation at the dispensary, etc., on 31/12/35 127 27 TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE YEAR 1935.

The whole scheme continues to function in a most satisfactory manner, and there have been considerable increases in attendances at all the clinics during the year. All those taking-part in the work are to be congratulated on the very low Infantile and Maternal Mortality rates which have been recorded. The ladies of the Voluntary Association have continued to give much valuable assistance at the Welfare Centres, and their activities not only serve a verv useful purpose but are also greatly appreciated. Infant Welfare Centres. In 1935 there were 16,712 attendances at the three centres as compared with 14,192 in 1934 and 13,427 in 1933. Children under one year of age made 8,952 attendances, and children over one year made 7,760. The average attendance of children per session was 52. Ante-Natal Clinic. The number of women attending the Ante-Natal Clinic shows a marked increase over that for previous years, being 234 in 1935 as compared with 159 in 1934 and 122 in 1933. The total attendances in 1935 were 773. The increase in the attendances has necessitated an additional fortnightly session being held on Tuesday mornings. Maternity Accommodation. In the early part of the year some difficulty was experienced in getting maternity cases admitted to the Wellhouse Hospital, and a number had to be diverted to one or other of the County Hospitals some considerable distance from Finchley. Every endeavour is made to get expectant mothers to attend the Ante-Natal Clinic as early as possible during pregnancy, and in this way they are able to book accommodation for some considerable time ahead. This action has gone a long way towards avoiding unexpected congestion at the Wellhouse Hospital and other institutions which they desire to enter, and preventing mothers being left in the lurch at a critical moment. 29 A conference was held between representatives of the Boroughs of Finchley, Hornsey, and Wood Green to discuss the necessity for further maternity accommodation easily accessible to the three areas, and a resolution was sent to the Middlesex County Council urging that body to provide such accommodation for all classes of maternity cases. No further action had been taken by the end of the year. Maternal Mortality. In 1935 there were 2 maternal deaths. One woman died in the Wellhouse Hospital from puerperal eclampsia, and one in Queen Charlotte's Hospital from sepsis and pernicious anaemia. The Maternal Mortality rate was 2.4 per 1,000 total births as compared with 4.1 for England and Wales. There is every reason to be gratified by this low rate. I am convinced that much harm and unnecessary fear have been caused in recent years by the constant references in the press and elsewhere to the high maternal mortality and the risks which a mother encounters at child-birth. These alarming statements are seldom missed by expectant mothers, and the psychological effect which they produce, more especially in young women who are approaching the most critical period of their whole lives, cannot be other than prejudicial to their well-being, and the successful completion of the natural process of child-birth. A local medical practitioner recently told me of a nervous young mother whom he attended at her confinement, and who had under her pillow a newspaper cutting of an article on maternal deaths. This form of propaganda, if it can be so termed, in addition to its effect on the expectant mother, has succeeded in frightening many healthy young married couples, who are in every way fitted to bring up a family, from having any children at all. The Supply of Milk for Mothers and Children. The supply of milk and other foods for children is organised by the Voluntary Association, and during the 80 financial year 1935-36 a grant of £75 was paid by the Council to the Association to cover the supply of milk in necessitous cases. The Council have instituted a scheme for the supply of milk to necessitous expectant and nursing mothers. A scale of income was drawn up and approved bv the Ministry of Health, and all cases recommended by the Assistant Medical Officer are supplied with a pint of pasteurised milk daily, at half-cost or free according to the financial circumstances of the family. The scheme came into operation in April, 1935, and up to the end of the year 45 mothers had received milk free of cost and 2 at half-cost. A sum of £75 was provided in the estimates of the Maternity and Child Welfare Sub-Committee, and has proved to be adequate. Puerperal Pyrexia and Puerperal Fever. Four cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified in 1935. Two cases were removed to hospital and two were nursed at home. All recovered. Three cases of puerperal fever were notified and all removed to hospital, where their treatment was successful. The' notification of one case which died from puerperal fever took place in another area. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. It is gratifying to be able to report that no case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum was notified during the year. Home Visiting. During the year the Health Visitors made 4,556 visits in connection with Maternity and Child Welfare work, as compared with 4,296 in 1934. 31 Dental Treatment. Expectant and nursing mothers who are in need of dental treatment are referred by the doctor at the Centres to the Council's dentist. Under the Council's scheme treatment is limited to extractions and fillings, but the Voluntary Association give assistance to necessitous mothers to enable them to obtain dentures. The amount of work done shows a considerable increase on the previous year, and it has been decided to have two sessions per week instead of one as from the 1st April, 1936. Mothers Children Number inspected 101 284 Number treated 81 124 Number of attendances 333 269 Fillings 141 170 Extractions 329 262 Gas administrations 57 81 Other operations 30 47 Dentures supplied 28 — Dentures repaired 6 — Visits re dentures 84 — Creche. The number of attendances at the Creche shows an increase on the previous year. 1935 1934 Children attending 83 100 Total attendances 6,483 6,333 Receipts from Mothers £160 15 10 £143 5 6 CHILDREN ACT, 1908. PART I. AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS ACT, 1932. At the beginning of the year there were on the register 17 mothers receiving 27 children, while at the end of the year there were 19 mothers receiving 44 children. Practically all the children attend the Infant Welfare Centres, but frequent home visits are also paid by the Health Visitors. No case called for any special action by the Council. 32 Housing Statistics for the Year 1935.

During the year the Town Council have had under sideration a scheme for the erection of flats on what is known as the Red Lion Hill area. The area in the original scheme was approximately 9 acres, and included a number of dwelling-houses abutting on Oak Lane and the Great North Road, and a number of cottages in Red Lion Hill. Many of the cottages are of a poor type and considerably below the standard of working class dwellings in the Borough. A Compulsory Purchase Order was applied for and, after holding a Public Enquiry, the Minister of Health confirmed the Order with the exception of one property. Since then several additions have been made to the scheme, and it is contemplated that eventually some 340 flats will be erected. 35 FOOD Meat and Other Foods. Under the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, 8,946 carcases were inspected, and a large amount of meat was condemned as unfit for the food of man. A full account of this work will be found in the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. MILK SUPPLY. Details of the inspection of dairies, cowsheds and milk shops, together with the bacteriological results of samples will be found in the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector.

The inspection of meat is mainly controlled by the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. These regulations provide that any person intending to slaughter an animal for human consumption must notify the local authority three hours before the time of slaughtering. These notices may be given at any time as the local authority are not empowered to regulate the hours of slaughter. In addition to the regular times fixed by certain butchers when slaughtering is to be carried out, 486 individual notifications of intention to slaughter were received. 53 As in former years, it has on many occasions proved somewhat difficult to arrange for the inspection of the carcases and organs of the animals slaughtered owing to the uncertain times when slaughtering takes place and the delivery after office hours of notices of intention to slaughter. With very few exceptions, however, the necessary inspections have been made. Nine certificates were issued to butchers at their request, certifying that certain meat had been inspected and found to be unfit for the food of man and destroyed. The total number of carcases of animals (including organs) inspected after slaughter during the year and the number and percentage found to be affected with tuberculosis are as follows:— No. Found to be Examined, tuberculous.

The licence of an old slaughterhouse at North Finchley became extinct consequent upon the demolition of the premises to clear the site for a new building scheme. 56 The number of visits paid to the five slaughterhouses was 962. Most of these visits have been made for the purpose of inspecting the carcases and organs of animals slaughtered for human consumption. Attention has also been given to the condition, generally, of the slaughterhouses and steps have been taken to ensure compliance with the provisions of the byelaws with respect to these premises. The Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933.

'The usual periodical inspection of all dairy premises has been maintained, and the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, with respect to the cleanliness of dairies and cowsheds, the protection of milk against infection and contamination, and the conveyance and distribution of milk have been generally well observed. The veterinary inspection of the cows kept in the district is carried out by the Middlesex County Council. The Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923.
