Clerkenwell Detached.—With regard to this outlying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from London, and on the north-western confines of Hornsey. This 20 little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of Loudon, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a 'great cure performed upon a King of Scot, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell, a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell.'Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.'This Cbapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River. "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initials affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 68 houses and pieces of land in assessment. The Annual Elections of Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts took place on the 30th 21 and 31st May, 1892.—In Ward No. 1 (Pentonville), the election was held at the Volunteers' Head Quarters, Penton Street, and was decided without a poll, Messrs. T. Simnett, G. Morris and G. Griffiths being re-elected for a term of three years; Mr. R. M. H. Griffith being elected for three years in place of Mr. J. Gibson, who did not seek re-election, and Mr. F. Newport being elected for one year in place of Mr. C. H. Belsey, resigned. Mr. Martin Doerr was elected Auditor of Accounts. In Ward No. 2 (St. Philip's), the election was held at the Amwell Street Schools, and was also decided without a poll. Mr. A. J. Dixie, Mr. R. C. Murray and Mr. A. T. Catley, were re-elected for three years, and Mr. A. J. Harris and Mr. J. E. Foot were elected for the same term in place of Mr. W. Pierpoint and Mr. H. K. Davison, who did not seek re-election. Mr. J. H. Spink was elected Auditor of Accounts. In Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's), the election was held at the Vestry Hall. The members retiring by effluxion of time were Mr. E. Sans, Mr. C. H. Norbury, Mr. W. Partridge and Mr. S. Brighty, the latter however having died in the preceding February. Messrs. Sans, Norbury and Partridge, were again nominated, and Mr. E. Cetti and Mr. J. Newport also sought election. A poll was consequently demanded, the ballot taking place on the 31st May, the votes recorded being as follows:— Mr. J. Newport 60 „ C. H. Norbury 60 „ E. Sans 56 „ W. Partridge 53 „ E. Cetti 47 The first four were therefore declared elected Mr. E. Lenard was elected Auditor of Accounts. 22 In Ward No. 4 (St. James'), the election was held at No. 12, Clerkenwell Close. There being six candidates only for six seats, the retiring members Messrs. R. Stebbings, W. R. Putterill, H. Phillips and F. Mache were re-elected, and Messrs. G. F. Cooper and W. Edenborough were elected in place of Mr. W. Goody and Mr. W. E. Davis, who did not seek re-election. Mr. W. Pearson was elected as Auditor of Accounts. In Ward No. 5 (St. John's), the election was held at the Constitutional Hall, 15, Clerkenwell Green, and was decided without a poll. Messrs. F. G. Boulton, J. Shilton and Wm. Reason were re-elected, and the Rev. W. Dawson, M.A. and Mr. A. Mignot were elected to the seats vacated by Mr. Jolly and Mr. F. C. Holliday. Mr. A. A. Bellefontaine was elected Auditor of Accounts. Meetings.-Under the Byelaws of the Vestry Standing Committees are appointed at the first Meeting of the Vestry after the Annual Elections, and Special Committees are appointed from time to time to deal with special questions, and it is at the Meetings of these Committees that a very large quantity of the detail work of the Vestry is carried out. The following statement shows the number of Meetings held by the Vestry and the various Committees during the year, and will also shew the parishioners that the administration of their local affairs is no light task, but is one which entails considerable labour on those who, recognising the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, come forward to take part in the municipal work of the Parish. 23 Vestry 42 Works Committee 52 Wharf Committee 6 Joint Works and Sanitary Committee 2 Works Sub Committee 1 Sanitary Committee 23 Sanitary Sub Committee, re Cholera 6 Assessment Committee 14 Finance Committee 9 Parliamentary Committee 2 Special Committees 6 Vestry Hall Committee 10 Vestry Hall Sub Committee 3 Petty Sessions 4 180 Personal.—Mr. Wm. O'Connor, late of Myddelton Street, died in January, 1893, and the Vestry on the 26th of that month passed a resolution expressing their regret at his decease. Retirement of the Rector of St. John's Church.—At the Vestry meeting on the 1st December, the Chairman called attention to the retirement of the Rev. Wm. Dawson, M.A., from his position as Rector of St. John's Church, and to the good services he had rendered to the Parish during a period of 22 years, by the special interest he has shewn in sanitation, his association with the Library movement, the great improvement of St. John's Church, chiefly at his own expense, and his uniform devotion to the interests of the Poor. The reverend gentleman was an ex-officio member of the Vestry as Rector of St. John's, but he was also for some years, and at the time of his retirement, an elected member for St. John's Ward. 24 The Vestry unanimously passed the following resolution:—That the Members of the Vestry desire to express their great regret at the resignation of the Rev. Wm. Dawson, M.A., of the Rectory of St. John's, Clerkenwell, by which they feel that the parish is losing a great benefactor and themselves a valued colleague. Death of Mr, Robert Paget, the Yestry Clerk.—The Vestry have to record with great regret the sudden decease of Mr. Robert Paget, who had been Vestry Clerk of the Parish since the constitution of the Vestry under the Metropolis Local Management Act in 1856. On the 28th June, l892, Mr. Paget was entering a train at Farringdon Street Station, when his foot slipped and he was partially drawn between the train and the platform, and so injured that he only survived a short time. The following letter was forwarded to Mrs. Paget by the Chairman of the Vestry:— 40, Myddelton Square, E.C., 4th July, 1892. Dear Mrs. Paget, My colleagues on the Yestry have requested me to forward the resolution passed at its last Meeting, which very inadequately expresses the deep sorrow that is felt by every Member at the great and irreparable loss you have sustained. We all recognise the fact that words cannot convey in the slightest degree the sympathy that thrills through every heart for you and yours in this hour of your terrible bereavement. We have lost one who for many years has been associated with and laboured for the benefit of the Parish of Clerkenwell, and we mourn his death to-day with sincere regret. Your loss we cannot measure—your grief we dare not attempt to gauge ; we would fain stand aside and pray that He who alone can heal the broken heart and wipe away the mourner's tear may sustain and comfort you. Believe me, dear Mrs. Paget, Yours very faithfully, WILLIAM ROBSON. 25 Decease of Mr. J. W. Hill, Clerk to the Guardians of the Holborn Union.— Clerkenwell has reason to regret the decease also, on the 14th February, of Mr. James W. Hill, the Clerk of the Guardians of the Holborn Union, who had held the appointment for twenty-three years, and had previously been Clerk to the Clerkenwell Guardians. Although not an officer of the Vestry, Mr. Hill's duties constantly brought him into contact with the Vestry, and his zeal and ability were universally recognised. On the proposal of the Vicar, the Vestry unanimously passed the following resolution : —That the Vestry hereby express their deep regret at the decease of Mr. Hill, by which the Holborn Union has lost a faithful and able officer, and that this expression of the Vestry be communicated to the members of the late Mr. Hill's family, and to the Guardians of the Poor of the Holborn Union. Decease of Mr. R. M. Holborn.—In March, 1892, there passed away in the person of Mr. Robert Major Holborn, a resident in the neighbouring Parish of Islington, a considerable benefactor to the inhabitants of Clerkenwell in connection with the public library. The Vestry forwarded to Mr. Holborn's family an expression of their sincere condolence, and recorded their heartfelt sorrow at the great loss sustained by his decease. 26 For the Half-year to Lady-day, 1898. A Poor Rate of 1s. 6d. including a Library Rate of 1d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £25,740 A Lighting Rate 1d. „ „ „ 1,430 A General Rate 1s. 3d. „ „ „ 21,540 2s. 10d. £48,710 The rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £365,373, and those made in October, for the halfyear to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £366,140. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £29,996 in the first, and £25,441 in the second half-year, total £55,437. The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £3,972 1s. 9d. and £4,569 10s. 1d. in the first and second halfyears respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union include the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor Rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £18,854 15s. 8d., divided into moieties of £9,427 7s. 10d. in the first, and £9,427 7s. 10d. in the second half-year. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, they receive from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with two-fifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants hitherto paid from 27 the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payments of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the latter amount for the year ending Lady-day 1893 is £7,886, the amount being based for the first five local financial years on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The precept of the School Board for the year 1892 amounted to the sum of £15,869 10s. l1d., including £102 15s. 2d., an arrear charge consequent on the increase of the totals of the rateable value of the Parish. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,558 0s. 7d. It will thus be seen that of the £100,190, raised during the year, the sum of £70,313 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 5s. 10d. in the pound for the year, 4s. 1d. was for other bodies, and 1s. 9d. for the local administration, paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1,416 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons 28 summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 30 Committal Warrants per quarter were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who sot the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied, and it may bo taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of those cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 14 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Valuation Lists.—One Supplemental and four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year, dealing with 324 Assessments and raising the rateable value by £6,584. School Board Precepts.—The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870: £ s. d £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1882 8,067 10 5 1872 9431 11 2 1883 9,397 16 2 1873 780 0 2 1884 11,054 2 2 1874 1,869 9 3 1885 11,999 1 10 1875 8,267 12 11 1886 12,890 9 0 1876 4,897 4 9 1887 12,210 12 5 1877 6,046 10 1 1888 11,717 15 1 1878 6,013 14 10 1889 13,252 6 0 1879 6,371 8 11 1890 16,052 19 4 1880 7,488 9 8 1891 16,589 15 11 1881 7,900 4 4 1892 15,869 10 11 29 Metropolitan Board Precepts.—The following is a list of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to the coming into force of the Local Government Act, 1888, in March, 1889.

Do. 31st March, 1891 (13.25d.) £19,900 2s. 3d Do. 31st March, 1892 (11.75d.) £17,718 10s. 0d Do. 31st March, 1893 (13.0d.) £18,854 15s. 8d. Some further particulars as to these Precepts will be found on pages 26 and 27. Collection of the Rates.—Of the rates made in the Parish of Clerkenwell, a percentage of about 93½ is actually collected, 6½ per cent being irrecoverable from allowances to owners who compound, empty houses, runs, and excusals on the ground of poverty. It follows therefore that when the Parish is called upon to satisfy the Precept of some Central body, such as the County Council or the School Board, which is stated to be at the rate of say 1s. in the pound, an actual rate of nearly 13d. must be made to produce the amount required. Parliamentary Representation by the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885.—The Parish of Clerkenwell forms the Central Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Finsbury, and was represented in the Parliament of 1886, which was dissolved in 1892, by Captain Frederick Thomas Penton. At the ensuing General Election in July, 1892, the result of the poll was as follows:— Hon. Dadabhai Naoroji (L.) 2,959 Captain F. T. Penton (C.) 2,956 Majority 3 A re-count of the votes took place on the 8th August, resulting in the totals being altered to Hon. Dadabhai Naoroji 2,961 Captain F. T. Penton 2,956 Majority 5 31 Subsequently a scrutiny took place before Mr. Justice Cave and Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams, and after an enquiry extending over three days, the petition was withdrawn. The Parish also forms part of the Hornsey Division of the County of Middlesex, represented in the last and the present Parliaments, by H. C. Stephens, Esq. School Board for London.—Under the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Finsbury Division of the School Board for London. The following are the members elected in November, 1891, for the Division:— Mr. G. B. Clough, Titchfield, Preston Park, Brighton. „ Thomas Smith, 132, Queen's Road, Finsbury Park. „ J. J.

London County Council.— Under the Local Government Act, 1888, the County Council superseded the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Electoral Areas of London are the same as for Parliamentary purposes. At the triennial election which took place on the 5th March, 1892, the following was the result of the polling for the representatives of the Division of Central Finsbury:— Hon. Ashley Ponsonby, 9, Princes Gate, S.W. 1902 Mr. Ernest Bowen Rowlands 1902 Elected Mr, H. E. Davis 1265 Mr. J. R.

Blake 1674 „ Philip Rutland 820 „ H. E. Davis 477 The present representatives are therefore:— Hon. Ashley Ponsonby, 9,Princes Gate, S.W. Mr. William F. Blake, 29, Brunswick Gardens, Campden Hill. 32 Guardians of the Poor.—The Parish of Clerkenwell is the central and the largest Parish in the Holborn Poor Law Union. The administrative offices of the Guardians are situated in the Parish in Clerkenwell Road. A list of the Guardians will be found on pages 15 and 16, and of their officers on page 14.

Register of Voters.-The Register of Parliamentary Voters and County Electors for the Parish of Clerkenwell (which is the Central Division of the Borough of Finsbury) made out in 1892, and coming into force in 1893, shows the total number of Parliamentary Electors to be 9,279, and of County Electors 8,552. Loans.—The debt in the shape of loans of the Parish of Clerkenwell compares most favourably with almost every other Parish in the Metropolis. It amounted at the 25th March, 1893, to the sum of £8,935, made up as follows:— £2,100 Balance of £21,000 incurred in September, 1874, for new paving works. The money was borrowed from the Atlas Assurance Society, at per cent, and the loan will be extinguished in September, 1894. 33 £600 Balance of £4,000 incurred in August, 1875, for new paving works. This sum was also borrowed from the Atlas Assurance Company at 4£ per cent., and will be extinguished in 1895. £460 Balance of £2,300 taken up in November, 1876, for building the Mortuary, Coroner's Court, &c. The amount was borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works at 3f per cent, and will be paid off on October 1st, 1896. £2,925 Balance of £6,500 borrowed in December, 1881, for new paving, from the Metropolitan Board of Works at 3½ per cent. It will be paid off in October, 1901. £1,100 Balance of £2,000 borrowed in April, 1883 for new paving in a portion of Pentonville Road. This amount was also borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works at 3½ per cent. The annual repayment of principal is £100, and the loan will be extinguished in April, 1903. £1,750 Balance of £2,100 borrowed in February, 1888, for acquiring the freehold of the present Yestry Hall. This sum was also borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works; the term is 30 years, at 3½ per cent. The annual instalment of principal is £70, and the last payment will be made on January 1st, 1918. £8,935 At the close of the year the Yestry was about to take up a loan of £3,000 for five years for asphalte paving, and another of £6,200 for the purchase of c 34 land in Rosebery Avenue, as a site for the New Vestry Hall, the latter to be repaid as to £3,700 in 56 years, and as to £2,500 in five years or less, on the disposal of the site of the present offices. Appointment of a Vestry Clerk.—Consequent upon the decease of Mr. Robert Paget, it became the duty of the Vestry to appoint a new Vestry Clerk. The matter was referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry for consideration, with the result that Mr. Robert Ernest Paget, the First Assistant Clerk, who had been in the Vestry's service for over twenty-two years, was, on the 21st July, appointed Vestry Clerk, at a salary of £500 per annum, such salary to be inclusive of any salary or emolument that may be awarded to him by the Guardians or Governors of the Poor or any other Parochial Authority (with the exceptions of the Trustees of the Church and the Overseers), subject also to the payment by him to the credit of the General Rate of the fees derived from the rate summonses, and hitherto received by the Vestry Clerk, he being required to devote the whole of his time to the Vestry with the exception of the Boards above-mentioned. Office Staff.—The Vestry followed the precedent of the appointment of the Vestry Clerk, by promoting the remaining assistant clerks to the higher positions, with an increase of salary in each case, details of which will be found in the appendix No. 2. The vacancy thus occasioned in the office of junior clerk has not been filled up, the report of the Finance Committee on the subject being as follows:— The Committee have also considered the question of filling up the vacancy which will now occur in the office of Junior Clerk. They have consulted the Vestry Clerk thereon, who has expressed an 35 opinion that it would be desirable for the prompt and efficient carrying on of the Vestry's business that a Junior Clerk who could write shorthand should be appointed. He has drawn the Committee's attention to the great increase in the clerical work since 1871 (when the clerical staff was increased to four) by the establishment of the Wharf, the printing of the Minutes, and the greatly increased number of meetings, together with other reasons which were set out in a communication of the late Vestry Clerk in 1888 (Minutes, 1887-8, page 295), upon which the Vestry appointed another clerk. The Vestry Clerk also points out that even with that addition constant night work on his part was necessitated to keep the work from falling into arrear, and that the additional demands on his time as Vestry Clerk will make it impossible for him to continue the same amount of detail work which he has hitherto done. There is, however, the fact that the office accommodation, even for the present staff, is utterly inadequate, and the inconvenience at present experienced would be intensified by the further appointment. The Clerk has therefore expressed bis willingness to endeavour to carry on the work, without filling up the vacancy, it being understood that the appointment is rather in abeyance than done away with. New Vestry Hall.—The inadequacy of the present Vestry Hall for the purpose of carrying on the parochial business properly has been long patent to those who have given any consideration to the subject, but the prospect of a suitable and central site being found when the new street, now called Rosebery Avenue, was formed, has had the effect of delaying the provision of the necessary accommodation. The site has now presented itself in the vacant ground to the north of, and immediately adjoining, the present Vestry Hall, and it has been purchased by the Vestry from the County Council for the sum of £6,210, a loan of £6,200, at 3J per cent., being obtained for the purpose, repayable over a period of 56 years. Active steps are being taken to proceed with the building at as early a date as possible. Valuation Lists.—Uniformity in Procedure.— The Vestry in February received an invitation from the Couuty Council to appoint a representative to 36 a Conference between the Local Government and Taxation Committee of the Council, and representatives of the various Assessment Committees and Overseers, with the view to promoting uniformity in the valuation of the County of London. The Vestry appointed Mr. J. F.Kelly as their representative to such Conference, which met on the 13th March, but has not yet concluded its sittings. Paving.—A List of the paving works carried out by the Vestry during the year will be found in the report of the Surveyor. Sewer works.—A list of the sewer works carried out by the Vestry during the year will also be found in the report of the Surveyor. Street Nomenclature.—During the year the following Orders made by the London County Council for re-naming and re-numbering streets have been received by the Vestry, and notices to the persons concerned have been duly given. To re-number the houses in Warren Street and to abolish the names Warren Villas and Warren Cottages. To re-number the houses in Rodney Street. To re-number the houses in Penton Street. Newcastle Street has been re-named Scotswood Street, carrying out an Order of the County Council in a previous year. Lighting.—The number of public lamps in the Parish at the close of the year was 870. The gas is supplied by the Gas Light & Coke Company, who also light, clean, and glaze the lamps. The amount paid to the Company was £2,829 18s. 10d. Further particulars as to lighting will be found in the Surveyor's report. 37 Summary Proceedings.—During the year summonses have been issued at the instance of the Vestry, and heard by the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court in respect of the following offences:— Number of Summonses issued. Offences Charged. Convictions. Dismissals. Penalties and Costs. 3 Neglecting to cleanse water closet 3 £3 2 0 1 Neglecting to repair defective water closet 1 3 4 6 6 Defective drains 5 1 8 0 0 1 Neglecting to unstop drains 1 1 2 0 1 Illegally letting underground rooms 1 2 2 0 1 Neglecting to make house habitable 1 0 15 6 1 Neglecting to remove noxious matter 1 0 4 0 2 Neglecting to notify infectious disease 1 1 1 4 6 2 Exposing child suffering from in fectious disease 1 1 2 2 0 1 Removing infected furniture 1 3 2 0 1 Summons for closing order under Housing of Working Classes Act withdrawn 1 Refusing admission to Sanitary Inspector 1 4 Smoke nuisance 3 1 7 16 0 4 Selling articles unfit for food 2 2 30 2 0 17 Selling adulterated articles 16 1 withdrawn 22 14 6 1 Refusing to sell milk for analysis 1 2 2 0 2 Selling margarine in unstamped wrapper 2 2 5 0 49 40 9 £89 18 0 Premises belonging to the Vestry. The following particulars are here given with reference to the various Buildings and Premises belonging to the Vestry:— The Vestry Hall, Rosoman Street.—Until 1888, held on lease from the New River Company, at a ground rent of £10, which would have expired in 1903. The freehold was, in February, 1888, purchased for the sum of £2,132. 38 The Mortuary, Coroner's Court and Disinfecting Oven.—Erected on a portion of Spa Fields' Burial Ground in 1876, at a cost of £2,433 1s. 11d., the land being leased by the Marquess Northampton for 50 years at a rent of 10s. per annum. Nos. 47 and 49, Northampton Road.—Leasehold premises purchased in 1876 for the sum of £750 to acquire an entrance to the Mortuary. The lease expires in June, 1931, the ground rent being £12 on each house. No. 47 is used as a shelter for persons requiring same during the disinfection of their homes, and No. 49 is partly occupied by the Mortuary keeper, and partly let to private tenants in apartments. Phoenix Wharf, Commercial Road, Lambeth.— Taken by the Vestry on lease in 1881 (expiring at Lady Day, 1909), as a Depot for the disposal of refuse at a rental of £615, a sum of £500 being paid as a premium, and £1,963 16s. being spent in the construction of stables, paving, &c. 27, Commercial Road.—Held on lease at £45 per annum for 21 years from Michaelmas, 1883, and used as a residence by the Wharf Superintendent. Spencer Place.—Van shed erected by the Vestry, and held on lease of the Marquis Northampton for 18¾ years from Christmas, 1891, at a rental of £5 per annum. 247-253, Pentonville Road, formerly the site of a Toll-house. Now leased to Mr. George Ell in two leases at £50 per annum each, expiring at Michaelmas, 1962. 245, Pentonville Road, a freehold house adjoining the above, also leased to Mr. Ell for the same term, at £22 per annum. 39 Parish of the Charterhouse.—Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Guardians of the Poor of the Holborn Union became the Sanitary Authority to carry out the provisions of the Act in the Parish of the Charterhouse. It being obviously undesirable to appoint a separate staff for so small an area, the Guardians, with the consent of the Vestry, appointed the Vestry's Sanitary Inspector for the contiguous portion of this Parish, to be the Sanitary Inspector for the Charterhouse, and they came to an arrangement with the Vestry for the latter to remove the house refuse for £55 per annum, and to sweep Charterhouse Buildings and Foresters' Hall Place for £8 per annum. They have further agreed to pay 21s. per case for families using No. 47, Northampton Road, during the disinfection of their rooms, 6s. per time for the use of the Disinfecting Oven, and 5s. for each person removed to the Mortuary. Shelter, 47, Northampton Road.—The Vestry have received requests from the Vestry of St. Luke and the Holborn District Board of Works asking to be allowed to make use of the premises, No. 47, Northampton Road, which have been appropriated by the Vestry to the purposes of section 60(4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as a shelter for persons requiring accommodation while their homes are being disinfected, and such use has been granted to those authorities on payment of a sum of £25 per annum each. Clerkenwell Road.—The last report stated that an application had been made by the authorities of Charterhouse and Clerkenwell to the County Council, to make an Order placing Clerkenwell Road entirely under the jurisdiction of Clerkenwell. After some delay, resulting from negotiations for 40 including other matters in the Order, the Order was duly made by the Council on the 21st December, 1892, placing the portion of the road in the parish of the Charterhouse, under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of drainage, paving, lighting, watering and cleansing. Streets partly situate in other Parishes.—The particulars below mentioned show the Orders which have been made from time to time under sec. 140 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the agreements which are in force with other Local Authorities with regard to streets partly in this Parish and partly in the adjoining Parishes. An Agreement, dated November, 1861, between the Vestries of Clerkenwell and St. Pancras, by which the entire width of Bagnigge Wells Road, now King's Cross Road, from the west Bide of Vernon Street to Baker Street is to be watered, cleansed and kept in repair by Clerkenwell, and the entire width from Vernon Street to Pentonville Road, and of Pentonville Road from the junction with King's Cross Road to tbe boundary between the Parishes of St. Pancras and Islington is to be watered, cleansed and kept in repair by St. Pancras. An Agreement, dated August, 1864, by which Clerkenwell maintains and repairs the whole of Goswell Road, in the Parish of Islington, and that portion of the City Road lying between the Obelisk and the Angel Hotel to the line formed by the then granite paving, and also tne roadway in Sermon Lane, Islington maintaining and repaiiing Liverpool Road from Sermon Lane to High Street, and High Street between Upper Street and the granite paving line above referred to. An Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works of 6th February, 1885, placing the carriageway of Goswell Road. to the north of Seward Street, entirely under the management of Clerkenwell, and to the south of Seward Street entirely under the management of St. Luke. An Order of the London County Council, dated 21st December, 1892, placing the portion of Clerkenwell Road, in the Parish of the Charterhouse, under the exclusive management of the Vestry of Clerkenwell. Proposed Repeal of Clerkenwell Local Acts.— At the passing of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1807, 41 it was thought that the Clerkenwell Local Act, under which the Guardians or Governors of the Poor administered the relief of the Poor, had been impliedly repealed, and the Board ceased to meet for some time, the Vestry transacting such business as was left to the Board. In consequence of difficulty arising as to the proper authority to collect the rates, legal opinion was taken, the Board of Guardians or Governors was revived, and that Board has since collected the Poor Rate, the Yestry collecting the Local Management Rates. This cumbrous mode of doing the parochial business led the Yestry in November, 1892, to request the Local Government Board to obtain the repeal of the 15 Geo. III., cap. 23, and 23 Geo. III., cap. 44.—the Clerkenwell Local Act and Amending Act, and to transfer all the remaining duties and obligations under the Act to the Vestry. The Guardians or Governors of the Poor concurred in the proposal. The following is an extract of the Local Government Board's reply:— The Board have had these Acts under their consideration, and it would appear that practically the only powers which the Guardians or Governors of the Poor now exercise under them are those relating to the collection and recovery of rates. It seems doubtful whether there is any sufficient reason for transferring these limited powers to the Vestry. It would appear to be preferable that the Local Acts should be entirely repealed, and that the rates should be made, collected and recovered under the provisions of the general law. If the Guardians or Governors concur in this view, the Board suggest that they should make formal application to the Board, under the provisions of section 2 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1867, as amended by section 3 of the 31 and 32 Vict., cap. 122, and section 9 ot the 42 and 43 Vict., cap. 54, to repeal the Local Acts referred to. The proposal of the Local Government Board appeared to the Yestry to perpetuate, though in another form, the dual authority which the Yestry's proposal was designed to do away with. Under the general law the collection of the whole of the rates, 42 together with several other duties, would have passed from the Vestry—an elected body—to the Overseers of the Poor—a nominated body. This appeared to the Vestry to be a retrograde rather than a progressive step, and they took no further action in the matter, preferring to wait until the formation of District Councils groups all departments of parochial administration under one elected body. Kiosks for Sale of Newspapers.—A letter was read in July from Messrs. Ward, Perks & McKay, Solicitors, asking, on behalf of the Newsvending Company, to be allowed to erect kiosks on the public way for the sale of newspapers, &c., similar to those in Paris and other Continental cities, and offering a rental of £5 per annum for each stand. The Yestry decided not to grant the application. Advertisements on Lamp-posts.—In October the Vestry had before them a letter from Heath's, Limited, submitting proposal for utilizing the columns of street lamps for advertising purposes, but they decided not to entertain the application. Technical and Industrial Institutions Act.— Northampton Institute.—In June, 1892, attention was called to the Technical and Industrial Institutions Bill, before the House of Commons, by which it was proposed to confer upon owners whose estates are in settlement power to convey land for such institutions, it being found that no such power at present existed. Clerkenwell was especially interested, as the proceedings for the establishment of the Northampton Institute were at a standstill owing to the want of statutory power on the part of the Marquis Northampton to convey the site he had promised. The Yestry, therefore, presented a 43 Petition to the House of Commons in favour of the Bill, and requested the Borough Members to support same, and asked the Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, to do all in his power to ensure the passage of the Bill. The Bill duly received the Royal Assent. Northampton Institute.— In October, 1892, the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., Vicar, suggested, with reference to the erection of the Northampton Institute, that a public improvement might be effected by a portion of the Institute site being given up for widening Ashby Street, an equivalent being taken in Lower Charles Street; Ashby Street being at present only 36 feet wide from house to house, while Lower Charles Street is 60 feet. The Vestry approved of the suggestion, and decided that the land to the south of the railing in Lower Charles Street, sloping down to the site of Taylor's Row, be given up for the purposes of the Institute, on condition of an equivalent being given on the north side of Ashby Street, for the purpose of widening that thoroughfare, and referred it to the Works Committee to carry out the arrangement when the proper time arrives. Poor Laws.—In October the Vestry received an invitation from the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, to a Conference of Guardians and Vestrymen in the Metropolis, to take into consideration the advisability of approaching the President of the Local Government Board on the question of the present Poor Law system. . The Vestry appointed two delegates to the conference, at which resolutions in favour of the following objects were passed:— (1.) "An equalisation of the Poor Rate over the whole of the Metropolitan area." 44 (2.) "The issuing of an order that all Boards of Guardians, at least one mouth before the Annual Elections, should issue a report showing their receipts and expenditure up to the preceding December 31st, as compared with the receipts and expenditure for the preceding 12 mouths." (3.) "The abolition of the Property Qualification for Guardians, the establishment of vote by ballot, and the abolition of the system of Plural Voting, also that the Returning Officer shall not be a servant to the Board." (4.) "The issuing of an order admitting the Ratepayers, as a matter of right, to the deliberations of the ordinary meetings of the Guardians." (5.) "The release, at an early hour, of able-bodied poor, compelled to seek a night's shelter in the Workhouse, when they desire to obtain work." The Conference also expressed the opinion that it is desirable that a Royal Commission be appointed to enquire into the working of the present Poor Law system. The resolutions were forwarded to the Local Government Board, and a reply was received stating that it was proposed that a Royal Commission should be appointed to consider whether any alterations in the system of Poor Law Relief are desirable in the cases of persons whose destitution is occasioned by incapacity for work resulting from old age. In November a formal Order was received from the Local Government Board, reducing the qualification of Guardians to £5 rateable value. The Vestry sent a letter in reply to the Local Government Board, expressing the opinion that the Order will be of little good unless accompanied by vote by ballot, and the abolition of plural voting. Immigration of Pauper Aliens.—In Sept., 1892, letters were received from Sir J. Blundell Maple, M.P., the Vestry of Islington, and the Clerkenwell Ratepayers' Association, suggesting that the Vestry urge upon the Government the necessity of stopping the immigration of pauper aliens, especially with 45 the view to the prevention of cholera ; and from the Vestry of St. Pancras, urging the necessity of steps being taken by the Government to prevent the immigration of pauper aliens from infected places. The Vestry expressed the opinion that the Government should be requested to take immediate steps to prevent the immigration of pauper aliens into this country from ports and places affected by cholera or other infectious diseases, and forwarded a copy of same to the Home Secretary. In October the Vestry of St. Margaret, Westminster, invited a Conference on the subject, to which Mr. Putterill, Mr. Walton, and Mr. Scheib were appointed delegates, which was held on the 22nd November, when a deputation was appointed to the President of the Local Government Board, but he replied that he did not think it necessary to see the deputation, and that the question of restrictions on such immigration is one for the Board of Trade rather than the Local Government Board. Insanitary House Property.—In July, a letter was received from the Board of Works for the St. Saviour's District, forwarding resolution asking their Member, Mr. Causton, M.P., to introduce a Bill into the House of Commons, on the earliest possible opportunity, to compel the owners of insanitary house property (occupied or empty) to put same in thorough repair; and failing the necessary work being done within three months of notice given, to give the Local Authorities power to do the repairs themselves, and for that purpose to raise the necessary capital and to hold the houses and collect the rents, paying the ground rent (if any), taxes and other outgoings, till they have recouped themselves. The Yestry referred the matter to the Sanitary Committee, who reported that, while agreeing that the suggestions of 46 the St. Saviour's Board deserve consideration, they would prefer to defer making any recommendation thereon until the suggested Bill is before them. Exmouth Street Market.—In the latter part of the year 1891, representations were made to the Yestry that on the opening of Rosebery Avenue to traffic, and the consequent diversion of traffic from Exmouth Street, that street should be allowed to become a market street. To this the Vestry assented, and in July, 1892, costermongers were allowed in the street, subject to the police regulations, and to certain further regulations made by the Vestry. It will be seen by the succeeding paragraph that the control of the Yestry has practically passed away. Costermongers.—A case of great importance on the subject of the occupation of streets by costermongers was decided by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge in the Queen's Bench Division, in the case of Summers v. The Holborn District Board of Works, that the provisions of the General Paving (Metropolis) Act, 1817, as regards costermongers are virtually suspended by the Streets Traffic Regulation Acts 1867 and 1868, and that the regulation of the costermongers in the streets has passed from the local authorities to the police. The Holborn District Board of Works convened a Conference at their Town Hall on the 16th March, to consider what course could be taken with reference thereto. The Yestry appointed Mr. Walton and Mr. Sans as their representatives, and the following resolutions were passed:— "That this Conference of Vestries and District Boards of Works, having taken into consideration the case of Summers v. The Holborn Board of 47 Works, is of opinion that all streets in which costermongers, street hawkers, and itinerant traders can, with safety to the public, carry on their business under the Police Regulations of 1869, should be scheduled after consultation with the local authorities; and that the Home Secretary be asked to receive a deputation to give effect to this resolution." "That the Secretary be directed to communicate with the Home Secretary, requesting him to receive a deputation and to name a date, and that the members of the Conference then present form the deputation." Widening of Old Street and Goswell Road.— In October, 1892, the Vestry referred it to the Works Committee to consider the desirability of taking further steps to bring about the widening of Old Street at its junction with Goswell Road and Clerkenwell Road, and of Goswell Road from Compton Street southwards, with power to go to the London County Council as a Deputation on the subject. A Deputation of the Works Committee accordingly attended a meeting of the Improvements Committee of the Council on the 16th November, and urged the necessity for the widening of Goswell Road as a Metropolitan improvement, and especially urged that the widening of the western end of Old Street, at the junction with Goswell Road, which was also under the consideration of the Council at the instance of the Yestry of St. Luke, should form part of one general scheme with the widening of Goswell Road, the cross traffic at the junction being so great that the omission of one would greatly mar the results of the other. Statistics of the traffic between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., on the 11th and 14th November were also taken and submitted to the Improvements 48 Committee. These statistics showed a total of 5,050 vehicles on the first clay and 4,857 on the second, besides 307 horses on the first and 250 on the second, and in addition a police return of accidents during the five years ending October 31st was also submitted. In March, 1891, the Improvements Committee recommended that Old Street, at its junction with Goswell Road, and the east side of Goswell Road, up to Willow Walk, should be widened, and the Vestry informed the Council of their regret that they had not seen their way to include the widening of the western side of Goswell Road in their proposal, and expressed the hope that the matter might be reconsidered. The Council, however, negatived the recommendation of their Committee, and informed the Vestry that, while recognizing the desirableness of the widening of Old Street and of other street improvements in London, they felt unable to take any measures for the purpose until an alteration shall have been made in the incidence of local taxation. London Owners Improvement Rate or Charge Bill.—The alteration in the incidence of local taxation sought by the London County Council before they deal with the above and similar improvements, was brought before Parliament by the London Owners Improvement Rate or Charge Bill, and the following extract from the annual report of the Parliamentary Committee of the Council gives the object of the measure, and the way in which it was dealt with in Parliament:— (5 ) London Owners Improvement Rate or Charge Bill. We have already in our report on the London Improvements Bill quoted the resolution of the Council of the 8th November, (see footnote) with regard to a incidence of a moiety of the oost of the Strand and Tower-bridge improvements, and the preparation of a separate 49 bill for creating an Improvement Rate or Charge on the owners of property. To give effect to this resolution, we prepared and submitted to the Council a bill with respect to the provisions of which we had passed the following resolutions:— (a) That the provisions of the bill be made wide enough to cover future repayments of capital borrowed in the past by the Council and interest thereon, as well as repayments of future capital and interest. (b) That power be taken by the Council to levy the owner's rate up to an amount not exceeding 4d. in the £. (c) That the amount to be raised in any year in respect of the owner's rate shall be applied as follows—(1.) To the payment of one half of the annual charge incurred in relation to the following specific improvements, viz., the new street from Holborn to the Strand, the southern approach to the Tower-bridge, and the Retherhithe-ferry; (2) To payments in respect of any improvements and works of public utility, effected or to be effected by the Council, charged or chargeable to capital account as permanent improvements. (d) That the charge on owners of property shall be deducted by every payer of rent from every receiver of rent pro rata. (e) That the amount of the rate shall be collected through the machinery of the local authorities, unless an agreement be arrived at with the Government for the collection along with the property tax. The bill having been amended and approved by the Council was introduced in due course, but when it came on for first reading on the 9th February a point of order was raised by Mr. J. Lowther, who objected to the bill being introduced or proceeded with as a private bill, on the ground that it was in contravention of the standing order 194, which, as amended by the late Government in 1891, is as follows:—"All bills promoted by the London County Council, containing power to raise money, shall be introduced as public bills; but after being read a second time by the House shall be referred to a Select Committee to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, in like manner as private bills." In the result the Speaker ruled that the introduction of the measure as a private bill could not be sanctioned. As the main object of the bill was to provide funds towards the carrying out of improvements, and it could not be proceeded with except as a public bill, it appeared to rest with the Government to deal with the matter and to take such steps as would enable the necessary funds to be raised, either by the introduction of a Government bill, by making some other provision as to. London taxation, or by the amendment or suspension of the standing order to allow of the Council's bill proceeding as a private bill. From the correspondence which passed between the late D 50 Government and the Council in 1891, it is apparent that the standing order in question was admittedly only framed to apply to the Council's annual money bill for the raising of capital in accordance with the Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1875, under which Act, by the arrangements between the Treasury and the Board in 1875, the Government until last year introduced the annual bill. We subsequently understood from communications made to the Government that they were not prepared to promote a public bill dealing with the matter, and therefore there appeared to be no alternative but to withdraw the Improvement Kate Bill. The resolution referred to:— "That a moiety of the cost of the improvement be paid out of any rate to be imposed by Parliament in respect of the ground values of property within the county of Loudon, and to be charged upon the owners thereof, with provisions that the same shall be incapable of being made the subject ot contract so as to shift the incidence there of; that a communication be made to the Local Government Board with a view to the introduction by the Government of a bill dealing with the subject in the ensuing session; that, notwithstanding anything contained in the resolutions of the Council. the Parliamentary Committee be empowered to embody in a separate bill provisions for creating an improvement rate or charge on owners of property, and that out of such charge provision shall be made for payment of one moiety of the cost of the improvement, und that the necessary notices be issued." London Improvements Bill.—This Bill promoted by the County Council provided for the formation of a new street from Holborn to the Strand and for subsidiary street improvements in connection therewith; for the southern approach to the Tower-bridge; for the widening of Wood-lane, Hammersmith; for the rebuilding of Vauxhallbridge; for a new ferry between Kotherhithe and Batcliffe; and for the improvement of the southern approach to Woolwich-ferry. In connection with the Holborn to Strand improvement, the Council proposed to acquire land in Clerkenwell on tho south-east side of Rosebery Avenue, between Rydon Crescent and Lloyd's Bow, and including Spa Cottages, and also the piece of land at the junction of Lower Calthorpe Street and King's Cross Road, to 51 provide for the erection of dwellings for persons of the labouring or poorer classes, whose dwellings would be removed for the purpose of the intended improvement. On the statutory notice from the Council, the Vestry expressed its dissent in regard to the proposal. The resolutions of the Council with reference to the new street from Holborn to the Strand, and approach to the Tower-bridge, provided that the scheme should not be proceeded with unless satisfactory provision were made with regard to payment for them. Difficulties arose with regard to the compliance of the Bill with the Standing Orders which, though ultimately surmounted, caused delay. The Bill was formally read a second time on the 2nd March, but the Council at the date to which this report is made up was considering whether the whole or any part of the Bill should be further proceeded with. Public Health (London) Act, 1891.—Bylaws.—Under this Act it became the duty of the Connty Council to prepare by-laws to be observed by the Sanitary authorities on the following subjects— By-laws under Section 16 (2). Fcr prescribing the times for the removal or carriage by road or water of any faecal, or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, and providing that the carriage or vessel used theiefor shall be properly constructed and covered so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid, and as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. As to the closing and filling up of cesspools and privies. As to the removal and disposal of refuse, and as to the duties of the occupier of any premises in connection with house refuse so as to facilitate the removal of it by the scavengers of the Sanitary Authority, 52 By laws under Section 39 (1). With respect to waterclosets, eartbclosets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of the Act. The proposed by-laws were submitted for the Vestry's observations, and amendments and additions were proposed therein ; but they had not come into force at the date to which this report is made.* The Vestry, as the Sanitary Authority, were also, under the Act, charged with the duty of making by-laws:— With respect to the keeping of waterclosets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. For securing the cleanliness and freedom from pollution of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles used for storing of water used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man. For the prevention of nuisances arising from any snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth or other matter or thing in any street. For preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughter house, knackers' yard, butchers' or fishmongers' shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence. For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. * The by-laws received the confirmation of the Local Government Board on June 28th, 1893. 53 As to paving yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling houses. The Local Government Board forwarded to the Vestry a set of model by-laws for the above purposes, which were carefully considered and amended in several particulars. They had, however, not come into force at the date of this report.* Factory and Workshop Acts, 1878 to 1891 Lists of Outworkers.—In December, 1892, the Vestry received a letter from the Local Government Board, forwarding, and asking the Vestry's active attentionto, an Orderrecently issued by the Secretary of State, under the Factory and Workshop Acts, requiring lists to be kept of outworkers in the following businesses, viz.:— The manufacture of Articles of Wearing Apparel The Cabinet and Furniture making and Upholstery work. The manufacture of Electro-plate. The manufacture of Files. which lists are to be open to the inspection of the Factory Inspectors and the Officers of the Sanitary Authority, with the view to the frequent inspection of the places where outworkers are employed. It did not appear clear to the Vestry whether the Sanitary Authorities or the Factory Inspectors were to bring to the notice of the employers concerned the Order and its requirements, and they therefore communicated with the Local Government Board, asking for further information the result being that Mr. Lakeman and Mr. Graves, two of the Factory Inspectors, had an interview * These by-laws were approved by the Local Government Board on August 11th, 1893. 54 with the Clerk on the 19th December, and stated that there need be no clashing of authority, that the forms in question might be served by the Sanitary Inspectors, and if they had been already served by the Factory Inspectors, the fact would only recall the attention of the employers thereto ; the object aimed at being that the Vestry's Officers should notify to the Factory Inspectors in cases where they found women and young persons employed, the Factory Inspectors notifying to the V estry any sanitary defects which they might find. Mr. Lakeman has since forwarded a considerable number of the forms referred to, and the Vestry have directed that the Inspectors shall serve them in any cases which come under their notice. A letter has been received from the Vestry of Chelsea, forwarding a report of their Medical Officer of Health upon the subject, in which he called attention to the fact that if the Vestry should attempt to carry into effect the practical working of the Order, it would be necessary for the Officers of the Vestry to call at the premises and inspect the copies of the lists of outworkers, and visit the business premises outside the Parish, as the outworkers in any trade are not likely to be confined to the Parish in which the chief place of business is situated, unless every Metropolitan Parish were to send to every other a list of premises in the parish in which outworkers in the specified trades are employed: that this co-operative method of obtaining the desired information would, if agreed upon, necessarily take up a good deal of time, and he suggested that a better method would be, either for the Home Office or the London County Council to organise a staff of inspectors for the work, whose duty it would be to inspect the lists of outworkers in these trades at the various chief 55 centres of business all over London, and to extract and forward a properly tabulated list to every Medical Officer of Health. The Yestry agreed with the suggestions made by the Chelsea Medical Officer, and forwarded a communication to the Home Office in support thereof. The Home Secretary replied that it was his opinion that the Sanitary Inspector or other Officer of the Local Authority should examine the outworkers' lists in their district, and extract the names and addresses as are resident within their jurisdiction. The Vestry however, went farther, and made arrangements for communication of the names and addresses of outworkers, working for Clerkenwell employers but residing elsewhere, to the Sanitary Authorities of the parishes of residence. The Sanitary Inspection of Workshops.— Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requires that every factory, workshop or workplace shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation, in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had to the number of persons employed or in attendance at such building, and also where persons of both sexes are, or are intended to be, employed, or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex. The Vestry have considered the question, and have come to the conclusion that, unless there are special circumstances in the case, water closets should be provided in factories, in the proportion of one for each twenty persons employed, and where there are employees of both sexes, one closet for each twenty of either sex, and they have instructed the Sanitary Inspectors accordingly. Under Clause 2 of the same Act, it is provided that any factory, workshop, or workplace, which is not a 56 factory subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, relating to cleanliness, ventilation and overcrowding, and is so overcrowded while work is carried on as to be injurious or dangerous to the health of those employed therein, shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act. The Vestry are of opinion that 250 cubic feet should be the minimum air space for each employee, this minimum being only permitted when careful regard is given to ventilation, and they have instructed the Inspectors accordingly. They have considered a letter from the London County Council, with which was forwarded a report of Dr. Hamer on the sanitary condition of workshops which had been inspected in various parishes in the Metropolis, asking what steps the Vestry was taking to carry out the provisions of the Act, and they replied that the Inspectors are carrying out such inspection, and stated the decisions of the Vestry with reference to closet accommodation and overcrowding above referred to. Cholera.—In August, 1892, the Vestry received a commimication from the Local Government Board that the Board had received information from the Consul General at Hamburg that Asiatic Cholera has broken out at Hamburg severely; and that, having regard to the large amount of traffic between Hamburg and this country and to the short time which may elapse between a person leaving Hamburg for England and arriving in London, the Board had deemed it necessary to take into consideration the question of the measures of a precautionary character which should be adopted in view of the possible introduction of the disease into London. 57 The Vestry immediately referred the subject to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, with instructions to issue to every family in the parish a handbill of precautions in view of the possible outbreak of Cholera in the district. A few days afterwards the Vestry received a letter from the Post Office Authorities, enquiring if they would undertake the disinfection and, if necessary, the destruction of parcels received from abroad by Parcels Post, and suspected of containing infected matter. The Vestry at once undertook to do the work to the extent of their ability at a charge of 6s. for each time the apparatus is used. Other precautions taken by them were the flushing of all courts at least once weekly; an arrangement with the New River Company for the supply of pure water from standposts, should it be deemed desirable in particular cases; and the appointment of five medical men, residing in different parts of the main parish, and of one in the detached portion, to undertake the special care of Cholera patients. They also met representatives of the Holborn District Board of Works with the view to taking concurrent action in regard to the parts of the respective parishes inhabited by the Italian colony, and this area was agreed to be within the following boundaries:—Mount Pleasant, Farringdon Road, Clerkenwell Road, and Laystall Street. The Joint Committee agreed that it was desirable that a house to house inspection of this area should be again made by the Sanitary Inspectors, who should be instructed to insist upon an air space of 300 feet per person for rooms used for sleeping only, and of 350 feet for rooms used for both living and sleeping. The Inspectors were further instructed to report to each other as far as possible cases of removal of infected persons from one parish to another. 58 On the 9th September, the Joint Committees paid an evening visit to the houses occupied by Italians in both parishes, especially to those in which ice-cream is manufactured for sale. They met again on the 13th inst., and passed the following resolution thereon:—That the Joint Committee having viewed the property occupied by Italians in their respective districts, find it with a few exceptions in a very fair sanitary condition, and in no case have they found icecream manufactured or stored in living rooms." Outbreak of Enteric Fever in South East London.—The Vestry in July received a letter from the London County Council, forwarding a report of Dr. Geo. Turner, lecturer on Public Health at Guy's Hospital, on an outbreak of enteric fever in the south-east of London, in which the disease was traced to the distribution of infected ice-creams by Italians living in Deptford, the ice-creams being prepared under conditions which certainly gave considerable opportunity for their contamination. The letter asked that special attention might be given to places in which food is prepared for sale, and particularly where they are occupied by persons who are less likely than others to be living under wholesome conditions. The Vestry therefore directed the Medical Officer of Health and Inspectors to pay special attention to premises in the Parish where ice-cream is made, and the Sanitary Committee made a night visit to the houses occupied by Italians on the 9th September, and found the places generally in very fair sanitary condition, and in no case did they find ice-cream manufactured or stored in living rooms. Sale of Old Clothes in the Streets.—In September, 1892, the Vestry had under their considera- 59 tion the possible danger of infections diseases being spread by the sale of old clothes in the streets, and communicated with the Local Government Board upon the matter. The Local Government Board replied, forwarding copies of Orders which they had issued prohibiting the importation of rags and clothing into this country, and stating that they did not see their way to the imposition of further restrictions. The Vestry therefore instructed their Sanitary Officers to give all possible attention to see that the Orders of the Local Government Board are carried out. Baths and Washhouses.—For the third time (the two previous being in 1874 and 1884), the Vestry appointed in November, 1892, a Special Committee to consider the desirability of the Yestry adopting the Baths and Washhouses Acts, and to report thereon, but at the date at which this report is closed the Committee had not reported on the subject. International Congress on Hygeine and Demography.—The last annual report contained a record of the appointment by the Yestry of delegates to attend this Congress in August, 1891, and the report of the delegates. The Vestry has since received a print of the transactions of the Congress contained in thirteen volumes. Bishop's Court.—The last Report stated that, with reference to the proposed pulling down of No. 6½, Bishop's Court as an obstructive building, under section 38 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, the Vestry had considered the matter, and adjourned the further consideration until after Bolton Court had been dealt with under the same section. A letter was received in December from 60 the County Council, expressing the hope that the Vestry would proceed in the matter as speedily as possible. This Vestry then again considered the subject, and informed the Council that in their opinion the very small improvement which the removal of No. 6½, Bishop's Court, would effect would not be commensurate with the cost of attaining it, but suggested that the neighbourhood of Bishop's Court would be a suitable one to be dealt with by the Council itself under Part I. of the Act. District Councils.—The year has passed without any progress being made to supplement the legislation of 1888, creating County Councils, by the creation of District Councils. A Bill to establish Parish and District Councils was introduced by Mr. Fowler, Pretident of the Local Government Board, on the 21st March, 1893, affecting bodies outside the Metropolis. In his speech on the first reading Mr. Fowler said "When the third reading of the Local Government Act of 1888 was agreed to, I ventured to say that that Act was the first volume of a great work. We are now asking the House of Commons to give its sanction to the second volume of that work. It will not, however, complete the work, for there still remains a large subject to be dealt with, viz., the Local Government of the Metropolis and the Unification of London." At the date of writing this report no further progress had been made with the measure. Completion of Rosebery Avenue.—The formal opening of the last section of Rosebery Avenue, between Garnault Place and Farringdon Road, took place on Saturday, the 9th July; in the presence of a large gathering of members of the London County 61 Council, members of the Vestry, and inhabitants; the ceremony being performed by J. Hutton, Esq., Chairman-Elect of the Council, in the absence of Lord Rosebery, who was unavoidedly prevented from being present as previously arranged. Mr. Hutton stated that the construction of the Avenue had been in hand since 1885, having been commenced by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and that the cost of the Avenue, which is 1,173 yards long, 60 feet wide, planted with trees on both sides, and has a subway for gas and water pipes, telephone wires, &c., throughout its entire length, was as follows:— £ s. d. Gross cost of the improvement 386,916 13 5 Less Receipts from sale of land 33,390 6 7 Net cost of improvement to 30th June, 1892 £353,526 6 10 He also stated that a further amount would be received in respect of land not yet disposed of. Gloucester Street and Sekforde Street. —On the 6th October, 1892, a Deputation of inhabitants attended the Vestry to urge that Gloucester Street be continued into Sekforde Street by the removal of the few houses which now intervene in Corporation Row, St. John Street, and Sekforde Street. The Vestry considered the matter, and had an estimate xnade of the cost of the proposed improvement, from which it appeared that such cost would amount to .£4,200, exclusive of trade interests or costs of paving. The Vestry considered that the advantage of the improvement was not commensurate with the cost, and took no further action in the matter. 62 Rosoman Street Improvement,—The Arti- zans', Labourers' and General Dwellings Company had commenced negotiations with the Vestry on the subject of widening Rosoman Street opposite Northampton Road, by setting back the proiecting houses, Nos. 46, 48 and 50; and the matter will be treated at greater length in the next Annual Report. Private Land round House of Detention. —From time to time the School Board have been asked by the Vestry whether they were prepared to give up the pieces of private land at the back of the "Jolly Coopers," Short's Buildings, and between St. James's Walk and Woodbridge Street, which form part of their property in the House of Detention site. A letter was received in December from the School Board, stating that the Board were prepared to hand over to the Vestry the two pieces of land in question, upon condition that the Yestry bear the expense of making them up. The Yestry accepted the offer, and have now laid the pieces in question with asphalte, making also a thoroughfare from Woodbridge Street to St. James's Walk, and putting an end to a long-standing cause of complaint of the condition of the ground. St. John's Burial Ground.—In December, 1892, the Yestry received a letter from the Parks Committee of the London County Council, stating that they had had under consideration the question of taking over the care of the Burial Ground of St. John's Church, Clerkenwell, but before expressing an opinion the Committee would be glad to be informed whether the Yestry would be prepared to contribute towards the cost of maintaining the ground. The burial ground in question, though belonging to St. John's Parish, is situate in the 63 Parish of St. Sepulchre, and the Yestry ascertained that a similar letter had been sent by the County Council to the Holborn District Board of Works. A joint meeting of the two Works Committees therefore took place. Mr. Millward and Mr. Fincharn, the Churchwardens of St. John's, were also present. The Churchwardens of St. John's produced an Order of the Charity Commissioners, dated 13th May, 1881, vesting the Burial Ground, which is Charity property, in Trustees, consisting of the Rector and Churchwardens of St. John's for the time being, and Messrs. Millward, Franklin, Gedge and Javens, the three latter of whom are now deceased. Mr. Millward stated that up to the present time the ground had been maintained and the caretaker paid by the Rev. W. Dawson mainly from his private purse, small grants having been made from time to time by the Yestry and the District Board, and he estimated the total cost of maintenance at about .£80 per annum. The Joint Committee were of opinion that the ground might be continued to be maintained by the two parishes concerned without the assistance of the County Council, and recommended that the Yestry and the District Board respectively contribute an annual sum of not exceeding £40 to the expenses of maintaining the ground; that the surviving trustees and two members from each authority form the Committee of Management, such grant to take effect from the 1st January, 1893. The Yestry and the District Board respectively adopted the recommendation, and Mr. Robson and Mr. Walton were appointed as the Yestry's representatives on the Committee. Coldbath Fields Prison Site.—The Yestry are still unable to report any decision of the County 64 Council with reference to the disposal of the £10,000 received by them for the purposes of an open space, under the provisions of the Post Office Sites Act. On the 5th January, 1892, the Council had replied to a communication of the Vestry that the whole subject was under their consideration. Nothing being heard in the meantime, the Vestry, on the 31st March, decided to again ask the Council to receive a Deputation on the subject. On the 27th May a Deputation waited on the Parks Committee accordingly. Mr. Churchwarden Robson addressed the Committee, and the Deputation came away satisfied that a favourable impression had been made on the Committee, and that it was their intention, if possible, that the money should be spent in Clerkenwell. The Committee asked the Deputation whether they had any suggestion to make where open spaces might be provided. They therefore made three suggestions for consideration—the ground between the new street and Hardwick Street; the second was the extension of the St. James' Churchyard; and the third was the desirability of extending the open space in the new street, Spa Green, as far as Eydon Crescent, and, as the latter land was in the possession of the County Council, there would be no difficulty in acquiring it, for they would be only buying their own. The Committee promised to come down with some of the members to view the grounds Nothing, however, appearing to be done, the matter was again considered by the Vestry in November and December, and they considered the question of what sites there were in the parish, where the sum could be expended for the purpose of an open space. Four areas were under the consideration of the Vestry, viz.:—The houses on Clerkenwell Green abutting on St. James' Churchyard; the old Workhouse 65 site, including Crawford Place ; the block of houses in Hard wick Street, Garnault Place and Rosoman Street; and the cleared ground on the south side of Rosebery Avenue, between Lloyd's Row and Rydon Crescent. Having regard to all the circumstances, the Vestry decided that a communication be made to the County Council, calling their special attention to the St. James' Churchyard site and the Rosebery Avenue site, as being, in the opinion of the Yestry, the two most desirable for the expenditure of the sum in question. Gallery of British Art.—Referring to the statement in last year's report on the action taken by the Yestry with the view of a central site being selected for the proposed Gallery of British Art, to be given by an anonymous donor to the Government, it will be remembered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that the offer was conditional inter alia, on the adoption of the South Kensington site, and that, therefore, the Government had not a free choice in the matter. This condition, however, from its difficulty, had the result of the offer being withdrawn. The Yestry of St. Saviour's, Southwark, invited Delegates to a Conference in April, 1892, to consider the advisability of taking further steps to secure Mr. Tate's offer (the name of the donor having then transpired), either by Deputation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the County Council, or in any other way which might be deemed expedient. The Yestry appointed Messrs. Robson, Sans, and Walton as their Delegates, and they were gratified to learn in January, 1893 that the Government had accepted Mr. Tate's offer to present his collection of pictures to the nation, and to build a Gallery for their accommodation, and that the matter had been satisfactorily settled. E 66 Playgrounds of School Board Schools.— In June, 1892, the Vestry received a letter from the Vestry of St. Saviour's, Southwark, in favour of the playgrounds of School Board Schools being open daily after school hours, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. till dusk. The Vestry agreed with such views, except in cases where schools are used on Sundays for purposes of instruction.. In consequence of the action taken by the local authorities, the School Board agreed to open such playgrounds as are needed on Sundays, owing to the want of open spaces, and where the opening will not disturb any Sunday tenancy, provided that means are taken to secure the rest of the school keeper, and that they have referred it to the divisional members to recommend suitable cases. Clerkenwell Detached.—At the close of last year the Local Government Board had intimated their intention to hold an enquiry under the Divided Parishes Acts, on suggestions made by certain inhabitants of Clerkenwell detached and Hornsey that such detached portion should be added to the Parish of Hornsey. The Vestry continued to receive complaints of the want of drainage, and urged the County Council to come to a settlement of the question, but they deferred further action pending the Enquiry. The Enquiry was held on the 25th and 26th October, by two of the Inspectors of the Local Government Board, Mr. Robert Hedley and Mr. E. P. Burd. The authorities represented on the occasion were the Vestry of Clerkenwell, the Hornsey Local Board, the Overseers of Hornsey, the Edmonton Board of Guardians, the Eriern Barnet Local Board, the Wood Green Local Board, the Middlesex County Council and the London County Council. Mr. B. 0. B. Lane, Q.C., appeared for the Vestry, The Memorialists to the 67 Local Government Board appeared, and urged that they were put to inconvenience by the existing state of things, and that no services were rendered to them in consideration of the rates which they paid. The Vestry, on the other hand, showed that they had expended on the area a sum of ,£2,770 in excess of what they had received, the difference being mainly for permanent improvements, and they submitted that if the area was to be transferred to an adjoining district, such district should recoup the Vestry the amount in question. The representatives of the adjoining districts objected to this proposal. On the 30th November the Local Government Board wrote, stating their intention of issuing an Order to attach the outlying portion of Clerkenwell to the Parish of Hornsey. By sec. 2 of the Poor Law Act, 1876, under which the enquiry was held, if one-tenth in number and rateable value of the ratepayers gave notice in writing of objection to the Order within three months after copies of it have been sent to the Overseers of the parishes affected, the Order would become provisional only. The Vestry thought it desirable that an expression of opinion of the inhabitants of Clerkenwell should be, if possible, obtained, and they called a public meeting of the inhabitants upon the subject. On the 23rd December the Local Government Board issued their Order, which was to take effect on the 24th March, 1893, unless it should in the meantime become provisional in pursuance of the statute above mentioned. A largely attended public meeting was held at the Amwell Street Schools, on the 25th January, and the following resolutions were passed almost unanimously:— "That this Meeting of ratepayers of Clerkenwell hereby expresses its objection to the Order of the 68 Local Government Board for the transfer of the detached portion of the Parish of Clerkenwell to the Parish of Hornsey, and hereby requests the Yestry to take the necessary steps to enable the ratepayers to give notice to the Local Government Board, in writing, of their objection, as required by sec. 2 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1876." " That in the event of such Order being carried into effect, provision should be made for a recoupment by the Parish of Hornsey of the balance of the outlay by the Parish of Clerkenwell for surface drains, road repairs, &c." "That the Hon.D. Naoroji, M.P., be requested to use his influence with the President of the Local Government Board to give effect to the foregoing resolutions." The Yestry thereupon took steps to obtain the signatures of one-tenth in number and rateable value of the ratepayers to an objection to the Order, and they received, through the rate collectors, the signatures of 1/274 persons occupying premises at a rateable value of £82,996. As the number of ratepayers is about 8,500, and the rateable value about £370,000, it will be seen that the statutory proportion of one-tenth was considerably exceeded. The objection was lodged with the Local Government Board on the 22nd March, that being within the three months of the issue of the Order, and Mr. Naoroji, M.P., was requested to ascertain, if possible, what course the Local Government Board proposed to pursue in the matter. The matter was at this stage at the close of the year to which this report relates. Electric Lighting.-In July, 1892, the Vestry received letters from the following Companies and 69 Firms, giving statutory notice of their intention to apply in the next Session for Provisional Orders for Electric Lighting in the Parish:— Messrs. Latimer, Clarke, Muirhead & Co. The Holloway Electricity Supply Co., Limited. The Islington & General Electric Supply, Ltd. No further steps were, however, taken by the Companies to carry out their intention. In December, 1892, the Vestry passed the following resolution:— "That, whereas the Brush Electrical Engineering Company, Limited, have with the consent and approval of this Vestry, obtained powers to supply this Parish with electric light and power, it be referred to the Works Committee to ascertain how far that would affect this Vestry in the event of such powers being sought on its own behalf; and also that the whole question of this Vestry undertaking the Electric Lighting in the Parish be referred to the Committee for immediate consideration and report." The Committee had not concluded their enquiries by the date at which this report closes. By Order, R. E. PAGET, Vestry Clerk. — . - «».

Dusting.—During the year 9265 loads of dust and 671 loads of trade refuse have been removed from the Parish. After sifting same, 152 freights of ashes and breeze, containing 9821 chaldrons have been removed from the Wharf, for which a sum of £558 0s. 1d. has been received, being an average of £3 13s. 8d. per freight, as compared with £3 6s. 4d., £3 6s. 10d., and £3 14s. 0d., for the three previous years. 21 freights of hardcore have been removed, for which barges have been hired at a cost of £95 14s. 6d. The following is a statement of the cost of disposal of the dust for the year:— 88  £ s. d. 9936 Loads of Dust sifted 786 0 6 Lest Rags, Bones, &c., sold 176 5 5 £609 15 1 21 Freights of Hardcore removed 95 14 6 Cost of Loading same 28 4 0 Tools 8 8 1 Removal of old Tins 9 8 2 141 14 9 751 9 10 9821 Chaldrons of Ashes and Breeze sold 572 17 10 Less Cost of Loading 122 15 3 450 2 7 Nett Cost £301 7 3 9936 Loads of Dust at £301 7s. 3d. is equal to about 7½d. per load against 10fd. last year, and l/2¼d. the previous year—a very satisfactory result. Street Sweepings.—During the year 8364 loads of street sweepings and dung were removed from the parish, 426 of which were collected on Sunday mornings. 189 freights were barged away at a cost of £183 4s. 6d. Watering.—Only a small part of the watering was done by the Vestry staff, but for 105 days between April 2nd and September 17th, an average of 5.9 horses per day were hired from Mr. Varney for the purpose at a cost of £324 3s. 9d. The following represents the cost of the watering for the 89 season of 1892, that for 1891 being added for the purpose of comparison:— Season 1891. Season 1892. Vestry Carmen's Wages £23 16 6 £21 9 0 Repairs to Water Vans 30 12 4 84 0 0 Keep of Horses, &c. 16 1 8 11 11 9 Cost of water and meter rent (3,926,000 gals.) 170 10 11 (5,020.000 palls.) 209 5 10 Repairs to Standposts 2 0 0 17 8 9 Horse Hire, including Wages of Drivers 240 9 0 324 3 9 £483 10 5 £667 19 1 A largely increased charge will be noticed for Repairs of Vans. This may be accounted for by the fact that for 1891, the actual cost of these Vans is recorded, while for 1892, a proportion of the contract for the whole of the rolling stock, viz., £7 per van for twelve vans, is charged. The extra number of days on which watering was done, and the increase of 1,094,000 in the number of gallons of water used, point to a much drier season in 1892 than in 1891. Four additional horses have been purchased with the view of reducing the large annual charge for hired horses. Horses.—On the 5th April, 1892, the horse "Dore," bought in 1880, and the horse "Finigan,' bought in 1889, were sold, having become unfit for the Vestry's work. On August 9th, the horse "Batchelder," bought in 1880, broke a blood vessel while at work in Compton Street, and died in a short time ; and on the 13th September, the horse "Brailey," also bought in 1880, was destroyed, having become unfit for further work. To replace these four, and to provide others to reduce the cost of hiring, eight horses have been purchased during the year as follows:— one on April 26th, one on April 28th, two on July 20th, and four on September 13th. The enlargement of the stud of horses necessitated a corresponding enlargement of the stable accommodation; the wheelwright's shop was therefore converted into a five-stall stable at a cost of £106 14s. 7d, 90 Repairs to Rolling Stock.—The necessity of taking the wheelwright's shop has resulted in the repairs to the vans and carts being done by contract, instead of by men employed direct. The wheelwright employed by the Vestry commenced business on his own account, and a three years' contract has been made with him to keep the vehicles in repair for the sum of of £7 per annum each, The cost for tho year has been £262 1s. 6d. as compared with £263 6s. 8d. last year. This year's price, however, includes a proportion for tho four new vans purchased, so that the actual cost is lower than previously. It is hoped that tho change will bo to the mutual advantage of the Vestry and the whoelwright. Storage for Vans.—It was found that the twelve water vans, which during the Winter stood under the dustshed, took up more room than could conveniently be spared, and the addition of four new dust vans compelled the Vestry to seek for more storage room, An advantageous site has been secured, on lease, in Rponcor Place, and a shod has been erected in which the vans can be stored, and much additional space has been thereby obtained at tho Wharf. Cartage.—The horses and carts have also been employed during the year in carting stone, refuse from 860 gullies, and rubbish. For cartage purposes, horses, carts and men have been hired during tho year from Mr. Varnoy, at a cost of £31 10s. Od. Vans aud Carts.—Four vans have been purchased at a cost of £50 each. The number of vans and carts belonging to the Vestry is—20 vans, 8 carts, 12 water vans, and 2 sweeping machines. Fodder.—Tho Fodder account amounts to £1158 1s. 8d., boing an avorage of 17s. 6d. per horse per week, an increase from last year of 1s. 5d. per horse per weok. This increase has been caused by an advance in tho price of fodder, especially of hay and clover; tho average price of hay being 80s. 9d. per load against 74s. 9d. in the previous year; of clover 101s. 6d. against 88s.; of straw 35s. against 82s. 8d.; and of oats 21s. 6d. per quarter against 21s. 4d.

The four additional horses and vans, the provision of the new stable, and the Spencer Place shod account together for over £650. Of the other items, the most noticeable are the increase in the fodder account of £225, and in the wages account £545, the latter being partly due to the additional men engaged for the additional horses, but principally to the increase of wages voted to the dustmen and carmen in January, 1892.

To the Vestry of St. James and, St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I do myself the honour or laying before you my Thirtyseventh Annual Report on the Mortality, &c., of the Parish during the year 1892. The number of deaths occurring from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1892 was 1,125. The annual average for the last ten years was 1,173, so that the deaths were 48 less than the average. The deaths in 1891 having been 1.171, those in 1892 were 46 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite;— deaths. births. 1883 1,172 2,402 1881 1,303 2,448 1885 1,195 2,390 1886 1,170 2,279 1887 1,216 2,363 1888 1,168 2,311 1889 1,033 2,277 1890 1,184 2,204 1891 1,171 2,222 1892 1,125 2,175 112 The births were 47 loss than in. the preceding year, but 132 loss than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 274 543 269 Amwell 262 521 259 Pentonvillo 292 523 231 Goswell 293 587 294 In each year a number of deaths of parishioners takes place in General and Special Hospitals, in the Workhouses, and in the Infirmary, all of which are extra-parochial. The number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals was 212; in the Workhouses, 122; in the Infirmary, 129; elsewhere, 21; making a total of 484. The numbers, causes, and ages of the deaths are given in the tables appended to this Report. The population of the Parish has increased by the occupation of new buildings, since the Census of 1891; but takiug the numbers of that Census, the intra-parochial mortality amounts to 18 per 1000; including the workhouse and infirmary deaths, to 20; and including the hospital deaths, to 23 per 1,000. The deaths occurring in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill, are enumerated with those of the Pentonville district. The mortality of all London during the year, was 20 per 1,000. That of the West districts being 10; the North district, 19; the Central districts, 23; of the East districts, 23; and of the South districts, 19. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in the Parish in 1892 was 119; 104 less than in the preceding year, The number and the causes of the deaths from zymotic 113 disease occurring in Clerkenwell during the last ten years are exhibited in the following table:— small pox. measles. scarlet fever. diphtheria. Whping. cough. typhoid fever. diarrhœa. totals. 1883 0 61 36 10 33 16 59 215 1884 6 48 15 12 69 7 79 236 1885 6 87 14 7 52 5 58 229 1886 0 18 8 4 42 7 93 172 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 1889 0 47 10 6 23 4 54 144 1890 0 33 5 2 64 6 62 172 1891 0 107 4 7 51 4 50 223 1892 0 40 3 6 39 9 28 119 Fifty-two deaths also occurred from zymotic diseases in extraparochial hospitals, viz.: 2 from measles; 18 from scarlet fever; 21 from diphtheria; 3 from whooping cough; 4 from typhoid fever; and 4 from diarrhoea. The average number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 195; so that the number for 1892 was 76 less than the average. It must be observed, however, that the deaths from those diseases occurring in the hospitals is larger than last year, showing that more of the cases are removed to hospitals than previously. The number of deaths arising from all causes in infants under one year was 347; extra-parochial, 52. 114 212 deaths occurred in the Parish at and above 60; 128 extra parochial. 17 deaths arose from violence. 116 inquest deaths were registered in the year, 41 more than in the preceding year; 19 extra-parochial inquests were held upor parishioners. In 20 large English towns the mortality in 1892 was 20:—In London, 20; Brighton, 19; Portsmouth, 18; Norwich, 20; Ply; mouth, 18; Bristol, 19; Wolverhampton, 21; Birmingham, 2; Leicester, 18; Nottingham, 18; Liverpool, 24; Manchester, 23; Salford, 24; Oldham, 22: Bradford, 18; Leeds, 19; Sheffield, 20; Hull, 19; Sunderland, 20; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 19. In Edinburgh the mortality was 19; in Glasgow, 22; and in Dublin, 29 per 1,000. Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself on September 26th, prior to licensing. There were 4 in the Upper Wards, and 5 in the Lower; and were kept by 9 butchers. They were found in good order, and no complaints were made of them during the year by the neighbours. Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. There were 5 in each district, and were kept by the same number of cow-keepers. They were in very good order, and the animals were fine and healthy; the cows were 42 in the Upper Wards, and 54 in the Lower. Bake-houses.—These were inspected twice in the year, viz. in May and December. They were 54 in number—27 in each district. Notification of Infectious Diseases.—741 notices of Infectious disease were made in the year :—4 of Small Pox; 370 of Scarlet Fever; 127 of Diphtheria; 48 of Typhoid Fever; 170 of Erysipelag; 19 of Membranous Croup; and 3 of Puerperal Fever. This is 90 more than in the preceding year, when the notifications were 651, 115 In regard to Erysipelas, I may well repeat what was stated in my last Report, viz.: "No second case occurred in any house.

APPENDIX I. 134 At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 19th December, 1893. "The Clerk called attention to the fact that "since the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor ',Rate, which duty had reverted to the Guardians "or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, "and which Board has been revived for the purpose "in November, 1871, there was no Poor Rate "Account published, except the remainder of those "in collection by the Vestry previous to that time, "and suggested whether it would not be desirable, "by an agreement between both Boards, to publish "the Poor Rate Account of the Guardians or "Governors as an appendix to the Annual Reports "of the Vestry, in which case there would be one "and a half years' Poor Rate Account to be "appended to the Report about to be issued for the "year ended Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by "Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved "and adopted." (Extract from Minutes). R. E. PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
