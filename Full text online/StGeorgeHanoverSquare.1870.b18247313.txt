TO THE Destry of St. George, Hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, During the year ended March 26th, 1870, 2265 births and 1836 deaths were registered in the Parish, including those of 285 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, 110 in the Workhouse, Mount-street; 38 in Little Chelsea Workhouse; 5 in the Belgrave Hospital for Children, and 2 in the Orthopaedic Hospital, Oxford-street. I am happy to report that the total mortality (1836) shows a decrease of 112 as compared with 1948 recorded in 1868-9, representing an annual death-rate of 20 per thousand, instead of 21*3 in the previous year. But deducting the deaths (292) of non-parishioners at the preceding hospitals, the death-rate at home was 16*8 per thousand, which is the lowest that has hitherto been obtained for the whole Parish, during the last 14 years. The annual death-rate throughout the Metropolis, during the same period, was 24. The highest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter of the present year, according to the following table:— 4 1st quarter, ending June 26th, 1869 418 2nd „ „ September 25th, 1869 409 3rd „ „ December 1869 449 4th „ „ March 26th, 1870 560 The quarter ending September 1869 was most fatal to infant life under 1 year of age when the deaths numbered 42; but in the corresponding quarter of 1868 they amounted to 60. New Industrial Dwellings and Schools. The five blocks of improved industrial dwellings which are in the course of erection in Ebury-street, Pimlico; on a portion of the estate of the Marquis of Westminster, and intended to provide 110 tenements of 2 and 3 rooms each, with 10 large shops, and to accommodate about 600 persons of all ages, are expected to be completed and occupied before Michaelmas next. The late Marquis of Westminster having granted the lease of a site in Ebury-square, Pimlico, 65 dwellings, with 4 shops, affording accommodation for about 330 persons, are already in course of erection, and it is hoped that they will also be completed and occupied before Michaelmas. The houses on the east side of the same square have been taken down, and the site is now occupied by large and commodious schools for St. Michael's District. Gatliff Buildings. Although the deaths in these dwellings were a very slight increase when compared with those which happened in the same period of last year, still we notice that four of them arose from consumption and that not one occurred from scarlet fever, which has been prevalent in the District. Taking the number of inhabitants at 621, which includes 250 children under 10 years of age, the death-rate was 22 per thousand. 5 No. Date, 1869. Age. Years. Months.

Scarlet Fever. The Registrar-General, in his Weekly Report dated January 8th, 1870, has stated that "the disease was therefore more fatal in London last year than in any previous year since registration commenced,—the nearest approach to so high a death-rate having been in 1863, when scarlet fever killed 171 persons to every 100,000 of the then population." This statement induced me to analyse the deaths in the Parish from this cause, and to publish the following Mortality Tables. The first one records the deaths during the four quarters of the past year, and the other includes those 6 which occurred between March 1861 and 1869. It is, however, to be noted that, in 1868, the West and Central Districts of London produced most deaths, which was reversed in 1869. Quarter. Total.

Mr. Tyrwhitt fined her 40s. Zymotic and other Diseases. The mortality from zymotic disease amounted to 319, against 366 of the previous year. The highest number of deaths was, from diarrhœa, (73), of which 51 were those of infants under 1 year of age, and 10 under 51, against 8 in the previous year; scarlet fever came next, 64 against 62; then whooping cough, 61 against 47; typhus fever, 43 against 34; pyaemia, 18 against 30, of which 15 were those of non-parishioners at St. George's Hospital; measles, 17 against 27; diphtheria, 8 against 17; erysipelas, 9 against 16; croup 9; thrush 5; syphilis 4; and small pox 1; tabes and scrofula destroyed 16 persons; consumption 247; lung disease 320; hydrocephalus, convulsions, and teething, 83. The highest mortality from zymotic disease happened in the quarter ending September 25th, 1869, when it destroyed 104 persons, of whom 56 succumbed to diarrhoea, and of these 38 were under 1 year of age. The deaths from accident or negligence numbered 68, 36 of which occurred to non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. Of the parishioners, the wife of a porter, aged 57, died from fracture of the skull, caused by falling down stairs at No. 3, John's-eourt, Farm-street. A gentleman, aged 44, died from fractured cervical vertebrae, at No. 15, Graham-street, Pimlico. An infant of 2 years was crushed to death by the wheel of a cart under which she 8 ran, in Commercial-road; the son of a coachman, aged 7 months,was run over by a Hansom cab, which was crossing the road in Chapel-street, Belgrave-square. A boy, at No. 77, Sutherland-street, aged 3 years, was wounded on the scalp by the crook of a baker's barrow, on which he was swinging, falling on him. A rivetter, aged 19, was drowned in the Serpentine, Hyde Park, while bathing; and a hairdresser, aged 22, fell into the river Thames, Grosvenor-road. Two infants, aged 2 and 3 months, respectively, were suffocated when in bed with their parents, the former at No. 60, Green-street, Grosvenor-square; and the latter at No. 3, "Westmoreland-place, Pimlico; an infant of 6 months by turning over on her face, when in bed, at Royal Oak-place, Elizabeth-street; another, of 4 months, when feeding from a bottle, at No. 54, Eccleston-place; and the daughter of a physician, aged 4 years, was choked at dinner, and died two hours after, at No. 17, Green-street, Grosvenor-square. A gentleman, aged 60, residing at No. 5, Chesham-place, fell from his horse, and died from the effects 9 months afterwards. A man, aged 55, at No. 37, New Bond-street, who suffered from disease of the brain and bed sores, after a railway accident. An infant of 10 months, at No. 28, Rutland-street, had his spine ruptured, caused by hanging between the seat and rail of a child's chair, in which he had been left sitting. A bricklayer, aged 57, from congestion of the brain, through falling down stairs at No. 88, St. George's-mews. A labourer, aged 26, whose lung was injured by a slab when at work; and the son of a cabdriver, aged 2 years, of Cambridge-terrace, from concussion of the brain, by falling in the passage of No. 13, Effingham-street, and striking his head against the door bolt. The wife of a chimney sweep, aged 30, died in the Workhouse, Mount-street; of hcemorrhage from a wound inflicted by her husband. A newly-born infant was found strangled with braid in the area of No. 6 Park-lane. A 9 young man, aged 28, shot himself with a pistol, when insane, in Hyde Park. A clerk, aged 42, committed suicide in the same manner, near Apsley House. A labourer, aged 79, wounded himself in the throat, at No. 20, Effinghamstreet; and a stone sawyer, aged 50, died in St. George's Hospital, from the effects of wounds in his throat, inflicted by himself, with a razor, at No. 3, Caledonia-street, Pimlico. A youth, aged 19, poisoned himself with prussic acid, in Hyde Park; and a wine merchant, aged 23, took oxalic acid, at No. 7, Cumberland-street. Three men, aged respectively 40, 45, and 63, drowned themselves in the river Thames, Pimlico; a fourth in the Thames, near Chelsea Hospital; a housemaid, aged 37, in the same manner, and a young woman, aged 19, and the widow of a bricklayer, aged 27, in the Serpentine, Hyde Park. An ostler, aged 45, was found hanging from a tree, in Kensington Gardens; a cabinet-maker, aged 18, from a rope on a beam in his workshop, in Horse-shoe-yard, Brook-street; and the widow of a farrier, aged 54, from a rope on the clock nail, at No. 1, Brewer's-place, Brewer-street. Of the deaths from "causes not specified or ill defined," 6 were those of newly-born infants, found on the pavement in Gillingham-street, outside the railings of Belgrave-square, in the Omnibus Yard, Eccleston-place, Hyde Park, in a travelling bag at the waiting room of the Victoria Railway Station, and in Kensington Gardens, respectively. Sickness. In presenting this subject, I have to acknowledge the voluntary assistance rendered to me by Drs. W. Griffith and Webb, Messrs. E. Jay, C. P. Ward, C. Connock, and S. Lee. The number of cases relieved by the Parochial and Dispensary Medical Officers in the Parish was 38,423. Of these, 21,560 were patients at St. George's Hospital. 10 It appears that the whole included 9 of small pox, 49 of chicken pox, 123 of measles, 145 of scarlet fever, 183 of whooping cough, 12 of croup, 698 of diarrhoea, 10 of dysentery, 187 of continued fever, 157 of rheumatic fever, 50 of erysipelas, 6 of diphtheria, and 8 of ague. There were 2,609 cases of bronchitis, 36 of pleurisy, and 90 of pneumonia. Vaccination in the Hanover and Mat-fair Sub-Districts. The following table shows the number of persons successfully vaccinated by Mr. Jay:— Under 1 year. Above.

Having received three communications from Mr. John Simon, the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, in October last, two of which related to the reappearance of relapsing fever in London, and the third containing precautionary measures against scarlet fever, I brought the subject before the notice of the Nuisances' Removal Committee. The recorded cases of relapsing fever admitted into various Metropolitan Hospitals from the begining of the year 1869 to October 15th, amounted to 141, but none of them belonged to this Parish, although the disease showed itself in 26 Unions, only one of which—that of Hendon— was outside the Metropolis. I subsequently ascertained that a patient who had been subject to much privation was attacked with the fever and removed to the hospital, on November 9th, from Thomas-street, Grosvenor-square. Threatened as the Parish was with the invasion of two epidemics, I drew up a paper, containing precautionary measures against them, which was printed and circulated throughout the Parish. A small sum so expended in conveying useful information is calculated to prevent the spreading of those diseases, to diminish mortality, and, consequently, much distress among families. Two women and 5 men, suffering from relapsing fever, were removed to the Hospital between December 13th and 31st inclusive. Five of the patients were tramps, and were sent from the Workhouse; the other 2 resided in Chapel-street and Brown-street, Grosvenor-square, respectively. The Report Book of the Infirmary, Mount-street, shows that 10 inmates, all of whom were tramps, suffered from the disease. The Foot and Mouth Disease. This disease, which attacks those parts of the cows designated in its name, is a specific fever, and is accompanied 12 by an eruption, which has been compared with that of chicken-pox. Having made its appearance on October 11th, among some cows kept in a shed in Elizabeth-street, Mr. Smith, the Vestry Clerk, sent my report to Mr Dexter, the Inspector of Cattle, who kindly informed me of the progress and decline of the disease. The symptoms, as usual, were mild, not proving fatal in this Parish. It affected the animals in several other sheds, but no complaint reached me of any injurious results arising from drinking the milk. The Serpentine. The important work of emptying and cleansing this river commenced in September. It is roughly estimated that the Serpentine occupies a space of 40 acres, and that it contained about 180,000 cubic yards of mud. Several years ago large quantities of lime were thrown, on two occasions, into the river, with the view of purifying the mud, and which, no doubt, had the effect of neutralising much of its poisonous qualities. But of late years the stench, especially on very fine and hot days, when the public naturally flocked to its vicinity in greater numbers than usual, became intolerable,—not only neutralising the pleasure which would otherwise be desired from a stroll along its banks, but actually endangering the public health. A great outcry was made when the operations for emptying the lake first commenced, during a few unexpected warm days, but no increase of fever took place in my District, although situate in its immediate neighbourhood. The mud has caused the deaths of many persons by their sinking into it and by preventing others from making an effort to save them by diving, lest they should be similarly imbedded, but, when the present operations are finished, a man may plunge into the water in order to rescue a fellow-creature's life with much greater security, and it is to be hoped that 13 bathers may be prudent enough to select in future such spots as may be free from danger of drowning. The following arrangements were made, among others, for drawing off the water by means of the existing sewer which passes close to the north-east corner of the Serpentine, and near the present outfall:— (1.) For drawing off water from time to time and draining the mud with the whole bed of the lake by various means, until the mud should be of sufficient consistence to be moved; the work of moving the mud not to be commenced until it is thoroughly drained and consolidated. The exposed surfaces to be deodorized by spreading over them lime, fresh earth, or burnt ballast. (2.) For providing a new outfall, by laying in concrete a 3 feet cast-iron discharge-pipe from the lake, and connecting the same with the existing sewer. (3.) For supplying water through a cast-iron 24-inch pipe, from the Grand Junction Waterworks Company's mains in the Bayswater-road, to a point in the lake near the fountains. (4.) For taking out the whole of the mud from the part of the Serpentine within Kensington-gardens (i.e., west of the bridge), forming the bottom so as to give a depth of 4 ft. 6 in. in the middle and 4 ft. at the bottom of the slopes at the north end, and 5 ft. in the middle and 4 ft. 6 in. at the bottom of the slopes near the bridge, and covering the slopes, and the top to be protected by a brick at one end; and the footpaths to be made good with a surface of hard binding gravel. (5.) For taking out sufficient mud from the bed of the Serpentine, on the east side of the bridge, as to leave a depth of water in the middle of the lake of 14 feet near the centre outfall and of 8 feet near the bridge, or as near those depths as possible, for forming slopes at an inclination of 6 to 1 for a depth of 5 feet, and to make the fall from 14 near the bridge to the outfall end continuous, and filling in over the top of the mud, when sufficiently consolidated, an average depth of 1 ft. 9 in. of compact clay and gravel. Such is the general outline of the alterations to be carried out for improving the Serpentine. I have caused an analysis to be made of two samples of the mud, which was free from smell; while the vegetable organic matter after drainage was insufficient to affect the public health during its removal into pits. In my last Annual Report to the Yestrv, pages 14 and 15, I published a correspondence between the then First Commissioner of Works, Lord John Manners, and myself, in which Mr. George Russell, the Assistant-Secretary, states that "the best means of making and keeping it—the Serpentine—pure and safe are now under considerationbut the specification which was strongly adhered to by Mr. Ayrton, allowing the mud to remain and the lake to be 14 feet deep, would have rendered it impure and unsafe. It has, however, been since determined to remove all the mud and to fill up the gap, which takes away part of the sting; while the House of Commons has unfortunately determined by a large majority not to diminish the depth; so that, while I remain your Medical Officer of Health, it may be my painful duty to record annually several deaths which might have been prevented. Sanitary Improvement. The number of cases entered and investigated by Mr. Longland, of complaints made by the Medical Officer of Health, the ratepayers, and himself, was 723; verbal notices given, and orders served, 176; summonses taken out, 6; magistrates' orders, 4; orders by Committee to summon, 10; slaughter houses, 25; cowsheds, 10; marine store dealers, 25; bakehouses, 85. The last four are frequently 15 inspected as to their cleanliness and the removal of refuse, and are lime-whited when necessary. Workshops' Regulation Act. This Act is so framed as often to cause confusion when proceedings are taken at the Police Court. For example, the 4th clause of 6th section enacts that "No child, young person, or woman shall be employed in any handicraft on Sunday, or after two o'clock on Saturday afternoon," &c.; hut the 2nd clause of the 9th section, under the head of "Permanent exceptions," directs—"That, in any workshop in which it is satisfactorily proved that work does not commence before the hours of seven or eight in the morning, children, young persons, and women may be employed on Saturday, or any other day on which the weekly half holiday is given, from the hours of seven in the morning to three in the afternoon." Hence, one clause is an ambush for the other. Again, the 4th clause, already quoted in part, after the words "Saturday afternoon," thus proceeds,—"except in cases where not more than five persons are employed in the same establishment," &c., &c. This exception, of course, applies only to Saturday afternoon. Now it may be contended that such limitation leads to an evasion of the Act. Suppose a complaint is made against A for employing young women beyond the legal hours, I visit the premises and find ten young women there, five in the show room, and five in the work room, working beyond the proper time, and some of the five in the show or sale rooms are evidently sewing, and although I ascertain that four more are employed in a work room "over the way," I cannot exclude A from the benefit of the exception; but the Factory Act provides against such evasion by combining the workshops situate in different places—a provision which it would be well to insert in an amended Workshops' Regulation Act. 16 Forty-six establishments were visited against fifty-eight of the previous year, and it was necessary to caution eighteen of the owners against infringing the Act in future—while thirteen were convicted—one being the manager of a model establishment, superintended by a committee of ladies of rank, leaving eleven against whom there were no grounds for complaint. Two more convictions would have occurred, had not the young women whose evidence I took been summarily dismissed, in one case, on the day the summons was taken out, so that, without knowing their addresses, they could not be called as witnesses; and, in the other, the three witnesses gave either false evidence to me, or committed perjury afterwards in the Police Court, Marlborough-street. One of them, however, did admit working beyond the legal hours on a certain day, showing that in her there was a particle of truth; but the charge naturally fell to the ground, with such lying and evasion. I am sorry to record this instance of failure on account of untruth; but, at the same time, it is the only example that has come under my notice. I can, therefore, testify to the general truth of the women, who must be sometimes placed in very trying circumstances from intimidation and threats of being dismissed by some of their employers, unless they can be suborned to give false evidence. Fortunately I have heard threats used but by few of the employers, while the threatened have stood firm, although risking the loss of their situations. A great many of the employers in my district consider the Act to have been very useful. The following is a list of the thirteen persons convicted as against 5 during tb e corresponding period of the previous year:— 1. Madame Armandine, dressmaker and milliner, New Bond-street, April 21st, 1869, at Marlboroughstreet; fined 40s. 2. Mrs. Huddart, dressmaker and milliner, of Grosvenor-square, April 21st, 1869, at Marlboroughstreet, fined 40s. 17 3. Mr. John Williams, Lupus-street, Pimlico, April 28th, 1869, at Westminster; fined 30s. and costs. 4. Mrs. O'Grady (alias Fletcher), of South Audleystreet, on May 12th, 1869, at Marlborough-street; fined 40s. 5. Miss Margaret Graham, of Conduit-street, on May 12th, at Marlborough-street, was fined 40s.; and pleaded guilty, on June 16th, to 2 summonses for a similar offence, and was fined 40s. and costs in each case. 6. Mrs. J. H. Hilton, No 54, Brook-street, Grosvenorsquare, May 21st, at ditto; fined £3 and 8s. costs. 7. M. Jules Leblond, No. 147, New Bond-street, June 4th, at ditto; fined 40s. and costs. 8. Mrs. Jessie Pettit, No. 65, New Bond-street, June 4th, at ditto; fined 20s. and costs 9. Madame Devy, of Grosvenor-street, on June 16th, at ditto; fined 10s. and costs. 10. Madame Le Jeune,of George-street, Hanover-square, on June 30th, at ditto; fined 20s. and costs in 2 cases. 11. Madame Golay, of Davies-street, Berkeley-square, June 30th, at ditto; fined 20s. 12. Mr. Henry Richards, wigmaker, No. 71, Daviesstreet, Berkeley-square, on August 25th, at ditto; fined 10s. and 8s. costs. 13. Messrs. Richards & Rogers, dressmakers, No. 71, Davies-street, Berkeley-square, August 25th, at ditto; in each case fined 10s. and 5s. costs. The carrying out of this Act has occupied a good deal of time during the last two years, but it is satisfactory to find that it is workable in this Parish, and has produced beneficial results. Ladies, however, should assist in this good work, by giving more time to the milliners and dressmakers for executing their orders. Table II shows the establishments which have been visited. 18 Gas. One hundred and ninety observations were made during the year upon the four gases supplied by the London and Equitable Companies, at No. 73, Bessborough-street, and Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard required by the Act, except on August 18th, 1869, when the cannel gas of the London Company, and on January 18th, 1870, when the common gas of the London Company burnt at the rate of only 4*5 feet per hour, on account of defects in the meter. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper, except on August 18th, October 12th, 1869, and January 18th, 1870, when the common gas of the London Company presented slight traces of ammonia. On November 8th, 1869, I tested some fish-tail burners supplied by the London Gas Company to the street lamps in Belgravia, and found that they passed the stipulated quantity of gas. The following Table gives the average light monthly in sperm candles of all the gases:— London. Equitable. Cannel 23.56 25.27 Common 14.60 14.16 A Table and Summary were sent with each Monthly Report on the Gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations, and the pressures, with the dates, and the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.
