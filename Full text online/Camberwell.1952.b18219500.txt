AC 4376 Library METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF CAMBERWELL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1952 HOWELL W. BARNES, B.A., M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H. Printed by MERRITT & HATCHER LTD London. CAM 47 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Camberwell, S.E.5. August 4th, 1953. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report for 1952 which has been prepared in accordance with the terms of Ministry of Health Circular No. 2/53, dated 22nd January, 1953. There was no serious epidemic of infectious disease and the health of the Borough maintained a satisfactory level. The population, according to the Registrar-General's estimate for mid-1952, showed a further increase of 1,700 over the estimated figure for the previous year. The general death rate showed a decrease from 13.5 in 1951 to 12.2 last year. There were also decreases in the infantile, maternal and tuberculosis mortality rates; the infantile death rate of 23.6 per thousand live births being the lowest ever recorded in Camberwell. The birth rate of 16.1 per 1,000 of the population was three points lower than that for the previous year. The housing situation continued to improve and most of the war-damaged property in the Borough has now been repaired and brought up to a reasonable condition for habitation. Some of the older premises, however, give rise to considerable difficulties as they are not repairable at a reasonable expense in view of the high cost of building repairs. Is is not possible to use extensively the powers conferred on the Council under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, until suitable and sufficient alternative accommodation is available for the tenants of the houses which would be demolished by such action. Every effort is being made, therefore, to keep these dwellings in a reasonable state of repair by taking action under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, to ensure that serious nuisances, such as defective roofs, receive attention. By arrangement with the London County Council, slum clearance operations were re-commenced during the year and three areas comprising 26 houses were represented. These were in addition to the Picton Street Clearance Area which is being dealt with by the County Council. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Members of the Council for the co-operation and consideration they afforded me throughout the year. I should also like to express my appreciation for the loyal and efficient service so willingly rendered by the Staff of the Public Health Department. Their help was particularly praiseworthy in view of the difficulties experienced in recruiting sufficient and suitable officers to carry out the important and onerous duties which inevitably fall upon the Public Health Department of a large metropolitan borough. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient Servant, H. W. BARNES, Medical Officer of Health. Staff of the Public Health Department at the end of 1952 Medical Officer of Health : H. W.

Population. The Registrar-General's estimated mid-year population of Camberwell was 181,200, which shows an increase of 1,700 over the estimate for mid-1951. The Census figure in April, 1951, was 179,729. Births. The birth rate for the year 1952 was 16.1. This is three points lower than that for the previous year, but is still very much above the pre-war figure of 13.9 in 1938. The number of births during 1952 allocated to this Borough are set out in the following table : — Live Births Still Births Total M. F. M. F. M. F.

The number of deaths of Camberwell residents during 1952, after adjustment for inward and outward transfers, was 2,212 or 12.2 per thousand of the population. This was 212 less than in 1951 in spite of the number of deaths which resulted from the dense fogs at the end of the year. The following table shows the deaths classified by causes and age groups : — TABLE SHOWING CLASSIFIED CAUSES OF DEATHS IN AGE GROUPS IN CAMBERWELL DURING 1952. Causes of death. Sex.

The death rates for England and Wales, London and Camberwell during the past five years are as follows : — 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 England and Wales 12.5 11.6 10.8 11.3 11.7 London ... ... 12.6 11.8 13.1 12.2 11.6 Camberwell ... 12.2 13.5 11.9 11.3 11.4 Infantile Mortality. There were 69 deaths of infants under one year, 49 of which occurred within four weeks after birth. The infantile mortality rate of 23.6 per thousand live births is the lowest ever recorded in this Borough. The previous lowest was 24 in 1949. The infant death rates for England and Wales, London and Camberwell for the past five years are set out in the following table :— 1952 1951 1949 1950 1948 England and Wales 27.6 29.6 29 32 34 London ... ... 23.8 26.4 26 29 31 Camberwell ... 23.6 25.7 27 24 31 7 Maternal Mortality. Two maternal deaths occurred in Camberwell during 1952 —one from obstetric shock following an operation and the other from pulmonary embolism due to phlebo-thrombosis of the right leg following parturition. This represents a death rate of 0.67 per 1,000 total births, the second lowest figure ever recorded in the Borough. The lowest maternal death rate was in 1950 ; in that year there were also two deaths, but the slightly lower death rate was due to the fact that a larger number of births were registered. Sickness among the Council's Permanent Employees. In addition to the medical examination of candidates for appointments on the Council's official establishment, the Medical Officer of Health undertakes the medical examination of the Council's employees for admission to the Sickness Pay Scheme or the permanent staff and of any employees who have been absent from duty owing to illness for a period exceeding fourteen days. A brief survey of the rate of sickness absence of permanent employees of the Council during 1952 has been carried out and the findings are summarised in the following tables. This survey could not be extended to temporary employees in view of their fluctuating numbers. Table A shows, by age groups, the total number of permanent men employed, the percentage sickness rate, the average number of days' sickness for each man sick and the average number of days' sickness per man employed. The sickness rate is the total number of days lost owing to illness expressed as a percentage of the potential number of man-days per year. For statistical purposes, the potential has been assumed to be 300 working days per year per man employed.

It is not possible to suggest a reason for this rise, as the rate is based on only one year's record and the number of employees in this age group was rather low as compared with the following age groups up to 60 years. Similar figures have been prepared separately in respect of men employed in sewers to see whether the nature of their employment has any effect on the amount of illness. It is interesting to note that the sickness rate and average length of sickness among men employed in the sewers are lower than the figures for the Council's permanent employees as a whole. There is no indication, therefore, that employment in the sewers tends to give rise to a greater risk of sickness. As the permanent staff employed in sewers totalled only 23, figures for each age group have not been prepared as the percentages in respect of such low numbers might be misleading.

Water Supply. Every dwelling house in Camberwell is provided with a water supply direct from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Following complaints as to the purity of the water supply in a dwelling house, two samples were submitted for bacteriological examination, one of which was also examined chemically. Both were found to be satisfactory. Seven of the Borough's wells are in operation but the water drawn from them is used only for industrial purposes. Water Certificates. Water certificates issued during the year under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, numbered 58, involving 524 new dwellings. Drainage and Sewerage. Ninety-five applications were received during the year for approval in respect of the drainage of new buildings and alterations tions to the drainage of existing buildings. Sewers reconstructed totalled 595 yards ; 44 brick road gullies were replaced by pot gullies and 55 defective pot gullies were renewed. Public Cleansing. The Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who is the officer responsible for this service, has kindly furnished the following information:— Amount of house refuse (including salvage and kitchen waste) collected during the year ... ... ... 42,391 tons Method of disposal ... ... ... Removed by barges from Honduras Wharf, Bankside, to a controlled tip. Frequency of collection... ... ... Weekly from dwelling houses and twice-weekly from blocks of flats and tenements. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Emission of Smoke. The expression "smoke," as defined by the above Act, includes soot, grit and gritty particles. Private dwellings are exempt from action under this Act. It is not generally known that action may also be taken with regard to smoke under common law procedure for the purpose of securing both an injunction and damages. Forty-one complaints were received during 1952 of alleged nuisances from the emission of smoke from factory chimneys. The district sanitary inspectors kept 44 observations but it did not become necessary to serve any Intimation Notices nor to institute legal proceedings in any instance. The smoke fog of December 5th-8th, which occurred throughout London, not only caused great suffering but affected seriously the health of the occupants of the Borough and was the cause of a sharp increase in the number of deaths from respiratory diseases. The deleterious effects of smoke and other air pollution are well known and can only be remedied by increased production of smokeless fuels and the establishment of smokeless zones throughout the country. In December of the year under review the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee invited the constituent Councils to co-operate with the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Society by setting up stations in their areas for measuring and recording the extent of atmospheric pollution. The Council agreed to set up such a station in Camberwell and at the end of the year consultations had been arranged between officers of the Public Health Department and the Fuel Research Station, Greenwich, with a view of arranging for the purchase of the appropriate equipment and the selection of a suitable site. Bombed Sites and Static Water Tanks. The number of bombed sites in the Borough is being steadily reduced by the progress of the housing programme, and in consequence complaints concerning nuisances arising on such sites have diminished. An open site at the corner of Coldharbour Lane and Crawford Road, however, gave rise to some concern among local residents as it was used on occasions by persons occupying moveable dwellings, viz., motor coaches converted into caravans. Close supervision was exercised by the sanitary inspector for the area to ensure that there was no infringement of the Council's By-laws relating to such vehicles and it did not become necessary to take any statutory action to secure the abatement of any nuisance. All the static water tanks in the Borough were kept under observation, particularly during the warm weather, and where public health nuisances arose, prompt action was taken to eliminate the cause. In three instances, it became necessary to completely empty and cleanse the tanks. Noise Nuisances. Three complaints were received during the year that the noise of machinery at factories was giving rise to annoyance to residents in the vicinity. These were investigated and the proprietors of the factories concerned were advised as to the best means of reducing the noise. In each case alterations were carried out or additional machinery installed which proved effective in mitigating the nuisances. Nuisances from Pigeons. A complaint was received during the year with regard to an excessive number of pigeons in the vicinity of Court Lane Gardens, which it was alleged was giving rise to a nuisance and causing damage to property. The Public Health Committee authorised the Borough Engineer and Surveyor to arrange for the destruction of the birds. Swimming Bath Waters. During 1952 samples of swimming bath water were taken for bacteriological and chemical examination from the Council's baths, as follows : — Bacteriolo- gical Examination Chemical Examination Camberwell Front Swimming Bath ... ... 7 7 12 12 Camberwell Rear Swimming Bath ... ... Dulwich 1st Class Swimming Bath ... ... 5 5 Dulwich 2nd Class Swimming Bath ... ... 6 6 Totals ... ... ... ... ... 30 30 The reports on these samples indicated that the waters were maintained in a satisfactory condition, but owing to the build-up of organic matter in the water of the Dulwich 2nd Class Bath in July, it was considered desirable that this water should be renewed. The bath was accordingly emptied, cleansed, and refilled. In addition to the above, three samples of water from the Swimming Bath at the Mary Datchelor Girls' School were obtained for bacteriological and chemical examination and found to be satisfactory. The Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. Under the provisions of this Act all premises used for the manufacture and/or storage of filling materials to which the Act applies are required to be licensed by the local authority and certain premises where such materials are used in upholstering, stuffing or lining bedding, toys, baby carriages, etc., must be registered with the local authority. At the end of the year there were no premises in the Borough used for manufacture or storage, but there were 8 entries in the register of premises where trades were being carried on involving the use of these materials. The Sampling Officer obtained 22 samples of filling materials for submission to the Prescribed Analyst, all of which were reported to conform to the standards of composition and purity laid down in the regulations made under this Act. The following table indicates the number of samples of each type of filling material examined : — Rag flock (loose) ... ... ... ... ... 7 Rag flock (layered) ... ... ... ... ... 2 Woollen mixture felt ... ... ... ... ... 3 Jute wadding ... ... ... ... ... 1 Grey wadding (cotton felt) ... ... ... ... 2 Cotton felt ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Hair (loose) ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Hair (pad) ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Fibre (loose) ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Coir fibre (Pad) ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Total ... ... ... ... ... ... 22 Offensive Trades. The district sanitary inspectors supervised the following five premises in the Borough which are registered for the conduct of offensive trades : — Skin dressers ... ... ... ... ... ... 4 Soap boilers ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 It became necessary to draw the attention of the proprietors of one factory engaged in skin dressing and dyeing to nuisances arising from noise, formaldehyde vapour and trade refuse (fur residue) and a copy of the London County Council By-laws relating to such trades was forwarded to them. On the authority of the Public Health Committee this was followed by the service of a Statutory Notice, with which they complied. Rag and Bone Dealers. No complaint or nuisance arose during the year in connection tion with the 8 premises in the Borough where the business of rag and bone dealer is carried on. Shops Act, 1950. The provisions of the above Act relating to temperature and sanitary accommodation in shops are the responsibility of the local sanitary authority. Four-hundred-and-two visits of inspection were made by the district sanitary inspectors during the year and one notice was served in respect of infringements of the statutory requirements. No applications were received for exemption certificates in accordance with Section 38 (6) of the Act. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. Sellers of poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List prepared under the provisions of the above Act are required to be registered with the local authority. New applications for registration received during the year numbered 30 and there were 172 applications for renewal of registrations. The district sanitary inspectors supervised the shops concerned to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act but it did not become necessary for any statutory action to be taken by the Public Health Department. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The number of district sanitary inspectors employed was below the authorised establishment during the whole of 1952. At the end of the year the retention of the services of the existing inspectors and the filling of vacancies was beginning to give cause for anxiety. The number of complaints received during the year was 5,289, and the sanitary inspectors made a total of 34,440 visits of inspection.

This Act, which came into operation on 1st April, 1952, provides that no person shall keep a pet shop, except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The local authority is empowered to grant such licences on payment of a fee subject to compliance with such conditions as may be specified in the licence, having regard to the need for securing : — (a) that animals will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable as respects size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness; (b) that animals will be adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals ; (c) that animals, being mammals, will not be sold at too early an age; (d) that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious diseases ; (e) that appropriate steps will be taken in case of fire or other emergency. For the purposes of this Act an "animal" includes any description of vertebrate. In order to secure uniformity throughout London in the conditions to be specified in licences granted under this Act, the matter was referred by the Council to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, who subsequently submitted the following list of conditions which were adopted by the Council:— 1. No animal shall be displayed so as to expose it to interference or annoyance by persons or animals. 2. Every animal shall at all times be kept in accommodation suitable for the species of animal as respects size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness. 3. All animals shall be adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and visited at suitable intervals. 4. No animal shall be sold unweaned, or, if weaned, at an age which it should not have been weaned. 5. All reasonable precautions shall be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious diseases and, in particular, no animal which is suffering from or could reasonably be suspected of having been in contact with any other animal suffering from an infectious disease shall be brought or kept on the premises unless it is properly isolated. 6. Animals, goods and equipment shall not be placed or kept outside the shop so as to render ingress or egress difficult in case of fire or other emergency. 7. A supply of water and sand and/or an efficient fire extinguisher must always be available on the premises. In the case of lock-up premises, the licensee shall appoint a responsible person residing within a reasonable distance of the premises to have custody of the key outside business hours. The name and address of such person shall be displayed in legible characters on the front door or windows of the premises and be notified to the local police. 8. Animals shall not be handed to customers in paper bags or other unsuitable containers. 9. Where animals are kept in cages, hutches, boxes or other receptacles placed on top of other cages, hutches, boxes or other receptacles effective means shall be provided for preventing water, food or other droppings falling on to or contaminating the animals or receptacles which are underneath. On the receipt of applications for licences, the Council's sanitary inspectors visited the premises concerned to ascertain whether they were suitable in all respects for the purpose of a Pet Shop, and periodical inspections were made following the issue of licences to ensure that the conditions laid down therein were being observed. No infringements of the Act were reported. Eighteen licences were granted during the year and at the end of the year there were 14 licensed Pet Shops in the Borough, tour having discontinued business. GENERAL PROVISION FOR HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA. Welfare of Aged Persons. The Council provides financial assistance to the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association to enable them to carry out their various activities for the care of the aged. Office accommodation is also provided at the Town Hall for the Organising Secretary of the Association. Meals on Wheels and Dinner Clubs. There are two dinner clubs in the Borough where old people may attend and purchase a meal at reduced cost —one at the U.G.S Settlement, Staffordshire Street, Peckham and the other at the Women's Voluntary Services, 47 Camberwell Church Street, S.E.5. The "Meals on Wheels" Service provides for those elderly persons who are too frail or incapacitated to cook for themselves or attend a dinner club. The whole of the Borough is covered by this service, which is conducted in conjunction with the Women's Voluntary Services, the Union of Girls' Schools Settlement and the London County Council Londoners Meals Service. In the case of meals collected from L.C.C. restaurants, that Authority subsidises part of the cost of the meal. Transport for the delivery of the meals is provided by a van belonging to the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association, a van and driver loaned by the Council for approximately two hours at mid-day on four days each week, and by the Women's Voluntary Services volunteer cars. The number of meals provided by this service during 1952 was approximately 15,000. Night Sitter-in Service. This service was put into operation during the year under review by the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association, and provides for attendants to sit up throughout the night with elderly invalids in emergency cases or where relatives or friends, who are looking after the old person, are in need of a few nights rest. A charge of ten-shillings per night is normally made for this service but may be reduced in exceptional circumstances, each case being treated on its merits. Chiropody. Chiropody clinics for old people are conducted by the British Red Cross Society, the Union of Girls' Schools Settlement and by Cambridge House (for members of its Old People's Club only). The charge to patients at all these clinics is one shilling and sixpence per treatment. A Mobile Chiropody Unit was also established during the year to visit and treat old persons who are unable to attend one of the clinics. Old People's Clubs. At the end of the year there were 17 old people's clubs in the Borough. Any assistance to these clubs for the provision of games and/or equipment is made by the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association from the grant made by the Borough Council. At Cambridge House, in addition to the social activities of the club, a Crafts Class is conducted under the guidance of an instructor. In January of the year under review, a display was held at the Town Hall by the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association, at which were exhibited a number of items of handwork by members of Old People's Clubs throughout the Borough. Mobile Library Service. The Council have provided a Mobile Library, which is under the control of the Libraries Department, to visit the homes of aged and infirm persons whose disability prevents them from attending at one of the Council's Public Libraries. Domiciliary Supervision. The Council's Sanitary Inspectors paid 170 visits during the year to old people known to the Public Health Department to be approaching a condition where they are finding increasing difficulty in caring for themselves and keeping their homes in a clean and sanitary condition. Where necessary, the London County Council were asked to provide the services of a homehelp and/or district nurse, and close co-operation was maintained with the Camberwell Old People's Welfare Association. It is a tribute to the services of the officers of the Council and members of voluntary organisations who have to deal with aged persons that in only one instance during the year did it become necessary for the Council to exercise the powers conferred upon them by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to secure the compulsory removal of an aged person to an Old Persons' Home. Rodent Control. The following is a summary of the work of the Rodent Control Staff during the years 1950, 1951 and 1952 : — 1950 1951 1952 No. of complaints received ... ... 1,546 1,383 1,383 No. of inspections ... ... ... 3,533 2,709 2,802 21,473 No. of operators' calls ... ... 17,554 20,257 1,427 No. of private premises baited ... 1,573 1,484 281 No. of business premises baited ... 176 216 49,898 No. of pre-baits laid ... ... ... 38,644 39,884 16,959 No. of poison baits laid ... ... 22,194 23,886 It is encouraging to note that during 1952 it was not necessary for so many poison baits to be laid following prebaiting. This indicates that the unceasing war which is being waged against rats is taking effect and provides evidence of the efficiency of the present system of rodent control. In thirty-four instances where persistent infestations were encountered the drains of the premises were tested and positive results were obtained in twenty cases. Systematic block treatment of sewers was carried out weekly throughout the year and in the months of June and December the customary half-yearly baiting of all sewer manholes and side entrances took place. Three hundred and fifty-eight packets of poison mice baits (totalling 1,432 baits) were supplied by the Public Health Department to the occupiers of 156 dwelling houses which were infested with mice. The following is a reproduction of the annual return which was forwarded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in respect of the year 1952 : — TYPE OF PROPERTY Local Authority Dwelling Houses All other (including business premises) 6,862 147 19 nil 104 43 147 nil nil nil nil Agricultural Total 30 41,391 nil 48,283 I.

With the approval of the Public Service Committee, the Public Health Committee authorised the erection of a display stand in the entrance hall at Dulwich Library and the installation of poster frames at Nunhead, Livesey and North Camberwell Libraries. These were designed for the display of posters giving advice and information on health matters and were provided with ledges for leaflets with the words "Please take one" inscribed thereon. The topic of these displays is changed periodically, suitable material being obtained from the Central Council for Health Education or the Central Office of Information. Pamphlets were also distributed and personal instruction given by the Sanitary Inspectors when inspecting food premises, shops, factories, etc., and when visiting private dwelling houses following the occurrence of a case of infectious disease. In the early part of the year, the Headmistress of a local girls' school arranged for a party of schoolgirls to attend at the Town Hall where they were given a talk on public health by a senior officer of the Department. HOUSING. New Dwellings. The progress of the Council's Housing Schemes continued satisfactorily. One hundred and ninety-one new dwellings were completed during the year and at 31st December 658 were under construction. The total number of tenancies under the control of the Council at the end of the year was 7,242 which included 1,386 permanent dwellings and 519 prefabricated bungalows. There were 6,474 housing applications still outstanding. Requisitioned Properties. In the early part of the year the Council gave consideration to the question of the services of the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspectors being made available to the licensees of requisitioned property and tenants of the Council's permanent houses. The Town Clerk and Medical Officer of Health submitted reports on this matter to the appropriate Committees and the Council subsequently passed the following resolution: — "That the services of the Council's Sanitary Inspectors for the purpose of inspection and report be made available to licensees of requisitioned premises and tenants of permanent housing in those cases where complaints addressed to the Housing Office are not attended to or where there is delay in the execution of the work, and where it appears that there is a likelihood of a public health nuisance arising." Reports submitted to the Housing Office following the inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors of properties under the control of the Council numbered 208 during the year. A number of requisitioned houses are of a very poor type; worn out and requiring constant attention —houses that cannot be made in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation at an economic expenditure. The difficulty in maintaining the older type of house property in the Borough, whether requisitioned or not, is well known and the rising cost of repair and maintenance causes the position to become more difficult every year. It is the Council's practice therefore, to rehouse the licensees and derequisition properties of this type where possible. In every case where it is proposed to release a property from requisition owing to its bad condition, the Housing Office notify the Public Health Department in order that the premises may be inspected to see whether action should be taken under the Housing Acts to secure their demolition. Forty-three such premises were referred to the Public Health Department during the year. It is also the practice for the Housing Office to request the Medical officer of Health to arrange for the inspection of underground rooms, basements and parts of requisitioned premises to see whether they are regarded as fit for human habitation within the meaning of the Housing Acts. During 1952,34 such parts of premises were referred to the Public Health Department; in 18 instances they were found to be unfit for human habitation and the Director of Housing was notified accordingly. It will be seen from the foregoing that the closest cooperation exists between the two Departments. Slum Clearance. Early in the year the first of the areas in the five-year Slum Clearance Programme agreed between this Council and the London County Council was represented. This was the Wagner Street Area comprising three houses, the Clearance Order for which was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 1st July and became operative on 22nd August. The next two areas in the programme to be dealt with by the Borough Council, viz., the Astley Street Area (comprising 21 houses) and the Sandgate Street Area (2 houses) were represented in November. The London County Council have agreed to rehouse families nominated by Borough Councils from small areas of not more than ten houses dealt with by Borough Councils under the programme, and will consider on their merits applications from Borough Councils for assistance in rehousing families from larger clearance areas on the basis of contributing up to 50 per cent. of the additional rehousing required. It may be necessary, therefore, for the Borough Council to provide accommodation for a certain number of families in the Astley Street Clearance Area. Consideration was also given during the year to the Banstead Street, Kimpton Road No. 1 and Kimpton Road No. 2 Clearance Orders. These Orders became operative in 1938 and 1939 but owing to the outbreak of war no action was taken to secure the demolition of the buildings. As only one house in each area was still occupied, the Council decided to offer alternative housing accommodation to the tenants and to proceed to give effect to the Orders. All the Clearance Orders which were made by this Council and confirmed before the war have now been dealt with. The London County Council were also active in the sphere of Slum Clearance in this Borough. A Public Local Inquiry was held at the Town Hall during May in respect of the Picton Street Area, which had been declared by the County Council towards the end of 1951, and involved nearly 700 houses. The Orders in connection with this project were subsequently confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government with slight modifications. Individual Unfit Houses capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense. Nine formal and nine informal notices were served under the provisions of Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, in respect of houses which were unfit for human habitation but were capable of being rendered so fit at a reasonable expense. Twenty-three individual unfit houses were rendered fit during the year—14 following informal action and 9 as the result of statutory action. Of the latter, 6 were repaired by the owners and 3 by the Council in default of the owners. Individual Unfit Houses not capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense. During 1952, two demolition orders were made in respect of dwelling houses not capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense and the Council accepted one undertaking by an owner to render the house fit. Four houses were demolished as the result of action by the Council in accordance with the provisions of the Housing Acts, and four houses were rendered fit following the acceptance of undertakings by the owners to repair the properties. Underground Rooms and parts of Premises. The Council made 28 Closing Orders in respect of underground rooms or parts of premises which were unfit for human habitation, and accepted one undertaking by an owner to render the premises fit. In two instances Closing Orders were determined, the owners having rendered the part of premises and basement room fit for habitation. Housing Acts, 1936-1949.

Nil Overcrowding. Cases of statutory overcrowding which came to the notice of the Public Health Department during the year numbered 117. In every case certificates of overcrowding were forwarded to the Director of Housing and Valuer, London County Council, and to this Council's Housing Department in support of housing applications by the families concerned. Ninety-nine overcrowded families were rehoused during the year, 67 by the London County Council and 32 by the Borough Council. Medical Grounds for Rehousing. The Camberwell Borough Council's Points Scheme has for its main object not so much the determination finally of those cases whose housing need is greatest, but the provision of a method of preliminary selection out ot the numerous applications which have been registered. All applicants eligible for consideration are grouped for statistical and record purposes into five main groups. The Medical Group includes : — (a) Pulmonary tuberculosis cases and certified contacts of pulmonary tuberculosis supported by medical certificates from the Chest Physician of the local Chest Clinic. Twenty points are allotted for these cases. (b) Health cases supported by medical certificates from the Medical Officer of Health recommending either preference on general health grounds or the necessity for the provision of alternative accommodation on a lower level. These cases receive ten points. (c) Cases of statutory overcrowding confirmed by the Medical Officer of Health for which ten points are awarded. The number of applicants who produce some medical evidence in support of their housing applications is not negligible. Four hundred and forty-seven such cases were referred to the Medical .Officer of Health during the year under review. The weight which is to be attached to these medical conditions varies to a great extent. A follow-up survey has been made of thirty-three families re-housed during 1952 in newly built accommodation who were recommended for the award of additional points on medical grounds and who have been in occupation of their present premises for not less than six months. In twenty-two cases it was stated that there had been considerable improvement in the medical condition for which points were alotted; slight improvement was reported in four instances; in four cases there was no improvement (one of these had since died); and in three instances no information could be obtained. It would appear, therefore, that the effect of housing on certain ailments is a factor of considerable importance. Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. Following the receipt of applications from tenants of dwelling-houses in the Borough, 50 certificates of disrepair were issued under the above Act during 1952. Common Lodging House. The only common lodging house in the Borough is situated at 124 Camberwell Road and is licensed for the accommodation of 224 male persons. It is kept under close supervision by the district sanitary inspector who made 45 visits of inspection during the year. The premises were at all times found to be well-conducted and in a satisfactory state of repair and cleanliness. By arrangement with the owners of this lodging house, and on payment by them of an agreed charge, the premises are sprayed regularly every month by the Council's Disinfecting Staff as a precaution against vermin infestation. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The total number of notifications of infectious disease received during the year was 2,720 of which 26 cases were subsequently found not to be suffering from the disease notified. There were only three deaths of notified cases. A table of notifications appears on page 33. Diphtheria. It is gratifying to record that for the second successive year no confirmed case of this disease occurred in the Borough. The intensive publicity campaign which has been conducted for diphtheria immunisation has, without doubt, been the main contribution to this satisfactory state of affairs, but the reduction in the incidence of diphtheria must not be allowed to give rise to apathy on the part of the public. In order to prevent the possibility of this dread disease again rearing its ugly head, it is imperative that an adequate level of immunisation should be maintained. The publicity campaign must, therefore, be vigorously continued so that parents may be constantly reminded that " diphtheria still kills " and it is their duty to ensure that their children are properly protected against this disease. Paratyphoid Fever. Only one case of this disease occurred during the year which was apparently contracted whilst the patient was on holiday on the South Coast. Full particulars were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health for the district concerned. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were 118 cases of puerperal pyrexia notified during the year as compared with 60 in 1951. The increase is mainly due to the operation of the Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations, 1951, which slightly modified the definition of this disease so that any fever of 100.4 deg. F. or more in a woman within fourteen days after confinement or miscarriage became notifiable. The Regulations also required the notification to be accepted by the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the case occurs regardless of the home address of the patient. Consequently, all cases occurring in St. Giles' and Dulwich Hospitals are included in the figures for this Borough.

No case of this disease occurred in the Borough during the year, but some persons who travelled on a ship on which a case occurred proceeded to this Borough and were visited daily by a Sanitary Inspector until all danger of contracting the disease had passed. Scabies. There were 21 cases of scabies notified and in every case the Sanitary Inspector visited the patient's home to arrange for all members of the family to attend at the Council's Cleansing Station for treatment. The record of such attendances is set out in the table appearing on page 24. Food Poisoning. The following is a copy of the Return of Food Poisoning Notifications for 1952 which was forwarded to the Ministry of Health as required by Circular 46/49 dated the 24th May, 1949. 1.

It will be seen that although only 20 cases were notified, a further 93 came to the notice of the Department. These resulted from a report from a school in the northern part of the Borough that some of the children and staff had been taken ill after consumption of a midday meal at the school. On investigation, it was found that the food suspected was prepared in the school kitchen and was also distributed to two other schools —one in this Borough and one in Lewisham. Enquiries were made at the second school in Camberwell but there was no evidence of any suspicious illness among the pupils or staff. The Medical Officer of Health for Lewisham was notified by telephone and subsequently reported 53 cases of illness among the children and staff at the school in that Borough. Unfortunately, none of the suspected food remained available for examination, but specimens of faeces were obtained from two of the affected children. These were submitted to the Bacteriologist who reported that no organism likely to be responsible for food poisoning was isolated. The outbreak was mild in character, the main symptoms being abdominal pain and diarrhoea. NON-NOTIFIABLE DISEASES. Psittacosis. This disease is caused by infection with a virus which is harboured by parrots, budgerigars and cockatoos. Canaries, pigeons and domestic fowls have also been proved to be responsible for infection in man. The method of transmission is contact with infected birds whose droppings contain the virus which may be inhaled by people cleaning the cages or handling the birds. Bites by infected parrots can also convey the disease. In December 1951, the ban on the importation of parrots into this country, which had been in force since 1930, was lifted. Shortly afterwards, 110 parrots from India were received by the owner of a pet shop in Camberwell. These parrots showed signs of sickness from the time of delivery and 104 died. Five of the birds were sold, but it was not possible to trace the purchasers. The proprietor of the pet shop was bitten by one of the birds of this consignment and developed Psittacosis. A second case occurred in a man who dealt with foreign birds and who had been in contact with the first batch imported into this country. The following methods of control were put into operation : — (i) The attention of Private Practitioners was drawn to the possibility of cases of this disease occurring. (ii) All cases of pneumonia notified to the Public Health Department were investigated for possible association of the patient with sick or recently dead birds. (iii) All pet shops in the Borough were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors who made enquiries and warned the proprietors to watch for any illness among their parrots, budgerigars, etc. (iv) The cages of infected birds were burnt or disinfected. TUBERCULOSIS. Primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis numbered 377 and non-pulmonary 23 as compared with 274 and 26 respectively in 1951. I am indebted to Dr. K. Marsh, Chest Physician, for the following information relating to tuberculosis and the conduct of the Camberwell Chest Clinic. During the past year a number of changes have been made in the running of the Chest Clinic. At the same time, there have been certain changes in the population of the Borough which have influenced the work carried out at the Clinic. As a result of rehousing by both the Borough and the London County Council there has been an increase in the population. This increase is likely to go on for some time until the various housing projects in the Borough have been completed. It should be noted that both the Borough Council and the London County Council give priority to the rehousing of patients with tuberculosis not only within the Borough but also from outside; this will mean that the number of notified cases on the register will show an increase. Furthermore, as a result of the gradual increase in the population, it is to be expected that a certain number of new cases will be discovered. The facilities provided for free medical examination and treatment under the National Health Service Act encourage people in poor health to consult their doctors more promptly than they might have done a few years ago, and this has no doubt resulted in cases of pulmonary tuberculosis being discovered at an early stage of the disease. A new service for general practitioners has recently been started at the Chest Clinic. The doctors can refer a patient for a chest X-ray and they receive a report on this X-ray. If it is considered that there is any abnormality, or if the doctor especially makes the request, the patient is seen at the Clinic. In this way a number of patients are referred for routine chest X-rays who would not normally be seen. This service is an addition to that given by the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit, which is only in the Borough of Camberwell for limited periods. Another scheme which has recently been started, in conjunction with Dr. H. D. Chalke, Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, is to attempt to X-ray all women attending the Ante-Natal Clinics. These X-rays are read by the Chest Physician and if any abnormality is detected the doctor at the Ante-Natal Clinic is informed and the patient is asked to attend the Chest Clinic for examination. A revision of a large number of cases has led to an alteration in the diagnosis and as a result several patients already under observation at the Clinic have been notified. Similarly, many patients on the register were considered to have " arrested disease " and their names were removed. As a result of all these factors primary notifications for tuberculosis totalled 377 pulmonary and 23 non-pulmonary cases and the register changed from 2030 to 2148. The chances of recovery are greatly enhanced by early treatment and this is shown in the decrease in the number of deaths from tuberculosis which amounted to 48 as compared with 56 during the previous year. Deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis also showed a decrease from 9 in 1951 to 4 during the year under review. The waiting period for admission to hospital or sanatorium is still very long and this has led to an increase in the amount of treatment carried out in the home. With the help of the District Nursing Association and the Ranyard Nurses it has been possible to give chemotherapy to patients at home. Since the introduction of other anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as I.N.A.H. which can be taken by mouth in conjunction with P.A.S., it will be possible to extend this service. Collapse therapy, instituted at the Clinic and maintained on patients brought weekly to the Clinic by ambulance is a limited measure, but it was thought to be worthwhile in three cases. There has been a very satisfactory co-operation between the Council's Director of Housing, Mr. F. O. Hayes, and the Clinic with regard to the allocation of priorities to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The Chest Physician, and more especially the Health Visitors on his staff, are continually indebted to the Sanitary Inspectors for their reports and recommendations about the housing of patients known to the Clinic. It is known that almost as many cases of infection due to pulmonary tuberculosis occur at work as occur in the home. When a Camberwell patient works in another Borough, the Chest Physician has made arrangements whereby the Medical Officer of Health of that Borough is told when the case is notified. It is hoped that the Medical Officer of Health will take note of this and will inform the Mass X-ray Unit of the area and encourage it to visit that particular factory. In this way it should be possible to find other source cases or early secondary cases, and certainly to give some slight reassurance to the work people in that particular factory. In conjunction with Dr. Chalke, it has been possible to devise a system whereby Tuberculosis Health Visitors visit the general practitioners when one of their patients is newly notified. It is hoped in this way to encourage the general practitioners to feel that they all play a part in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis among those patients on their panel. Vaccination with B.C.G. for contacts, especially child contacts, was carried out at the Clinic on 25 cases during the last six months of the year. It is expected that when the new Ministry of Health Memorandum on B.C.G. vaccination is issued there will be a considerable increase in the amount of this work. The work at the Chest Clinic has almost reached full capacity in the existing unsatisfactory surroundings. Accommodation for patients, health visitors, the Care-worker and the Medical Officers is completely inadequate. This state of affairs has already been pointed out and it must be realised that until suitable accommodation, with adequate arrangements for taking chest X-rays has been obtained, the Borough will be at a constant disadvantage. The work that can be done in the Borough could be considerably increased if all the facilities were improved. The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations; 1952. These Regulations, which came into operation on the Ist May, 1952, revoke the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930, and make similar provision for the notification of tuberculosis modified to accord with the structure and administration of the services now being provided under the National Health Service Acts. It is no longer a statutory requirement for the Medical Officer of Health to keep a register of tuberculosis notifications, but in an accompanying circular the Minister of Health urges that he should continue to do so, in the same way as he keeps a record, for his own purposes and without any legal requirement, of notifications of other diseases. The effect of these new regulations does, however, relieve the Medical Officer of Health of the responsibility for making certain periodical returns in so comprehensive a form as hitherto.

During the early part of the year Councillor Mrs. A. Crossman, J.P., L.C.C., was appointed as a Member of the Committee in the place of Councillor Mrs. M. Monk, and in July Dr. K. Marsh took the place of Dr. C. F. Price as Consultant Chest Physician for Camberwell —Dr. Price having been appointed to the Lambeth Chest Clinic. The Committee's work continued as in previous years. The Secretary interviewed 1,479 patients and the following is a list of the types of assistance given and the number of patients assisted by the Committee : — Type of Assistance. Number. of patients. Clothing ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 77 Pocket money while in hospital ... ... ... ... 14 Wireless: repair, rental and licences ... ... ... 4 Fares of relatives to distant sanatoria ... ... ... 36 Taxi fare ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Holiday for patient ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Household removals ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Loan of bedside comforts ... ... ... ... ... 101 Loan of beds ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 36 Supply of bedding ... ... ... ... ... ...59 Supply of towels ... ... ... ... ... ... 5 Loan of jig-saw puzzles and books ... ... ... 291 Hire purchase payments ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 Payment of insurance premium ... ... ... ... 1 Fees for correspondence courses ... ... ... ... 3 Purchase of a deck chair ... ... ... ... ... 1 Payment for spectacles ... ... ... ... ... 1 The National Assistance Board is able to help financially in some cases. In certain circumstances they can also give additional monies for clothing, bedding, fares and hire purchase payments. After investigation the Secretary referred 240 patients to the Board. Most of the cases which the Committee considered were referred by the medical staff and health visitors of the Chest Clinic and various voluntary organisations. The Committee participated in the Christmas Seal Sale and it is by the generous response, mainly on the part of the people of Camberwell, that the Committee is able to continue its work of alleviating hardship for those suffering from tuberculosis. Camberwell again collected the highest amount of money throughout the Metropolitan Boroughs in the Christmas Seal Sale for the year ended 31st March, 1952. It is pleasing to record that just after the close of this year the target of £1,000 was reached. The Committee is indebted to the London County Council for a further grant of £30 from the proceeds of the Sunday Cinematograph entertainments. The handicraft class continued to meet each Friday from 2-4 p.m. There was a Roll of 20 students with an average attendance of 13. Of the students who left the class one became fit for work, two moved from the Borough, three became medically unfit and two resigned for domestic reasons. One of our students had a particularly successful year. In March he was awarded the first prize—a silver engraved cupin the competitive section at the Maidstone Model Engineering Society Exhibition for a hand-made calf handbag exhibited by the Kent Branch of the British Bed Cross Society. In July he exhibited various leather articles at the London Guildhall. These goods were greatly admired. One of the exhibits, a handmade zip writing case, was shown by the 8.8.C. on their Television programme "Struggle against Adversity" —receiving from the Commentator great praise for the professional appearance of the work. This student also demonstrated the art of leather glove making at the Guildhall Exhibition. Close co-operation with the following voluntary organisations tions in the Borough was maintained throughout the year: The British Bed Cross Society; Family Welfare Association; Nursing Associations; Invalid Children's Aid Association; Soldiers, Sailors and Air Force Families' Association; and the Women's Voluntary Services. We thank them for their assistance. We also thank the official bodies who have always readily given advice. We desire to place on record our thanks to the Borough Council for affording us accommodation for our meetings; to the Honorary officers: Mrs. Cecilia Green-well, as Organiser of the Christmas Seal Sale; Mr. H. Smith, Borough Treasurer, as Treasurer; and Mr. A. W. J. Lamb, as Auditor. We also wish to thank Dr. H. W. Barnes, Medical Officer of Health, for including the Committee's Annual Report for 1951 in his Annual Report for the same year. J. M. LEONABD, Secretary. A. F. CBOSSMAN, Chairman. MASS RADIOGRAPHY. The Mass Miniature Radiography Unit of the South Bast Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board visited Camberwell during the year and was established at Station Way, Rye Lane, S.E.15, from 10th September to 9th October; at Dulwich Grove Congregational Church Hall, Tell Grove, S.E.22, from 13th to 27th October; and at Wren Road Congregational Church Hall, Camberwell Green, S.E.5, from 29th October to 14th November.

Thirty-two samples from hospitals and 42 from schools were also submitted for bacteriological examination. One hospital sample failed to comply with the Methylene Blue test. In addition, one sample of milk was taken from a Day Nursery in the Borough and examined for Shigella Sonnei with negative result. Biological Examination of Milk. Five samples of tuberculin tested pasteurised milk and 3 samples of tuberculin tested raw milk were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service for examination. In all cases it was reported that animals inoculated with these milks showed no evidence of tuberculosis or brucella infection on post mortem examination. Ice Cream. The Sampling Officer obtained 85 samples of ice cream during the year for examination by the Methylene Blue Test, with the following results:— Number of samples 51 Grade I II 16 111 9 IV 9 Fifty-three samples of ice cream were submitted for chemical analysis ; six of these were found not to comply with the standard in force at the time and further action was taken.

These By-Laws which were made by the London County Council on 15th July 1952, came into operation on 3rd November 1952. They are designed to secure the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food sold or intended for sale for human consumption, and in connection with the sale or exposure for sale in the open air of food intended for human consumption. The enforcement of these By-laws should make a valuable contribution to the provision of a clean food supply. Unsound Food. The Council's Food Inspector undertakes the examination of any food suspected to he unsound, and if in his opinion it is unfit for human consumption, a condemnation certificate is issued and the food surrendered for destruction. Condemnation certificates issued during 1952 numbered 3,350, and the following table gives particulars of the food concerned: — Description Weight Total Weight Tons cwt. qrs. lb. Tons cwt. qrs. lb.

It did not become necessary to take action against any trader during the year for any infringement of the Orders in Council, made under the provisions of the above Act, which require that all imported food sold or exposed for sale shall bear an indication of the country of origin. Bakehouses. At the end of the year there were 76 bakehouses in use in the Borough, 12 of which were underground bakehouses. These were kept under supervision by the district sanitary inspectors to ensure that they were maintained in a satisfactory condition. Restaurants and Eating Houses. The register of eating houses indicates that at the end of the year there were 359 premises in Camberwell used for this purpose. This is 37 more than were reported last year. When an application is made to the district office of the Ministry of Food for a catering licence, the Public Health Department is notified of the name and address of the applicant, together with the situation of the premises at which the business is to be conducted. If the premises concerned have not previously been in use as an eating house, a report is forwarded to the Ministry as to their suitability for this purpose prior to the issue of a licence. All restaurants and eating houses are kept under supervision by the district sanitary inspectors. Street Traders. Seventy-nine street traders licences were issued by the Council during the year in respect of the sale of foodstuffs from barrows and stalls. The street markets were regularly inspected and the premises used by the traders for storage purposes were kept under supervision by the district sanitary inspectors.
