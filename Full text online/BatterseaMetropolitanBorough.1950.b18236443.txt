To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Batter sea. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Herewith I beg to present a report upon the health and sanitary conditions of the Borough for the year 1950. This report has been prepared, as in recent years, in an abbreviated form in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Health. In this, my last Annual Report, I would like to record my appreciation and thanks to the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, and in particular to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for the kindness and courtesy that has invariably been extended to me. To the Town Clerk and all the other Chief Officers I express my sincere thanks for their friendliness and help at all times. Finally, I have to acknowledge gratefully the very loyal and willing service I have had from the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Chuter, and all the members of my staff in the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. MACDONALD, Medical Officer of Health Principal Figures for 1950.

The Registrar-General's estimate of the 1950 mid-year home population of Battersea was 117,700, and this figure has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. The population of Battersea at the census taken in April, 1931, was 159,552, and the estimate for 1950, therefore, indicates a decrease of 41,852 (or 26 per cent.), but an increase of 190 during 1949/50. BIRTHS. The numbers of live births registered as belonging to Battersea, and occurring in 1950, were as follows: — Males Females Total Legitimate 955 845 1,800 Illegitimate 50 49 99 1,005 1,899 Totals 894 The live birth rate was 16.13 per 1,000 of the population, a decrease of 0.09 on the figure for 1949, and compares with a live birth rate of 17.8 for the County of London and 15.8 for England and Wales. 708 births (live and still) registered in the Borough and occurring during 1950 were " domiciliary births." Still-Births. The registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1950 there were 51 still-births registered in Battersea, of which 25 were of Battersea parents. 28 still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 53 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 27.15 per 1,000 births (live and still) registered. Of the 53 still-births 5 (9-4 per cent,) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Rattersea still-births registered, and the still-birth rates from 1941 to 1950, were as under:— No. Rate No. Rate 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 42 43 36 40 38 59 31.5 26.7 21.6 24.0 23.3 22.7 1947 1948 1949 1950 74 46 43 53 27.0 20.1 20.8 27.2 Mean 1941-50 47 24.5 Notification of Births. During 1950 the number of notifications of live births received belonging to the Borough was 1,796. The corrected number of Battersea births registered and occurring during the year was 1,899. The proportion of notified to registered births was, therefore, 94.5 per cent. Forty-nine still-births were notified under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, during the year, the number notified being 92.5 per cent, of the total Battersea still-births registered. The homes from which births are notified are visited and revisited by Health Visitors. MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1950 numbered 949. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 16.1. Year. Marriages. Marriage Rate 1,082 23.9 1945 19.2 1946 1,043 1947 1,085 18.9 1948 988 17.0 17.2 1949 1,013 1,042 Mean, 1945-49 19.2 1950 949 16.1 DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1950 was 1,844. Of these, 1,015 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. There were, on the other hand, 490 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,319 (males 686, females 633). This gives a recorded death rate of 11.21, compared with 11.8 for London, and 11.6 for England and Wales. The following table shows the age and sex distribution of the total deaths (corrected) in Battersea during 1950: — Under 1 year. 1— 5— 45— 15— 25— 65— 75+ Total M. 4 178 686 3 6 47 225 189 34 17 F. 4 3 5 31 127 173 273 633 Totals 7 11 51 7 78 305 398 462 1,319 0.5 5.9 23.2 30.2 % Of Total 0.5 3.9 0.8 35.0 100.0 Of the 1,319 Battersea deaths, 734 (or 55.6 per cent.) occurred in hospitals, etc. It is well known that in almost all districts the average age at death tends to increase. The position of Battersea in this respect is illustrated by the following figures:— Average Age at Death. Mean, 1940/1944 60.9 1945 62.4 1946 61.4 1947 62.6 1948 63.3 1949 65.3 Mean, 1945/1949 63.0 1950 65.5 The deaths of 860 residents of Battersea aged 65 years and upwards were registered during 1950. These 860 deaths constituted 65-2 per cent. of the total deaths at all ages. The natural increase of population (that is, excess of births over deaths) was 580 in 1950 as compared with 597 in 1949. The causes of the 1,319 deaths in 1950 classified in various age groups, are shown in the following tables. Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life in Battersea during 1950.

The corresponding death rate of legitimate children in, 1950 was 26-11, the ratio of mortality rate of illegitimate infants to that of legitimate being 155 to 100. The corresponding figure for 1949 was 90 to 100. Maternal Mortality. During 1950 there were 2 deaths of women from diseases or accidents of child-birth, which is equivalent to a fatality rate of 1-02 per 1,000 births (live and still), as compared with 2 deaths, and a fatality rate of 0-97 in 1949. The rate for England and Wales in 1950 was 0.86. Comparative Statistics of Births, Mortality, etc. (Compiled from Registrar-General's Returns.)

There was a marked decrease in the number of notifications received during 1950, there being 1,037 during the year, as compared with 2,118 in 1949. The following table shows the number (corrected) of cases notified during 1950 and, for the purpose of comparison, the average number of cases notified annually in the five years, 1945-1949: — Notified 1950 Average 1945/49 Diphtheria 20 - Erysipelas 18 34 Scarlet Fever 152 207 Enteric (Typhoid) Fever 1 - Puerperal Pyrexia 12 15 Meningococcal Meningitis 3 7 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 13 Polio-encephalitis - - Polio-myelitis 7 12 Encephalitis Lethargica - - Malaria 4 - Dysentery Pneumonia 7 10 (Acute Primary) 72 101 (Acute Influenzal) 9 19 Scabies 28 336 Food Poisoning 9 5 Whooping Cough 338 401 Measles 231 1,183 Tuberculosis (all forms) 149 199 2,567 Totals 1,037 It is most interesting and gratifying to report that there was no case of Diphtheria in the Borough during 1950. Seven cases were notified and removed to hospital, but the diagnosis was not confirmed a nd the notifications were subsequently cancelled. 12 Notifications of Scabies again decreased. Twenty-eight cases were notified in 1950 as compared with an average of 336 for the five-year period 1945/49. Thirteen cases of Polio-myelitis and 1 case of Polio-encephalitis were notified during 1950. Of these 14 cases, 6 Polio-myelitis and 1 Polio-encephalitis were subsequently cancelled, the diagnosis not being confirmed, leaving 7 confirmed cases of Polio-myelitis (5 paralytic and 2 non-paralytic). Of these 7 confirmed cases, 6 occurred in children under 10 years of age, of which one was severely paralysed, one had slight paralysis, and the remaining four, together with the adult, showed no evidence of paralysis. In addition to the above-mentioned 14 notified cases, 5 further cases of suspected Polio-myelitis were removed to hospital, but were found not to be suffering from this disease. In comparison with previous years, there were 30 (including 2 cases of Polio-encephalitis) confirmed cases in 1949, 5 in 1948 and 23 in 1947. The case rates per 1,000 of the population for these diseases in the Borough during 1950 were 0.04 (paralytic) and 0.02 (nonparalytic) which compare favourably with rates of 0.13 (paralytic) and 0-05 (non-paralytic) for England and Wales. Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation, Smallpox Vaccination. Diphtheria and Whooping Cough immunisation, and vaccination against Smallpox were carried out throughout the year at Southlands, under the control of the London County Council. I am indebted to Dr. Bertha E. A. Sharpe, Divisional Medical Officer, No. 9 Division, who supplied the following information relating to Battersea cases : — Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation.

During the year 1950 there were 149 cases of Tuberculosis (all forms) notified in Battersea as compared with 194 in 1949, 213 in 1948, 162 in 1947, 228 in 1946, and 199 in 1945. In addition, 51 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 200 cases for the year. The case rate per 100,000 population was 169.9. The tables on page 16 give details in age groups of the 200 cases. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1950 deaths from Tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 45, of which 44 (i.e., 97-8 per cent.) were due to pulmonary tuberculosis, 1 (i.e., 2-2 per cent.) to other forms of the disease. The death rate per 100,000 of the population, during the 45 years ended 1945 in quinquennial averages and yearly from 1946 are given in the following table: — Pulmonary Total Non- Pulmonary Years 138.1 50.9 1901-1905 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 Average (45 years) 106.4 25.8 132.2 1946 76.4 8.3 84.7 1947 51.3 9.6 60.9 1948 59.2 6.9 66.1 1949 40.9 5.1 46.0 1950 37.6 0.8 38.4 Average (5 years 1946/ 50) 53.1 6.1 59.2 The death rate per 100,000 population was 36 for England and Wales, and 39 for the County of London.

During 1950 the number of deaths of Battersea residents from Cancer was 237 (males 128, females 109), as compared with 269 in 1949, 232 in 1948, 252 in 1947, and 224 in 1946. The death rate from this disease per 1,000 of the population was 2.01. Deaths from Cancer constitute 18-1 per cent, of the total Battersea deaths during the year. The following gives the comparative average death rates from Cancer in Battersea for quinquennial periods since 1901. 1901-1905 0.88 1.99 1936-1940 1906-1910 0.95 1941-1945 2.44 1911-1915 1.11 2.06 1946 1916-1920 1.28 1947 2.19 1921-1925 1.33 1.99 1948 1926-1930 1.51 1949 2.29 1931-1935 1.75 1950 2.01 Details in age groups and the localisation of this disease will be found on page 7. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The bacteriological examination of clinical material (with the exception of specimens of sputum, which are dealt with at the Chest Clinic) is carried out by the Clinical Research Association, of Watergate House, Strand. During 1950 the number of bacteriological examinations of specimens sent in by medical practitioners practising in Rattersea was 183 (exclusive of the specimens dealt with at the Chest Clinic , ). The following table gives particulars of the bacteriological examinations carried out during the year:— Positive Results Negative Results Suspected disease Total Diphtheria 1* 177 178 Other - 5 5 Total 1* 182 183 * This was not a clinical case of Diphtheria. The cost of these examinations is borne by the Council, and in 1950 amounted to £29 9s. 18 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the main work of the Department in relation to sanitation : — Summary of Main Operations for the Year 1950. Sanitary Operations.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 286 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, by-laws, regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below, and further details will be found in the sections dealing with the respective matters. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 268 Food and Drugs Act, 1938 7 L.C.C. Drainage By-laws 6 L.C.C. By-laws re Rag and Bone Dealers 2 L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1934 (By-law re Fouling of Footpaths by Dogs) 2 National Assistance Act, 1948 (Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons) 1 286 Fines totalling £20 7s. 6d. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £124 19s. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling houses could be secured. During the year, 3,383 Intimation, and 2,075 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices were served. The high proportion of Statutory to Intimation Notices gives some indication of the difficulty in securing compliance with the latter. Furthermore, legal proceedings to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices had to be taken in no less than 262 cases. Of these, 88 resulted in Nuisance Orders being made by the Court. Of the remaining 174 summonses, 171 were either adjourned or withdrawn, as the work required to comply with the Notices was either in hand, or had been completed, before the hearing. In 2 cases fines totalling £5 5s. were imposed (both for failing to supply dustbins). One case was dismissed on a technicality concerning ownership. In 17 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken. In 16 of these, the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. Most of these accounts had been settled by the end of the year, but in 2 instances proceedings for the recovery of the cost had to be taken. These summonses stood adjourned at the end of the year. In one case, the Council elected to take proceedings for the non-compliance, and a fine of £1 was imposed. One application was made to the Court for a warrant to enter a house for the purpose of making an inspection, the Sanitary Inspector having previously been refused admission. The warrant was granted and duly executed. 20 Dustbins. Under Section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, if any house is found to be without a proper dustbin, the Council may serve notice on the owner or occupier requiring provision to be made. The same Section provides that any person aggrieved may appeal to the London County Council. Similar provisions are contained in the Public Health Act, 1936, which applies to England and Wales outside the administrative County of London. Under that Act, however, any appeal against a notice has to be made to a court of summary jurisdiction. In the last two or three years, a number of such appeals have been made, some of them being subsequently taken to the Divisional Court. As a result, the principle has been established that, in deciding whether notice should be served on the owner or on the occupier, the local authority must consider all the circumstances of the individual case. It had previously been the practice of the Council, save in very exceptional circumstances, to regard the provision of dustbin accommodation as a matter for the owner, and accordingly to serve notice on him. In view, however, of the situation created by the various appeals referred to above, the Health Committee decided in 1949 that in future the circumstances of each case (e.g., net rent of house, number of tenants, existence of any tenancy agreement, financial circumstances of the occupier, etc.) should be submitted to them for their decision as to whether the notice is to be served on the owner or occupier. It should be made clear that the right of appeal to the London County Council still remains. During the year, 30 such cases were considered by the Committee. In 21 of them it was decided to serve the notice on the owner, and in the remaining 9 on the occupier. In one case an appeal was lodged by the owner, and was allowed by the County Council, despite the fact that the notice had been served about six months prior to the lodging of the appeal, and the fact that the owner had been convicted and fined for failing to comply with the notice. In two cases, proceedings for failure to comply with notices were taken. Both were successful, fines of £5 and 5s., respectively, being imposed. Common Lodging Houses. There are no Common Lodging Houses or Seamen's Lodging Houses in the Borough. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. In addition to the usual lavatory accommodation (at least one free water-closet being provided for each sex) facilities for washing are also provided. Three public urinals are also maintained. In addition, the urinals attached to eight licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public. 21 Drainage Work. The by-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Acts with regard to drainage, and also those under the Public Health (London) Act relating to water-closets, etc., are enforced by the Council. During the year new drains were constructed to 93 new buildings, and the drains of 34 old buildings were partially or entirely reconstructed under the supervision of the Officers of the Health Department. 107 plans of proposed drainage work were deposited in 1950, as compared with 102 in 1949. During the year drains were tested by smoke on 120 occasions, and 61 were found defective. The water test was applied on 703 occasions, this being mainly to drains in course of construction. The frontage drains of 8 premises were constructed or reconstructed. In 11 cases, the Council carried out drainage works in default of compliance by the owners with the requirements of notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In two of these cases, legal proceedings to recover the cost incurred had to be taken. In one case, judgment for the amount was obtained. In the other, the summons was withdrawn, the amount claimed having been paid before the date of the hearing. Legal proceedings for offences against the Drainage By-laws were also taken as under : — (a) For failing to give notice of commencement of drainage work—Two cases, in both of which convictions were obtained, fines totalling £2 10s. being imposed and £4 4s. costs awarded to the Council. (b) For carrying out work contrary to the requirements of the by-laws—One case, the summons being withdrawn as the work had been satisfactorily altered before the date of the hearing. (c) For failing to deposit plans of proposed drainage work — Three cases. In one, a fine of £2 was imposed. In the other two, the summonses were withdrawn, as satisfactory plans were deposited before the date of the hearing. Combined Drainage. A claim was made by the owners of a block of houses drained by a combined operation that the combined portion of the drainage system was a " sewer" repairable by the Council. The claim was repudiated, and the necessary work to the drain was subsequently carried out by the owners at their own expense. Smoke Nuisances. During the year a number of complaints were made, alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from premises occupied by various industrial and public utility undertakings in the Borough. All such complaints were carefully investigated. 22 .In the Annual Report for 1948, reference was made to serious emissions of smoke, grit, etc., from two public utility undertakings in the Borough. In one of them (an electricity generating station) the installation during 1949 of additional grit arresting and other plant of a similar nature reduced the emissions to a very material extent. In the other case (a gas works) little improvement can be reported, and does not seem likely to take place until the replacement of a large amount of plant of an obsolete type can be effected. This, it appears, is not likely to take place for a number of years. Apart from these two instances, the complaints related to emissions from various industrial plants. On investigation, they were found to be due to some transient cause such as the use of unsuitable fuel, or temporary breakdown of some part of the plant. In two cases intimation notices were served, on which the nuisance was abated, and no further action was found necessary. The total number of observations made was 165. Effluvium Nuisances. A small number of complaints alleging nuisance from effluvia emitted from various industrial and business premises were received. In only one case (a works where the boiling of varnish is carried on) did there appear to be any justification for the complaint. This case was still under observation at the end of the year. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which scheduled offensive trades are carried on. These businesses have been established for many years and are satisfactorily conducted. Water Supply. During the year certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 93 new or re-erected dwelling houses or tenements. In five houses an additional water supply on an upper floor was provided, in compliance with notices served under Section 95 (5) of the Act. Thirty-four notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Periodical examination of the water supplies drawn from the deep wells at the Latchmere Baths was carried out during the year. The Public Analyst's reports on his examination of the samples showed that the water maintained a high degree of purity. These wells supply water not only to the Baths Establishment, but also to over 360 tenements on the Council's Latchmere Estate. Formerly, supplies were adequate for all these purposes, but of recent years the yield from the wells has fallen, so that supplies from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board have had to be drawn upon to an increasing extent. During 1950, the existing air-lift pumps on two of the borings were replaced by electrically operated submersible pumps of modern design, with the result that the yield from these borings is now sufficient for normal requirements. The mains are drawn upon only in emergency. 23 Rag and Bone Dealers. Premises occupied by rag and bone dealers in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 114 inspections were made. Various small irregularities found to exist were brought to the notice of the occupiers of the premises and were remedied without recourse to formal action. Legal proceedings were taken against two men in respect of an offence against that part of the by-laws which prohibits the giving of toys in exchange for rags, and which had been reported 1 by the Police at the end of 1949. A fine of 10s. was imposed in each case. Fouling of Footpaths by Dogs. Legal proceedings were taken in two cases for offences against the Council's by-law. In one case a fine of 2s. 6d. was imposed. In the other, the summons was dismissed absolutely under the Criminal Justice Act, 1948. Verminous Premises. During the year, 392 premises, including 47 flats or houses on the Council's estates, which were found to be infested with vermin (principally bed-bugs) were disinfested. The usual method of treatment is by a D.D.T./pyrethrum spray. Van Dwellings. There are three sites in the Borough on which van dwellings have regularly been placed for many years. The number of vans on the sites varies from time to time. All the sites are subject to regular inspection and are in general reasonably well kept. Dangerous Structures. Eighty-nine cases in which structures or parts thereof had been noted, in the course of inspections for various purposes, as appearing to be unsafe, were referred to the District Surveyor of the London County Council for his attention. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act, which came into operation on the 31st March, 1950, repealed, and re-enacted, with many alterations and additions, the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. It gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestations of rats and mice, and to prevent infestations. These duties are carried out by the Rodent Officer, assisted by three Rodent Operatives. All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Sanitary Inspectors. In other cases, the occupier is called on to set traps, lay baits or take other action as the circumstances may require. The setting of traps and laying of baits is, on request, carried out by the Rodent Control Staff, charges being made for this service. These charges are usually nominal except in the case of business premises, where the cost is charged in full. 24 The sewers under the control of the Council are treated twice yearly, in accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Infestation Control Division). Their recommended method of treatment, namely, the laying of prebait (unpoisoned) on two days, followed on the third day by poisoned bait, is followed. The Ministry make a grant of 50 per cent, towards the cost of the service, in so far as this is not recovered from the owners or occupiers of premises. The following table shows the prevalence of rats and mice in the Borough for the year. Property Number of properties where infestation was Number infested by Notified by occupier Otherwise found Total Rats Mice only Major Minor Council's Properties 5 5 3 2 - - Dwelling Houses 392 20 412 171 241 - Business Premises 23 4 27 16 11 - The following table summarises the control measures carried out. Property Number of inspections made Number of treatments carried out Rats Mice Council's Properties 56 11 45 Dwelling Houses 1,403 171 241 Business Premises 732 18 11 Vacant Sites, Static Water Tanks, etc. Complaints continued to be made of nuisances caused by the dumping of rubbish in disused static water tanks, and on cleared sites and in derelict buildings, and by the accumulation of stagnant rainwater in static water tanks. In many cases, the rubbish consisted merely of builder's material, scrap metal, etc., which, although unsightly, could not be said to be a danger to health. In certain instances, however, dead animals, vegetable refuse, old bedding, and other material of a putrescible nature were found. It appears that the primary responsibility for abating any nuisance so caused rests upon the owner of the site, but in view of the difficulty and delay which would have arisen from any attempt to enforce this responsibility, the Council themselves undertook the removal of any such material causing or likely to cause danger to health, a special provision of £100 having been made for this purpose. Four cases in which particular nuisance was being caused by accumulations of water and rubbish in static water tanks were, however, taken up with the owners of the sites. In one of these cases, 25 the tank was subsequently demolished. In two others, they were emptied and the rubbish removed. The fourth case was still outstanding at the end of the year. Five similar cases mentioned in the Annual Report for 1949 as being outstanding at the end of that year were also dealt with by the clearance of two tanks and the cleansing of the other three. Burial of Deceased Persons. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying or being found dead in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 21 cases were dealt with, as per the following table:— 11 Died in St. James's Hospital 8 at home Bodies found in river 2 21 The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is provided for followers. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any " liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so that he may take steps to recover the cost. The total cost incurred in dealing with the 21 cases was £104 5s. 3d., of which £76 10s. 9d. had been recovered by the end of the year. Aged and Infirm Persons. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or other suitable place of any person who is aged or infirm or suffering from some grave chronic disease, and is living under insanitary conditions. This power is exercisable on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health. One such case was dealt with during the year. This was a woman of 82 years of age, who lived in a three-roomed flat which she shared with her sister, who was herself over 80 years of age and quite incapable of looking after her sister. The only other relatives which could be traced were two nieces, who were, however, unable to accept any responsibility. The Order was duly made and the woman removed to hospital. A number of other cases of persons, mostly of advancing years, alleged to be living under unsatisfactory conditions, were reported. In none of these was there justification for certifying that an application for an Order for removal be made. In some cases, however, it was found possible to arrange voluntary admission to hospital, and other cases were under observation at the end of the year. 26 PROTECTION OF FOOD SUPPLY. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. Regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is prepared, stored, or sold has always been carried out as a routine measure. During the last few years, however, it has become increasingly evident that with the existing staff of Sanitary Inspectors engaged in this particular work, inspections could not be carried out with sufficient frequency. This applies particularly to catering establishments, the number of which has shown a phenomenal increase during and since the war. There has, also, been a growing recognition of the amount of illness caused by the consumption of food prepared and sold under unhygienic conditions. The Health Committee gave careful consideration to this matter and on their recommendation the Council decided to appoint an additional Inspector for the inspection of food premises, particularly catering establishments. This appointment was duly made and the Inspector (Miss A. L. Jones) commenced duty in November. As a further contribution to the general campaign to secure improvements in food hygiene, the Council decided to arrange a Clean Food Exhibition. It was originally intended that this should have been held in October, but for various reasons it had to be postponed to January, 1951. Restaurant Kitchens, etc. The number of restaurants and cafes (including fixed and mobile stalls) on the register at the end of the year was 173. 508 inspections were made, and 23 notices served for various defects. Reference is made in the preceding paragraph to the question of inspection of these premises. As stated in the Annual Report for 1949, the Council in July, 1949, adopted a Code of Standards for Catering Establishments, which was subsequently circulated to the proprietors of 135 restaurants where a full range of meals is served, and to 43 factory canteens, with an invitation to apply for a Certificate of Hygiene, which could be displayed at the premises. Only 5 such applications were made, 3 of which were granted. The other 2 applicants were invited to make certain improvements to their premises, but failed to do so. As these improvements were not such as could be legally required under existing legislation, no further action was taken. Slaughterhouses. There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough. It is used only occasionally, for the slaughter of calves. Thirty-five visits were made to it during the year, and 3 calves were examined, all of which were passed as fit for human consumption. The use of this slaughterhouse ceased about the middle of the year. 27 Butchers' Shops. There are 74 butchers' shops in the Borough, and in addition a number of shops where cooked meats are sold. All these shops are systematically inspected, 1,126 visits having been made during the year. In general, the shops are well conducted, and no formal action was found necessary. One shop where horseflesh is sold for human food is included in the above figure. Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. No offence against the Regulations was reported during the year. Dairies and Milkshops. The following table gives the dairies and milkshops registered in the Borough, and the changes during 1950: — (a) Dairies where loose milk is sold, and both the premises and the occupier are registered:— ~ 1 o Retail Wholesale Total 56 On register at 1st January 49 7 Added during year 4 - 4 60 53 7 Removed during year:— (i) Premises closed or sale discontinued 5 5 - (ii) Transferred to (b) below 1 1 - On register at 31st December 54 47 7 (b) Milkshops, where milk is sold only in sealed containers, and only the occupier is registered:— 77 On register at 1st January Added during year, by transfer from (a) above 1 9 „ „ „ by new registrations 87 Removed during year 4 83 On register at 31st December A total of 288 visits were made to these shops during the year. Generally they are very well conducted. In 3 cases, however, it was found necessary to draw the occupier's attention to minor contraventions of the statutory requirements. These were rectified without recourse to formal action. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949. One case of an offence against these Regulations, by the deposit of a crate of bottles of milk on the public footpath, was reported. This was dealt with by a cautionary letter. 28 Milk (Special Designations). Under the two sets of Milk (Special Designations) Regulations issued in 1949, four designations are prescribed, namely, Accredited, Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised, and Sterilised. Accredited Milk may not be heat-treated. Tuberculin Tested milk may be pasteurised or sterilised, provided it is so described. Pasteurised milk must be so treated by either the "Holder" or "High Temperature Short Time" processes, and must comply with the " phosphatase " and " methylene blue " tests. Sterilised milk must be filtered or clarified, homogenised, and heated to and maintained at a temperature of not less than 212° F. for such time! as will ensure that it complies with the " turbidity " test. All persons who pasteurise or sterilise, or deal in special designation milk, are required to hold licences, which (except in the case of producers of raw milk) are issued by Food and Drugs Authorities. The number of licences issued by the Council during 1950 was as follows:— Full Supplementary Accredited - Tuberculin Tested 44 19 Pasteurised 75 19 Sterilised 102 21 221 59 Two licences to pasteurise, and one to sterilise milk were issued, and are included in the above figures. Details of examination of samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are given on page 34. Ice Cream Premises. The number of premises registered for the manufacture, storage, and/or sale of ice cream at the end of the year was 105, 25 having been added and 6 removed during the course of the year. All these premises are regularly inspected, 221 visits being made. Particular attention is paid to premises where manufacture takes place, and not only are the premises, plant, and methods of operation scrutinised, but samples of the products are taken for examination by the methods suggested by the Ministry of Health. The premises generally are found to be well conducted. Further reference to sampling of ice cream will be found on page 35. Fish Shops. Shops in which fish, either cooked or uncooked, is sold, or where the curing or smoking of fish is carried on, are regularly inspected. There were 58 such shops in the Borough in 1950. 252 inspections were made, and 1 notice was served, for minor matters which were remedied without difficulty. 29 Street Stalls. All street stalls from which food for human consumption is sold are regularly inspected and, where the food sold is stored in the Borough, the storage places are also inspected. It was not found necessary to take any formal action during the year. Unsound Food. The following table gives particulars of the unsound foodstuffs which, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council. Most of these foodstuffs were ultimately used for the manufacture of animal feeding stuffs. Fish (preserved) Fish (wet) Meat and sausages (preserved) Meat and sausages (fresh) Poultry and game Vegetables (preserved) Vegetables (fresh) Fruit and fruit juices (preserved) Fruit and fruit juices (fresh) Milk Eggs (dried) Eggs (shell) Eggs (liquid) Fats Suet Cheese Bread Cakes and biscuits Flour and cereals Tea Sugar Jams, syrups and preserves Pickles and sauces Paste (meat and fish) Patent foods and beverages Sweets and chocolate Puddings Soups Spaghetti Gravy thickening 1,768 tins, 13 boxes 51 boxes 1,546 tins, 6 cases, 326 lbs. 966½ lbs. 476 lbs., 6 tins, 6 crates 1,488 tins 7½ cwts., 536 cases 725 tins and bottles 356½ lbs., 24 baskets 1,742 tins 2 tins 995 eggs 148 lbs. 74 lbs. 22 packets 336½ lbs., 164 packets 26 loaves 22 ½ lbs. 80 lbs., 25 packets 82½ lbs. 38 lbs. 357 tins and jars 315 jars and bottles 30 tins and jars 43 tins, 1¼ lbs. 32¾ lbs., 24 packets 8½ lbs., 85 packets, 53 tins 314 tins 20 tins 1 bottle Eleven cases of the presence of foreign matter in food came to light during the year. All were reported to the Health Committee, on whose instructions legal proceedings/ were taken in four cases. The proceedings were all successful, fines totalling £6 10s. being imposed and £12 12s. costs awarded to the Council. The remaining seven cases were dealt with by cautionary letter. Food Poisoning. During the year nine cases of food poisoning were notified. All were isolated cases and of a minor nature, and call for no special comment. 30 In May, there was an outbreak of illness among persons resorting to the Staff Canteen at the Town Hall. The symptoms were suggestive of food poisoning, but no case was notified as such, and all bacteriological examinations were negative to intestinal pathogens. In all, 27 persons were affected, but the symptoms were in all cases slight and recovery was complete within a few days. A careful investigation failed to disclose the specific cause of the outbreak. PROTECTION OF FOOD SUPPLY. (B)-SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS. The analysis of samples of food and drugs, procured under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, or informally (i.e., without following the procedure prescribed by the Act), and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream by the prescribed tests, is carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough (J. E. Woodhead, Esq., B.SC., F.R.I.C., PH.C.) at his laboratory at 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.1 1. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1950 was 595, of which 3, or 0.5 per cent., were certified to be adulterated. In addition, 605 informal samples were procured, of which 9, or 1.5 per cent., were reported against. The percentage of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1945 and yearly from 1946, is given in the following table : Year Formal samples (per cent.) Informal samples (per cent.) Mean 1921—1925 6.4 7.4 „ 1926—1930 3.3 2.4 „ 1931—1935 1.8 2.1 „ 1936—1940 0.9 0.9 „ 1941—1945 1.4 1.1 1946 1.5 1.2 1947 0.5 1.7 1948 0.7 0.3 1949 2.0* 1.0 1950 0.5 1.5 *The somewhat higher figure for adulterated formal samples is explained by the fact that it includes seven samples of milk taken from the same consignment. 31 The following tables give details of the articles of which samples were obtained for the purpose of analysis.

The 462 samples of milk, all of which were formal samples, were reported as genuine. In the five years 1945-1949, and in 1950, the percentage of adulterated (formal) samples of milk was as under: — Samples taken Adulterated Year No. Percentage 459 0.4 1945 2 1946 430 0 0.0 0.0 1947 415 0 1948 0 0.0 402 2.4 1949 421 10 Mean 423.4 0.6 2.2 1950 462 0 0.0 34 The average composition of the 462 samples of milk reported as genuine, proved to be as under :— Total milk solids 12.42 per cent. Milk fat 3.61 Non-fatty solids 8.81 The Analyst reports that the content of milk fat in these 462 samples ranged as follows: — 4 per cent, and over 50 samples or 10.8 per cent.

Contained 71.5 per cent, coarse broken oats, 27.3 per cent, semolina and 1.2 per cent, pearl barley. Cautionary letter sent. No. 91. Non-brewed Vinegar. 15 per cent, deficient in acetic acid. Legal proceedings taken. Defendant discharged under Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, on payment of £5 ss. costs. Heat Treated Milk. Samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk are taken at regular intervals for submission to the Public Analyst for the prescribed tests, and during the year samples as under were taken with the results set out: — Phosphatase Methylene Blue Satisfactory Failed Satisfactory Failed Pasteurised 57 1 57 1 Turbidity Satisfactory Failed Sterilised 24 Monthly returns of the samples taken, and of the results of the examinations, are sent to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Food, and they are at once notified of any adverse report. 35 Milk supplied to Schools and Hospitals. Samples of milk in course of delivery to Schools and Hospitals in the Borough are regularly taken, both for chemical analysis and, where the milk is supplied under a " Special Designation," for submission to the prescribed tests for such milk. These samples are included in the general totals given on pages 32, 33 and 34. The results of the analyses and tests are communicated to the London County Council or to the appropriate Hospital Management Committee. Ice Cream. Eighty-three samples of ice cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the presumptive test for coliform organisms in 3 tubes at 1/10 ml. dilution, and to the methylene blue test, in accordance with the technique suggested by the Ministry of Health. The following is a summary of the results : — Coliform Test. Methylene Blue Test. Negative 51 Provisional Grade 1 44 Positive in 1 tube 4 2 17 „ „ 3 ...... 11 „ „ 2 tubes 3 „ „ 3 tubes 25 4 ...... 11 83 83 These results show a marked improvement over those recorded in previous years. Where samples of ice cream made at premises in the Borough received unsatisfactory reports, the premises, plant, and methods of operation were examined, and, where possible, improvements were suggested. Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. During the year, the erection of 60 new flats by the Council was completed 42 flats in two blocks at Tyneham Close and 18 at Holmside Court. By the end of the year work was well in hand on a block of 17 flats on the Nightingale Lane/Hendrick Avenue site. Work was also in hand on the Bolingbroke Grove/Salcott Road site, where four blocks comprising 64 flats were in course of erection; on a third block of 22 flats at Tyneham Close; and on the St. John's Hill and Westbridge Road sites. During the year, acquisition of further sites, with a view to their redevelopment as housing sites, was under consideration by this Council. The rebuilding, by the owners, of 23 houses on a privately owned housing estate, demolished by enemy action, was completed during the year, together with 6 other similarly demolished houses in various Parts of the Borough. Four flats at Eaton House which were badly damaged by enemy action were also rebuilt by the Council. 36 Summary of New Accommodation Provided. By Battersea Borough Council 64 By Private Enterprise 29 93 Conversion of Existing Houses. During the year the Council converted into flats one house held under requisition. Three family units were made available in this way. Repair of Unfit Houses. While, as stated in the paragraph on the operation of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (vide page 19), that Act continued to afford the main means by which the remedy of insanitary conditions in dwelling houses was effected, the limited use of the provisions of Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, resumed towards the end of 1948 after having been discontinued since the outbreak of the war, was continued. Action taken under Section 9, Housing Act, 1936. Informal Notices served during 1950. 10 Formal Notices served during 1950 following service of Informal Notices — (a) In 1949 3 (b) In 1950 3 6 Work completed in 1950 after service of Informal Notices- (a) In 1949 3 (b) In 1950 4 7 Work completed in 1950 by owners after service of Formal Notices— (a) In 1949 2 (b) In 1950 2 4 Work completed in 1950 by Council in default after service of Formal Notices — (a) In 1949 3 (b) In 1950 Nil 3 Total number of houses where repairs were completed under Section 9 during 1950 14 Outstanding Notices at 31st December, 1950— Informal Notices 3 Formal Notices 4 Of the 4 Formal Notices outstanding at the end of the year, in 2 cases the time allowed for compliance had not expired; in one case repairs by the owner were in progress; and in the remaining case arrangements were in hand for the Council to carry out the work in default. 37 Closing Orders. Four Closing Orders under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, were made during the year, two in respect of basement rooms, one in respect of two semi-basement rooms, and one in respect of four rooms on first and second floors. Demolition Orders. During 1950, one house was demolished under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, the Demolition Order having been made during the previous year. One such Order was also made by the Council in 1950 in respect of a dwelling house, as it was considered that repairs could not be carried out at a reasonable cost, but the time allowed for compliance had not expired at the end of the year. Houses Let in Lodgings. No special action was taken in respect of such houses. Overcrowding. 268 cases of overcrowding were discovered during the year, 165 in consequence of applications for housing accommodation made to this Council, and 103 to the London County Council. Ninety-two overcrowded families were rehoused during the year, 33 by this Council and 59 by the London County Council. During 1949 a case of overcrowding occurred where it appeared that the circumstances were such as to give rise to an offence against the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1936, and proceedings were taken under Section 59 (1) of the Act. A fine of 10s. was imposed by the Magistrate with 10s. costs, but -the overcrowding was not abated, and the Housing Committee gave instructions that the case should be deferred for six months. This period expired early in 1950, and the Housing Committee then instructed that proceedings for possession be taken under Section 66 of the Act. Before a summons was issued, however, the two families concerned obtained additional accommodation in the same house, thus abating the overcrowding, and no further action was taken. Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants and licensees of requisitioned premises. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). At the end of 1949 the Council adopted a " Points Scheme " to deal with applications for housing accommodation. Under this scheme, points are allocated by the Housing Manager for statutory overcrowding ; bedroom deficiency; lack of a separate home, etc., and he still refers cases of ill-health and unsuitable accommodation, for which points up to a maximum of 10 can be allocated under each heading. Each case is placed in a group according to the number of bedrooms required by the family. Cases with the highest number of points in each group are submitted to the Housing Committee for instructions. 38 This scheme does not apply to applications for transfers from Council or requisitioned property, which are still dealt with under the previous system, " essential " and " advisable " recommendations being made on medical grounds. During 1950 a total of 660 cases were dealt.with; the maximum number of points on medical grounds were allocated to 76 applications, whilst in 45 cases of transfer applications rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council also refer cases in which there appears to be overcrowding, for the submission, in appropriate cases, of an " orange form." Overcrowding was found to exist in 103 instances. The London County Council also notify cases in which the application alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. Increase of Rent, &c., Acts. Two certificates that houses or parts thereof were not in a reasonable state of repair were issued to tenants. Statistics for the Year ended 31st December, 1950. 93 Number of new dwellings erected or re-erected Number of houses demolished: — In pursuance of clearance orders Nil In pursuance of demolition orders 1 In pursuance of undertakings to demolish Nil 1 Number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health and Housing Acts) 4,644 Number of inspections made for that purpose 34,456 Number of houses at which defects found: — Dealt with under Housing Act (informally) 7 Dealt with under Housing Act (formally) 6 Dealt with under Public Health (London) Act 2,706 2,719 Number of houses where defects remedied: — As result of action under Housing Act 14 As result of action under P.H.

In 16 of these cases the Council carried out the work in default of the owner. 39 Factories and Homework. Factories Act, 1937. Metropolitan Borough Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act in regard to :— (i) Sanitary conveniences—Section 7-ln all factories. (ii) Cleanliness, Overcrowding, Temperature, Ventilation, and Drainage of Floors—Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6—ln all factories where mechanical power is not used. (iii) Certificates of Suitability for Basement Bakehouses —Sec- tion 54—In all basement bakehouses. (iv) Water Supply (where derived from a source other than the public mains) —Section 53 —In all factories. The following table gives the number of factories on the register at the end of the year, with the number of inspections, defects found, and action taken. 1. —INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health.

During the year, 73 lists of outworkers were received, 26 from Battersea employers, containing 250 names, and 47 from other authorities containing 224 names. Some of these lists included out- Workers not residing in Battersea. These were forwarded to the appropriate authorities. After eliminating them, and duplicate entries, there remained 343 names and addresses of Battersea outworkers. The total number of registered outworkers' premises in the Borough at the end of the year was 437 (including 5 contractors), 156 premises having been added, and 57 removed, during the year. The total number of inspections made was 1,095, most of them by the female Inspector. The premises were found to be generally satisfactory, and it was not found necessary to serve any notices or take any other action. Two cases of infectious disease occurred at outworkers' premises, and the usual precautions to prevent spread of infection were taken. The following table gives details of the outworkers' premises:— Number on Register Trade Premises Persons employed Workrooms Wearing Apparel 218 234 278 Curtains, etc. 3 3 3 Artificial Flowers 8 8 8 Boxes, etc. 12 12 12 Lampshades 194 197 214 Stuffed Toys 2 2 2 437 456 517 It will be seen that these figures indicate a considerable increase in the amount of outwork carried on in the Borough. 42 Bakehouses. There were 38 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year. All of these are classed as factories, and 35 of them use mechanical power. Thirty-four inspections were made but no notices served. Eight of the bakehouses operating at the beginning of the year were " basement bakehouses " within the meaning of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937. Two of these, however, later ceased to be used in consequence of notices served during 1949 withdrawing the Certificates of Suitability as from 3rd August, 1950. Miscellaneous Matters. Student Sanitary Inspectors. During the year practical training was given to three student sanitary inspectors, under the Government's Special Scheme for the training of Sanitary Inspectors. Each of these students attended in the Public Health Department for a period of eight weeks, and spent similar periods with each of two other local authorities. In addition, practical training was given to two members of the Clerical Staff of the Health Department who are studying for the Qualifying Certificate, at such times as they could be spared from their normal duties. One of them, Mr. L. H. Whanslaw, sat for and obtained his Qualifying Certificate. Conferences.

During the year 1950 there were 2,238 children and 226 adults cleansed and treated at the station. Of the 2,238 children attending, 326 were suffering from scabies or itch, a contagious parasitic skin affection. The remainder were verminous. Of these children 2,138 attended from the public elementary schools in the Borough by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Battersea Borough Council for the use of their Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council while the disinfestation of the clothing and (if necessary) of the homes is carried out concurrently by the Borough Council's sanitary staff. The homes of all cases of scabies that come to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health are visited by the Council's sanitary inspectors. The following table shows the numbers of persons cleansed and treated at the Personal Cleansing Station and the expenditure incurred since 1906, the year in which the cleansing of verminous persons was begun: — Number of Baths, &c. *Amount Contributed Expenditure Year Adults Children Verminous and Scabies Verminous and Scabies £ £ 1906-1915 10,443 6,430 1,037 303 1916-1925 3,269 39,117 3,155 5,007 1926-1935 2,404 39,293 8,521 4,045 1936 265 4,524 723 403 1937 389 4,256 729 403 1938 432 3,808 820 402 534 1939 2,820 795 402 1940 778 3,497 866 404 2,558 1941 5,456 1,026 435 1942 3,083 6,656 1,059 440 1943 2,017 5,223 1,149 422 1944 1,798 3,931 1,100 441 1945 1,885 3,277 1,179 454 1946 1,822 4,229 1,352 443 1947 4,179 986 1,402 424 1948 497 3,266 1,808 408 1949 286 2,773 1,534 411 1950 226 2,238 1,750 410 *Financial year ending 31st March.
