During the year 267 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 79 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 20). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1920-1950 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 22 and 23. Diphtheria. Three cases were notified and were removed to hospital. One was re-diagnosed as ulcerative stomatitis whilst in hospital. Graph No. 3, facing this page, shows a comparison between the incidence of diphtheria and the number of persons immunized against diphtheria during the years 1920 to 1950. Dysentery. Five cases were notified and removed to hospital. Three were subsequently rediagnosed whilst in hospital, one as ulcerative colitis and two as enteritis due to salmonella typhimurium. Enteric Fever. One case of paratyphoid B fever was notified. The patient was a nurse resident at a hospital in the Borough. Erysipelas. Three cases were notified, all of which were nursed at home. Food Poisoning. Two cases originally notified as dysentery were subsequently re-diagnosed in hospital to be suffering from enteritis due to salmonella typhimurium. In one case the patient was a woman of 42 and in the other a girl of 18. Measles. One hundred and forty cases were notified, and twenty-five were removed to hospital. Three of the cases removed to hospital were subsequently re-diagnosed as acute tonsillitis with toxic erythema, pyrexia of unknown origin, and exanthema subitum respectively. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Two cases were notified and were removed to hospital. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal). Five cases were notified, and two were removed to hospital. Acute Poliomyelitis.

Scarlet Fever. Sixteen cases were notified, and thirteen of them were removed to hospital. Smallpox. In April, 1950, a ship arrived at the Port of Liverpool having on board a suspecied case of smallpox, later confirmed as a case of mild discrete smallpox. Eleven passengers, presumed to be contacts were kept under surveillance by this Department for a period of sixteen days. In May a young woman who had arrived in London by air from Switzerland was removed to hospital as a suspected case of generalised vaccinia. As a precaution, the case was treated as suspected smallpox, and a person staying in Holborn who had been a possible contact was kept under surveillance until the diagnosis was confirmed. In July a ship arrived at the Port of London, having landed a case of modified smallpox at Aden. Thirty passengers, presumed to be contacts, who came to Holborn after disembarkation, were kept under surveillance by this Department for a period of sixteen days. In cases where they left the area before the sixteenth day, the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which they were proceeding was informed. In August a person who had just returned from a fortnight's travelling on the Continent called at the Casualty Department of a hospital in the Borough, and was suspected to be suffering from smallpox but was found not to be so suffering. In October a provisional diagnosis of suspected smallpox was made in the case of two seamen at the Outpatients Department of a London hospital. A possible contact living in this Borough who had attended the hospital, was kept under surveillance until the cases were later re-diagnosed as cliickenpox. Tuberculosis. See page 51. Whooping Cough. Ninety-four cases were notified, twenty-eight of which were removed to hospital. Four were subsequently re-diagnosed, one as acute catarrhal laryngitis, one as broncho pneumonia, and two as bronchitis. Other Diseases coming to the notice of the Department. Disease. No. of Cases.

Proper and sufficient supply provided 19 Waterclosets. Cleansed 32 Water supplied, flushing cistern repaired 6 Repaired, new pans provided 10 Position or construction improved 5 Soil pipes. Repaired, renewed or ventilated 4 Rainwater pipes. Repaired or renewed 7 Drains. Repaired 6 Unstopped, cleansed 7 Sinks. Waste pipes repaired, sinks renew 20 27 Yards, Areas and Washhouses.

Roofs repaired 41 Gutters repaired 9 Other works to prevent dampness 30 Ash bins, and Ashpits. Provided, repaired 2 Various. Accumulations of refuse removed 10 Animals improperly kept 2 Other defects 17 Complaints. During the year 678 complaints were received in respect of the following nuisances: — Rodent infestation 292 General dilapidation and disrepair 71 Obnoxious smells 65 Dampness 49 Vermin 62 Accumulations of refuse 36 Inadequate or unsuitable W.C. accommodation 33 Defective or choked drains 17 Defective roof 14 Absence of artificial lighting to common staircase 11 Inadequate or unsuitable dustbin accommodation 1 Overcrowding 4 Smoking chimneys 10 Noise 15 Defective flues 8 Inadequate water supply 9 Aged and infirm persons 4 Nuisance from animals 6 Unsound food 41 Impure water supply 2 Inadequate ventilation 4 Miscellaneous 49 28 Water. 1. Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. One certificate was issued under Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, certifying the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water in respect of four war damaged flats which had been rebuilt. Two complaints were received during the year in relation to drinking water. In each case it was found that the storage tanks had become dirty. These tanks were cleansed and no further complaints were received. Nineteen premises were supplied with a proper and sufficient water supply following the service of notices Drainage. During the year 3,239 inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 87 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 87 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement. During the year 10 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 143 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Sanitary Inspectors. In no case was it found necessary to serve a Notice under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Bombed Sites. Accumulations of refuse on bombed sites present a considerable problem to local authorities. In very few cases are the accumulations such as to warrant the service of notice in respect of a "nuisance" and there is also the difficulty of assessing responsibility for the accumulations. In 1949 the Council made a by-law governing fly tipping on vacant sites in the Borough, but considerable difficulty is experienced in apprehending the offenders. During the year the Public Health Committee arranged for warning notices to be displayed on the sites most subject to nuisance. Sites cleared by Council 9 Sites treated by Council, e.g., bedding removed 29 Approximate number of tons of refuse removed 80 Approximate cost of removal £200 Sites cleared as a result of the service of notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 6 29 War — Time Reservoirs for Emergency Water Supplies. The war-time reservoirs for emergency water supplies were kept under observation throughout the summer months, with a view to the prevention of nuisance, and in particular to prevent the breeding of insects. Where necessary, arrangements were made for accumulations of water to be pumped out by the London Fire Brigade. It is pleasing to note that with the increase in rebuilding a number of these potential nuisance spots are disappearing. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act and the Poisons Rules, 1949, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1950, 33 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. Two applications were received for entry on the list and three for removal. Shops Act, 1950. This Act, which came into force on the 1st October, 1950, is a consolidating Act replacing the Shops Acts, 1912 to 1936. The Act makes no alteration in the powers of Metropolitan Boroughs as sanitary authorities for the enforcement of provisions relating to ventilation and temperature of shops and to sanitary conveniences. Housing Acts, 1936 and 1949. The following is a summary of action under the above Acts during the year 1950: Slum Clearance. Houses included in clearance areas Nil „ ,, „ „ „ and demolished Nil „ repaired as a result of action under Sees. 9 and 10 Nil „ made the subject of demolition orders Nil „ demolished as a result of demolition orders Nil Parts of buildings made the subject of closing orders 1 „ „ „ closed by undertaking Nil Underground rooms made the subject of closing orders 2 „ „ closed by undertaking Nil Closing orders determined Nil No. of flats erected by the Council during the year Nil Note: The number of underground rooms which do not comply with the relevant Regulations, but which are occupied for human habitation, is 499. Houses Let in Lodgings. Number in Borough 294 Inspections made 287 Notices served 8 Complaints remedied under the Bye-Laws 19 30 Overcrowding. On the 1st January, 1950, 199 families were known to be living in overcrowded conditions. During the year a further 48 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions. In 39 cases, overcrowding was abated during the year as follows: — Families rehoused by the Holborn Borough Council 7 Families rehoused by the London County Council 15 Accommodation found by other means 14 Size of family decreased by death or otherwise 2 During the year 184 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with conditions of overcrowding. In cases where overcrowding is abated, a warning letter is sent to the owner of the premises drawing attention to the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1936. Rodent Control. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act, which came into force on the 31st March, 1950, replaces The Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. The new Act lays a duty on local authorities to see that their district is kept free from rats and mice. It empowers them to carry out inspections and to require owners and occupiers to keep their land free from infestation. A duty is laid upon occupiers to give notification in writing of infestation by rats or mice to the local authority. The Act also confers powers relating to infestation of food, on the Minister of Food. The Minister may delegate certain of these powers to a local authority. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Report for period 31st March to 31st December, 1950. The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in accordance with Article 1 (c) of the Conditions of Exchequer Grants to Local Authorities dated 28th July, 1950: — 1.

This scheme, which was started in March 1949, and has yet to be completed, has been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The scheme covers that part of the Borough lying East of Woburn Place and Southampton Row to Gray's Inn Road, and North of High Holborn. Particulars of work carried out during the year under this scheme are as follows Blocks surveyed 10 Blocks treated 10 Business premises treated 11 Dwelling houses treated 46 Bombed sites and derelict buildings treated 8 Treatment visits 502 Other visits 1,087 Estimated kill (rattus rattus) 225 Bodies recovered (rattus rattus) 59 Estimated kill (rattus norvegicus) 58 Bodies recovered (rattus norvegicus) 22 The rate of progress achieved with this scheme was not as great as had been anticipated owing to prolonged spells of illness suffered during the year by the Rodent Operative engaged in this work. Complaints.

During the year 1.23 men were cleansed at the Council's Cleansing Station. Eightythree were referred from Bruce House, Westminster, and 34 from Parker House, Parker Street. Under the agreement between the Council and the London County Council thirtyfour school children were treated for head lice at the Station during the first three months of the year. This agreement, however, was terminated by the London County Council on the 31st March, owing to the small number of children involved. As a result the services of the Council's part-time Women's Cleansing Attendant was dispensed with, and arrangements were made with the Westminster City Council to cleanse women from the Holborn area at a charge 1/- per person. Under this arrangement 18 women were cleansed up to the end of the year. 34 Public Mortuary. The following are details of work carried out during the year at the Council's Public Mortuary: — Residents in Holborn. Residents outside Holborn. Total.

Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, provides that, where certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be necessary for the purpose of securing the proper care and attention for persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention, a local authority may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order to secure the removal of such aged and infirm persons. There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Section by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. Burial of the Dead. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. 35 Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year nine cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £74. 15s. 6d. of which £38. 17s. 0d. was recovered, leaving a net cost to the Council of £35. 18s. 6d. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources: — French Hospital 1 Hospital for Sick Children 1 Coroner's Officer 3 Local Practitioner 1 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 3 36 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing; by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1950 are as follows: — Number of visits to: — Factories with mechanical power 142 Factories without mechanical power 15 Outworkers' rooms 16 Re-inspections of above 145 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 57 Notices served: — Factories Acts. 1937 & 1948.

Outworkers. Section 110 of the Factories Act, 1937, requires that where, in certain specified industries, work is given by an employer or contractor to be done by workers outside his factory, lists containing the names and addresses of such workers must be forwarded to the Local Authority. Section 111 has the object of preventing such work being carried out in premises which are insanitary or in which infectious disease is present. The following table gives the number and type of such premises in the Borough, and the nature of the work carried out: — Section 110. Section 111. Type of Specified Work.

Owing to the movement of the persons in the lists difficulty was experienced in tracing some outworkers and the survey therefore continued into 1951. A number notified as outworkers were found to be doing a non-specified trade. The outworkers notified were found to fall into two categories. The first worked in premises which could be regarded as a factory and registered as such. These premises can be inspected both by the Factory Inspector as well as by the Council's Inspectors. The second category work in premises which are also their homes, and so they may better be described as homeworkers. Their premises are subject to inspection by the Council's Inspectors, but not by the Factory Inspector. These homeworkers numbered only 24, and were either women or retired men. 40 SECTION 6. Inspection and Supervision of Food. General. All premises where food is prepared, stored or exposed for sale for human consumption are inspected, and the following is a record of the inspections made during 1950— Dairies and milk shops 63 Ice cream, sale or storage 39 Ice cream, manufacture 49 Restaurants and kitchens 1,237 Bakehouses 44 Butchers' shops 206 Fish shops 62 Fried fish shops 44 Other food shops 473 Market streets 144 Licensed premises 91 Re-inspections 686 Foods and Drugs Acts, 1938-1950.

Gutters repaired 1 Other work to prevent dampness 1 Sinks. Waste pipes repaired, sinks renewed 16 Other nuisances. Accumulations of refuse removed 1 Milk Legislation. Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. This Act, which came into force on the 1st January, 1951, makes no changes in the law, but consolidates certain enactments relating to milk, dairies and artificial cream, notably Part II of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, Sections one to four of the Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944, and the whole of the Milk (Special Designations) Act, 1949. The Act is cited with the Food and Drugs Acts, 1938 and 1944, as the Food and Drugs Acts, 1938 to 1950. Registrations. The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register c of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises 42 which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether bv wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1950 1 Dairies on register at end of 1950 Distributors registered during 1950 7 Distributors on register at end of 1950 71 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 29 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1950 63 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 216 During 1950, 216 formal samples of milk were taken, one of which was found to contain at least 11.7% added water. Legal proceedings were instituted and the defendants were fined £1 and £2. 2s. Od. costs. The following table shows the monthly variation of the chemical composition of the 216 samples. Month.

A person proposing to use a special designation authorised by the Regulations is required to apply to the licensing authority of the area in which the milk is to be sold, for a licence to use the designation. Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 112 licences were issued, details of which are as follows: — Dealer's Licences. Dealer's Supplementary Licences. To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 16 14 To sell Accredited milk - 1 To sell Pasteurised milk 32 17 To sell Sterilised milk 16 16 Milk — Bacteriological Examination. During the year, 82 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. Thirteen of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and two to Day Nurseries. Two samples of pasteurised milk were found to be unsatifactory and in each case the Company concerned and the Medical Officer of Health in whose district the milk was pasteurised and bottled were notified. The Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council was notified of the results of all school milk samples submitted for examination. In addition two samples were subjected to the animal inoculation test but no evidence of tubercle bacilli was observed on post mortem examination six weeks after inoculation, 44 Registration of Premises Used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream. Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1950, six premises were registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream in Holborn, and forty-four premises were registared for storage and sale. During the year, seventeen applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. One set of premises ceased to be used for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, and was removed from the register. Another, which ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, was also removed from the register. At the end of the year, five premises were registered for manufacture, storage and sale and sixty premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1947. During the year 89 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows: — Grade 1 23 Grade 2 34 Grade 3 12 Grade 4 8 Twelve samples were coloured ices which did not respond to the test. 29.8% of the samples graded were Grade 1. This was an improvement on the results for the previous two years details of which are: — Year. . % of Samples Grade 1. 1948 17.5% 1949 15.3% In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. The results of all examinations of their own products were for warded to the large manufacturers for their information. Ice Cream—Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 12 samples were examined for the presence of faecal coli, which in each case were found to be absent in 1 ml. of the sample. Ice Cream—Fat Content.

The Holborn Clean Food Guild was formed in January, 1950, at a meeting to which representatives of the food industry had been invited by the Council. The representatives elected to become an Advisory Committee of the Guild, and appointed an ad hoc Executive Committee of eleven Association representatives, including where possible those who were also traders in the Borough, together with four representatives of the Holborn Borough Council. The Medical Officer of Health was invited to act in an advisory capacity to the Guild, and Mr. A. E. Hobbs, Chief Clerk of the Public Health Department, was appointed Secretary and Treasurer to the Guild. The Executive Committee met subsequently throughout the year, to conduct the business of the Guild, under the Chairmanship of Councillor M. P. Greengross, Chairman of the Council's Public Health Committee. Rules and Codes of Standards and Practice were drafted, and care was taken to ensure that the latter, while capable of being carried out in the majority of food premises in the Borough, were at the same time of a standard higher than that enforceable by law. All food traders in the Borough were invited to become members of the Guild. In November traders were invited to meetings held at the Town Hall and presided over by the Deputy Mayor, Alderman J. H. Boraston, C.B., O.B.E. The meetings were held to encourage membership of the Guild. The Central Office of Information co-operated by showing films on the subject of Food Hygiene. The Guild has the support of the majority of the food traders' Associations. There are, however, a few exceptions and one or two of these are understood to have advised their members against joining clean food guilds. During the year 84 applications for membership were received. By the 31st December, 1950, 41 of these applicants had conformed to the Guild's standards and had been granted membership. One applicant withdrew owing to a short lease not warranting the alterations which were required to the premises. In the case of the majority of the remaining applicants, the works necessary to bring the premises up to the required standard were in process of being carried out at the end of the year. Many of these works have since been completed and the applicants granted membership. Considerable interest was aroused by the Guild's Codes of Standards and Practice, and a number of requests for copies were received from local authorities and other bodies interested in food hygiene. Articles concerning the Codes appeared in technical journals. Enquiries were also received from other local authorities regarding the formation and constitution of the Guild. In accordance with the powers conferred upon them by the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, for the publication of information relating to health and the prevention of disease, the Council gave support to the Guild throughout the year by publicising clean food with the aid of posters, pamphlets, and public meetings. 51 SECTION 7.

The campaign for the early detection of Tuberculosis was continued during the year by Mass X-Ray Unit II of the North-West Regional Hospital Board. Facilities were afforded to persons living or working in Holborn for X-ray examination of chest and lungs during April and May, 1950. A large number of firms in the Borough were invited to allow their employees to undergo examination by the Unit, and the managements proved very co-operative. So great was the response that it was found necessary to extend the original four week programme by a further two weeks. The following are particulars giving the results of the examinations: — Analysis of Survey of Persons Working in the Borough. Men. Women. Total.
