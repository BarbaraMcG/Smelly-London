INTRODUCTION BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH Telephone No: Elmbridge 6441-8. Ext. 25. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 2, SHALSTON VILLAS, SURBITON. June 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report, 1961. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1961. The report is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/62, dated 18th January, 1962, and follows the general lines as for previous years. I am pleased to report on the continued satisfactory state of the Public Health in the Borough during the year; there have been no outbreaks of infectious disease. Population: The population of Surbiton on which the vital statistics are based is now 62,850. In my last year's Annual Report I gave the 1961 Census Provisional figure as 62,940. The Registrar-General in an explanatory note states "in making the mid-1961 estimates regard has been had to the preliminary results of the Census enumeration of 23rd April, 1961, adjusted in respect of (a) persons enumerated away from their usual place of residence; (b) pupils and students in boarding schools and university halls of residence, etc.; (c) armed forces in stations within the specified area; (d) the movement of population between Census Day and 30th June, 1961; and (e) all other relevant available information". Infectious diseases; With the exception of the periodic increase of measles notifications which were 897 for the year, I am pleased to report a low incidence of infection generally, although it is with regret I report that a case of Poliomyelitis occurred in the person of a female aged 39 years who contracted the disease whilst on holiday abroad. It is most pleasing to report a decrease of 28 in the whooping cough notifications, and to say for the first time in nine years no case of sonne dysentery was reported. There was no case of diphtheria reported during the year, and we have been free from this disease in the Borough since 1946, which again speaks very highly for the way in which the general Medical practitioners and public health officials have continued to carry out an intensive and persistent programme of active immunisation. Births; The number of live births for 1961 is 924 and compares with 921 for I960. The birth rate is 14.70 per 1,000 of the population compared with 14-36 for the previous year. 2. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1961 is 664 compared with 675 for 1960. This gives a death rate of 10.56 per thousand of the population compared with 10.53 for 1960. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1961 is 15 giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 16.23 compared with a rate of 17.37 for 1960. The causes of death of these infants will be seen on page ten. Causes of death: The main causes of death during 1961 were.Heart and circulatory disease 244 Cancer 128 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 83 In view of the attention given to the relationship between smoking and lung cancer the relevant figures for Surbiton residents is given below:- 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 M F M F M F M F M F M F Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus. 24 6 19 4 26 3 22 4 34 1 24 5 Total 30 23 29 26 35 29 With regard to the dangers of tobacco smoking the following points are now considered relevant. "Three quarters of the men and half the women in Britain are now regular smokers and the number of people dying each year from lung cancer has been increasing very rapidly. Heavy cigarette smokers have thirty times the death rate of non-smokers. Once people become addicted to smoking it becomes a drug habit and difficult to break off. That is why young people should never start. Lung cancer is a particularly unpleasant way of dying and smokers'lung cancer often causes death in the prime of life. It has been shown that the examples of parents especially of mothers who smoke may encourage children to do the same". (from a pamphlet of the Central Council for Health Education). Housing: The provision of new dwelling houses still remains an urgent responsibility for the Council. The activity of recent years by private developers continues but at a slower pace 3. . While it is true that a great deal of opinion is expressed in favour of a home which stands on the ground, it is also true that the ground space for this can be ill-afforded in Surbiton today. Therefore if present needs are to be served the planned programme must include not only houses of 3 to 4 bedrooms for families, but also housing for special groups such as flatlets and bungalows for the old people; a few specially planned or adapted houses for handicapped persons, aiso some accommodation of small self-contained flats for single persons. Last but not least a small percentage of tenants prove to be destructive and are bad tenants in the real sense of the word. The Authority has a duty to these as to the sick which in a sense they are, at least, socially. This problem is not solved by making special unbreakable houses but by social welfare and constant supervision by qualified staff, and this is where the Housing Department and the Medical Social Department join. Sometimes the family is reclaimed and the children grow up to be decent tenants after years of education. There are also those tenants who can but will not pay the rent; these are best dealt with by court action before the arrears accumulate; but however unsatisfactory tenants may be, every effort should be made to keep the family as a unit, preferably placed in individual houses where their behaviour will affect their normal neighbours as little as possible. Staff: The details of the staff of the Public Health Department are set out on page 1. There was one change during the year. Mr. J.M. Weaver, the junior clerk was transferred to the Borough Treasurer's Department, and Mr. M.L, Thompson was appointed in his place. I am pleased again to record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year, and to Mr. Eldridge, the Chief Public Health Inspector and his Inspectors, Mr. Elms and the clerical staff and to Dr. W.H. Kinstrie, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STaRKEY Medical Officer of Health 4.

It will be seen that there are over 6,000 persons over 65 years of age in this population table. The presence of so many in the older age groups means the necessity to co-ordinate, organise and maintain more comprehensive geriatric services and special housing for the old folk. BIRTHS.

Exclusion from work of Contacts of Infectious Disease. By regulations made under the National Insurance Act, 1946 and the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1953, persons may be excluded from work and entitled to National Health sickness benefit if, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, such persons are contacts or carriers of disease and it is necessary to exclude them from work in order to prevent the spread of infection. These Regulations apply particularly to food handlers in foodshops, also cooks, and kitchen hands employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year one such certificate was issued. diphtheria. The Borough has now been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation services offered, there is no reason why the disease should not be entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Administrative work on immunisation is conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria, whooping cough and other immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisation carried out in the course of his practice; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from Grange Road Health Centre, Kingston-upon-Thames. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Monday mornings at 1, Gosbury Hill, 9.30-to 11 o'clock. Chessington. Telephone; Elmbridge 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings at Swell Road, Surbiton. 11 o'clock. Telephone; Elmbridge 4897 (or Diphtheria Immunisation may be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). 13. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1961 Reinforcement doses during 1961 Age under 1 year 379 - Age 1 year to 4 year's. 539 274 Age 5 years to 14 years. 146 2,006 The following table sets out the number of children immunised in each of the last seven years:- Year Primary Immunisations Reinforcements. 1955 737 132 1956 741 298 1957 691 1,399 1958 799 1,162 1959 859 1,267 1960 956 1,002 1961 1,064 ! 2,280 14.

SMALLPOX. Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat which materialised at the end of 1961 when a case occurred in London. Its seriousness is such that the simple precaution of vaccination ought not to be neglected even though it is no longer compulsory for infants to be vaccinated. Patients of all ages can be vaccinated by their own doctors whilst children are also dealt with at the Clinics under the control of the Surrey County Council. Calf-lymph for vaccination is obtainable from the Central Public Health laboratory at Colindale. 15. The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1961 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5 -14 15 or over total Vaccinations 685 61 27 36 56 865 Re-vaccinations - - 9 33 288 330 Calculations show that by the end of 1961 74.13 of children under one year have been vaccinated against smallpox. SONNE DYSENTERY. No cases occurred during the year and only two the previous year. The following table shows the number of cases occurring since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton in 1951:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 62 - 10 12 25 289 202 28 123 2 - POLIOMYELITIS.

At the end of the year good progress had been made towards the protection by vaccination of the priority groups for which vaccine had been issued by the Ministry of Health. These groups were:- All persons who have not at the time of their application for vaccination reached the age of forty. General practitioners. Ambulance staff Hospital staff who come into contact with patients. Medical students. Practising dental'surgeons, dental students, dental hygienists, student hygienists and dental surgeons' chairside assistants. 16. Practising nurses not working in hospitals. Public Health staff who may come into contact with poliomyelitis cases. The families of the above groups. Expectant mothers who are particularly urged to be vaccinated as early as possible in pregnancy and such requests are dealt with as priorities. Persons going to visit or reside in a country outside Europe, other than Canada or the United States of America. In the latter part of the year supplies of Salk vaccine became severely restricted when the Ministry of Health decided to introduce Oral Sabin vaccine. This very much curtailed the poliomyelitis vaccination programme, and it was not until early 1962 that the Sabin vaccine became available and allowed the doctors and the clinics to catch up on arrears. In June 1961 the Public Health Laboratory Service commenced a one-year study of the incidence of poliomyelitis and other viruses in the faeces of normal children below 5 years of age with the object of obtaining more information as to the presence of these infections and to see what changes have taken place as a result of the widespread use of polio vaccine. We are co-operating in this survey by arranging for and collecting fire specimens per week so that by the end of the period some 260 children in this Borough will have been checked. FOOD POISONING. There were eleven confirmed cases notified by general medical practitioners, the causative organisms were identified as shown below;- S. Newport 5 cases S. Typhi-murium and Staph. Aureus 2 cases S. Typhi-murium 3 cases Staphylococci Aureus 1 case The ages of the eleven persons were as follows:- Adults 4 14 years 1 6 " 1 3 " 2 2 " 1 1 year 4 months 1 6 weeks 1 The five cases of S. Newport were members of one family who were almost certainly infected by the consumption of a chicken in which ^composition had commenced. 17. The origin of the other cases, two of whom were sisters, was not ascertained. On 28th March, 1961, there was a small food poisoning incident at a local factory involving seven persons, three of whom were sufficiently ill to be removed to hospital. All made a satisfactory recovery within a few days. These cases were not included in the notifications because none of those who were seen by a doctor were residents of this Borough. The responsible organism was confirmed as Staph. Aureus and the vehicle was undoubtedly imoorted cheese. laboratory facilities. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); and opportunity is taken to gratefully acknowledge the co-operation of Dr. D.R. Gamble and his staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens are taken. Apart from routine samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the Inspectors in the course of investigating suspected cases of dysentery, para-typhoid, food poisoning, etc. and taken to the Laboratory.

It was not necessary to take any action under these Regulations during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936, (Section 172) No action was taken under this section. MASS RADIOGRAPHY No visit was made by the Mass X-ray Unit to the Borough during 1961. However, persons requiring chest x-ray may attend by appointment at the Chest Clinic, 27, Queen's Road, Kingston Hill, Telephone Number Kingston 6251, at the following times:- Mondays at 9.30 a.m. Tuesdays at 9.30 a.m. and 2.0 p.m. Wednesdays at 2.0 p.m. Thursdays at 9.30 a.m. and 2.0 p.m. Fridays at 9.30 a.m. KINGSTON & DISTRICT TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE, This is a local voluntary Committee which raises funds and gives help to families with tuberculosis and other chest diseases. It works with the Surrey County Council Official services and is formed from representatives of the four District Councils in the North Central division together with other interested persons. 20. The Town Council appoints two representatives annually and the present representatives are:- Alderman Mrs. A. Woodgate, J,P. Councillor J.R. Ashton. During the year 1961 an amount of £1,841 was spent on giving help to 80 families in the Division. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year fifty-nine medical examinations were carried out at the Public Health DepUUAAartment, 2, Shalston Villas. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service, also members of staff attaining the age of 18 years to determine their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme; members of the Borough Engineer's outdoor staff after completing six months' service to determine their suitability into the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, also to examine special cases referred for investigation. The latter usually necessitated a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospital specialists. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE There is in the Borough much voluntary activity devoted to this cause such as provision of weekly clubs, daily centre, arranging seaside holidays, distribution of Christmas gifts and visiting of house-bound. The work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life and presided over by His Worship the Mayor. The Town Council leases to the Committee a large house known as "Alfriston", Berrylands Road, which, after extensive works of repair and re-decoration, was opened in September 1958 as a Centre for old people, including clubrooms, recreation rooms, handicraft room, chiropody clinic and canteen. The chiropody service is now being conducted on behalf of the County Council. A meals on wheels service is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society, and the Council makes a generous contribution towards the cost involved. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was 4,156. The Borough Council has provided ninety-four special flats for aged people, and a further twelve are under construction. There can be no exaggeration of the importance of this work for the old people, or of its increasing urgency as year succeeds year and more survive to the older age groups. It is now imperative that the contributions in money and services by the Local Authorities, i.e. County and Borough be extended and continuous co-ordination be exerted over all the field of work. CO-ORDINATION OF HEALTH AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. In 1957 a committee of the Council was formed to consider and report upon methods of co-hperation between the Town Council and other bodies concerned witH the health and other social services 21. within the Borough, to assist if required in the co-ordination of such work, and to examine ways of encouraging recruitment of more voluntary workers. The need for such work was indicated by the consideration of the Housing Committee of the previously published report of the Working Party of the Surrey County Council on the Prevention of Break-up of Families. There was also a conference between the Housing Committee, the Old People's Welfare Committee and the W.V.S. at which all aspects of the provision of services for the elderly was discussed. During the year meetings of Field Social Workers in Chessington Area were held. There appeared to be a desire for all social workers to meet informally, and to establish contact with each other beyond the telephone. The meetings proved to be very helpful to all concerned. NURSING IN THE HOME. (District Nursing). The Headquarters of the District Nursing Association is at 21-23, Upper Brighton Road (Telephone No. Elmbridge 3027) where application should be made for the services of a district nurse or midwife. Such applications have to be supported by the family doctor under whose direction all home nursing is given. The District Nursing Services are administered by the Surrey County Council through the Divisional Medical Officer of Health who is also Medical Officer of Health for Surbiton. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS. The ante-natal clinic can serve as the focal point to all activities relating to the expectant and nursing mother. The health visitor from the ante-natal clinic follows up cases at home for the purpose of advising and helping the expectant mother in all matters relating to pregnancy. Mothers are also encouraged to attend these clinics after their confinement to make sure that full health and normality is restored. This service is additional and designed to supplement that which an expectant mother is entitled to receive from a general practitioner and midwife. HOME HELP service. Persons desiring to avail themselves of this service should apply, supporting their application with a medical certificate, to the Divisional Medical Officer, The Health Centre, Grange Road, Kingston-upon-Thames, who will arrange for the Divisional Home Help Supervisor to visit and investigate the application. water supply. The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply 2nd there are no wells or standpipes in use. 22. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. This dependable first class water supply is a tremendous factor in maintaining the good health of the people of Surbiton. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Hogsmill River is the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. Now that sewage effluent from Epsom is no longer discharged into it, it has become a clean stream again and small fish which have been absent for many years have re-appeared. The River Thames is the northern boundary and whilst there is no bathing a pleasant riverside promenade gives much pleasure to many people and boating and yachting are popular pastimes. The island known as Ravens Ait belongs to the Navy League and Sea Cadet Corps and is used as a national boat training station for sea cadets. SWIMMING BATHS Publicly owned bath. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is from Metropolitan Water Board mains and is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition thirteen samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School bath. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine with changes of water as necessary. Eight samples were taken by the Public Health Department to ensure adequate chlorination and fitness for bathing, all of which proved to be satisfactory. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved under contract for disposal into privately owned pits. SEWERAGE. There are very few cesspools remaining, nearly all properties in the Borough being connected to the public sewerage system, A little trouble is being experienced in the Hook area with the sewers which are proving inadequate to deal with the many new properties connected to them, and a new relief sewer is to be constructed by the Council along the Hook Road at an early date. 23. Flooding during times of heavy rainfall has also occurred in other parts of the Borough and sundry remedial works have been carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department and a new surface water sewer in the Tolworth area is under consideration. 24. COMPLAINTS. During the year 1,423 complaints were received with regard to the undermentioned matters, were duly investigated, and any necessary action taken.

NOTES: (i) Further details will "be found under headings "Food Hygiene',"Factories" , etc. (ii) No works carried out as a consequence of action under the Rent Act and Improvement Grant Scheme are included above. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases (a) where new housing accommodation would "be provided by the conversion of an existing building, (b) where additional accommodation was to be provided by adding rooms to meet the needs of the family, and (c) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. These grants are now known as "Discretionary Grants" and are paid solely at the discretion of the local authority. Seven applications for Discretionary Grants were received, four were approved, two withdrawn, and one not recommended. The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, requires local authorities to make grants towards the cost of providing "standard amenities" in dwellings; and makes certain amendments to the existing provisions relating to improvement grants. Further amendments to the scheme were introduced by the 1961 Housing Act. The standard amenities now are (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (b) a washhand basin; (c) a hot water supply at a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom, and at a washhand basin, and at a sink; (d) a water closet in, and accessible from within, the dwelling; (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. The amount of the "standard grant" which, subject to certain conditions, can be claimed as of right is one half of the cost of the approved works, subject to a maximum of £155. This limit of £155 is reduced as follows in respect of amenities which already exist Amenity Reduction: £ Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom 25 Washhand basin 5 Hot water supply 75 Water closet 40 Satisfactory food store 10 Forty-four applications for standard grant were received, 35 were approved, 8 not proceeded with, and 1 not recommended. 30.

RENT ACT, 1957. This Act, together with its accompanying Regulations has been in operation since 6th July, 1957. The Council has delegated to the Public Health Committee its powers relating to Certificates of Disrepair, and this materially helps in dealing "with applications in an expeditious manner which is so important in common fairness to the parties concerned. The position up to the end of the year is shown in the following summary:- 6th july to 31st Dec. 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 (1) No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 61 56 25 5 9 (2) No. of decisions not to issue Certificates 3 1 1 Nil 1 (3) No. of decisions to issue Certificates - (a) in respect of some hut not all defects listed hy tenants 40 36 16 5 4 (b) in respect of all defects listed 12 13 8 Nil 3 (4) No. of undertakings to remedy defects given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K) 27 34 19 4 4 (5) No.of such undertakings refused by Council Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil (6) No. of notices of proposal to issue a Certificate of Disrepairserved (Form J.) 52 57 25 5 7 (7) No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 10 32 5 1 Nil (8) No. of applications by tenants under consideration at the end of the year ( Form I) 6 1 Nil Nil 1 (9) Applications "by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of Certificates (Form M) Nil 16 9 3 2 (10) Objections hy tenants to cancellation of Certificates Nil 9 1 3 Nil (11) Decisions hy Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections.

There can be no doubt that a great deal of repair and redecoration of houses has taken place as a result of the Act - much of it without recourse to the Council. 33. FOOD INSPECTION Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not fit were surrendered by the owners and destroyed by burning or burying. The total weight of such goods was:- 1 ton: 2 cwts: 3 lbs: 13½ ozs. There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough, consequently the only meat inspection carried out is in butchers' shops, canteens, etc. Thirty-nine samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for human consumption. FOOD HYGIENE. Forty-four premises are registered under section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1933, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted pressed, pickled or preserved foods intended for sale, and twenty-one premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (including the preparation of fish by any process of cooking and the cooking of poultry). 1,159 visits were made to these premises and to shops,canteens restaurants, public houses, food handling businesses, and vehicles, to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation:- Protection of food from contamination 16 Hot water supply provided 15 Sinks and basins provided 8 Floors repaired, renewed, cleansed, etc. 5 Internal walls and ceilings repaired 8 Food rooms cleansed 48 Renewal or cleansing of equipment 6 WCs. cleansed, repaired, or new pans fixed 25 WCs. lighted or ventilated 2 Drains cleansed, repaired or re-laid 14 Refuse bins provided 4 Accumulations removed 9 Rooms ventilated 3 Artificial light provided to food room 1 Roofs repaired 1 Gutters or RWP repaired 2 Yards cleansed 2 New staff rooms constructed 2 Glass screen provided 1 Partition erected 1 Butchery cutting room constructed 1 New cutting blocks provided 1 Name and address displayed on vehicle 8 Miscellaneous 8 Whilst the standard of hygiene has been maintained at a reasonably satisfactory level, it is a subject which calls for constant attention by the Inspectors. 34.

FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) The Analyst's report and details of action taken on contravening samples were as follows:- 2408 (informal) Milk Deficient in milk solids other than milk fat to the extent of 4 per cent. This sample contained : Milk fat 8.53% Milk solids other than milk fat 8.14% It did not contain added water. The milk was abnormally rich in milk fat and may have "been drawn from the top of milk which had "been standing. This sample was taken at a school canteen kitchen. The explanation offered by the Public Analyst may be correct, or there is a possibility that the milk might have been prepared in some way for cooking purposes without the Sampling Officer being so informed. A subsequent sample was normal. 2424 (informal) Hi-Proteen Loaf Contained only 20.1 per cent of protein (N2 x 5.7) on the dry basis instead of a reasonable minimum of 22 per cent for an article of this nature described as "Hi-protein". The matter was taken up with the manufacturers. It Would seem that the Public Analyst took the opportunity to express his personal opinion that the recommendations of the Food Standards Committee are too low, but until the recommendations are implemented in the form of legislation prescribing standards there is no further action which can be taken. 2481 (informal) Wheatmeal loaf Contaminated with lumps of burnt blackened bread. Matter taken up with manufacturers who submitted a detailed report for consideration of the Council after which it was decided that no further action be taken. 2496 (informal) Milk & Vegetable Fat, Evaporated and Separated Deficient in fat and skimmed milk solids to the extent of 8 per cent and 9 per cent respectively as compared with the analysis on the label. This article is also subject to the minimum requirements of the Skimmed Milk and Non-Milk Fat Regulations, 1960, for protein and fat and the deficiencies in these respects amount to 16 per cent and 7 per cent. The sample contained 37. FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) 2496 (informal) (Cont.) Milk & Vegetable Fat, Evaporated and Separated Total solids 29.8% Fat, including oils 8.6% Skimmed milk solids 21.1% Protein derived from milk 8.0% After a thorough investigation the manufacturers admitted that an error had occurred and gave an assurance that action had been taken which would prevent a recurrence. The Council decided to issue a warning to the manufacturers. FOOD & DRUGS ACT,1955. Foreign bodies in food. Mouldy loaf. A resident complained that he had taken delivery of a small wrapped cut brown loaf which was later found to contain mould growth. After considering the circumstances and correspondence with the manufacturers the Council decided to send them a letter expressing concern at the incident and the hope that they would take all possible measures to prevent a recurrence. MILK SUPPLY. 1. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations,1960. These regulations came into operation on 1st January, 1961, insofar as they relate to dealers' licences, the effect being, inter alia, that all dealers' licences (except a few kinds which will be granted by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food) will be issued by the food and drugs authority for the area in which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is processed or sold. A dealer's licence no longer restricts sales to the area of the licensing authority and supplementary licences are therefore discontinued. A new form of licence, the dealer's (pre-packed milk) licence, is introduced which may authorise, in a single form of licence, the use of any or all of the appropriate special designations where the milk is obtained by the licensed dealer pre-packed i.e., in the container in which it is to be delivered to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer in accordance with a dealer's (pasteuriser's) licence, or a dealer's (steriliser's) liecence. The dealer's (tuberculin tested) licence is being retained for the purpose of re-selling such milk by wholesale or by retail. Dealers' licences issued on or after 1st January, 1961, will be valid for five years from that date, and will be renewable for subsequent quinquennial periods. Applications for Dealers' (Pre-Packed Milk) licences to use 38. MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) the special designations were granted; subject to the provisions of these regulations, until the expiration of the period of five years ending with the 31st day of December, 1965 Pasteurised 32 Sterilised 18 Tuberculin Tested 24 2, Registrations. - At the end of the year there were forty-four entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk (premises in the Borough) 32 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 3 3. Milk Sampling. - Eighty-seven samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests :- T.B.Biological Test Turbidity Test Phosphatase Test Methylene Blue Test Tuberculin Tested (Raw milk) 15 - - 2 T.T. Pasteurised - - 19 19 Pasteurised - - 41 35 Sterilised - 10 - - All samples conformed to the required standard. The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out: the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tuborcle bacilli. Twelve of the T.T.(Raw Milk) samples for T.B. test were taken at farms in the Borough. 4. Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. A complaint was made by a local resident concerning the dirty condition of a milk bottle delivered to her house. After considering the report of the Public Analyst and the observations of the suppliers the Council decided to send the distributor a warning letter. 39. ICE CREAM (i) Registration: 167 premises are registered by the Council under Section 16, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, as under :- For manufacture, storage and sale 3 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to toe limited to iced lollies 5 For storage and sale but not manufacture 159 (ii) Samples: 85 samples were taken, details being as follows :- Ice cream. Grade 1 81 98.781% 100% Grade 2 Nil Grade 3 1 1.219% Grade 4 Nil 82 Iced lollies. Grade 1 3 100% The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the "bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgement should "be "based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six monthly period, 50$ of a vendor's samples should fall into grade 1, 80$ into grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into grade 3j and none into grade 4. The results above show that a very high standard of hygienic quality is being maintained both by manufacturers and retailers. There is now no ice cream manufactured within the Borough, merchandise marks acts. The parts of these Acts for which the Council is responsible relate to false trade descriptions of articles of food and to the marking of certain imported foodstuffs with an indication of the country of origin. There is a tendency for the requirements of these Acts and the Marking Orders made thereunder to be 'overlooked' necessitating reminders to traders of their obligation. Three contraventions were observed during the year and a caution given in each case. There were no prosecutions. 40. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. The following sites remain licenced either under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, or the Public Health Act, 1936, Section 269. 1. The Riverhill Estate the lease of which is held by a local Sports Club and where 36 caravans are permitted. 2. One caravan in the orchard of a private house. 3. A temporary summer-house type of dwelling on a large plot of land used only occasionally. As in the previous year a great deal of trouble was caused by itinerant caravan dwellers who became attracted by four open sites in the Borough and were reluctant to move on. On one occasion more than thirty caravans were parked at one time, causing annoyance to local residents and making the site generally foul and untidy. All the offenders on various sites were eventually removed but on two occasions towing-off operations were necessary to effect this. There are now seven Orders under the Surrey County Council Act in force in the Borough prohibiting the parking of moveable dwellings. NOISE ABATEMENT. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, came into operation on 27th November, 1960, the main provisions being as follows:- (i) Noise or vibration. Under section 1 a noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with under Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. Under this procedure, local authorities will be able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises, and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates' court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft, which are subject to other statutory controls, nor to noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers. In the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practical means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect; (ii) Loudspeakers in s.treets. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., except in the following circumstances :- (a) For Police, Fire Brigade or Ambulance purposes, or by a local authority within their area; 41. NOISE .ABATMENT (Cont.) (ii) Loudspeakers in streets (cont.) (b) For communicating with persons on a vessel for the purpose of directing the movement of that or any other vessel; (c) If the loudspeaker forms part of a public telephone system; (d) If the loudspeaker (1) is in or fixed to a vehicle; and (2) is operated solely for the entertainment of or for communicating with the driver or a passenger of the vehicle or, where the loudspeaker is or forms part of the horn or similar warning instrument of the vehicle, solely for giving warning to other traffic; and (3) is so operated as not to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity; (e) Otherwise than on a highway, by persons employed in connection with a transport undertaking used by the public in a case where the loudspeaker is operated solely for making announcements to passengers or prospective passengers or to other persons so employed; (f) By a travelling showman on land which is being used for the purpose of a pleasure fair; (g) In case of emergency. No trade, business or entertainment may be advertised by loudspeakers at any time, except that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are on sale; the loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. (iii) Byelaws. Section 4 preserves existing byelaws and byelawmaking powers. The public soon became interested in this Act and 16 complaints were received during the year, some of which were rather trivial. All the complaints were investigated, and by persuasive means a number of items received attention which brought relief if not complete satisfaction to those aggrieved. This is a new field of activity for the Public Health Inspectors as hitherto no such powers have been in the hands of Councils except those with local Act provisions. The subject has therefore had to be approached with caution, out the response of those who found they were causing annoyance (even though insufficient evidence had been obtained to prove actual nuisance) has been most co-operative. It seems likely therefore that tactful handling of the situation will in most cases produce the desired results without recourse to statutory action, which is just as well, for the prescribed procedure appears to present many difficulties for those charged with the administration of the Act if the need for prosecutions should arise. 42. DISINFECTION. (a) (i) During the year disinfection was carried out free of charge at thirteen premises as under Poliomyelitis (or suspected) Tuberculosis 7 Suspected Food Poisoning 1 Enteritis 1 Miscellaneous 2 (ii) Disinfection was also carried out at twelve premises where non-infectious illnesses had occurred on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was Disinfected: Destroyed: Blankets 4 1 Mattresses 5 - Pillows 3 - Pillow cases 11 - Sheets 13 - Wearing Apparel 27 1 Counterpanes 2 - Bolsters 3 1 Towels 5 - Miscellaneous 20 - 93 3 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 28 No. of library books disinfected 45 DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed bu&s.etc. Council Houses: Other Houses: Found to be Disinfested infested: Found to be Disinfested: infested: Bugs - - 5 5 Fleas - - 1 1 (b) School Canteens. At the request of the Surrey County Council thirteen school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. 43. DISINFESTATION (CONT.) (c) Wasps nests. The Council has no responsibility for the destruction of wasps nests on private property, but many calls for assistance are received (66 this year). All complainants are visited and suitable advice given; in most cases the nests are easily disposed of by the occupier using a recommended insecticide at sundown when it can be applied with no danger to the operator. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 95 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. 1. It was not necessary to make any burial arrangements as provided by section 50 of the Act. 2. It was not necessary to make use of the powers of section 47 for compulsory removal to suitable premises of sick or aged persons in need of care and attention. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952. This Act which prohibited the sale, or letting, of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard was repealed during the year by the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, but the Regulations made by the Secretary of State were continued in operation. Nine visits were made to premises in the Borough to inspect appliances, and in no case was it necessary to take action. THE PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Four premises were licensed during the year. Twelve inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. 44. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Two hundred and thirteen visits were made in the administration of this Act and 7 infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purpose of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or "business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1961 was Antique dealers and second-hand furniture 8 Bakers 18 Boots and Shoes 28 Builders and Decorators supplies 29 Butchers 34 Cafes and Restaurants 39 Chemists 23 Confectioners, newsagents and tobacconists 93 Cycles, radio and television 26 Dairies and Milkshops 7 Drapers and Ladies' Outfitters 51 Electrical supplies 20 Fishmongers and Fried Fish Shops 15 General Stores 13 Greengrocers, Fruiterers and Florists 60 Grocers and Provision Merchants 75 Hairdressers 51 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 23 Licensed premises 54 Motor and Cycle dealers and Engineers 32 Tailors and Outfitters 14 Upholsterers and House Furnishers 15 Watchmakers and Jewellers 9 Miscellaneous 106 843 The present unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to shops is to be deplored. The 1950 Act is merely a consolidation of legislation passed between 1912 and 1938 and is to a large degree outmoded. Further, there have been many decisions given by the Courts which have rendered much of the Act virtually incomprehensible and consequently inoperable. It seems most desirable for the sake of traders, public and local authorities, as well as for Inspectors trying to carry out their duties in a state of uncertainty, that the situation should be straightened out at an early date. 45. FACTORIES ACT, 1957 to 1959. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 290 (251 mechanical, 17 non-mechanical and 22 works of building construction). Three hundred and sixty-seven visits were made to these premises and work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under :- Particulars: No. of cases in which defects found and remedied: Inadequate ventilation. 2 Insufficient sanitary conveniences 2 Unsuitable or defective sanitary conveniences. 13 Other offences, etc. 15 There were 64 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. Twenty-six visits were made but no infringements found. 1. INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health.

CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. (i) Smoke Control Areas. The Minister of Housing and Local Government requested the Council to re-consider their previous decision not to create any smoke control areas in the Borough at present hut to call for a further report from the officers in January, 1962. The Council resolved to adhere to their previous decision to review the question of an overall programme of smoke control in January 1962, and to inform the Minister that they are dissatisfied with the present procedure and urge him to alter the grant arrangements in accordance with their previous recommendations. (ii) Air Pollution - measurement and research. The Minister of Housing and Local Government drew attention to a co-operative scheme whereby local authorities undertook, or contributed towards, the cost of investigation and research into problems of air pollution particularly with regard to the measurement of air pollution. The essence of the scheme was the collation of measurements of air pollution of different kinds made by local authorities in various parts of the country. The work of collation and publication was undertaken by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Local authorities could participate in the scheme by taking and making available air pollution measurements or, whether or not they took measurements, by making a token contribution towards the cost of the services provided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in connection with the scheme. Local authorities could obtain the advice of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on what type of instruments to purchase, how to operate them and interpret the results and where to install them. The Council agreed to participate in the scheme by setting up a station for the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide, the necessary financial provision to be made in the estimates for 1962/63. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, places upon the occupiers or, in certain circumstances the owners, of land (including buildings) the responsibility for the destruction of rats and mice thereon and for keeping the land free from such pests. It is the duty of the Council to carry out inspections to see that this is done, and to secure so far as practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice. Where necessary they may serve upon owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. The policy of the Council is,however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff, who are primarily engaged to deal with Corporation property(including sewers) to give advice and practical help where appropriate,without charge subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. The Council is under no legal obligation to do this and does not undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but allows its staff to help so far as time permits. Every effort is made to give householders the best possible service with the staff available. Seventy-three schools, business and industrial premises were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. VISITS 1 .
