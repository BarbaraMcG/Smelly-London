To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year 1957 which has been prepared in accordance with Circulars 1/58 and 3/58 of the Ministry of Health. The vital statistics for the year call for little comment. The death rates in every case are below the national ones, but the birth rate, which shows an increase, is considerably above that for the whole country. There was very little infectious disease notified in the district during the year, the largest number being measles which was of a mild type, and whooping cough. An outbreak of influenza at the end of the year affected a large number of people particularly in the school population. This accounted for the rise in pneumonia notifications received. For ten years it is gratifying to report no case of diphtheria has occurred. During the year further progress was made under the auspices of the County Council with poliomyelitis vaccination and by the end of the year 813 children had received two injections. There were three cases notified of this disease during the year, one of which was paralytic. With the increase in the number of children vaccinated, one can hope for a considerable decline in these cases. Further poster displays were used during the year emphasising the need for hygiene in the handling of food, both in the home and elsewhere. It is pleasing to record that no cases of food poisoning were notified although three cases in one family came to the notice of the department, which proved to be due to roast pork which had apparently been contaminated in the home. Once again it is a pleasure to record the large amount of work done for the old people by the various voluntary organisations in the district. With the opening of the Melvin Hall a very attractive centre for their various activities has been provided. It has been possible during the year to make further progress with housing and with slum clearance, representation having been made in respect of two further areas. The year has been a difficult one for the department because we have had a vacancy for a public health inspector throughout the year. In a small establishment such as this it is a very serious loss. With the impact of the Rent Act this has meant a lot of work for the two senior inspectors and a certain amount of work has of necessity had to be put on one side until we have the staff and time to deal with it. That so much work has successfully been accomplished reflects great credit on all members of the department, and I should like to express my appreciation of their efforts in this report. During the year it was hoped to have made a pilot investigation on smoke abatement but this had to be shelved for the time being until it is possible to make the necessary inspection. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (Acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-year 1957 (estimated by Registrar General) 25,610 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1957 £330,750 Sum represented by Id. rate £1,031 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the old Crystal Palace the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 95 men and 47 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Crude Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 21.1 Adjusted Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 19.0 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 0.39 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still births) 18.1 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Live births 11.1 Adjusted Death Rate for 1,000 of estimated Home Population 11.02 Death Rates of Infants under One Year of Age All infants per 1,000 live births 22.1 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 20.3 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 1.85 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 541 compared with 495 in 1956. This gives a crude live birth rate of 21.1 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 19.38 for 1956. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local birth rates is 0.90. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 19.0 compared with 17.44 in 1956. Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 10, equal to a rate of 18.1 of 1,000 total births, compared with 20.2 for 1956. 5 Deaths The deaths registered totalled 285, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.1 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.6 in 1956. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates in 0.99. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 11.02 compared with 11.368 for the year 1956. The Death Rate for England and Wales was 11.5 compared with 11.7 recorded for 1956. Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 14. A large proportion of deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths, 193 or 67% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 53.2% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 42.8% of the total deaths, compared with 43.1% in 1956. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 44 giving a death rate for 1,000 Home population of 1.7 compared with 1.8 for 1956. The rate for England and Wales was 2.104. Tuberculosis The death rate per 1,000 Home population was 0.07 against 0.202 for 1956. The rate for England and Wales was 0.107. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year compared with one maternal death in 1956. The rate for England and Wales was 0.47 compared with 0.56 in 1956. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 12, corresponding to a rate of 22.1 for 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 18.2 for 1956. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 23.0. Ten of the 12 infants died under the age of four weeks, four from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1957:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births j Penge Urban District 211 18.1 11.1 22.1 England and Wales 161 22.4 11.02 23.0 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Two storage cisterns were renewed, cleansed or covered. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewerage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Additional manholes were constructed in the Council's sewers during the year. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse is collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector.

During the year five bodies were dealt with by the Council under these provisions. Under Section 47 of this Act it was necessary to apply for a Magistrate's Order for the removal of a woman in need of care to a home. This application was granted. MORTUARY During the year 16 bodies were brought to the Mortuary where post-mortem examinations were conducted by a Home Office pathologist. A refrigerating chamber is installed in the Mortuary. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation at all times.

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting the Annual Report of the Public Health Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1957, I would at the outset have it noted that the work of the department has been handicapped by reason of being without a District Inspector. It should also be noted that the coming into operation of the Rent Act, 1957, placed considerable work on the department both as regards administrative and inspectorial work. I am indebted to all members of the department for their co-operation and efficient service. During the year 597 complaints (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the great majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints were investigated and appropriate action taken when necessary. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises, 335 written informal notices and 51 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. Three hundred and fourteen intimation notices and 38 statutory notices were complied with. The Local Authority, in default of the owners, had carried out works required by four statutory notices under Section 39, Public Health Act, 1936. The Council also did the work required by seven notices served under Section 24, Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains) at seven premises. The amount of work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen on reference to the summary of work executed. Every endeavour is made informally to have notices complied with before statutory action is taken. It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against the owners or agents of three properties in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects, with the following results:— case no. result 1 Summons adjourned sine die since contractor had commenced the work between the taking out of the summons and the date fixed for hearing. 2 Order made to do work in six weeks. 15 3 Summons for non-compliance with Court Order. Fined 6d. per day for six months—£4 10s. Od. A Closing Order was made under Section 18, Housing Act, 1957, respecting one basement flat which could not be made fit for human habitation at reasonable cost. The drainage systems of 15 premises were relaid or partially relaid and 26 cleared of obstruction. Disinfestation of 33 rooms found to be verminous was carried out. Five licences to deal in game were issued during the year.

The co-operation of the food traders in bringing to the notice of the department the existence of suspected unsound food has been maintained. Warnings were given in two cases where traders sold articles of food to the prejudice of the purchaser. Milk Supply There are no cowsheds or pasteurising plants in the district. All milk sold in the district is special designated milk in sealed containers. There are four dairies on the Register and 24 persons are registered as distributors. 19 Milk (Special Designations) Orders Dealers' Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 5 Pasteurised milk 10 Sterilised milk 15 Supplementary Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 6 Pasteurised milk 6 Sterilised milk 6 Milk Sampling Samples of milk submitted to chemical analysis totalled 72, and all proved to be genuine. The samples gave the following averages:— Fat—3.56% (standard 3.0%) Solids not fat—8.79% (standard 8.5%) Thirty-three samples of pasteurised milk and 23 samples of tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk were submitted to the Phosphatase and Methylene Blue tests and all satisfied the tests. Fourteen samples of sterilised milk were examined and satisfied the turbidity test. Ice-Cream There are no manufacturers in the district, but 86 premises are registered for the sale of ice-cream, the shop-keepers obtaining their supplies from wellknown manufacturers. In the great majority of cases the ice-cream is delivered to the premises and sold in cartons or wrapped. Thirty samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the Methylene Blue test with the following results:— Grade I—24; Grade 2—3; Grade IV—1.
