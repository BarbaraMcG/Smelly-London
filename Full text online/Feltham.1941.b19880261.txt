December, 1943. - 6 - CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. Council Offices, Feltham, Middx. Dr. D. McCarthy, M.B., Ch, B,, Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Sir, On August 11th, 1941 all work in connection with billeting and requisitioning of properties was handed over to paid personel. Housing Inspection, This work was being carrifcfl out systematically by Mr, Connell from September, 1941 until April, 1942 when he resigned. The vacant post was not filled by another Inspector. This obviously Impeded the investigation of complaints and other vital work generally in the district. The shortage of houses is very acute in the district. Some thirteen houses condemned as unfit are in the majority of cases still being oocupied. Many houses have been taken over by firms as offices and by Civil Defence, which to a certain degree adds to the shortage, Food A distributing eentre under the Ministry of Food is situated at Bedfont from which meat is supplied to the following districtsiThe Boroughs of Twickenham and Heston and Isleworth and the Urban Districts of Staines. Feltham, Yiewsley and West Drayton, Sunbury ahd Hayes and H arlington. All meat before being finally condemned has to be examined by myself or Mr. Bell after having been returned by the above mentioned districts to the Meat Depot, It will be readily realised that this vital work has taken up a lot of time.
