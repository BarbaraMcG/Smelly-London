Notifiable Diseases. 2,042 notifications of Infectious Disease were received, or 1,007 less than in the previous year. This corresponds to a rate of 6.53 per 1,000 of the population. 1,635 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 393 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 6.66 per 1,000. 349 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 6.55 per 1,000. 845 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 7.09 per 1,000. 455 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 5.60 per 1,000. The greatest number of notifiable diseases occurred during the fourth week in March, when 58 cases were notified, which coincided with the greatest number of Scarlet Fever notifications in one week, viz., 37, which occurred during that period. The greatest number of notifications of Diphtheria in one week was 16, which occurred in the third week of February, the fourth week of March, and the third week of October. 12 The number of cases of Enteric Fever gradually increased in the autumn until the maximum was reached in the third week of November. The largest number of Notifiable Diseases occurred during the fourth week of July in the Limehouse District, the first week of July in St. George's, the fourth week of March in Mile End, and the second week of March, with the third and fourth weeks of October in the Whitechapel District. Wrong: Diagnosis. 181 cases of Infectious Disease were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which were subsequently returned home in consequence of the patients being found not to be suffering from the disease stated on the certificate, or any other notifiable disease. 89 of the cases were notified from the London Hospital and 15 from other public institutions. This number consisted of 82 cases of Scarlet Fever, 8 cases of Typhoid Fever and 91 cases of Diphtheria. Bacteriological Examinations. 110 specimens were bacteriologically examined, 27 giving positive results. They included the examination of two milks for the presence of the tubercle baccilli, and 49 specimens of sputum in suspected cases of Consumption. Number Positive. NumberNegative. Consumption 12 37 Diphtheria 12 39 Enteric Fever 3 5 27 81 Small Pox. Eight cases of small pox were notified, with one death. The first case of small pox occurred in a sailor named Gaffney, who had only recently arrived in the district. The patient left his ship, "Mombasa," in Algiers, on September 1st, when he and his four shipmates were admitted to a hospital. All were supposed to be suffering from "Java" fever. Two of their number died. After a few days at the hospital in Algiers, Gaffney returned to England as a passenger on the s.s. "Cordova," and arrived in Newcastle-on-Tyne on Sunday, September 26th. On Tuesday, September 28th, he came to London by a train due to arrive about 7 p.m. He called at his sister's house in Royal 13 Mint Square, but found that she and her husband were hop-picking in Kent. They had left their address at 134, Royal Mint Square, where Gaffney called, and remained for 10 minutes. I was unable to trace his movements from the time of his leaving Royal Mint Square until midnight, when he called on some of his friends at 3, Pell Place, Pell Street, St. George's. He was admitted into the house, and allowed to sleep in a bed-chair in the kitchen. He was then ill, but he does not seem to have had a rash at this time. Early the following morning he left, and visited his sister at Pembles Farm, Capel, near Tonbridge. He slept that night in a barn with his sister, brother-in-law, an old lady and her daughter. Gaffney was very ill during the night, and the following day (Thursday, September 30th) the five returned to London, occupying the same compartment in the train. No one else entered this compartment during the journey. Having arrived at London Bridge, he was taken in a cab to 135, Royal Mint Square. The railway carriage and cab were not disinfected as it was hopeless to try and identify them, when I found out these facts. A medical man was called in to see Gaffney on Thursday evening, and the doctor also visited him on the four following days as well. It is true there was a suspicion in the mind of the doctor that the disease might possibly be small pox, but the patient was very persistent in stating that it was "Java" fever, which he had suffered from, on several occasions, and which he had contracted on the West Coast of Africa. The patient was very positive that it was a relapse of the attack that he had at Algiers, and that the rash which had now developed was exactly the same. I was not asked by the doctor in attendance to see the patient until the following Monday morning (October 4th). The patient repeated the same tale to me, but I was positive that he was suffering from confluent small pox. He was removed to Joyce Green Hospital within an hour. I had his sister and brother-in-law at once removed to the Council's Shelter, and the premises at Royal Mint Square were disinfected. The two women who slept in the same barn contracted small pox many years ago. Gaffney himself was vaccinated in infancy and again when he was thirteen years of age. I communicated with the Medical Officer of Health of the district where the hop farm was situated, and obtained the addresses of those who slept in the immediate vicinity of the patient, and who were likely to have come in contact with him. I forwarded those addresses which were not situated in this Borough to the respective Medical Officers of Health. With regard to those situated in this district, I kept the occupiers under observation as well as those living in Pell Place. Gaffney died on October 9th. 14 On October 13th, Mary Ann and James Mulverhill—Gaffney's sister and brother-in-law—who had been at the Shelter since October 4th, were taken ill, and the rash appeared on October loth. They were taken to the Small Pox Hospital on October 15th. Both must have contracted the disease on October 1st, when the rash first appeared on Gaffney. On October 20th, Mrs. G-, of 134, Royal Mint Square, called at Dr. B-'s surgery. She had no rash at the time. He gave her a bottle of medicine, which contained bromide of potassium. A rash appeared soon after taking the first dose. On October 22nd, she again called at the surgery, and Dr. B- said the rash was due to the medicine. She was next seen by Dr. B- on October 24th. On no occasion did Dr. B- visit Mrs. G-— in her own home, neither did she mention the fact to the doctor that there had been a case of small pox next door. On the evening of Saturday, October 30th, the Superintendent of Royal Mint Square Buildings casually mentioned to another doctor- Dr. M- that Mrs. G- had a rash on her face, and that she lived next door to the place where the case of small pox occurred. Dr. M- called and notified the case to me. I received the notification on Monday morning. Mrs. G- was very indignant, and when I called, previous to the arrival of the ambulance, she had gone to see Dr. B-. Dr. B- again assured her that she was not suffering from small pox or any other infectious disease. As Inspector Wrack and I waited for her, she kept away from her house, purposely, in my opinion, until the afternoon. The ambulance had to go away without her. I saw her soon after she returned home, and I again telephoned her removal. Mrs. G- was not laid up, but mixed freely with other people during the twelve days that she had the rash, previous to her being removed to the hospital. In addition to calling four times at Dr. B-'s surgery, she was in the habit of frequenting four public houses. It will, therefore, be seen how impossible it was to keep all the contacts under absolute supervision. Mrs. G-'s husband, a stoker, was leaving London at 4 a.m on November 2nd, for a three weeks' voyage. He was stopped and taken to the Council's Shelter, where he was detained for 15 days. It will be remembered that Gaffney called at Mrs. G-'s premises on September 28th. He was removed to the Small Pox Hospital on October 4th, and his relatives were taken to the Shelter on the same date. Their premises were disinfected on September 28th, and afterwards closed. The clothing was removed to the Disinfecting Station. Mrs. G- maintained that she did not see Gaffney, or his relatives after September 28th. If she contracted 15 the disease on September 28th, she should have been taken ill on October 9th, and the rash appear on October 12th. If she contracted the disease on the day that Gaffney was removed to the Hospital—October 4th—she should have shown symptoms of small pox on October 15th, and the rash appear on October 18th. Mrs. G-, as well as the other residents of Royal Mint Square, were kept under observation until October 19th. On the latter date she appeared to be quite well, and there were no signs of a rash. I can only account for it in one or two ways. Either it was a case of delayed incubation, or Mrs. G- contracted the disease through using some article on October 6th or 7th that became infected on September 28th, but was not used for some time after it had been infected. I am of opinion it was the latter, as the incubation period of small pox is invariably 12 days, the rash always appearing on the third day of the onset of the disease. All the residents of Royal Mint Square were kept under observation. On November 8th, I found that J. O'B-, of No. 133, and Mrs. G-, of No. 121, who had been feeling unwell for two or three days, showed signs of a rash. They were removed to the Small Pox Hospital within an hour of the appearance of the rash. Mrs. C- had accompanied Mrs. G- to Dr. B-'s surgery on October 24th, and sat next to her in the waiting-room. On November 10th, Miss K-, of 137, Royal Mint Square, was removed to the Hospital. With the exception of Mrs. C-, all the persons who contracted the disease resided on the same floor as Gaffney. Mrs. C-'s tenement was on the floor underneath. On October 18th, P. O'B-, wife of the above-named J. O'B-, was taken ill at the Shelter, and was removed to the Small Pox Hospital on October 19th. With the exception of Gaffney all the persons notified were vaccinated in infancy only. These small pox cases are the first that have occurred in the Borough since March, 1906. I communicated with all the medical men practising in the Borough, drawing their attention to the outbreak and offering my services in assisting them to diagnose any doubtful case. 16 Scarlet Fever. 976 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, or 1,138 less than in the previous year. 922 were removed to the various Fever Hospitals. 216 belonged to the Limehouse District, with 6 deaths. 157 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with 4 deaths. 420 belonged to Mile End Old Town, with 12 deaths. 183 belonged to the Whitechapel District, with 3 deaths. The death-rate for the Borough was .08 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was .08 per 1,000. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 491 cases were notified during the year, or one less than in the previous year, and 473 were removed to Fever Hospitals. 87 belonged to the Limehouse District, with 8 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .13 per 1,000 of the population. 98 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with 13 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .24 per 1,000 of the population. 206 belonged to Mile End Old Town, with 21 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .17 per 1,000 of the population. 100 belonged to the Whitechapel District, with 9 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .11 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout the Borough was .16 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was .13 per 1,000. Enteric Fever. 63 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, or 20 less than in the previous year. 8 occurred in the Limehouse District, with no deaths. 10 occurred in St. George-in-the-East, with 1 death. 30 occurred in the Mile End Old Town, with 3 deaths. 15 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 2 deaths. The death-rate throughout the Borough was .01 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was .03 per 1,000. At the suggestion of the Local Government Board, arrangements were made for the bacteriological examinations of the stools and urines of persons who had Chart showing the number of cases notified week by week in the Borough, of Scarlet Fever, Typhoid and Diphtheria during 1909 Chart showing the total number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified week by week in Limehouse, St. George's, Mile End and Whitechapel, during 1909 Chart showing the total number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified week by week in the Borough during 1909. 17 been discharged from the Fever Hospitals after recovering from Typhoid Fever. These arrangements were made in consequence of opinions expressed by medical experts that persons who had thus suffered were often "carriers" of the disease for a long period after their discharge from the hospital. Seven bacteriological examinations of urines and stools were thus made with negative results in every instance. Typhus Fever. Two cases of Typhus Fever were notified, one occurred in St, George-in-the East, and the other in the Whitechapel District. Erysipelas. 484 cases of Erysipelas were notified, or 79 more than in the previous year. 77 belonged to the Limehouse District, with 2 deaths. 81 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with 4 deaths. 183 belonged to Mile End Old Town, with 8 deaths. 141 belonged to the Whitechapel District, with 5 deaths. Cerebro-Spinal Fever. Four cases were notified during the year, one having occurred in the Limehouse District, one in St. George-in-the-East, and two in the Whitechapel District. Puerperal Fever. 12 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, or 3 more than in the previous year. 3 occurred in the Limehouse District, with 4 deaths. 1 occurred in the St. George-in-the-East, no death. 4 occurred in Mile End Old Town, with 2 deaths. 4 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 1 death. There were more deaths in the Limehouse District than notifications. This is accounted for, by the fact that one case was notified towards the end of 1908, and was included in the number of notifications for that year, but the patient died in the early part of 1909. Anthrax. One case was notified, which occurred in the Limehouse District. Alfred Fernie, aged 38, was employed on barge work in Wapping, on Saturday, December 4th. On entering the cabin of an empty barge to get a light, he H 18 stated that he was stung by a "fly" on his temple. He afterwards went home, and on the following day he felt unwell. On Thursday he was so ill that he was taken to the Hospital, where the disease was diagonised as anthrax. The barge "George" on which he was stung ;was used exclusively in carrying waste paper.

O'B was admitted to the Gore Farm Hospital with Scarlet Fever, and was discharged on December 18th. on December 26th and 27th her two brothers were notified to be suffering from the same disease. Both patients were at once removed to the Hospital. Zymotic Diseases. The total deaths from diseases of a Zymotic character numbered 546, or 260 less than in the previous year. It includes deaths from Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Croup, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever and Diarrhoea. 141 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 2.39 per 1,000. 139 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 2.61 per 1,000. 169 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 1.41 per 1,000. 97 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 1.19 per 1,000. b 2 20 Measles. The number of deaths from measles was 236, or 28 less than in the previous year. 58 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .98 per 1,000 of the population. 58 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 1.09 per 1,000 of the population. 69 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .57 per 1,000 of the population. 51 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .62 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole Borough was .75 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was .48 per 1,000. The question as to the advantage of the notification of measles was debated by the Public Health Committee. It has been considered on several occasions by previous Committees, but it has always been decided not to recommend making it a notifiable disease. The number of deaths from measles in the Borough since 1901 was as follows: — 1901 155 1902 158 1903 162 1904 176 1905 151 1900 171 1907 155 1908 264 1909 236 As I have stated in previous reports, ignorance on the part of mothers of the seriousness of the disease, is probably the principal factor in the high mortality from measles. They fail to recognise the fact, that children suffering from measles, are very liable to complications, such as broncho-pneumonia, which is possibly the most frequent secondary cause of death. It is thought 21 that measles is such a trivial disease, that the sooner the child gets it, the better it is for him and all concerned. Whereas, it is an admitted fact, that beyond the age of two years, the older the child becomes, the less liable he is to the disease; and if contracted, children over five years of age rarely succumb. In 1903, the London County Council made an order that all the sections of the Public Health Act, 1891, relating to notifiable diseases, should apply to measles, with the exception of that section which would make it obligatory on the nearest relative, or the doctor in attendance, to notify the patient so suffering to the Public Health Authorities. The Order was approved by the Local Government Board, and came into force on April 1st of that year. A person is liable to heavy penalties if he exposes infected clothing, or allows a person suffering from measles, whilst under his charge, to be in a public place. The premises must be disinfected when the patient has recovered from measles, and is presumably free from infection. It was assumed by the London County Council that information would be given to us by the school authorities, as well as by the parents themselves. It is true that we receive information from teachers that certain children are absent from school, and that such children are supposed to be suffering from measles. As a rule the teachers' notifications are based upon the report of the school attendance officer, or upon information given by children in the same house, or neighbouring houses. To that extent the information is unreliable. When visits are made by officials of the Sanitary Authority for the purpose of enforcing isolation and disinfection, the mothers of the children in question often deny the statement made to us by the teachers. They usually state that the patients had suffered from an illness other than measles, and pointed to the children as being quite well at the time of the visit. Unreliable as the information from the school teachers is, it is rendered even of less value from the fact that the child has been absent from school for a considerable time, when the inquiries by the Sanitary Inspector are made. In some cases, we are able to persuade the parents that the disease may have been measles, and it is to the interest of the other children that the premises should be disinfected. In such circumstances it would be useless to attempt to insist upon the premises being disinfected, if the parents refuse to have it done. If police court proceedings were taken, the evidence of the parents could not be controverted, if they stated that the child had not suffered from measles, and the case would probably be dismissed. If teachers refused to 22 accept any excuse as to the child's absence from school, except a written one, it would be more difficult for the parents to afterwards deny the existence of the disease. During the school holidays, we are without even this meagre information. For the above reason alone, the order of the London County Council is, in my opinion, of no great value, and it must be admitted that it has as yet shown no tendency to lessen the incidence of the disease in this Borough. It would, of course, be expensive to make measles a notifiable disease, and it is doubtful whether the expenditure would be justified if adopted. It is true that it has been tried in many of the large provincial towns, but the conditions are somewhat different. In all places where the experiment has been made, a certain number of patients at the onset of an epidemic were removed to the fever hospitals. During the height of the epidemic, the hospital accommodation was found to be inadequate. The Metropolitan Asylums Board, however, do not admit patients to their fever hospitals, if they are known to be suffering from measles. In considering the question of expense, the amount now paid to medical men for notifying infectious diseases would be doubled. This would be a small matter compared to the sum that would be necessary to provide sufficient hospital accommodation. Even with a sufficient number of Fever Hospitals, we could not expect to have the same good results with respect to measles, as we have in the other notifiable diseases. The children that contract measles are generally younger than those who suffer from scarlet fever. Thirty-two per cent. of the children that died from measles in this Borough in 1909 were under one year of age. Ninety per cent. of the remainder were between one and two years of age. The majority of the children that died from scarlet fever and diphtheria were between two and five years of age, and 15 per cent, were above five years of age. The objection to removing children under a twelvemonth old, or even under two years of age to a fever hospital, is obvious. Measles differs from other notifiable diseases in the fact that it is very infectious before the rash appears, and days before the disease can be recognised with any certainty. The removal of children suffering from measles to fever hospitals being thus out of the question, it may be asked whether notification without subsequent removal would be of any benefit. 23 Ninety-seven per cent. of the scarlet fever and diphtheria cases were removed to the fever hospitals in 1909, because it was found impossible to have them properly isolated at their own homes. This also proves that it would be equally impracticable to isolate children suffering from measles at home. By means of notification, we would certainly receive information where the first cases occur. The inspection of the premises and the isolation of the patient, if possible, with full instructions as to the prevention of its spreading to other children, would be of some value. Periodic visits to see that these instructions are being obeyed, would tend to an increased appreciation of the serious nature of the disease, and thus to prevent it spreading. The parents could at the same time be warned of the danger of pulmonary complications, which are so frequently fatal. The unprotected children were excluded from attending the Infants' Department of 14 schools, for periods ranging from 3 to 16 days. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths from Whooping Cough was 65, or 64 less than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death-rate of .21 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was .26 per 1,000. 25 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .42 per 1,000 of the population. 11 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .20 per 1,000 of the population. 17 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .14 per 1,000 of the population. 12 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .14 per 1,000 of the population Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, which includes Epidemic, and Zymotic Enteritis, Dysentery and Dysenteric Diarrhoea, Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea was 153. Of these, 134 were under one year of age. 40 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .67 per 1,000. 51 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .95 per 1,000. 43 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .36 per 1,000. 19 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .23 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole Borough was .48 per 1,000 of the population The death-rate for the whole of London was .33 per 1,000. 24 Enteritis. The number of deaths from Enteritis, which includes Gastritis, GastroEnteritis, Muco-Enteritis and Gastric Catarrh, was 104. Of these 76 were under one year of age. 20 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .33 per 1,000 of the population. 22 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .41 per 1,000 of the population. 37 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .31 per 1,000 of the population. 25 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .30 per 1,000 of the population. Diseases of Respiratory Organs. There were 1,162 deaths due to diseases of the Respiratory Organs, which corresponds to a death-rate of 3.71 per 1,000 of the population. 237 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 4.01 per 1,000. 215 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 4.04 per 1,000. 392 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 3.28 per 1,000. 318 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 3.91 per 1,000. Phthisis. 521 deaths occurred during the year from Phthisis, or 27 more than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death-rate of 1.66 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was 1.31 per 1,000. 93 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.57 per 1,000. 102 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 1.91 per 1,000. 146 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 1.22 per 1,000. 180 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 2.21 per 1,000. 25 Number of Deaths from Consumption from 1901 to 1909 :— Limehouse District.

The Local Government Board issued an order, which came into force on January 1st, 1909, to provide for the notification of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis amongst the inmates of Poor Law Institutions, and amongst persons under the care of District Medical Officers. 20 The notification must be posted within 48 hours after the Medical Officer has first recognised the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, and must be addressed to the Medical Officer of Health for the Sanitary District in which the residence of the patient is situate. It is the duty of the Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution to post to the Medical Officer of Health within 48 hours, a notification of the actual or intended place of destination of any person leaving the Institution, in respect of whom a notification has been made by the Medical Officer of the Institution. The Relieving Officer must notify the Medical Officer of Health within 48 hours of his obtaining accurate information of the change of address of any person in respect of whom a notification has been made by a District Medical Officer. The Medical Officers of Poor Law Institutions and the District Medical Officers are paid at the rate of one shilling for every notification, and sixpence for every notification after the first. In the case of a Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution or a Relieving Officer, the remuneration is at the rate of three pence for every notification. Nothing in these Regulations shall have effect so as to render the person notified, or the person in charge of the patient, liable to a penalty, or subjects the patient to any restriction, prohibition, or disability, affecting himself or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood, or residence, on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Subject as aforesaid, a Council—on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health—in the case of a poor person in relation to whom a notification in pursuance of these Regulations has been posted to the Medical Officer of Health, may, for the purpose of preventing the spread of infection from pulmonary tuberculosis:— (i) Take all such measures or do all such things as are authorised, in any case of infectious disease, or of dangerous infectious disease, by any enactment relating to public health, and as have reference to the destruction and disinfection of infected articles, or the cleansing or disinfecting of premises. (ii.) Take all such measures or do all such things as are appropriate and necessary for the safe disposal or destruction of infectious material, 27 produced and discharged, as a result of Pulmonary Tuberculosis; and otherwise for the prevention of the spread of infection from any such material. (iii.) Afford or supply all such assistance, facilities, or articles as within such reasonable limits as the circumstances of the case require and allow, will obviate, or remove, or diminish the risk of infection arising from the conditions affecting the use or occupation of any room, when used or occupied by the poor person as a sleeping apartment; and (iv.) Furnish for the use of the poor person, on loan, or otherwise, any appliance, apparatus, or utensil which will be of assistance for the purpose of any precaution against the spread of infection. 800 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified under these Regulations during the year, viz.:— Limehouse 130 St. George's 176 Mile End167 Whitechapel 327 800 Ages of Persons Notified. District. Under 5 years. Between 5 & 15. Between 15 & 25. Between 25 & 65. Over 65. Total.

Several of the cases have been reported as many as seven and eight times. The patients are constantly being re-admitted to the Infirmaries after having been discharged to a private address a few days previously. Under the Regulations, the Medical Officer is compelled to notify the case each time that the patient is admitted or discharged. This, of course, accounts for the large percentage of duplicate notifications received. 29 cases were voluntarily notified. 28 Infantile Mortality. 1,130 infants died under one year of age, which corresponds to a deathrate of 118 per 1,000 births. This number is 190 less than in the previous year. The infantile mortality throughout London was at the rate of 108 per 1,000 births. 256 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 133 per 1,000 births. 200 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 145 per 1,000 births. 391 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 106 per 1,000 births. 223 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 104 per 1,000 births. Though the infantile mortality remains at a high figure, it shows a marked and continuous improvement, as is evident by the following table: — Limehouse District. St. George's. Mile End. Whitechapel District. The whole Borough. 1899 210 199 161 147 174 1900 227 141 166 140 166 1901 211 185 150 140 165 1902 197 160 163 117 155 1903 165 170 122 138 141 1904 208 161 145 143 158 1905 163 157 140 119 142 1906 168 141 126 123 136 1907 131 130 112 110 119 1908 171 141 117 108 130 1909 133 145 106 104 118 There were 54 deaths of illegitimate children during the year, or at the rate of 306 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 12 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 375 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 12 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 285 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 21 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 318 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 9 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 250 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 29 Among the factors which are supposed to enter into the causation of infantile mortality, the industrial employment of married women ranks high in some quarters. Formerly, married female labour was almost universally held to be an etiological factor of preponderating importance, and the general tendency of legislation has been towards placing checks on the industrial employment of married women. It is very difficult to eradicate a fallacy which has originated in high quarters, and when a high authority asserted that the absence of the mother from the home, constitutes one of the greatest dangers to infant life, those unacquainted with the social, economic and sanitary circumstances of the industrial classes accepted the dictum in its entirety. The application of more precise methods of investigation has cast grave doubts on this view, and has called for a re-statement of the whole case. The Registrar-General in his report for 1905, discusses the question of Infantile Mortality, and the employment of married women. He took two groups of 15 towns, each containing respectively the lowest and the highest proportions of occupied married women, and compared their birth-rate and infantile mortality in two quinquennia. The birth-rate is, as might have been anticipated, lower in the towns having a high proportion of the married women industrially employed. The relationship between industrial employment of married women and infantile mortality is, however, not very visible. In the first group of towns having only 4 to 8 per cent. of its married women engaged in industrial occupations, the infantile mortality in 1901—5, varied from 101 in Burton-on-Trent to 202 in Aberdare, the average in the 15 towns being 161. In the second group of towns having from 20 to 39 per cent. of its married women engaged in industrial occupations, the infantile mortality varied from 140 in Rochdale to 206 in Longton, the average for the 15 towns being 168. More recently, inquiries have been conducted at the suggestion of the Home Office, and the publication of these results will be awaited with great interest. Special reports on the subject have been made by workers in this field of labour, and one of the most interesting is that of Dr. Robertson, of Birmingham. In Birmingham the area selected for inquiry comprised two wards, both of which have a high death-rate, a high infantile mortality, and a large proportion of married women industrially employed. The mortality among the infants whose mothers were industrially employed either before or after childbirth, was at the rate of 190 per 1,000 births, while among those whose mothers were not industrially employed, it was 207 per 1,000 births. The general conclusions 30 drawn by Dr. Robertson are, that the influence of industrial employment is largely masked by the general state of poverty; but that, so far as the investigation goes, the type of industrial employment in vogue does not appreciably influence the health of the mother or her infant, when the standard of comparison is that of women in equally poor circumstances, but not so employed. If the results of married female labour are analysed more closely, it will probably be found that the antenatal influences are less injurious than those which follow after the birth of the child. The causes of death most profoundly affected by antenatal causes are prematurity, congenital debility, and convulsions ; and it is probable that the deaths from these diseases are not higher amongst children whose mothers are industrially employed, than among children of women under similar social conditions but not so employed, other conditions, of course, being equal. In the Limehouse District, which contains the largest proportion of married women employed in factories in the Borough, 25 per cent. of all deaths under one year of age in 1909 were attributable to the three above-mentioned causes, while in the Whitechapel District, which contains the least proportion of women so employed, 19 per cent. were due to these causes. In the Limehouse District, 16 per cent. of all deaths under one year of age were due to prematurity, while in the Whitechapel District the number was 11.6 per cent. This disparity is probably due, not so much to the industrial as to the social conditions which prevail in the two districts. Married female labour, however, bulks less largely than the great economic condition of poverty which brings to the mother insufficient food and insufficient rest. In this district, poverty is the chief cause of married female labour. The mothers go to work, not from choice, but from necessity. It is doubtful if work is injurious to the expectant mother, provided it be not heavy or prolonged. The improved food and greater comfort, which this work means, should more than counteract its disadvantages. The actual effect of the employment of women on infantile mortality, can only be determined by further investigation and more exact information, not only as to the sanitary surroundings of the selected areas, but also as to the kind of employment. If the antenatal effect of married female labour is not obvious, the conditions under which the child is brought up as a result, undoubtedly affect the infantile mortality. 31 Although the question resolves itself to a consideration of the conditions under which children are hand-fed, it is not advisable that our survey should be limited to this aspect alone, but should also include some of the factors which tend to produce hand-feeding. This is essential for more than one reason. It must be clearly realised that human milk is not only the best food, but that no other milk can be made into a perfect food for infants. In infant feeding, nature is superior to art, and the milk of any species of animal is a highly specialised product, specialised mechanically, chemically and physiologically to suit the digestive system, nutrition, rate of growth, and mode of life of the animals of that species. The so-called "humanised" milk is not humanised in the true sense of the term. It is true that other milks can be modified so as to resemble human milk in chemical composition, but milk is not an inert liquid, depending for its nutritious qualities on the chemical substances it contains. It is a living liquid with important biological properties. There is evidence that human milk contains substances derived from the mother, and that these substances carried by the milk into the infant's body, protect it from the attacks of diseaseproducing bacteria. It is extremely rare for infants on the breast to suffer from measles, scarlet fever, or any of the acute infectious diseases. These observations are made not for the purpose of discouraging any improvement in the conditions under which children are being artifically fed, but in order to show that extreme care is necessary, lest an inducement be given to mothers to wean their offspring unnecessarily, and prematurely. Fortunately, the human organism is eminently capable of adapting itself to circumstances, and in spite of the above facts, healthy children can be brought up on the bottle in a majority of instances. We have to consider the factors which compel artificial feeding, when it becomes inevitable to what extent can they be obviated, and can the conditions under which the children are artificially fed be improved. There are in the Borough of Stepney, factories of various descriptions where married women are employed. This industrial occupation compels the mother to leave her home for a considerable part of the day. The women who have young families are compelled to have their children cared for during the day, and the alternative is either to leave the baby in charge of a very young child, in a "baby minder's" house, or a creche. As far as sanitary conditions are concerned, there is no doubt that a creche is superior to the other two. The mother does not select the house where the baby is cared for, on sanitary 32 grounds, and the standard of cleanliness in the "baby minder's" house is usually below that of the average of the neighbourhood. In a report of the London County Council, the advantages connected with creches were shortly summarised as follows:— The creche is usually healthier and cleaner than the child's home, the treatment is more enlightened, and the method of feeding better adapted to the child's tender years. Every creche can show children who have come there miserably anaemic, and suffering from rickets, whose health has visibly improved after some weeks of the creche's treatment. Where no creche exists, the mother, who is obliged to go out to work for her living, is compelled either to leave the child during the day where it cannot be properly cared for, or to place it out to nurse—in either case at a cost in excess of her means. At the creche the child is taught cleanliness and good habits, becomes stronger and healthier, and is given a better chance in life. Creches are under medical supervision, and the promptitude with which a case of sickness is treated, often prevents more serious consequences. The mother is required to bring the child clean; better methods of feeding are learnt; and the cleanliness and discipline of the creche insensibly react to the advantages of the home. Fortunately, in this Borough, five creches have been established, viz.:— Dr. Barnardo's Home; Nursery for Jewish Infants, New Road; St. Paul's Creche, Wellclose Square; George Yard Creche; and 154, St. George Street. At the creche attached to Dr. Barnardo's Home, children are looked after and fed for twopence a day, and in the case of widows for one penny per day. The number of infants that can be accommodated is limited to 50, the average number being 40 per day. The distance whence the babies are brought is also limited to the radius of one mile from the creche. During the school holidays the creche is closed, as it is found that the babies are looked after by the other children. When the babies cannot be thus accommodated at the creche, the mothers state that they usually pay about 3s. a week to women for looking after the babies for them. There are no means of isolation at Dr. Barnardo's Creche, but each child is washed on its arrival and put into clean clothes, which are supplied to it. If there are any signs of a rash the child is taken home at once. There is no open playground. 33 Nursery for Jewish Infants, New Road.—Fifty infants can be accommodated at this creche, but the average number is 35 per day. The amount paid for each child is twopence per day, and no child is allowed if its home is more than 1½ miles from the creche. Each child has a bath on admission, and is dressed in special clothing provided for it during the time it is in the creche. There is an open playground attached to the creche, and each room is adequately ventilated. An isolation room is provided. St. Paul's Creche, WeIlclose Square.—The average number of infants accommodated is 24 to 34, although there is room for 40. There is a large open playground, which is utilised during the warm weather. The mothers pay threepence per day for each child. Most of the mothers reside in St. George's or Whitechapel, but no child is refused. The long tube bottle is, unfortunately, in use at this creche. The children are given a bath if it is thought necessary, but not as a routine on their arrival. They are kept in their own clothes all day, and no special clothing is provided. There is no isolation room, but if a child is suspected to have an infectious disease, it is taken into the kitchen for the rest of the day. George Yard Creche.—The average number of infants is 18, but 20 can be accommodated. The long tube bottle is sometimes used. The children do not have baths and no special clothes are provided, but they are kept in their own clothes all day. The mothers pay threepence a day, and the infants are brought from any distance. I have seen a child which had been brought five miles from its home to this creche. 154, St. George Street.—This is a creche in connection with a soup kitchen at the above address. Children from the immediate vicinity only are taken in. No fixed charge is made, but the mothers pay what they can. The children do not have a bath, and are kept in their own clothing all day. The average number of children at the creche is 10, but 18 can be accommodated. One of the objections raised against creches is their liability to encourage premature weaning, and in some creches it must be admitted that this danger is not sufficiently appreciated. The establishment of a creche need not tend to discourage breast feeding, and in one of the above mentioned creches the mother is asked to return twice a day to give the breast to the baby. As an encouragement to the mothers to suckle their children, a glass of milk or a cup of cocoa is given to the mother in some creches whenever they come to suckle their children. In addition, the Notification of Births Act enables the Sanitary Authorities to advise mothers against premature weaning. c 34 Another objection urged against the establishment of creches is based upon their liability to act as foci in the spread of infectious disease. This objection refers almost entirely to measles. Everyone admits that wherever young children congregate, measles is liable to spread among the children. This danger is met to a very great extent by the care exercised by the matron in charge of the creche in examining each child on its admission. The objections to creches can be fairly met, and the difficulties arising in their management can to a certain extent be obviated. Two or three small creches are better than one large one. The French, who are the pioneers in this movement, consider that the ideal creche should be conducted by a private body and partly supported by the Municipality. This plan ensures personal interest with proper public supervision and control. The creche can also be made a centre of educational work and interest. The Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration recommended the establishment of Municipal creches wherever it was thought desirable, owing to the employment of married women in factories or for other reasons. Girls over 14 years of age might" be made to attend occasionally, and the teaching of infant management to such girls should be eligible for aid from the grant for public education. Old Age. 217 deaths were attributed to Old Age. This corresponds to a death-rate of .69 per 1,000. 65 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.10 per 1,000. 25 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .46 per 1,000. 102 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .85 per 1,000. 27 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .33 per 1,000.

The number of deaths due to Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver was 52, or 4 more than in each of the previous two years. 13 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .22 per 1,000. 6 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .11 per 1,000. 19 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .16 per 1,000. 11 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .17 per 1,000. The death-rate throughout the whole Borough was .16 per 1,000 of the population. As I have mentioned in previous reports, the death-rate from Alcoholism is gradually and steadily declining in the Borough, as is shown in the following table, although it is slightly higher in 1909 than in the previous year:— In 1901 the death-rate was .33 per 1,000 of the population. In 1902 the death-rate was .33 per 1,000 of the population. In 1903 the death-rate was .25 per 1,000 of the population. In 1904 the death-rate was .31 per 1,000 of the population. In 1905 the death-rate was .21 per 1,000 of the population. In 1906 the death-rate was .23 per 1,000 of the population. In 1907 the death-rate was .15 per 1,000 of the population. In 1908 the death-rate was .15 per 1,000 of the population. In 1909 the death-rate was .16 per 1,000 of the population. Cancer. The deaths due to Cancer were 202, or 21 less than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death-rate of .64 per 1,000. 45 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .76 per 1,000. 28 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .52 per 1,000. 75 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .62 per 1,000. 54 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .66 per 1,000. c 2 30 Deaths of the Homeless and of Inmates of Common Lodging Houses. During the year, there occurred in Lunatic Asylums, the deaths of 54 persons stated to have been removed into institutions from this district, but for whom no definite addresses could be given when the deaths were reported to the Registrars. 13 of these were stated to have been removed from the Limehouse District, 7 from St. George-in-the-East, 10 from Mile End Old Town, and 24 from the Whitechapel District. In addition to this, there were during the year, 205 deaths in Public Institutions, of persons admitted thereto from Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. After all, this is not a very large number when it is remembered that there are in the Borough, 40 Common Lodging Houses with nearly 6,000 beds, and in addition, a number of houses with over 400 furnished rooms, let nightly, in a manner similar to the ordinary Common Lodging House, and in which between 700 and 800 persons sleep every night. As the Borough possesses a river frontage of two and a half miles, a number of unknown persons are found, during the year, drowned on the foreshore. These deaths are included in the death statistics for the districts in which the bodies are discovered. During the year, the bodies of ten unknown persons were found in this Borough, eight of which are included in the Limehouse returns, one (found drowned in the London Dock) is returned in St. George's, and one in Whitechapel. In addition to the above, two unknown persons died in Dr. Barnardo's Homes in this Borough. These are included in the Limehouse returns, together with three others, whose addresses were unknown, who died in the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, and five who died in the Stepney Workhouse. In the St. George's returns are included four persons, with unknown addresses, who died in the St. George's Infirmary. In the death-statistics for Mile End are included 16 deaths of persons, who died under similar conditions in the Mile End Infirmary. In the Whitechapel returns, there are entered 98 deaths of persons with unknown addresses, 93 of which occurred in the Whitechapel Infirmary and Whitechapel Workhouse, 3 in the London Hospital, and 2 in the street. 37 The occupants of Common Lodging Houses should not, perhaps, be classified with the homeless, as some of the former occupy the same bed for a period of many years, and are of a different type to those who hardly every sleep in a bed, or who always frequent places of free shelter only, like the Medland Hall. Both of these classes consist of persons lower in grade than the ordinary occupants of the cheapest and meanest Common Lodging House. They are generally the "waste" of our industrial system, victims of misfits and failures, who, often fov long periods are tossed about hither and thither, until finally they are found settled, as it were, in the East End of London. They never have sufficient money to pay for a night's lodging, and they are possessed with a dread of the Casual Ward, on account of the toll of manual labour demanded of them in the morning, in return for food and a night's shelter. They gravitate towards the East End of London from all parts of the Metropolis, and of the Country, because here charitable effort has been focussed, and a number of places, like the Medland Hall, have been provided, in which half a pound of bread and butter and a night's rest can be obtained free of charge. They eke out a miserable existence for a time on the streets, and when an illness overtakes them, they arc admitted into the nearest infirmary or workhouse. The expense of their maintenance and the cost of their burial (if the illness proves fatal, as it frequently does in the case of persons so physically unfit) fail on the ratepayers of those districts in which these free charitable institutions are to be found. During the last few months the number of persons accommodated every night at Medland Hall is barely one-half the number that used to sleep there. This is due to the fact that certain restrictions are now imposed which allow a man to have accommodation for one week only in three months. Should he return at the end of three months, he is allowed a second week's shelter, but he is then barred for six months. At the end of that time he may have another week, but he will not afterwards be allowed accommodation for a period of twelve months. The cost of their maintenance to the ratepayers must be a very substantial item, as 50 per cent. of the deaths of homeless persons as well as those admitted from Common Lodging Houses were due to Consumption, which lasts for a long time before it terminates fatally. There is another danger in the fact that before their admission into a public institution, no precaution is taken to prevent the spreading of the disease among other persons with whom they come into contact. I am not entering into a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of free shelters, nor am I considering the question whether free shelters 38 are beneficial in supplying, to any extent, the wants of the lowest class, or as may be said on the other hand, are demoralising, their provision having a tendency to cause men to sink lower in the scale. I simply call attention to the important fact that the death-rate in the Borough of Stepney is materially increased by the influx of these homeless wanderers, while the same is also true of the expenditure by the various Poor Law Authorities in the Borough. Articles destroyed at the Disinfecting Station on account of their dilapidated condition and at the request of the owners:— Mattresses 33 Palliasses 12 Beds 19 Bolsters 7 Pillows 13 Cushions 8 Sundries 120 Verminous Persons. 883 verminous persons were cleansed during the year and their clothing disinfected. Of these 570 were adults—568 males and 2 females. 313 children were cleansed, all of school ages—257 being boys and 56 girls. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The number of bodies deposited in the Mortuary during the year was 645. Of these, 592 were removed by the Coroner's order, 40 by the Police, 10 at the request of friends and 5 on my instructions. Six of the bodies were those of persons who had died from infectious diseases and were placed in the infectious part of the Mortuary. 24 bodies were deposited in the Jewish part of the Mortuary and were "watched " in accordance with the Jewish rites. 632 Inquests were held in the Coroner's Court and 131 Post Mortem examinations were made. Glanders. Under the London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907, the Veterinary Inspector of the London County Council reported, in accordance with the provisions of that Act, the existence of glanders in 37 stables in the Borough, in which 85 horses contracted the disease. .39 ARTICLES DISINFECTED DURING 1909.

Pursuant to the Third Section of the Canal Boats Act 1884, I have to report with regard to the execution of the above Acts and of the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken during the year to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations, viz.:— 1. Canal Boats coming within the District are inspected by a Sanitary Inspector, who receives a sum of £10 per annum for the performance of this duty. His inspection is irrespective of the examination of Boats made prior to their Registration. 2. The number of Boats inspected in 1909 was 76, and the condition of the Boats and their occupants, as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations was very good. 3. Infringements of the Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows, viz.:— (a) Registration—Nil. (b) Notification of change of Master—Nil. (c) Certificates—Nil. (d) Marking—One. (e) Overcrowding—Nil. (f) Separation of Sexes—Nil. (g) Cleanliness—Nil. (h) Ventilation—Nil. (i) Painting—One. (j) Provision of Water Cask—Nil. (k) Removal of Bilge Water—Nil. (l) Notification of Infectious Disease—Nil. (m) Admittance of Inspector—Nil. 4. No legal proceedings were taken. 5. In the case.of infringements, notices were sent to the owners of the Boats requiring them to remedy the cause of complaint, and to forward to this Borough within a specified period a certificate signed by some duly appointed Inspector of Canal Boats, that the same had been duly done. Such certificates were afterwards received. 6. No case of Infectious Disease occurred. 7. No Boats were detained for Cleansing and Disinfection. 41 8. The number of Boats on the Register on December 31st, 1909:— (a) Number of Boats believed to be in use or available 18 (b) Number of Boats that cannot be traced 7 9. No Boats were registered in 1909. Removal of Human Bones. Human bones were discovered during the course of excavation for the purpose of constructing a strong room for the London and Provincial Bank, at 167, Whitechapel Road. The area excavated, measured 25 feet by 10 feet and 10 feet deep. The remains were found at depths varying from 2 to 8 feet, and consisted of bones belonging to at least 80 bodies. They were not unearthed from any particular part of the portion of the earth excavated, but were distributed over the whole area. No remains of coffins were discovered either as wood, nails or brass plates. No skeleton was discovered complete with the bones in situ, but on the contrary, six or seven skulls were found quite close to each other. In the earth between the bones, a farthing was found dated 1733. From the presence of the farthing, and also of ancient drain pipes of very old and others of more recent origin it looks as if an old plague-pit in the immediate neighbourhood had been disturbed at some time after the year 1733, and the contents were re-buried at the rear of No. 167. It is well-known that the Mount —which was close by—was constructed by Oliver Cromwell as a military fortification during the Civil War in 1660. The Whitechapel Road—or as it was then called the Road to Harwich—was the main thoroughfare by which the Royalist troops could enter London from the Eastern Counties. There is no record that any engagement took place at the Mount in which a number of soldiers were slain. There is no official record that a plague-pit existed at this spot. It has been handed down by tradition that there was a plague-pit at the Mount. This may mean that it was actually at the Mount itself or in its immediate vicinity. On the other hand the portion of the earth that has been already excavated at No. 167, Whitechapel Road, may be the situation of the plague-pit itself. I am disinclined to believe this from the position of the bones themselves and the presence of the farthing. It is quite possible that in levelling down the Mount they filled up the holes and hollows at the same time, and that the human remains were removed with the earth. The Mount was undoubtedly in existence in 1748. The plague occurred in 1665, and in June of that year it was very prevalent in the then West End parishes of Holborn, St. Giles, and St. Martins-in-the- 42 Fields. There were 421 deaths in these three parishes in the second and third weeks of July, when the East End was quite free from the disease. It ultimately reached Stepney, through Clerkenwell and Shoreditch. The epidemic did not reach its height in the East End until the end of August. Defoe, in his Journal of the Plague year, says that the pits were about 40 feet long, 15 to 16 feet wide, and about 20 feet deep. At first, they used to bury 50 to 60 bodies in each pit, but later, they made larger holes and buried from 200 to 400 bodies according to the number that the cart brought in a week. No bodies were allowed within G feet of the surface. There was a very large pit in Aldgate Churchyard, in which 1,114 bodies were buried. In three weeks there were 2,006 deaths in the parish of Stepney and 1,206 in the Parish of Whitechapel. It must be remembered that these parishes were then but sparsely populated, and that the people resided mostly in riverside parishes, such as Shadwell and Wapping. In 1660 there were only a few houses along the portion of the Whitechapel Road where No. 167 is now, with fields at the back. According to an old map which I have consulted, there had only been a slight increase between 1660 and 1733, but in 1745 new buildings were being erected. On account of the number of bodies that had to be buried and the difficulty of carting them, the plague-pits were placed close to the main road. It is, therefore, quite possible that there was a plague-pit at the rear of No. 167, Whitechapel Road. The bones were placed in four large boxes, covered with vegetable charcoal, and were reintcrred in the Chingford Mount Cemetery, after a license had been obtained from the Secretary of State. Whilst preparing the foundation for the erection of new buildings at the rear of Nos. 12 and 14, Church Lane, a quantity of human bones were unearthed. At the rear of No. 12 the remains of 30 bodies, and at the rear of No. 14, 15 bodies were removed. The ground must have at one time formed a portion of Whitechapel Churchyard before it became encroached on by buildings. There had been a post-mortem examination on one body, the skull having been properly sawn in order to examine the brain. The bones were placed in suitable cases and the Home Secretary informed of the facts. A license was obtained from the Secretary of State allowing the bones to be removed to another burial ground. 43 DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDERS. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 976 registered premises where milk is sold, which included 37 cowsheds. 238 premises were removed from the register, due to their unsuitability, and 109 were refused registration for a similar reason. 470 premises were registered conditionally. Each shop was considered on its merits, and certain conditions were imposed before it was registered. The conditions for every new registration generally included that:— (1) The shop, milk receptacles, and utensils must be kept scrupulously clean. The milk must also be kept in a cleanly condition. (2) The milk must be covered by a proper ventilated cover; paper, muslin or a plain board not being allowed. (3) Boxes of minerals or other boxes, sacks, bags, etc., must not be allowed to remain on the floor, but raised on shelves at least a foot from the floor. This allows the floor to be swept, otherwise it would only be swept when the sacks or boxes became empty, and dirt would accumulate under and behind them. (4) The shop must be swept and scrubbed frequently. (5) The shelves must be kept free from dust. (6) No paraffin, coal, coke or vegetables are to be sold. The purveyors of milk were warned that their names would be removed from the register if the conditions were not complied with. In addition to the above conditions, it was necessary in some shops to make structural alterations before they could be entered on the register.

Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908. These Regulations came into operation on January 1st, 1909, at a time when large quantities of meat were being imported. The meat consists of carcases of pigs, sheep, and calves with their offal, from Belgium, Netherlands, and France. When the Regulations became applicable, the Local Government Board, had approved of the examination instituted by the Netherlands 47 Government only, and all meat carrying the official label of that country was generally allowed to be landed without examination. However, it was thought advisable to make an occasional examination of the carcases of pigs, with the result that a total of 24 pigs' carcases were rejected at 5 examinations. The Belgian Government had not instituted any system of examination of meat exported from that country, therefore each pig was carefully examined. From January 7th to April 16th inclusive, there were 13,860 carcases of pigs landed in our District, of which 276 were condemned. When the pork season again opened in September, the Belgian Government had instituted an examination and labelling of some of their exported meat, but French traders were sending pork unlabelled via Belgium. Of this class, there were landed between September 17th and December 31st, 3,887 carcases, of which 60 were condemned, making a total for the year as follows: — Belgian and French 336 carcases condemned. Dutch 24 carcases condemned. 360 The reasons for condemnation were as follows: — Tuberculosis. Removal of Lymphatic Glands. (Suspected parts). Dropsy. Emaciation. Pyaemia. Peritonitis. Slaug-hter House Inspection. The slaughter houses have been regularly visited during the times of slaughter, with the result that 4,494 lbs. of meat and offal were condemned owing to disease. This condemned meat consisted of: — 1 Body and 1 Forequarter of Beef. 2 Carcases of Mutton. 28 Bullocks' Heads. 2 Sheeps' Heads. 5 Bullocks' Kidneys. 36 Sheeps' Livers. 18 Bullocks' Livers. 48 130 Sets of Bullocks' Lungs. 25 Sets of Sheeps' Lungs. 6 Bullocks' Tongues. 6 Cows' Udders. Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907. On two occasions it was found necessary to seize and ask for a magistrate's order for the destruction of unsound food on the wharves under this Act, which consisted of 543 boxes of dried plums. The Act does not empower Local Authorities to prosecute the owner of unsound goods, so dealt with, therefore no further proceedings were taken after the plums were destroyed.

On March 12th. Mr. Joseph Rosenberg, 135, Christian Street, was summoned for having deposited in his bakehouse liquid eggs for the purpose of preparation for sale, the same being unfit for human food. He was fined £15 with £3 costs. On March 16th. Mr. Joseph Magnus, of 137, White Horse Street, was summoned for exposing for sale tins of rabbit and tins of jam, the same being unfit for human food. He was fined £30, with £3 3s. costs. On April 14th. Mr. William Darby, of 59, Elsa Street, was summoned for exposing unsound fish for sale. He was fined 40s. with 23s. costs. On October 1st, Emanuel Lawrence, of 3, East Mount Street, was summoned for exposing cherries for sale, which were unsound and unfit for human food. He was fined £5 with 23s. costs. On October 18th. Mr. Abraham Gross, of 3, Winterton Street, was summoned for exposing for sale about 5½ cwt. of Greengages on a stall in Watney Street. The defendant did not appear, and the case was adjourned for 7 days. The defendant did not appear at the adjournment, so the Magistrate granted a warrant for his arrest. He was arrested on December 16th, and fined £12 12s., with £3 3s. costs, or in default, 6 weeks hard labour. 51 On December 3rd. Mr. Harris Lewin, of 22, Umberston Street, was summoned for having deposited in his bakehouse, for the purpose of preparation for sale, 95 eggs and a quantity of liquid eggs, which were unfit for human food. He was fined 40s., with 23s. costs. On December 3rd, Mr. Harris Grodsky, of 135, Christian Street, was summoned for having deposited in his bakehouse, for the purpose of preparation for sale, a quantity of liquid eggs which were unfit for human food. He was fined £25. On December 3rd, Mr. Lewis Greenwood, of 49, Anthony Street, was summoned for having deposited in his bakehouse, for the purpose of preparation for sale, one pint of liquid eggs which was unsound and unfit for food of man. He was fined £25 or two months' imprisonment. Sale of Horse Flesh. Several statements have recently been made that horseflesh is openly sold as human food in the East End as well as in some of the other poorer parts of the Metropolis. These statements, I believe, originated in a report made towards the end of the year 1907 by the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, in which it was stated that, "there can, of course, be no doubt that much catsmeat is still eaten by human beings in London. It is largely sold in extremely poor neighbourhoods, and the women seen buying four pennyworth or five pennyworth are clearly not buying for cats." It is also stated in the same report that the bulk of the cats meat is consigned to the East End of London. The bulk of horseflesh sold in London is brought from the country, but from 60 to 70 tons a week are produced by a firm of Knackers in London itself. With the exception of three firms, the trade is in the hands of East End firms, who import 75 to 80 tons a week from the country, and sell it to the various retail catsmeat shops in London. About 40 years ago an East End trader imported a small quantity of horseflesh from the provinces. Previous to this time, all the horse flesh sold as cats meat was produced in London. His business increased, with the result that others started in the same trade in the immediate vicinity. This is probably the reason why the East End is the chief dumping ground or the centre of distribution of catsmeat for the whole of London. Very little horseflesh is utilised for the feeding of cats in the provinces, hence its despatch to London. The meat is boned and boiled before it is sent by rail. [d 2 52 On an average 8 horses are required to be boiled down to produce one ton of catsmeat. The flesh loses about one-third in the process, so that to supply the existent demand, between 1,000 to 1,100 horses are required every week. About 10 tons of horseflesh used to be brought into London every week from Glasgow and other parts of Scotland. This trade has now diminished to less than one-half, owing, I am credibly informed, to the fact that in Scotland, horseflesh is pickled and exported to Sweden and other Continental countries. Several years ago, at a time when there was a glut of horseflesh on the London market, an East End firm attempted, under official supervision, to carry on a similar trade. Some of the meat was pickled and some smoked. It had soon to be given up, as it was found that the price obtained for it on the Continent was not much more than could be obtained in London, when it was sold as catsmeat. It is true that it was possible to convert the pickled portions into sausages, but it would be impossible to utilise the smoked portion in this manner. An attempt was also made to salt and afterwards to smoke horse tongues, and sell them as Reindeer tongues, but this did not prove a success, because horse tongues were found to be too thick to be passed off as Reindeer tongues, although bearing a general resemblance to them. The difference between horse tongues and ox tongues is so great as to be obvious to any one, and it is almost impossible for the horse tongues to be sold as human food when they are fresh. The tongue of the horse is longer, narrower, and more pliant than that of the cow. The surface is smooth while that of the ox is comparatively rough. The end of the tongue of the horse is broad, while that of the ox tapers almost to a point. Of course it is a much simpler matter to distinguish horse tongue from that of the ox when fresh than after salting. Apart from other marked differences, horseflesh is drier than ordinary cooked meat, and it is most unappetising in appearance. Horse meat in general has a dark red colour, which assumes a bluish sheen on the surface after lying for a long time. It is stated that in cooking and on the addition of sulphuric acid, the distinctive odour of the horse stable is developed. I have been unable to obtain this myself, for although the odour is distinctive enough, it is of a very disagreeable character and quite different to that given off when any other kind of meat is treated in the same way. The fat of the horse is light golden in colour and more oily. In cattle the breast-bone is broad and flattened, while in the horse the front portion is keel-shaped. The ribs in cattle are flatter and broader in the middle and lower third than in the horse. It will therefore be seen that the difference between horsflesh and beef are so marked and distinctive that raw horseflesh exposed for sale in butchers shops would 53 at once attract the attention of the Sanitary Inspector. No horseflesh has been seized in the Borough of Stepney since its inception nearly ten years ago. With respect to horseflesh sold as catsmeat, there are in the Borough 35 purveyors of this article, 14 of whom sell in shops only. 3 have rounds only, i.e., hawk it in the street or call from door to door, 13 have a shop and round, while 5 sell it on stalls in market places. These retailers sell on an average about 7 tons of catsmeat every week, including about 30 horse tongues. In a certain newspaper, it was stated that in Whitechapel within a short distance of Aldgate Station, there are several shops where horseflesh is sold for human food. There is of course no shop in the East End of London licensed to sell horseflesh as human food, and to sell it for anything but for human food a license is not necessary. Curiously enough, there are only 3 catsmeat shops in the whole of the Whitechapel district, which includes the parishes of Whitechapel, Mile End New Town, Spitalfields, etc. There is therefore less catsmeat sold in this part than in any other part of the Borough for the following reasons:— 1. The high proportion of Jews, relatively, to the rest of the population. Jews do not as a rule keep cats. When they do, they do not often feed them with catsmeat. Jews are great fish eaters, and the fish heads and entrails are given to the cats instead of, or in addition to, the catsmeat. I found this to be the case in other parts of the Borough where streets have recently been occupied by Jews. The trade in catsmeat in these streets has practically disappeared. 2. The great number of model buildings in this area. Fewer cats are kept in model buildings than in houses. The result has been that the catsmeat trade has disappeared almost entirely, in the Whitechapel District. In other parts of the Borough the cause of the decline of the trade has been unemployment. Purveyors of catsmeat, who had occupied the same catsmeat shops for many years in a part of the district where the residents are casual dock labourers, informed me that the diminution in the sale of catsmeat has been enormous in that part of the Borough, where there is a larger number of unemployed. Two purveyors who had lived in the same shop for over 30 years attributed the decline of their trade to less than one-half, entirely to this cause. As the unemployment increased, poverty also increased, and the cats were naturally got rid of. If there were any foundation for the statement that poor people eat catsmeat, the sale of catsmeat would have increased in recent years, in proportion to the increase of unemployment and poverty. This is not so. In every part of the Borough there 54 has been an appreciable decrease, both in the amount sold by each purveyor, as well as in the number of people who sell catsmeat. Besides, in market places in the district, scrags of mutton are sold for 2d. to 2½d. a pound, a price as low as that of catsmeat. It is true it is frozen meat, but no one can deny that it is more nutritious, and more palatable than catsmeat. The retail price of catsmeat varies from two pence to two pence halfpenny a pound. The usual amount expended by each customer for catsmeat in this Borough is a farthing to a halfpenny, and rarely does it exceed the latter sum. Occasionally a customer buys one pennyworth. Only ten purveyors had sold a pound of catsmeat at a time, and then it was to neighbouring tradesmen who were well known to them, and were also known to keep dogs. Three purveyors only sold fourpennyworth at a time, and as in the case of the one pound customers, the buyers were not only well known, but were also known to keep large dogs as well. It is curious that in some streets catsmeat dealers sell catsmeat at every house while in other streets hardly a single occupant buys catsmeat. As I have already stated, throughout the whole Borough about 30 horse tongues are sold every week. There is a considerable amount of waste attached to tongues, so that dealers prefer not to have them, and they are sold as cheap rough meat for dogs. I have interviewed every single dealer in catsmeat in the Borough, and each one was emphatic in his statement that none of his customers bought it for human food. Even the very poorest people insist on the farthing's worth being wrapped up in paper, and then they carry it home in a gingerly fashion as if it were something unclean and revolting. It is true that when I inquired at two shops near the docks, I was told that sometimes foreign sailors ask to be served with catsmeat, but they are told that it is not meant for human food. Some persist, admitting that they know it is horseflesh, and that they have been accustomed to eat it abroad. They are never served. This happens in two shops about once a year, and has never occurred in any of the other places. At present there are three shops in the Borough in which human food is sold as well as catsmeat. In two of them, however, the catsmeat is not horseflesh, but lungs of sheep, ox, &c., which are boiled for the purpose. In the third, tea is the only article that is sold for human consumption, and in addition, feathers are curled—a curious combination of trades, the purveying of cats meat and tea, and feather-curling. There has been a great improvement in this respect during the last few years. Eight years ago a man who sold human food as well as catsmeat in several shops in 55 the Borough was heavily fined for exposing diseased meat for sale. His defence was, that it was not intended for human food. Very wide publicity was given to the heavy penalty inflicted, and to the remarks of the Magistrate on the occasion, with the result, that several shops were closed, and the sale of articles not intended for human food was discontinued. A mistake has possibly arisen from loose statements made with regard to the eating of offal. Offal is defined in the dictionary as "waste meat, the parts of an animal butchered which are unfit for use or rejected, carrion, refuse, rubbish," whereas offal in the butchering trade includes the stomach, sweetbread, liver, heads, tails, kidneys, &c., and does not mean refuse, rubbish, or waste meat. A butcher in using the word offal may be referring to the most dainty bit of the carcase, while a layman may interpret it as designating something objectionable. A great danger lies in the fact that country knackers, who send horseflesh to London, occasionally send beef and mutton as well. Cows and sheep that have died are taken to them, and in most cases are sent by them to London dealers to be sold as catsmeat. Sometimes, however, an unscrupulous knacker will send such meat carefully boned with the obviously diseased portion cut off, to an equally unscrupulous butcher. I examined recently the books of a railway station in Essex, and discovered that large consignments of meat were sent to butchers in London by a knacker in the village, although his license did not allow him to slaughter any animal intended for human food. Boned meat if intended for human food should always be looked upon with a great deal of suspicion, if not prohibited altogether. The Local Government Board appreciated this danger and the difficulty of recognising diseased meat when boned, that in their Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908, boned meat is prohibited from being landed at British ports. In connection with the subject of the sale of horseflesh, some reference may be made to the exportation of worn out horses and the importation of sausages. From September until the end of March, about 120 to 150 horses a week are exported from a certain wharf in South London to Ghent. These horses are in a poor condition, but they are carefully examined to see whether they are in a fit condition to make the journey, and whether they are suffering from Glanders. These horses are undoubtedly killed for the purpose of sausage making. About 110 to 150 horses are exported from a wharf in the City of London to Rotterdam every week throughout the year, as well as about 45 horses a week from the London Dock. These horses are in a better condition than those exported to Ghent, and they are also carefully examined before they are taken on board ship. These horses are really in a fit condition to work, but on their arrival at Rotterdam, they are escorted by Government Officials and the Police, to the slaughterhouses 56 where they are killed within three days. They are afterwards sold in the ordinary way in butcher's shops, and are not converted into sausages. Rotterdam, as well as other continental towns, are supplied with sausages from Ghent. German sausages are only sold in 8 shops in the Borough, the price being 1/8 to 2/- a pound. They are therefore too expensive to be sold extensively in the East End of London. It is stated that the presence of horseflesh may be inferred, when a fairly large quantity of Glycogen is found to be present by chemical examination. Mutton and pork do not contain any Glycogen, but it may be present in beef under certain circumstances. In the presence of bread, it is impossible to obtain the Glycogen reaction without first separating the starch. This complicates the analysis of sausages.which generally contain bread and other starchy matter. I have examined German sausages from each of these eight shops, but have failed to detect the presence of horseflesh in any of them. It is true that there are other shops in the Borough where German sausages are supposed to be sold. These so-called German sausages are manufactured in the Borough of Stepney, entirely by Jews. The meat is therefore not horseflesh, as Jews will neither eat nor prepare for human food any animal that has not been slaughtered according to the Jewish religion. I have had over 24 years' experience of the East End of London, including five yeais as a medical man in general practice, and 13 years as a Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. I have found no evidence whatever that poor people in the Borough of Stepney eat catsmeat, and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that they do not knowingly eat horseflesh, either as catsmeat or sausages. Inhabited House Duty. During the year, seven applications were received for certificates under the Inland Revenue Act, 1903, for the purpose of securing remission or reduction of inhabited house duty. These referred to 44 tenements, all of which ultimately were satisfactory and certificates were given. General Sanitary Work. In the Sanitary Inspectors' Report table will be found the amount of work carried out by each Inspector during the year, together with its nature. 30,296 houses were inspected, 7,017 being the result of house to house visitation.

Police Court proceedings were taken in 43 instances where the statutory notices were disregarded. This number does not, of course, include proceedings under the Food and Drugs Acts. 9,832 drains were tested with smoke and 2,288 were either constructed or re-constructed, cleansed or repaired, and 745 were trapped. 315 new soil pipes were fixed and ventilated; 1,623 new closet pans and traps were fixed and 2,208 closets were either cleansed and repaired, or provided with additional light and ventilation, as well as 2,168 water closets provided with proper flushing apparatus. 2,951 yards, forecourts and areas were paved or repaired. Notices were served to provide 1,240 sanitary dust receptacles and 35 manure receptacles were provided; 752 offensive accumulations were removed from the rear of dwelling houses. 287 houses were ventilated underneath the lower floor. 52 underground rooms, which were illegally occupied, were discontinued from being used as such. 64 notices were served for the abatement of smoke nuisances. 349 bakehouses were visited and 284 cleansing notices were served. Overcrowding. 13,909 inspections were specially made for the purpose of detecting overcrowding and 645 living rooms were found to be overcrowded. The nuisance was abated in 575 cases without its being necessary to serve statutory notices. Police Court proceedings were necessary in four instances only. 4,028 houses were cleansed, and the water supply was re-instated to 207 houses. 58 287 sink, bath, lavatory and rain water pipes were disconnected; miscellaneous repairs were made to the roofs, floors, gutters, etc., of 5,292 houses, and damp walls were remedied in 568 houses.
