William Pile, Ltd., Printers, " Hehald " Office, Carshalton. CARSHALTON URBAN DISTRICT. Medical Officer's Report for the year 1905. I. Population, Births, and Deaths. Population.—The following figures from the last five Census returns shew the increase of population and of the number of inhabited houses in the District:— Census year. Population. Inhabited houses. 1861 2,538 492 1871 3,668 732 1881 4,842 910 1891 5,425 1,091 1901 6,746 1,329 If the population had increased at the same rate since the last Census as in the previous ten years, it would be about 7,400 in the middle of the year under review, but this estimate is probably too low, as a considerable amount of building has taken place recently, especially to the south of the town, and the population may be estimated at 7,500 in the middle of the year. Births.—The Births registered in the district during the year were 193 in number, representing an Annual Birth-rate of 25.7 per thousand of the estimated population, as against an average rate of 27 per thousand for the previous ten years. The illegitimate births registered in the district were seven in number, in addition to four illegitimate births among persons belonging to the district in the Epsom Infirmary. The birth-rate for England and Wales, for the year, was 27.2. Deaths.—The Deaths registered in the district during the year numbered 103, as against 117 in the previous year. Seventy deaths occurred in the town, 9 in the Cottage Hospital, 22 in the Croydon Rural Isolation Hospital, and 2 in the Home for Friendless Girls ; two of the persons who died in the Cottage Hospital were parishioners of Carshalton, but the remaining 31 deaths in Institutions occurred among patients belonging to other districts, and have to be deducted in estimating the death-rate. Thirteen parishioners of Carshalton died in the Epsom Infirmary, one in the Cuddington Isolation Hospital, and one in the Sutton Cottage Hospital; these 15 deaths in outside Institutions, added to the 72 deaths of parishioners in the district, give a nett total of 87 deaths, which represent an Annual Death-rate of 11.6, as against a rate of 14.2 in the preceding year, and an average rate of 13.4 for the previous ten years. The death rate for England and Wales for the year was 15.2. Causes of Death.—Two deaths were ascribed to Measles, 1 to Diphtheria, 2 to Influenza, 1 to Diarrhoea, 4 to Phthisis, 13 to Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 8 to Cancer, and 1 each to Appendicitis and Tetanus. Infant Mortality.—The deaths of Infants under one year were 19 in number, and were at the rate of 98 per thousand births, as against an average of 136 for the previous ten years, and a rate of 128 for England and Wales for the year. One of the children, who died in the Home for Friendless Girls, did not belong to the district, and two children belonging to the district died in January in the Epsom Infirmary. A new Table, in the form issued by the Local Government Board, giving the causes of death in detail for each month under one year of age, will be found on page 10. The District Council requested the Registrar of Births and Deaths for the Sub-District to supply me weekly with full copies of the certificates of births of children registered in the district. I was thereby enabled to distribute in suitable cases copies of a card, supplied by the Surrey County Council, upon the Feeding and Care of Infants, and I sent out 80 copies in all. The Zymotic Death-rate for the year was 0.53 per thousand of the population. II— Infectious Diseases. There was no special outbreak of notifiable infectious disease at any time during the year. Small Pox.—No case was reported. (4) Scarlet Fever.—Two cases were notified at the Cottage Hospital in March and September respectively, and 8 cases were notified in 6 private houses, viz., 3 cases in one house in January, and single cases in February, March, July, September, and December. Three of the patients were removed to the Cuddington Isolation Hospital, and the two patients at the Cottage Hospital, both of whom came from Beddington, and one patient from Beddington Corner, close to the Croydon Rural District Council's Hospitatal, were removed to that Institution, which is situated in Carshalton. Diphtheria.—Five single cases were notified, in March, May, June, August, and September. Two patients were removed to Cuddington Hospital, where one of them died, and one patient at Beddington Corner was removed to the Rural Council's Hospital. Enteric Fever.—Two cases were notified, in June and September. One patient was removed to Cuddington Hospital. Diarrhœa caused the death of an infant, aged 3 months. Another infant died of the same disease in the Home for Friendless Girls. The death of a boy, aged 8 years, was ascribed to Gastro-ententis. Measles was very prevalent in the spring, and caused two deaths of young children in June. The various Elementary Schools were closed for a short period in May and June, as a precautionary measure. Whooping Cough caused no death. Four cases of Erysipelas, none of which proved fatal, were notified. No case of Puerperal Fever was reported. Tubercular Diseases.—The deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Phthisis or Consumption) were four in number, and were at the rate of 0.52 per thousand, which is below the average rate for the preceding ten years. One death was caused by Tubercular Meningitis. No application was made during the year for the examination of any specimen from patients suspected to be suffering from Phthisis. Fumigation of rooms was done by the Inspector in five houses at which deaths from Phthisis had occurred. Bacteriological Examinations.—Two specimens were examined at the Lister Institute, at the expense of the Council, for the presence of the Bacillus Diphtherias, with one positive and one negative result. No applications were made for the examination of specimens for the Widal (Typhoid) reaction. The Isolation Hospital.—The number of patients who were removed to the Joint Hospital for treatment, from each of the four districts for which it provides accommodation, is shewn in the following table:— Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Total in 1905. Total in 1904. Total in 1903. Total in 1902.

Among other inspections of cottages, I again made a reinspection throughout Harold Road, and found that the whole of the works required by the Council had been completed; the structural repair and cleansing of these cottages, the lowering and paving of the yards, and the provision of an efficient system of surface-water drainage, have brought about a marked improvement in the sanitary conditions in this road. A cottage in The Square, which had been closed in the previous year, was drained and put into a good condition of repair, and a neighbouring cottage was closed by the owner und repaired, under notice from the Council. Three cases of overcrowding were discovered and abated upon the service of notices. In compliance with the instructions of the Council, the Inspector visited all the stables in the district, and served notices to enforce the requirements of the Bye-laws relating to the keeping of animals, in all cases in which he discovered nuisances. The piggeries were also visited, and a copy of the Circular upon Pigkeeping, issued by the Board of Agriculture, was delivered to each pigkeeper. (5) A tabulated list of the work done by the Sanitary Inspector will be found on page 7. 2.—New Streets and Buildings.—The Surveyor informs me that 144 plans for new buildings, including 24 for additions to existing buildings, were submitted for approval under the Bye-laws during the year. The corresponding number for the ten years 1895 to 1904 were 62, 48, 39, 50, 80, 82, 69, 120, 60, and 102 respectively. Plans for one new street were also submitted. 8.—Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops.—The names of four Cowkeepers and of two Dairymen and Purveyors were added to the Register during the year. A milk-seller purveying in the district was warned to register or to cease to purvey, and proceedings were ordered to be taken against him, upon his failure to comply with the notice. The Sanitary Inspector made periodical inspections of all the premises, which he found to be keep in a clean condition, and to comply in all respects with the requirements of the Model Regulations. The Veterinary Inspector continued his quarterly examinations of the cows belonging to the registered cowkeepers, and reported that he found all the cows to be healthy and free from signs of tuberculosis, upon each occasion. The number of Cowkeepers, etc., on the Register, and of the visits paid daring the year by each of the Inspectors are as follows:— Cowkeepers registered during the year 4 Cowkeepers on Register at end of year 8 Dairymen and Purveyors on Register at end of year 2 Visits by Sanitary Inspector 32 Visits by Veterinary Inspector 23 4.-The Slaughter Houses upon the Register are 4 in number, and 9 visits were paid by the Inspector, who found the premises to comply with the Bye-laws. 5.—Sewers and Sewage Disposal.—A complaint was received from the Croydon Rural District Council with regard to the condition of the brook into which the effluent from the Outfall Works discharges, but there was no indication that the effluent had deteriorated. The filtering area, however, was allowed to rest for three weeks, and the sewage was treated by irrigation in the meantime. The sewer in Park Lane was completed in April, and all the houses on the line of the sewer were connected. Sewers were also laid in two new roads. The Surveyor informs me that the drains of 16 existing premises and of 103 new houses were connected with the sewers during the year. 6.—House Refuse.—The weekly removal of house-refuse, was continued by the Contractor. Galvanised ashbins were provided by the owners to 21 houses. IV.—Factories and Workshops. A tabulated Report upon the administration of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in the form given below, is now required by the Home Office. In the majority of workshops not more than three or four persons are employed, and no defects of importance were discovered. Section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, is in force in the district. At the eleven factories, including Skin and Parchment Mills, and Iron Works, in which a considerable number of work-people are employed, the sanitary accommodation, both as regards sufficiency and separate conveniences for each sex, has received special attention in previous years, and accommodation has been provided in each establishment to the extent of one water-closet or earth-closet to about 15 persons. An inspection was again made in the course of the year. There is no underground bakehouse in the district. Notification was received from H.M. Inspector of Factories that he had discovered slight over-crowding in one bakehouse during overtime; notice was served by the Council upon the occupier, who abated the nuisance and undertook that the legal limit should not be exceeded in the future. The addresses of eight outworkers, all of whom lived outside the district, were received from two firms, and were sent in each case to the Councils of the respective districts in which the workers were residing.
