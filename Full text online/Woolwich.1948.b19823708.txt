To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In submitting the 48th Annual Report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich, it is my pleasure to report that on the whole the health of the Borough remained good during the year. Apart from measles the incidence of infectious disease again remained low. The notifications of diphtheria numbered 27 (10 of which were confirmed) and is a remarkable comparison with the figure of 264 ten years ago. The number of confirmed cases of scarlet fever decreased by 58 to 239. There were no deaths from diphtheria and scarlet fever, and only one in the case of measles, one from whooping cough, and one from cerebrospinal fever. During the year under review, there were 10 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis, compared with 23 during the previous year. Of these cases one has spent many months in hospital ; four have some paralysis in a varying degree preventing their participation in full of the normal activities of life ; four have made a complete recovery. The remaining case was fatal. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-1948 civilian population (142,800) shows an increase of 2,650 over that of 1947, and is the highest since 1938. The total live births which, for many years, have been around 2,000 per annum, rose to 3,193 in 1947 but dropped to 2,527 in 1948, resulting in a comparative birth rate of 22.8 in 1947 and 17.7 in 1948. I am pleased to report that the death rate of 11.0 is the lowest for the Borough since 1938 (10.4). The infant mortality rate of 29.28 shows a slight increase over that of 1947. The rate for London as a whole was 31. The infant mortality rate is usually regarded as the best single indication of the general health of a community. During the thirty years the Borough Council has been responsible for the maternity and child welfare services of the Borough, the number of infant deaths has fallen from 106 per thousand births in 1918, to a record low level of 27 in 1947—the last full year of control of these services by the Borough Council. There was only one maternal death in 1948, giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.43 per 1,000. There was a slight reduction in 1948 in the number of deaths from tuberculosis. On the other hand, the number of deaths from cancer, totalling 279, was in excess of the figure of 260 for the previous year, the majority of deaths occurring between the ages of 55 and 65. The Appointed Day, 5th July, under the National Health Service Act, 1946, makes the year 1948 a significant one in the history of the Council. I refer briefly, in an appendix, to the transferred services, but I feel the circumstances warrant special mention. Over a period of some thirty years, the Council, by implementation of legislation by the Central Government, by the practical expression of their own ideals, and by their appreciation of the needs and desires of the citizens of the Borough, built a Maternity and Child Welfare and a Tuberculosis Service of which they were justifiably proud. We can pause to recall all those Councillors, staff, and volunteers (especially those of the "pioneering" days) who formed part 4 of the team which produced and maintained the services so beneficial to the Borough. The London County Council took over with the advantage of a tradition, and, as goodwill, the efficiency and loyalty of the transferred officers. The smoothness of the transfer was evident from the fact that very few of the public were aware of the actual changeover—this surely being a gratifying result of the months of preliminary planning and co-operation of the personnel of all authorities. During the year, the Council gave a great deal of attention to the post-war housing problem and much progress was made. It is certainly gratifying to feel that Woolwich leads London Boroughs in the provision of post-war housing accommodation. Rehousing was, however, primarily concerned with overcrowding and an equally serious problem of clearance areas still remains. Certain Government restrictions were relaxed regarding building licences, and the supply of building materials was somewhat easier. This enabled sanitary inspectors, in spite of this and other difficulties such as the effect of lack of proper maintenance during the war years on the older houses, to maintain a fairly reasonable standard of housing fitness. In accordance with the scheme agreed between the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, the Council agreed that I should co-operate with the Local Health Authority in the day-to-day administration of their personal health services. At the request of the S.E. Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, the administration of the Tuberculosis Service was carried on on an Agency basis from the Appointed Day to the end of March, 1949. I desire specially to acknowledge the continued confidence and support which I have received from the Council. I take this opportunity also of thanking every member of the staff for the valuable work they have done during the year and for the help they have given me personally. I am, Mr. Mayor Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, . T.

The number of live births registered in Woolwich in 1948 was 2,094. After correction for inward and outward transfer, the nett number of Woolwich live births was 2,527, 1,313 being males and 1,214 females. It is known that at least 1,883 births took place in Institutions. The birth rate was 17.7, compared with 22.8 in 1947 and 21.6 in 1946. For the year 1948, the birth rate for England and Wales was 17.9. In addition, there were 44 stillbirths, 26 being males and 18 females. Natural Increase in Population (i.e., excess of births over deaths). In 1946 the natural increase in population was 1,372; in 1947, 1,567; in 1948, 954; compared with 368 in 1936 ; 465 in 1937 ; and 483 in 1938. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in Woolwich was 1,077, the nett number of Woolwich deaths being 1,573, giving a death rate of 110 for the Borough. Deaths of Woolwich residents in hospitals in the Borough totalled 300, whilst 361 died in other hospitals within the London area. Of the total number of deaths, 279 were from cancer, of which 138 occurred in males and 141 in females. The total deaths from cancer in 1947 was 260. Of the total of 74 deaths of infants under 1 year, 54 occurred in infants under 1 month and of these 45 were children under 1 week. During 1948, there was only 1 maternal death, compared with 3 in 1947. 7 Table No. 2. Nett Deaths during the calendar year 1948, including non-residents in Institutions in the Borough.

Attendances had been very good, and it is interesting to note that at the time of the transfer of the personal health services to the London County Council the Borough Council were holding more weekly child welfare sessions than any other metropolitan borough. Details of attendances at the various clinics up to the 4th July are as follows:— Centre. Children. Nursing Mothers. Expectant Mothers. Central Health Centre, Woolwich 6,623 1,151 1,572 Lionel Road, Eltham 5,334 1,043 1,101 St. Luke's Church Hall, Westmount Road 5,787 1,193 139 Plumstead Health Centre 5,071 1,091 699 Fernhill Street, North Woolwich 643 162 169 Bardhill Sports Pavilion, Footscray Road 4,466 956 201 Slade Welfare Centre, Plumstead 4,699 1,144 3 Horn Park Centre, S.E. 12 2,335 414 381 Shrewsbury House, Plumstead 58 13 — Total 35,016 7,167 4,265 11 Toddlers' Clinics. The clinics were well attended, and 1,904 inspections were carried out during the first six months of the year. Health Visiting. The number of visits paid by Health Visitors to children under five years of age daring the first half of the year was 13,403 ; the total number of visits was 13,694. Child Life Protection. There were 30 foster mothers on the register on the 4th July, 1948, seven more than at the end of 1947, and there were 25 foster children. The number of visits paid by child life protection visitors during the first half of 1948 was 63. Dental Treatment. The numbers of mothers and children under five attending the dental clinic up to the 4th July, 1948, were 170 and 165 respectively, and the number of tuberculous persons was 8. The total number of attendances was 1,044. Issue of Fruit Juices and Other Supplements. The distribution of the Government fruit juices and cod liver oil was continued at certain welfare centres. Artificial Sunlight Clinic. A total of 5,649 treatments were given at this clinic during the first six months of the year. Midwifery Service. This is administered in London by the London County Council. No substantial change took place in the midwifery services, which were dealt with fully in the Annual Report for 1945. The arrangement whereby the midwives see at their own sessions at the Central Health Centre, Market Street, mothers under their care, was continued. This innovation has proved most beneficial to patient and midwives alike and was about to be extended at the appointed day. During the year, 1,381 mothers were admitted to the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies, and of these, 862 were Woolwich mothers. The number of admissions to the maternity unit of the Memorial Hospital was 402, of whom 56 were Woolwich mothers. During the first half of 1948, 155 Woolwich mothers were admitted to the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies, and 30 mothers to the Memorial Hospital under the Council's scheme. Professional Nursing in the Home. The provision of nursing assistance in the homes of patients suffering from certain infectious diseases, by arrangement with the local nursing associations, was continued. The total number of visits paid by nurses on behalf of the Council during the first half of the year was 1,013. A grant of £25 for the first six months was made to the nursing associations for the nursing of children under the age of five years for non-infectious conditions, distributed on the basis of a percentage of the total of such cases nursed by the nurses of each nursing association. Immunisation—Diphtheria. Up to the 4th July, 1948, 945 children completed the full course of immunisation. Of the children who were Schick-tested during this period, readings confirmed that 1,443 children had been successfully immunised. There were 96 re-injections. 12 Whooping Cough. During the same period, 608 children received injections. Supply of Insulin to Persons Suffering from Diabetes. The number of patients who received insulin during the first half of the year, in accordance with the sanction of the Ministry of Health, was 10. This service was transferred to the local health authority. Care of Premature Infants. The action taken in connection with the care of premature infants was in conformity with the Ministry of Health circular No. 20/44. The number of babies born in the Borough during the first six months of 1948 whose birth weight was 5½ pounds, or less was 86. Of these, 78 were born in hospital and 8 in private houses. Of those born in hospital, 2 died during the first twentyfour hours and 52 survived at the end of four weeks. Of those born in private houses, 2 died during the first twenty-four hours and 6 survived at the end of four weeks. No applications for the loan of draught-proof cots or other equipment or for the services of the Consultant Paediatrician were received. Home and Domestic Helps. The Council's scheme, which provided for domestic assistance in confinement cases and in cases of illness where the housewife was incapacitated or where old people were concerned, was continued by the London County Council. During the first half of the year the total number of cases in which domestic help was provided was 335; 123 in confinement cases and 212 in cases of illness. Whereas the home help was employed in the majority of maternity cases for two weeks, in many of the cases of illness—particularly with old people—the period of employment was of much longer duration. Clinic for Physical Medicine. Attendances at this clinic totalled 4,155 during the period 1st January to 4th July. Foot Clinics. The control of the Council's foot clinics passed to the London County Council in July, 1948. During the early part of the year the Borough Council extended the scope of the chiropody services in the Borough by the setting up of chiropody chairs at North Woolwich, and at the Plumstead Health Centre to serve the lower Plumstead area. These clinics started in April and May respectively. The work of the Woolwich and Eltham foot clinics increased, there being 5,168 attendances at the Woolwich clinic and 3,602 attendances at the Eltham clinic. Vaccination. The National Health Service Act abolished compulsory vaccination as from the 5th July. The Vaccination Officer's Return for the period to the 5th July, 1948 shows that there were 970 entries in the birth hsts. Of these, 659 were successfully vaccinated. The total number of successful primary vaccinations during the same period was 1,004. Vaccination continues to be available either through the patient's own doctor or the local health authority clinics. 13 Health Propaganda. In addition to the normal health education work of the Council's visiting and clinic staffs and Press publicity, some 1,000 copies of the journal Better Health were distributed each month during the year. A series of posters provided by the Central Council for Health Education were displayed, and the subjects covered were Influenza, Tuberculosis, Sleep, Home Safety, Pood, and Household Pests. Welfare of Aged and Infirm Persons. The welfare of elderly and infirm persons in the Borough continued to occupy the attention of the Borough Council. An average of 50 visits per week were made by Inspectors of this department to the homes of these people. Shortage of hospital beds has increased the difficulties experienced by old people. The home help service, however, has been able to assist greatly, but cannot be regarded as a solution of the problem. The London County Council hope by March, 1950, to acquire or erect premises in the Plumstead area, to provide additional accommodation for elderly and infirm persons. A scheme prepared by the County Council also provides for temporary accommodation for those in urgent need. Since the 5th July, 1948, Section 47 of the National Assistance Act has been the appropriate section dealing with the removal to suitable premises of aged persons in need of care and attention. Section 224 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, which gave the Council similar powers, is now repealed. Often suitable provision can be made for such persons without resort to the above section. Where difficulty is experienced, and in the opinion of the Council removal is necessary in the interests of the persons concerned, or the general public, the Council can apply for an Order to a Court, requiring removal to suitable premises for a period, in the first instance, of not more than three months. However, action under this section is limited to those persons who are suffering from a grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm, or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions. Acting under the powers conferred by Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council are now giving financial assistance to the Woolwich Council of Social Service, who are operating the " Old People's Lunch Club " at the Central Hall, Plumstead High Street. SANITARY ADMINISTRATION Complaints. 4,144 complaints of nuisance were received and investigated. The necessary action was taken where defects or nuisances were discovered. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. During the year, 26,246 inspections, including re-inspections, were carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors. The nature of these inspections is shown in Table No. 5, and details of nuisances abated are given in Table No. 6. The number of intimation notices served as a result was 2,696, and the number of statutory notices, 930. In only 17 instances were legal proceedings found to be necessary. 14 Table JNo. 5.

The Metropolitan Water Board is responsible for the water supply for all domestic purposes in the Borough, all dwelling houses being supplied direct from the public water mains. During the year, 775 certificates were issued in respect of new dwelling houses as having a proper and sufficient supply of water. Wells. There are now only eight wells in use in the Borough, and these are used chiefly for trade and kindred purposes. Eradication of Bed Bugs. In the last Annual Report, reference was made to the commencement of the use of D.D.T. in cases of infestation by bed bugs. Before discussing this insecticide further, reference should be made to the methods of eradication referred to in previous Annual Reports. These methods, which were in use up to the outbreak of war, and which have been fully described, gave good results, but, apart from hydrogen cyanide (which has proved of the greatest possible value when dealing with bug-infested furniture), it could only be said that the Council's efforts fell under the heading of control rather than eradication. The methods referred to were largely experimental, and to a great extent constituted a search for a disinfestant which would not only kill bugs, but which also provided a residual lethal effect. The substances tried were orthodichlorbenzene, methylene chloride, sulphur dioxide, washed heavy naptha, and lethane. The use of all these substances was limited by the transient nature of the lethal action. No fault could be found in the "knock down" capacity, but reinfestations followed where bugs and their eggs had been in inaccessible places. 15 The pre-war methods had to be severely curtailed on the outbreak of war. The use of hydrogen cyanide was limited to a few special cases, owing to the dangers arising from storage of large stocks of this highly poisonous gas under war-time conditions. Staff shortages severely limited both inspections and treatment, and circumstances arose which made it appear that the problem would become even more widespread. In the great majority of cases, the only disinfestant used was lethane, which was imported from the United States of America. Pyrethrum insecticides were practically unobtainable, as the limited supplies were strictly controlled by the Government, mainly for use by the Services. It can be said, however, that in spite of all the difficulties, the bug problem remained under control, and the post-war period has not shown any increase in infestation. One important result of the war was the impetus given to scientific research in the field of disinfestation. The use of D.D.T. in typhus epidemics such as that in Naples in 1943, together with the use of the new substances in the Services, has drawn public attention to the merits of the important " residual " effects of these insecticides. D.D.T. did not become available outside the Services until 1945, when experiments were commenced by various authorities in the application of the methods which had been evolved in war-time. From the published results, and from discussions with persons concerned in the experimental work, it appeared that considerable progress had been made in the search for the ideal disinfestant and its practical applications in the municipal field. It was felt that the time was now ripe for a change over to the newer substances and methods, and arrangements were put in hand for the preparation of a new scheme of disinfestation of houses, embodying the use of these substances and methods. D.D.T. (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). D.D.T. is a white crystalline substance when pure. It is practically insoluble in water, moderately soluble in petroleum, and readily soluble in a number of organic solvents, the most usual being cyclohexanone. The dissolved substance is then diluted in kerosene to obtain the required strength. Research on the use of D.D.T. in laboratories and Army field tests had shown the substance to be lethal to a large number of insect pests. It attacks the nervous system and is toxic both by ingestion and by penetrating the surface of the insects through nerve endings and between body segments. D.D.T. will not kill the eggs of insects, neither does it act as a repellent. A careful assessment of its toxicity to animals and man was carried out by leading toxicologists both in this country and in the U.S.A., and it was found that although it was absorbed through the skin from oil solutions, it was sufficiently non-toxic to be used in the concentration necessary to kill the common insect pests. Provided reasonable precautions are taken when spraying, a 5 per cent. solution in kerosene is accounted safe, and a 10 per cent. powder can be used without danger if direct inhalation is avoided. D.D.T. is slow-acting and does not possess the knock-down effect such as is obtained with pyrethrum. The latter, however, is very unstable and can be broken down by exposure to light, heat, or air, whereas D.D.T. is very stable and has persistent lethal effect over long periods after application. 16 In the early trials in this Borough, D.D.T. Concentrate was diluted with ordinary Pool burning oil to make a 5 per cent. solution. Subsequently, it was decided to use a proprietary solution guaranteed to contain 5 per cent. D.D.T., and without any unpleasant or objectionable effects. Protection of Personnel. Although D.D.T. has been used extensively in the Services without injury to personnel, repeated or prolonged contact with oily solutions of the substance may cause absorption and dermatitis. Masks are therefore worn when operatives are spraying, to prevent inhalation of the spray into the respiratory system. Eyeshields are also worn when working in confined spaces ; and the ordinary overalls have been found to be a sufficient protection for the body, without causing the men to become unduly hot. The hands are protected with a proprietary " barrier cream," a small amount of which is rubbed over the hands and arms until dry, before commencing operations. It is claimed that this affords complete protection against various oils, until washed off with water. No case of skin irritation has occurred among the operators. Method of Spraying. Although the proprietary preparations used contain a "knock-down" ingredient in addition to the D.D.T., the main purpose in spraying is not so much to kill bugs seen, but to provide a residual lethal film over the surfaces of the room, so that any insects which subsequently travel over those surfaces will be killed as a result of the contact with the D.D.T. film. It is therefore unnecessary to remove any of the woodwork (architraves, skirtings, picture rails and the like) as heretofore ; the bugs which may be hiding behind these fittings will eventually have to come out in search of food, and they are therefore bound to come in contact with the lethal surface. Nor is it now considered necessary to use the blowlamp on bedsteads and other articles which are infested ; these, too, are covered with a D.D.T. film after spraying, and become lethal to the insects. Even the bedding (mattresses, pillows, etc.) is sprayed, so that there is no possibility of a bug surviving even if it succeeds in reaching the bedding. The former practice of treating bedding in the steam disinfector has been discontinued, except in unusual circumstances. Where steam disinfestation is resorted to, the bedding is afterwards sprayed with D.D.T. solution in order to prevent, as far as possible, further infestation. Apparatus. A spray of approximately half-gallon of solution to 1,000 square feet of wall surfaces, plus one foot of the floor and ceiling nearest to the walls, together with bedsteads, springs, frames, and both sides of mattresses, has to be applied. Even in a comparatively small room, this involves the use of a considerable quantity of solution. The ordinary hand-sprayer only holds about a pint of solution, and the frequent refilling and consequent wastage, together with the fatigue of manipulation of the hand-sprayer, render this form of apparatus unsuitable for the new technique. The foot-operated pump sprayer, although capable of dealing with fairly large quantities of solution, is inclined to be messy inside houses, and there is also some fatigue in operation. In order to overcome the objections to the former types of apparatus, and to enable the operators to concentrate on their work without undue fatigue, frequent interruptions for refilling, and wastage, it was decided to obtain a power-driven 17 apparatus which could be used in any circumstances, and which would be independent of electric power or manual operation. The apparatus obtained was the "Aerograph. Type ADV," which comprises a twin-cylinder compressor driven by a petrol-engine. The compressor unit is stationed outside the house, and the compressed air is led into the house through a hose which is connected to a "pressure tank" placed in a convenient position inside the building. To this "pressure tank" (which contains two gallons of D.D.T. solution) are connected two hoses (one for compressed air, the other for fluid) which are led to a "spray gun" which can be adjusted to give a spray of various degrees of fineness. There are other connections on the "pressure tank" which can be used for an additional spray gun or for a "powder blower" (for use where dry powder has to be spread instead of liquid). The spray gun has an extension arm fitted which enables the operator to reach the highest parts of the room without the use of ladders or platforms. When moving from one room to another it is only necessary to move the "pressure tank" with the hoses and spray guns, and spraying can be continued so long as there is fluid in the tank. Co-operation of Householders. In order to encourage the co-operation of householders, a letter is sent beforehand in each case informing the householder of the date arranged for disinfestation, and giving advice as to the preparations which should be made in advance of the arrival of the operators, together with information on the nature of the treatment and subsequent precautions. As was the case with the earlier methods of treatment, routine re-inspections of premises which have been treated are carried out by the women Sanitary Inspectors, in order to determine the success or otherwise of the treatment. Disinfestation with Hydrogen Cyanide. The Sanitary Inspector in charge of disinfestation inspects the furniture of all persons provisionally selected as tenants for the Council's houses, decides when disinfestation is necessary and makes the arrangements. During the year he made 1,826 visits in this connection. In all cases where vermin are found, the removal is carried out under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector, in one of the Council's special pantechnicons. After loading, the pantechnicon is driven to one of the Council's depots where hydrogen cyanide gas is released inside the vehicle. After fumigation and ventilation of the vehicle, the furniture is delivered to the tenant at the Council's house. During the year 62 removals were carried out in this way. Occasionally, requests are received from the London County Council for similar treatments to be carried out on furniture belonging to new tenants of County Council houses. During the year one such removal was carried out. Control of Insect Pests other than Vermin. From time to time complaints are received from householders and others regarding the presence of various insect pests in their houses or belongings. Among these may be mentioned cockroaches, beetles (especially wood beetles), silver fish and moths. Although the Council is under no obligation to assist in these cases, advice is given, so far as is possible, on identification and disinfestation of the pests, and if other disinfestation work permits, treatment is carried out by the Council's staff on the householder undertaking to pay a reasonable charge for the work. During the year, disinfestation 18 was carried out in 56 such cases, on payment, in connection with infestations of cockroaches and black beetles (12), crickets (10), flies (1), carpet beetles (I), woodworm (7), moths (23), weevils (1) and mites (1). Routine spraying of areas where mosquitoes are likely to breed was also carried out during the year. Housing. The total number of dwelling houses in the Borough is 37,366. The number inspected for housing defects under the Public Health or Housing Acts was 6,214. The number found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for habitation was 3,306. The number rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the sanitary inspectors, including the service of intimation notices, was 2,279. Statutory notices were served for the first time in respect of 799 houses. The number of dwelhng houses which were inspected and recorded under the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations, 1925, was 103. Demolition Orders were made under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, in respect of 8 houses, and 2 houses were the subject of Closing Orders. During the year, 608 cases of overcrowding under the Housing Act, 1936, were investigated. The problems in relation to housing dealt with by the Department continued to be aggravated by the acute housing shortage, notwithstanding the measures taken by the Council for its relief. During the year, considerable progress was made in the provision of new houses by the Council. Some 465 permanent and temporary houses were completed, bringing the total number of dwellings erected since the war to 1,746. At the end of December, 286 further dwellings were under construction. In addition, 285 houses were built by private enterprise compared with 95 during 1947. Squatters. Many of the squatters who, in previous years occupied two army camps, left for various reasons, and at the end of the year 29 families were still in occupation. Although all reasonable adaptations and additions had been carried out, the accommodation could never have been made wholly satisfactory, and as each hut became vacant it was rendered uninhabitable. Rodent Control. The work of rat destruction was continued throughout the year. The staff engaged on this work consisted of two investigators and four operatives, working under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector who devoted the whole of his time to this service. The treatment of private dwellings is generally free. This fact has made the public much more ready to report infestations. Before the scheme commenced, the average number of complaints received during a month was 40. This figure has now increased to approximately 100 per month. In addition to the systematic surface treatment, treatment of the sewers is carried out, there being two maintenance treatments and one test baiting each year. Results of the treatments continue to be satisfactory and indicate their worth in keeping the rat population of the Borough at a low level. The total number of premises surveyed during the year was 15,193, and the number of inspections 31,777. Effective preventative measures were taken in 2,129 instances. 19 Drainage. The inspection of new drains is carried out by the Borough Engineer and reconstructions and repair of drainage work is supervised by the Health Department. There were 39 reconstructions or alterations to the drainage systems during the year, and 11 combined drainage systems were repaired. Rag Flock Acts. Rag flock must comply with the Rag Flock Regulations, in which it is laid down that soluble chlorine, in the form of chlorides, must not exceed 30 parts of chlorine in 100,000 parts of flock. Of the samples taken, on analysis it was found that two samples did not conform to the prescribed standard of cleanliness, soluble chlorine in the form of chlorides being 13 parts and 10 parts respectively per 100,000 in excess of the maximum laid down in the Regulations. In both cases, the manufacturers stated that the rag flock was manufactured from entirely new materials. Warning letters were sent by the Town Clerk. Offensive Trades. During the year the Council approved an application for the re-establishment of one business of slaughterer of poultry, and also approved the renewal of one tripe boiler licence. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act places upon Metropolitan Boroughs the duty of enforcing the provisions of that part of the Act which relates to poisons in Part II of the Poisons List. Eighty-eight applications were received during the year for retention in the Council's list. In addition, 29 new entries were made and visits were carried out to the premises of all listed sellers. Smoke Abatement. During the period under review, 47 observations were made in the Borough and two notices were served in respect of offences. In both cases the nuisance was abated forthwith and no further action was necessary. Legal Proceedings. There were 17 prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and Bye-laws, fines totalling £6 10s. Od. being imposed. During the year, fines of £24 were imposed in connection with prosecutions under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. There was also one prosecution under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a fine of £2 10s. Od. being made. Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts. During the year, 14 applications for the issue of a certificate under the provisions of the above Acts were considered by the Health Committee, and in 8 cases certificates that the premises were not in a reasonable state of repair were issued to the applicants. Common Lodging Houses. These are licensed annually by the Borough Council in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. There are now only two licensed Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. The number of inspections made during the year was 56. Details of the accommodation available are as follows :— Premises. Accommodation—Men. 60, Beresford Street 50 102, Woolwich High Street 22 One application for renewal was refused, by reason of failure to comply with the Bye-laws. 20 Burial ok Cremation of the Dead. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, which came into force on the 5th July, it is the duty of the Council as Sanitary Authority to arrange for the burial or cremation or any person who has died or been found dead in their area, where it appears to the Council that no other suitable arrangements have been or are being made. This duty was previously exercisable by the London County Council. Expenses incurred in such burial may be recovered from the estate of the deceased person or from a " liable " relative. Of the 8 burials carried out during the period 5th July to the end of the year, 5 were from hospitals. In one case the charges were recovered; the total expenses in respect of the other 7 cases amounted to £54. Table No. 7. Factories Act, 1937.

Mxlk. The number of milk premises on the register on the 31st December was 56. The standard of the milk supply was satisfactory ; practically all the milk distributed in Woolwich is heat treated. All the 334 samples submitted for chemical analysis contained 3 per cent, or more of fat. The Public Analyst has furnished the following figures, showing the percentage of fat found in each sample of milk submitted during 1948, with comparative figures for 1947 :— Number of Samples. 1948. 1947. 4.5 per cent, and over 0 0 4 per cent, and under 4.5 per cent. 2 4 3.5 per cent, and under 4 per cent. 102 157 3 per cent, and under 3.5 per cent. 230 102 Below 3 per cent. 0 0 334 263 He states that the average fat content of the milk samples is lower for the year under review than normally ; this is due to the large number of milk samples taken during the April-June quarter, the period when the fat content of milk naturally falls to its lowest level (124 in April-June, compared with 57 in October-December). The phosphatase test for adequate heat treatment was satisfied in 160 samples, and the methylene blue test for the keeping quality of milk in 52 samples. Only 1 sample failed to satisfy the phosphatase test, the methylene blue test being satisfied in all cases. Under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 21 Principal and 21 Supplementary licences were granted. Of the Principal licences, 1 was in respect of a pasteurising establishment; 1 was for a pasteurising bottling establishment; 1 for a tuberculin tested bottling establishment; 8 were dealers' licences for the sale of pasteurised milk ; and 10 were dealers' licences for the sale of tuberculintested milk. The Supplementary licences consisted of 11 for the sale of pasteurised milk and 10 for the sale of tuberculin-tested milk. Meat Supplies. The one slaughterhouse in use in the Borough during the year is under contract to the Ministry of Food and, due to the concentration of slaughtering at these premises, the equivalent of the full-time services of more than three Inspectors was required for the inspection of carcases. Compared with the previous year, some 9,839 more carcases were inspected in 1948. Due to a change in the method of slaughtering, the flow of carcases is now much more rapid as compared with pre-war and the arrival of the beasts for slaughter is irregular. As all carcases must be inspected within a reasonable time of killing, the staff were frequently kept late on duty. The work has been further increased by the fact that the grade of bovine animals slaughtered is much below that of the pre-war quality, necessitating an even more detailed inspection. 22 Carcases Inspected and Condemned, 1948. Cattle (excluding Cows) Cows. Calves. Sheep or Lambs. Pigs. Number killed 10,639 3,678 3,257 17,985 256 Number inspected 10,639 3,678 3,257 17,985 256 All Diseases except Tuberculosis:— Whole carcases condemned 21 3 5 1 Carcases part condemned 6,001 3 744 15 Percentage of number inspected affected 42% 18% 4% 6.5% Tuberculosis only:— Whole carcases condemned 187 26 Nil. 2 Carcases part condemned 3,985 46 Nil. 55 Percentage of number inspected affected 29% 2% Nil. 22.5% It will be seen from the above Table that of the 14,317 cattle (including cows) inspected during the year, 29 per cent, (tuberculosis) and 42 per cent, (other diseases) were found to be diseased in some way. However, only 208 whole carcases or 19 per cent, of the total number of cattle inspected, had to be condemned. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933. Eleven licences were granted to persons to act as slaughterers. Premises where Food is Prepared or Offered for Sale. Amongst their other duties, five Inspectors are specially concerned in this work, and in the taking of samples under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 ; the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations ; and the registration of all new premises under the Food and Drugs Act. In addition, routine visits were paid by the district Sanitary Inspectors to all food premises in the Borough. The two women Inspectors devote a great deal of their time to the inspection of cafes, restaurants, canteens and eating houses. The total number of inspections of food premises during the year was 3,528. In addition to canteens, there are some 240 restaurants and eating houses in the Borough. Analysis of Food and Drugs. During the year, the Public Analyst analysed 902 samples, including 573 informal and 329 formal. Of these, 17 informal and 13 formal samples were reported to be adulterated, giving a percentage adulteration of 3'3, compared with 4'5 in 1947 and 2.8 in 1946. The samples found to be adulterated were as follows:—Milk, 5; ketchup, 4; syrup of figs, 2; gelatine, 2; orange crush, 2; glauber salt, 2; beef sausage meat, 2; pate de foie, 1; sausage meat, 1; ground ginger, 1; iodine, 1; bloater paste, 1; frying fat, 1 ; cream sponge, 1 ; slab fruit cake, 1 ; beef sausages, 1 ; salad cream, 1. Unsound Food. During the year 143½ tons of food were surrendered as unfit for human consumption. Most of this was utilised for animal feeding or for fertilisers. No seizures were made. 23 Food Poisoning. The 7 outbreaks of food poisoning during 1948 involved a total of 158 cases. Six of the outbreaks were at schools within the Borough. While in several cases the symptoms were acute, in the majority there was transitory discomfort only. Nearly all cases recovered rapidly and there were no deaths. Difficulty in tracing the causal organism with certainty is frequent. This is illustrated by the fact that of the many faecal specimens examined, in only three were pathological organisms detected—in each case Sonne Dysentery. As a result of advice given, various improvements in the layout of the kitchens and the exchange of certain utensils, the outbreaks were satisfactorily terminated. Basement Bakehouses. A quinquennial review of basement bakehouses within the Borough, under the provisions of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937, was carried out during the year, and certificates of suitability in respect of the under-mentioned bakehouses were renewed. 38, Frances Street, Woolwich. 1, Waverley Road, Plumstead. 10, Woolwich Church Street, Woolwich. 31, Vincent Road, Woolwich. 15, Woolwich New Road, Woolwich. Certificates of suitability in respect of basement bakehouses at 46, Hudson Road, Plumstead, and 24, Burrage Road, Plumstead, which premises had been closed since the last review, were not granted. Ice Cream. During the year, 882 inspections of ice cream premises were made. Twenty samples were obtained and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Camberwell for bacteriological examination and grading, using the Methylene Blue reduction test, to ascertain the time taken at 37 deg. C. for complete decolorisation to take place, and then graded according to the following table:— Grade Time taken to reduce Methylene Blue. 1 4½ hours or more. 2 2½ to 4 hours. 3 ½ to 2 hours 4 0. This test assesses the bacterial cleanliness of ice cream. Of the 20 samples which were submitted to the test, 7 were in Grade 1, 6 in Grade 2, and 7 in Grade 3. In those cases where the grading was low, repeat samples were taken and the manufacturing methods investigated and advice given as necessary. Owing to grave difficulties in the supply of certain essential recording instruments, the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, were not in full operation during the year. These Regulations, made under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, provide that ice cream mixtures intended for sale for human consumption shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of 150 deg. F. for 30 minutes or, alternatively, of not less than 160 deg. F. for 10 minutes before freezing. The Regulation does not apply to a " complete cold mix " which is a product capable of being manufactured into ice cream with no addition except that of water. 24 PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Incidence. The numbers of eases of notifiable infectious diseases which occurred during the year, after correction of diagnosis were as follows:— Table No. 8 Notification of Infectious Diseases (excluding Tuberculosis) 1948.

There were 122 notified cases of scabies during 1948. The drop in scabies cases and consequently in treatments required, has been as remarkable as the rise in the early part of the war. The Scabies' Order, 1941, which was introduced as an emergency war-time measure to combat an exceptional increase of scabies, ceased to be operative from the 1st January, 1948. All possible steps continue to be taken in tracing the existence of cases and in taking the appropriate measures to remedy them. Laboratory Facilities. The Council's bacteriological work has been carried out in the Pathological Department of the Woolwich Memorial Hospital. During the year, 439 throat and nasal swabs were examined; 1,552 specimens of sputum; 34 specimens of faeces ; 1 specimen of urine ; 10 specimens of blood; and 2 rectal swabs. The practice of submitting samples of water from public swimming baths for examination was continued. 56 such samples were submitted during the year and the results were satisfactory. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications during the year was 230, compared with 297 in 1947. The number of persons examined for the first time was 2,016 (1,968 in 1947), and of these 169 were found to be tuberculous. There were 1,508 cases on the register at the end of the year, being an increase of 70 on the number on the register at the end of 1947. Work of the Dispensaries. The work of the Dispensary at Maxey Road, Plumstead, and the branch Dispensary at 11, Carnecke Gardens, Eltham, during the period 1st January to 4th July, 1948, is shown below in tabular form:— Number of contacts examined 232 Number of contacts found to be tuberculous 4 Total number of attendances 5,265 Number of patients referred by medical practitioners 653 Number of patients referred by medical boards 25 Visits to homes of patients by Tuberculosis Visitors 2,912 Visits to homes of patients by Tuberculosis Officer 90 Number of X-ray examinations 1,737 Number of specimens of sputum examined 601 Number of specimens of sputum positive 73 Number of patients admitted to hospital or sanatorium 202 Number of attendances for dental treatment 31 Notifications include a number of Service and other personnel. In addition, a number have been diagnosed during routine X-ray investigations. The artificial pneumo-thorax clinic at St. Nicholas' Hospital continued its work during the year. The total number of attendances at the clinic was 2,035. Clinics at other London hospitals were attended by 87 patients, who received 2,024 refills. The number of applications for maintenance allowances received up to the 4th July, 1948, was 76. On the 5th July, 107 patients who had been receiving maintenance allowances came under the jurisdiction of the National Assistance Board. The Tuberculosis Care Committee continued its excellent work of providing for the after-care of patients and assistance to dependants. Four quarterly meetings of the full Committee were held, and the General Purposes Sub-Committee met on 11 occasions. Assistance is being given in many ways, including the supply of pocket 26 money, clothing, shoes, extra nourishment, beds and bedding, and fares for relatives to visit patients in institutions. The funds come from interest on investments; donations from both employees of firms in the Borough and from private sources; and by the sale of Christmas Seals. It will be noted that the work carried out at the Dispensaries has again increased, but that there is a gratifying fall in the number of notifications, of deaths, and in the total number of notified cases on the register. The major part of the Council's tuberculosis work, including the work of the two dispensaries, passed to the Regional Hospital Board on the 5th July. However, duties concerned with measures for the prevention of tuberculosis—investigation of sources of infection, supervision of environment of tuberculous persons, together with the keeping of a tuberculosis notification register of all cases in the Borough, remain with the Borough Council (Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930). The Borough Council continued to undertake certain administrative functions on behalf of the Regional Hospital Board during the latter half of 1948, on an "Agency" basis. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Infected articles of bedding, clothing, etc., and articles infested with bugs are disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station, White Hart Road, Plumstead; but the personal clothing of persons treated at the two Cleansing Stations is disinfected at those two stations. During the year 13,730 articles were disinfected at the three stations. The number of rooms disinfected after cases of infectious disease was 465, and of these, 121 had been occupied by tuberculous persons. The number of rooms disinfested of vermin was 1,091. Sixty-two van-loads of furniture were fumigated during the year. Personal Cleansing Stations are situated at the Turkish Baths, Plumstead High Street, and at the Eltham Hill Health Centre, Sherard Road. Part of the premises of the Turkish Baths was adapted as a Cleansing Station as a temporary measure after the destruction in 1941 of the former cleansing station at White Hart Road. Pending fruition of a plan for the erection of a combined cleansing and disinfecting station the premises at the Turkish Baths were structurally altered, enabling the service to be more permanent and efficient. The number of persons cleansed of vermin was 1,869 and the number of persons (including contacts) treated for scabies was 427. The total number of attendances was 2,564. Details of the number of cases and attendances at the two Cleansing Stations are given below:— Table No. 9. Treatment of Verminous Persons. PreSchoolchildren. Schoolchildren. Adults. Total. Boys.

On the appointed day, viz. 5th July, 1948, in compliance with Sections 22, 24, 25, 26 and 29, the Council's Maternity and Child Welfare, Vaccination and Immunisation services passed to the London County Council, the local health authority under the Act. The Tuberculosis Dispensary service, came under the control of the S.E. Regional Hospitals Board ; but at the request of the Board the Council continued the local administration of this service on an " Agency " basis to 31st December, 1949. The transfer of these services included the transference of staff and employees, buildings and equipment. The following is a list of whole-time staff transferred to the local health authority :— Assistant Medical Officers: Dr. W. M. Copeland Dr. K. Waghorn Dr. J. Henry Health Visitors and Tuberculosis Visitors: Miss H. M. G. Andrews Miss L. Berry Mrs. M. F. Chappell Mrs. W. M. Cox Miss G. B. Day Miss M. E. A. Dennitts Miss E. V. Farrell Mrs. M. E.

The following is a list of staff transferred to the Regional Hospital Board:— Dr. E. V. Saunders-Jacobs (Tuberculosis Officer and Deputy Medical Officer of Health). Dr. A. McManus. The following buildings or tenancies were taken over by the local health authority:— Woolwich. Central Health Centre, Market Street; North Woolwich Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, Fernhill Street. Plumstead. Plumstead Health Centre, Plumstead High Street. Slade Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, Timbercroft Lane. Eltham. Eltham Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, Lionel Road. Horn Park Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, Alnwick Road. New Eltham Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, Footscray Road. St. Luke's Maternity and Child Welfare Centre, Westmount Road. The following buildings or tenancies were taken over by the Regional Hospital Board:— Tuberculosis Dispensary, Maxey Road, Plumstead. Branch Tuberculosis Dispensary, Carnecke Gardens, Eltham. Eltham Hill Health Centre, Sherard Road, Eltham. The original plans for this Centre provided for the following services:—Physical Medicine and artificial sunlight; tuberculosis ; chiropody and cleansing of verminous persons. On the appointed day this building, which was temporarily finished during the war for use as a gas cleansing station, was in use as a Cleansing Station and Chiropody Clinic. No decision had been made at the end of the year on the Authority to control this building. The Maternity and Child Welfare Service can be said to have commenced in Woolwich in the year 1906, when the first part-time health visitor was appointed and the Council established a Milk Depot. The Infant Mortality rate for this year was 111 ; the lowest rate was the year 1947, viz. 27, and for 1948 it was 29. The milk depot was first recommended by the Medical Officer in a special report on summer diarrhoea in 1904, when 135 deaths occurred from that disease. Most of the babies supplied with milk were brought fortnightly to be weighed, and on one afternoon a week advice was given to mothers regarding their babies. This depot, therefore, was the fore-runner of the present extensive welfare centre service. The depot was closed in July, 1909. 29 Infant consultations continued at the Town Hall, the Medical Officer of Health and the health visitor attending one afternoon per week. In 1907 the Notification of Births Act was adopted in Woolwich, and this enabled the department to receive immediate notice of all births, and consequently visits could be arranged much sooner than hitherto. In 1910, the number of infants weighed had grown from 84 to 460, and health talks were started. The Local Government Board in 1914 approached sanitary authorities, stating that they were prepared to give grants in payment of expenditure for maternity and child welfare, and inviting authorities to initiate schemes. Hitherto, only infants under one year had been dealt with, but the scheme envisaged covered the child from birth to school age. A scheme was accordingly submitted, and embraced the provision of an antenatal clinic for expectant mothers, the appointment of an Assistant Medical Officer to conduct the infant consultations, an additional woman Inspector and Health Visitor (salary £120 to £140 per annum), and the acquisition of premises in East Plumstead for a consultation centre. The first world war materially retarded any advancement in the service, but in the early post-war years progress began in real earnest. In 1919 the Assistant Medical Officer had been appointed ; a home for ailing babies (21 cases) was taken over by the Council, with a part-time Medical Officer in charge ; and there were five health visitors, two of them being part-time sanitary inspectors. Infant consultations were held at the Town Hall; at a redundant mission workers' hutment in Well Hall Road ; at St. John's Hall, North Woolwich ; and at the American Red Cross Centre, Plumstead High Street. A voluntary centre was opened in Woolwich High Street, and the Council supplied the doctor and health visitor. The Assistant Medical Officer also acted as Medical Officer for the day nursery in Kingsman Street. Early in 1920 provision was made in New Eltham for a welfare centre by the use of the Church Army Hut, Southwood Road. No arrangements for the treatment of mothers and children at the centres had so far been made, but in 1920, by an arrangement with Woolwich Branch of the British Medical Association, children requiring medical, surgical or dental treatment were referred to a School Treatment Centre. Seventy-eight cases were sent in the first year. The Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, increased considerably the powers of Local Authorities. It provided for the establishment of a Maternity and Child Welfare Committee, stipulating that it must include at least two women, and that, subject to two-thirds of the members being Councillors, persons specially qualified by training or experience might be appointed as members. I quote from the circular of the Local Government Board accompanying the Act : " The supreme importance of maternity and child welfare work at the present time needs no emphasis. With a view to encouraging the provision of further services, which experience has shown would be of value for conserving infant lives and health, Mr. Hayes Fisher has obtained the sanction of the Treasury to a considerable extension of the scope of the Board's grant. The additional services for which the grant is now available are chiefly:— Hospital treatment for children up to five years of age; Lying-in houses; 30 Home helps; Provision of food for expectant and nursing mothers and children up to five years of age; Creches and day nurseries; Convalescent homes; Homes for the children of widowed and deserted mothers and for illegitimate children; Experimental work for the health of expectant and nursing mothers and of infants and children under five years of age." The Maternity and Child Welfare Act helped to further the Council's policy. Existing services were continually expanded, sometimes out of ah recognition. Some of the more outstanding items must be mentioned:— In 1922 an Agreement was entered into with the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies for the confinement there of 144 mothers per year, sponsored by the Council. This was later increased in 1939 to 216, and again in 1943 to 312. A similar Agreement was made with the Memorial Hospital in 1928 for 66 cases. In 1927 the Memorial Hospital in the Borough was opened. The Council made a grant of £30,000 to assist the hospital in providing the maximum service as soon as possible after opening. In 1931 the first combined Maternity and Child Welfare and School Treatment Clinic in the metropolitan area was opened in Westhorne Avenue, Eltham (this Centre was completely destroyed by enemy action in 1941). The Centre was an outstanding success and was followed by the Plumstead combined Health Centre in 1933, and the Woolwich combined Health Centre in 1939—services at this Centre included Physical Medicine, Chiropody, Sunlight, Dental, Ear, Nose and Throat, and Orthopaedics, in addition to the Child Welfare and Ante-Natal service. There are now many such Centres in the metropolitan area. In 1934, the Council, with the co-operation of local medical practitioners, started a scheme for the immunisation of children against diphtheria. The service has been continued and expanded ever since. Its success is shown by the fact that an estimated 74 per cent, of the mid-1947 child population are immunised, and by the remarkable drop in the cases and deaths from diphtheria. A similar scheme was instituted in 1943 for whooping cough. Its popularity has increased yearly. In 1939 war again intervened and dislocated the services. Almost overnight the carefully planned medical Civil Defence services came into operation. Health Centres, the Tuberculosis Dispensary and offices were transformed into first aid posts, gas decontamination stations and public shelters. Health Visitors became nurses in charge of first aid posts. It was possible, however, to maintain partial health services under extremely difficult conditions. Often the war-time emergency services and the health services were conducted side by side—some members of the staff being engaged on both forms of activity. The depletion of the permanent staff for various forms of national service necessitated the employment of temporary staff. Evacuation of children and expectant mothers ; extra clothing coupons and priority dockets ; continental refugees ; medical inspection of rest centres, shelters and day nurseries, are a few of the other war-time activities dealt with by the department. On the cessation of hostilities, intensive efforts were made to restore and in some 31 cases increase the health services, with the result that by the Appointed Day (5th July, 1948) all pre-war services were functioning with increased attendances, and in addition schemes for daily guardians, care of illegitimate children, care of premature infants, domestic helps, and midwifery sessions at Centres, were operating. The following Table of Statistics from 1906 onwards may prove of interest:— Year. Births. Infant Mortality rate (under 1 year). Neo-natal Mortality rate. Maternal Mortality rate (per 1,000 births).

The Tuberculosis Dispensary was opened at Maxey Road in September, 1911, by a local voluntary Committee inaugurated at a Conference held by the Health Committee of the Borough Council and under the auspices of the " Central Fund for the Promotion of the Dispensary System for the Prevention of Consumption in London," supported in addition by local voluntary funds. When in 1921 the central funds failed, the Dispensary, including the existing staff, was taken over by the Borough Council, and the Tuberculosis service became an integral part of its Health Services, until it was transferred to the Regional Hospital Board in July, 1948. From then until the end of the year, however, the Council continued to administer the service as agents for the Board. 32 In addition to administrating the Tuberculosis Regulations of 1925 and 1930 (a duty which remains with the Medical Officer of Health), the Council provided services at the Dispensaries (a branch dispensary had been opened in Well Hall Road, Eltham, and later transferred to Carnecke Gardens); by domiciliary visits; by arrangement with the London County Council, particularly for Institutional treatment, various hospitals and the Queen's nurses; and by co-operation with the Maternity and Child Welfare Service, the London County Council School Medical Services, the Public Assistance Committee, the Ministry of Pensions and the housing and other authorities. These services included:— For the Patients. Investigation for diagnosis by medical examination, X-rays, and by sputum and tuberculin testing; also by medical consultation with general practitioners, Hospital doctors, and Ministry of Pension and other officials. Arrangements for Hospital or Sanatorium treatment; and supervision and assistance at home during the waiting period. After-care; including arrangements for nursing ; assistance in the home; supply of garden shelters in suitable cases; supply of medicaments, surgical appliances, extra nourishment; and when necessary, by financial assistance. Rehabilitation, including occupational therapy in the form of handicraft, needlework and cookery classes; arrangements for vocational training, and assistance in finding suitable re-employment. For Contacts. An important side of the work has always been the examination of the contacts of known cases, particularly tuberculin testing and X-ray examination of child contacts and the making of arrangements for their boarding out in a suitable environment in order to minimise the risk of infection, or for their admission to day or boarding open-air schools. For Doubtful Cases. These are kept under observation and examined at intervals in order that disease may be detected and treated in its early stages. In all this work, the help of the Care Committee with its funds collected by local voluntary effort, has proved invaluable, particularly in solving personal problems coming outside the scope of official regulations. A review of the changing aspects of the work since 1911, or since 1921 when the Council became responsible, mirrors the changes on the social services, in the public recognition of the problem involved, and in medical advancement of knowledge. Early diagnosis is facilitated by the wide use of X-rays including Mass radiography surveys, and by a growing public consciousness of its need. Treatment in addition to rest, good food and fresh air, is now supplemented by many other procedures such as artificial pneumothorax, phrenic crush, pneumo-peritoneum, thoracoplasty, and operative removal of the whole or part of a lung. Also newly discovered drugs are a further aid to recovery, and B.C.G. vaccination offers hope for the future. The tuberculosis and family allowances and additional nourishment, ease the psychological strain of illness. Schemes for vocational training together with the Ministry of Labour, Disabled Persons Register, help with the all important problem of rehabilitation. And finally, the Home Help scheme gives the harassed housewife a chance. Thus, as is reflected in the lower death rate, many of the problems confronting the pioneers in 1911 have been partly solved, but others such as the housing shortage remain as a challenge to the future.
