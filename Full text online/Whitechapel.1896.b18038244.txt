WH13 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (WITH VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICs FOR THE YEAR 1896 (CONSISTING OF 53 WEEKS), being the THIRTEENTH ANNUAL by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; diplomate in public health, university of cambridge; fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health ; associate of the college of state medicine; member of the sanitary institute ; public vaccinator to the whitechapel union; examiner in, and instructor of, vaccination, by order of the local government board; &c. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE STEVENS & CO., Ltd., 19 & 25a, Commercial Road, E. 1897. Offices of the Works for the Whitechapel District. Pubilic Health Department: No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., January 12th, 1897. On the first page of my Annual Report for the year 1895 it is stated that "the total population of the Whitechapel District I have roughly estimated to be 79,000." A few months after that Report was published it was known that the census declared our population to be 78,676. The calculations, therefore, which appeared in my Report of a year ago were fairly accurate. The census of last year was the first quinquennial census, and was instituted not for such statistical purposes as might prove useful from a sanitarian's point of view, but to enable certain taxation arrangements to be adequately dealt with. It follows, therefore, that beyond the crude figures of population nothing is contained in the Census Returns for 1896 which needs any comment on my part. I am not now informed officially of the Foreign Immigration which takes place, but I know as a fact that it still continues to a large extent. Probably I shall be near the mark for statistical purposes if I average our population for the whole year 1896 at 79,500. The marriages during the year within the District amounted to 434. Last year they were 409, and in the previous year 373. The total births which were registered in the four Sub-registration Districts during the 52 weeks amounted to 3,168. In the Whitechapel Union Infirmary 118 births took place, of which number 18 were born of women who had not previously resided in the District. Distributing the remaining births among the Sub-registration Districts to which the mothers belonged, the correct distribution of births will be as uuder:- Mile End New Whitechapel Goodman's Spitalfields. Town. Church. Fields.Total 1071 683 979 424 3157 So that the corrected births amounted to 3,157, viz. :—-1,632 boys, and 1,525 girls. The District birth-rate was equal to 39 7 per 1,000. See Table A* of the Appendix. 36 boys and 35 girls were born in the 53rd week of the year. The Metropolitan birth-rate equalled 30-0 per 1,000. The total deaths which were registered during the year numbered 2.313, viz.;—1,394 males, and 919 females. Table B* of the Appendix indicates the deaths which were registered in the several Sub-registration Districts. A deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 929, which occurred among Non-Residents (mostly in the London Hospital); and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those Besidents who died in Out-lying Public Institutions and elsewhere outside the District. These deaths number 219, and the places where the deaths were registered are tabulated in the Appendix as usual—Table D.† Thus the corrected number of District deaths for the year was 1,603. A deathrate for the year of 20.1 per 1,000 is to be recorded, as compared with a Metropolitan death-rate of 18.5 per 1,000. * Page 24. † P'age 25. 4 This satisfactory return is almost identical with that which I presented two years ago, and shows, so far as our district is concerned, a diminution in the death-rate of 2.7 per 1,000, when contrasted with the year 1896. I append a Table showing the correct number of District Deaths for each Sub-registration District during the past ten years:- CORRECT DISTRICT MORTALITY TABLE FOR TEN YEARS ENDING 1896.

In the three preceding years it was, respectively, 1,808, 1,508, and 1,194. The ages at death of the Residents who died during the year are recorded in Table F. of the Appendix. The percentage of deaths for each Age period was as follows:— 28 4% of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 10 .7 ,, ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4 7,, ,, ,, ,, 5 and 20. 12.7 ,, ,, ,, ,, 20 and 40. 19 .5 ,, ,, ,, ,, 40 and GO. 15.7,. „ ,, „ 60 and 80. 2.1 ,, ,, ,, over the age of 80. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths, including Whitechapel, the infant deaths were as follows:- The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 26.1 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.1 per cent. of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 28.4 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.4 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 42.7 per cent. of the total deaths, and 26.3 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 45.1 per cent. of the total deaths, and 22.9 per cent. of the registered births. Table It has been introduced to enable one readily to contrast the mortality per cent. from each class of disease to total deaths, as regards both the Whitechapel District and the Metropolis as a whole. In three classes only are there any considerable differences between them. In the Zymotic class, whereas London exhibits an increased mortality, the death-rate for the Whitechapel District has become again diminished. On the other hand, owing to circumstances, which are easily understood, the District deaths from both the Respiratory and Constitutional classes of disease are proportionally greater than in the case of the entire Metropolis. * Page 20. † Page 28. 5 Just a word or two about the Zymotic diseases. During the year all but 31 of the deaths in this class were registered from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhœa. In fact, 182 lives were sacrificed by these five diseases. Large as this number appears, it is fewer by 35 than was the case in the preceding year. Contrasting the years 1895 and 1896, I find the following figures to be correct:- Contrasting the years 1895 and 1896, I find the following figures to be correct:- Deaths from: 1895. 1896. Measles 71 45 Scarlet Fever 23 20 Whooping Cough 17 35 Diphtheria 52 45 Diarrhœa 54 37 Taking Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria together, there is not much difference in the years under consideration. In reality, we are face to face with the startling truth, that notwithstanding all the efforts of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and notwithstanding the enormous increase in hospital accommodation, these diseases together cost London in lives and money more than one cares to contemplate. It is worth while for a moment to look at the figures extracted from the hospital returns for these diseases somewhat closely. For this purpose I will hero show the weekly total number of cases in hospitals, and the weekly admissions throughout the year:- For this purpose I will hero show the weekly total number of cases in hospitals, and the weekly admissions throughout the year:- 1896.

At the close of the year nearly 4,000 cases of Scarlet Fever and 850 cases of Diphtheria were receiving attention as in-patients. So far as the matter concerns the Whitechapel District, I can only be thankful that our cases have been so well provided for. During the later summer months some delay in removal—of course—occasionally took place. For the sake of favourable comparison with last year's figures, I append from Mr. Cook's return the following extract:— "Owing to insufficient hospital accommodation 104 cases of infectious "disease were taken to their homes from the London Hospital, and they "had to await vacancies in the hospitals before they could be admitted." "In 52 cases 3 daily applications were made for the removal of patients. ,, 14 ,, 4 ,, ,, ,, ,, 16 ,, 5 ,, ,, ,, ,, 3 ,, 6 ,, ,, ,, ,, 5 ,, 7 ,, ,, ,, ,, 4 ,, 8 ,, ,, ,, "In 27 cases removal was not effected at all owing to the delay." This difficulty was chiefly experienced immediately previous to the opening of the new Brook Hospital, at Shooter's Hill. Since that time no delay of importance has taken place. The Brook Hospital is the most modern institution of its kind, and is replete with every appliance that science and forethought could suggest. Although the cost of construction and fitting was considerable, I think few who inspect the buildings thoroughly would begrudge the outlay. I cannot, however, help thinking that something more is required to cope with these diseases successfully— and I look forward to the time when scientific research shall place a preventive serum in the hands of the medical profession, such as we at present possess in vaccine in the case of small-pox. Already, so far as the treatment of diphtheria is concerned, experience points to the enormous value of anti-toxin, and the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board have arranged for a supply of the remedy for use in cases which await removal to their hospitals. What is to be eaid concerning Small-pox ? I am writing with the current week's statement of the Registrar-General, on my desk. I notice that the whole of London has been only able to produce two cases of Small-pox. With such a recent history as Gloucester in our minds, it seems scarcely necessary to give further proofs of the efficacy of vaccination in the prevention of Small-pox, but I would briefly refer to the long-looked for Report of the Royal Commissioners, who were so anxious to use up all the information which they obtained, that seven years were occupied altogether before the results of their labours were published. So many extracts from the Reports have appeared in the papers, that everyone is familiar with their general outline. So far as the value of vaccination is concerned, the Commissioners were practically unanimous in recommending it; indeed, some went so far as to declare their belief that re-vaccination should also be made compulsory. The most important differences between the Commissioners had reference to details in mode of carrying out their recommendations. Probably, early in the next Session, Parliament will consider the advisability of increasing the facilities for the gratuitous use of Calf Lymph, as well as other matters which will give effect to the recommendations of the Commissioners. Personally from a very large experience in all matters appertaining to vaccination, I still am strongly of opinion that the greatest success attends the use of humanized lymph. 7 It is not an unknown charge against vaccination, that deaths often result from its practice; in the Appendix to this Report, 1 have given the average number of deaths for each disease during the last ten years. Not a single death has been attributed to "Cow-pox and the effects of vaccination"within the Whitechapel District during the whole of that period. In the entire Metropolis, among a population of four and a half millions, with a total of 81,744 deaths from all causes, seven are certified as due to "Cow-pox and the effects of vaccination."Probably over 100,000 primary vaccinations were performed among the 132,750 infants born during the twelve months, with the result that seven lives were lost from accidents connected with the operation. Much as this is to be regretted, the enormous balance which remains to the credit of vaccination appears from the fact that this splendid discovery which Dr. Jenner made known to the world 100 years ago, has been the means, wherever it is practised, of practically abolishing perhaps the most horrible and loathsome disease which ever afllicted mankind. Last year I had to report that a number of cases of Small-pox had appeared in the District as a result of the influence of certain philanthropic shelters, and that active measures were used to stop the spread of the disease. The year 1896 has produced only two cases of Small-pox, one of which came to us from Gloucester. It appears as though no lesson is sharp enough to teach the value of the operation to those persons who oppose the practice of vaccination. At a meeting of the Whitechapel Board of Guardians, and again in a recent copy of a local newspaper, one of the most active of these gentlemen called attention to some statements which appeared in my last Annual Report upon this subject. This gentleman, in his profuse verbiage, loses sight of one of the main points in my report, which is, that vaccination requires renewal, because although a primary vaccination in infancy does protect for many years against an attack of Small-pox, yet in the course of time its power to protect becomes gradually less. Let me take up the challenge of Mr. Haines, and inform him that the late Sir George Buchanan culled the following statistics from Dr. Barry's Report of the Sheffield epidemic of Small-pox in 1887-8. "In children under 10 years of age, the attack-rate and death -rate per "1,000 were as follows:— "The attack-rate of the vaccinated equalled 5 per 1,000 „ „ un-vaccinated „ 101 „ "The death-rate of the vaccinated „ .09 „ „ „ un-vaccinated „ 44 „ "Under the general circumstances, therefore, of the Sheffield epidemic, "the vaccinated children had, as compared with the un-vaccinated children, "living in the Town, a 20 fold immunity from attack by Small-pox, and "a 480 fold security against death by Small-pox. A consideration of the "attack-rate and death-rate amongst children in invaded households give "substantially the same results. Concerning persons over 10 years of "age, Dr. Barry shows the attack-rates and death-rates to be as "follows:— "The attaek-rate in persons twice vaccinated equalled 3 per 1,000 ,, ,, once „ ,, 19 ,, ,, „ not ,, ,, 94 n "The death-rate in persons twice vaccinated equalled .08 „ ,, ,, once ,, „ 1 ,, ,, ,, not ,, ,, 51 ii "So that the twice vaccinated persons over 10 years of age, as compared "with the un-vaccinated persons of the same age, had a 31-fold immunity "against attack by Small-pox, and a 640-fold security against death by 8 "Small-pox. Apart from re-vaccination in persons over 10 years of age, "if vaccinated at all, there was a 5-fold immunity against attack by "Small-pox, and a 51 fold security against death by Small-pox, compared "with the un-vaccinated people of the same age." Let me add that during the Sheffield epidemic, 372 policemen were employed. All had been vaccinated in infancy. Ten of the men contracted Small-pox prior to February, 1888, when all were re-vaccinated. After the re-vaccination, none were attacked. Of 290 men and boys employed in the Post Office, all of whom in accordance with regulations had been re-vaccinated, not one contracted Small-pox. It is obvious that they would run especial risks as regards exposure. If any more statistics are wished for from Sheffield, they may be culled from Dr. Barry's Report. Now, if it be remembered that although Whitechapel is so well primarily vaccinated, re-vaccination has not been at all general among the residents, and my anxiety in 1895 may be understood. Let it be further remembered that re-vaccination was well carried out in connection with all cases of Small-pox which I investigated, and it will be clear why the threatened epidemic came to nought. Before leaving this subject it were well to state that one of the objections most frequently raised against vaccination, is, that it is opposed to religion and that it is contrary to Bible teaching. The Jews have commenced to take up this line of argument. Hear what the Chief Rabbi says upon this point:—"I am greatly pained at seeing in the Report of the proceedings "at tiie Worship Street Police Court yesterday, that several Jews residing "in Whitechapel have refused to have their children vaccinated, on the plea "that they objected to do so on religious grounds. I hasten to assure you "that there is not the slightest foundation for so silly and absurd a "statement I have at once taken steps, through the medium of the "* Jewish Chronicle,' to state that Jewish parents who refuse to have "their children vaccinated, are guilty of a grave infraction, both of the "Divine Law, and the law of the land." Enteric Fever has been frequently notified during the year, but the deaths from this disease have been few. I received from Mr. Wrack a report concerning this disease, after a visit to the house, made by him at my request. I append a copy of the Report:— "Four cases of Typhoid Fever in one family have recently been notified. The "first was that of a boy aged 4 years, notified on the 23rd October; he died in the "Hospital. The second was a girl aged 3 years, notified on the 2Gth November; "she has been attended at home during her illness. The third and fourth cases, a "girl aged 10 years and a boy aged 15 months, were notified on the 28th "December; they are also being attended at home. The house consists of a "shop on the ground floor and four rooms above. On the first floor the front "room is occupied by the sick children, and the back room is used as a kitchen. "On the second floor are two bedrooms. The family now consists of the father, "mother, and seven children—four girls and three boys, whose ages are 18, 1G, 14, "12, 10 and 3 years, and 15 months, respectively. The father carries on the "business of a butcher and poulterer, in the said shop, and at the time of my "visit at 3 o'clock this afternoon there were several customers in the shop, who "were being served by the father and mother and other members of the family. "Upon proceeding upstairs I found the two last notified cases in bed in the first "floor front room, no one else was in the room with the children. Shortly after I "had been upstairs some of the members of the family came to me from the "shop, and one of them (the eldest daughter) stated that she was nursing her "sisters. As it appeared to me to be advisible for the children's benefit, and for "the public safety to do so, I advised the removal of the children to the Hospital. '' This the parents objected to have done, the father stating that he would sooner "close his shop. I subsequently saw the doctor who could not advise the "children's removal, for the reason that one of them was too seriously ill to be "removed, and that the child's life would be endangered by so doing." 9 The drainage of the house which proved to be defective was reconstructed, and such pressure was brought to bear upon the father, that ultimately he consented to close his shop until the place could be disinfected. I ought to have mentioned that recently a number of cases of Scarlet Fever occured in the Tower of London, which although extra parochial, so far as rates are concerned, may exercise considerable influence upon the South portion of the District. In each case, when requested by the Surgeon-Captain to do so, I arranged for the removal and disinfection of the bedding used by the patient. More than once your Board have been invited by other Authorities to pass a resolution in favour of the notification of Measles, as an infectious disease—but after a careful consideration of the matter, and after having read the opinions of other Medical Officers of Health, I have advised that the time has not yet arrived when such notification would be of much service. The question is one of the greatest importance, and demands more than local action. Nearly 4,000 deaths were attributed to Measles in the Metropolis during the year, and we have to deplore the loss of 45 children from the disease in our own District during the same period. The annual average of deaths for 10 years from Diarrhoea amounted to 54. Last year 37 deaths were registered from the disease. This naturally recalls the agitation which took place during the summer in the East of London, on account of the short supply of water which was afforded by the East London Water Company. Undoubtedly the supply of pure water in the District should be sufficient for all purposes. The curtailment of supply can only be attended by risk to the health and comfort of the people. I look in vain, however, for any evidence to prove damage to health by reason of our limited supply for so long a period. A Committee of your Board waited upon the Directors of the East London Water Company. Everything which could be done to mitigate the evil was promised by the Directors and by their Officers. Stand-pipes were erected in the most desirable places, and a supply of well-corked stone bottles were sent to the office to be distributed among the people where necessary. The drought suddenly came to an end, and during the six or seven weeks following, something like one-third of the year's rainfall took place. The fact remains that provision for the storage of water in East London has not kept pace with the increase of population, and future droughts may, and probably will, be attended by more than inconvenience to the inhabitants of the ill-served area. I notice that a Bill has been deposited for next session by the East London Water Company, by which it is proposed to obtain powers to construct two large storage reservoirs. In the aggregate over 90 acres of ground will be acquired by the Company at Tottenham and Chingford. It is calculated that seven years will be required to complete the works, but in the meantime the Company seek for powers to agree with existing water companies for the use of their works, or the supply of water by them. For the purposes of this Act, power is sought to raise £500,000. It will be seen that Wliooping-Cough was responsible for about an average number of deaths, and that only G deaths were registered as being due to Influenza. The disinfecting apparatus has given satisfaction, and has been of great service during the year. It has been the practice for some years partially, and during the past year entirely, to wash with Perchloride of Mercury solution, the interior of rooms where Small-pox or Scarlet Fever have occurred. This system has been added to the former plan of fumigation with Sulphur. From my experience, I think the innovation is valuable, and it will be continued. 10 After perusing the Tables in the Appendix, which set out roughly the work performed by the Sanitary Staff, you will agree with me that your Inspectors have well carried out most useful and beneficial operations. The increased number of notifications of Infectious diseases, as well as the extra work demanded by the Workshops' Acts of Parliament, have strained the energies of your staff. They have, however, thrown themselves into the work with a will that calls for recognition. I am obliged to do them this justice, because people who are not acquainted with their work are apt to undervalue the services which are rendered by them. As an illustration, you may remember how the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor, through their local agent, proceeded against the owners of Booth Street Buildings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It was alleged that your Officers had not performed their duty. The case was heard upon two occasions by Mr. Cluer at the Worship Street Police Court. The evidence for the prosecution was heard by me with great astonishment. I was present upon subpoena and gave evidence. The best comment upon the whole case is the summing up of the learned magistrate which I introduce here. "I do not see I have any option but "to dismiss this summons, I shall not be entitled to make an order "against the owner of these premises, unless they were in such a state as "to be injurious to health, and that was in the information set out. "With reference to the water-closets, the evidence as to that satisfies me "that though not perhaps such as would be seen in King's Palaces, at "the same time it is said by Dr. Willoughby that they are such as would "be put in by Sanitary Authorities. The principal point made with "reference to them was, that they were not fit for children, but if that is "so, I am afraid I shall have no power, so far as I can see, to order any "special class of water-closet to be put into buildings, so that children "can use them. It is the duty of parents to see that children use them; "if they are in accordance with Sanitary regulations. It is the duty of "parents to see that the children use the ordinary utensils, and not "commit a nuisance. Therefore, I cannot find that these premises are in "such a state as to be injurious or dangerous to health. I thought at "first that if it were true that there were no dust-bins at all all this time "on these premises, it would be impossible not to come to the conclusion "that the owner had been neglecting his duty, but it has now been "explained to me that dust-pails were supplied by the Vestry. "Mr. Easman says he gave notice to Mr. Reekie. It might be that "it was not given so soon as it might have been, but it is quite "clear that Mr. Reekie gave orders to replace them. It is quite "clear, therefore, that he did his best to replace them, because had "notice been given to the defendant with reference to those, it seems "to me he would at once have remedied that defect. The sinks on the "ground floor: as far as I can see, the defect in reference to them is "not that the water makes the place damp, but at one place it runs over. "That is an inconvenience that the owner would remedy of himself, but I "cannot say I should be justified in finding that that is injurious or "dangerous to health. If it were pointed out to the owner that there was "a defect, he would put it right, and you have someone on the premises "like Mr. Reekie, to whom you can apply at once. Under the present "circumstances he appears to have known nothing before about it, and "the injury is unnecessary if the people take care. Now, as to the fenders "upstairs, there is conflicting evidence as to that, and considering this, "that on the last occasion, the whole of the contention as to that point "was—and I was rather surprised at it being put forward by the prosecu"tion—that they were being stuffed up by the tenants who would empty "carrot peelings, tops of vegetables, etc., into these sinks and so fill them "over. I was rather surprised at that being taken as something for which "the owner was responsible. It was clearly a misuse by the tenants, not 11 "by the owner. But, now, to-day, the ground has been shifted from that. "Now it is said that, though there were four inches of cement, it is getting "shifted away, and the water is running down the wall and making the "premises damp. It is clear to my mind that that is not so, because fish "heads and other things are thrown into the sinks. These tenants are "reckless people. I expect they pay considerably higher rent because of "their carelessness. The probability is that if they were not so careless "they would have more money for their food. But I am satisfied that the "owner has seen to the rainwater pipes when they became defective. He "has had them repaired from time to time, and when a shoe is knocked "off it probably takes two or three days, or two or three weeks. That is "one's experience. When a tile is off you do not run at once to a "plumber, and you are not bound at once to remedy it. Other points were "put that there were no lights in the staircases or passages. I have no "power to put gas in a staircase. I have no power to make a man knock "a window through and make a light."* The case was accordingly dismissed with 15 guineas costs. In the course of the evidence the prosecutor, who acts as Inspector for the Mansion House Council, admitted that he never called the attention of caretakers to nuisances which he thought to exist. I can scarcely believe that the Committee and subscribers to this Council are aware that advertisements constantly appear in the local press inviting householders to communicate with the Council's Officers when they become aware of the existence of nuisances. Were the people advised to forward the information to the Sanitary Authorities which exist for the purpose of dealing with them, and whose machinery is ever ready to speedily treat such cases, much valuable time would be saved. In the summer I gave the prosecutor in the above case some post cards requesting him to forward to me any complaints which came under his notice, but up to the present time I have not received a single one. As a noteworthy contrast to this method for proving the raison d'etre for the existence of the Society, I am glad to record my appreciation of the good work carried out by the Jewish Board of Guardians through their Sanitary Inspector. Conducting his duties upon different lines, this gentleman acts as a fellow worker with the Board's Officers. I hope the Lord Mayor and the other Members of the Mansion House Council may be induced to assist Local Authorities in their work for the welfare of their Districts. We shall then most warmly welcome their efforts. OLD AGE DEATHS. Age Distribution of the Deaths. Sub-Registration Districts Distribution.

During the year 1896 a total of 156 bodies were deposited in the Mortuary. For the purpose of awaiting interment 16 bodies were admitted, and upon the remaining 140 inquests were held. 384 inquests altogether were held in the District—208 of which referred to District Residents. Those not held in the Coroners Court, at the Mortuary, took place at the London Hospital or at the Whitechapel Union Infirmary. In 25 of these cases post-mortem examinations were made. The Fees paid by the Coroner for the use of the Court amounted to the sum of £25 4s. 0d. Shrouds had to be provided to the number of 22. Of the total 156 entries, all but 12 referred to District Residents, and they were distributed among the Sub-Registration Districts as follows:- Spitalfields Sub-Registration District Males 32 Females 26 58 Mile End New Town Sub-Registration District Males 8 Females 5 13 Whitechapel Church Sub-Registration District males 24 Females 17 41 Goodman's Fields Sub-Registration District Males 16Females 16 32 Of the total admissions, 72 were children under the age of 1; 16 were between the ages of 1 and 5; 8 were between the ages of 5 and 20; 15 were between the ages of 20 and 40; 25 were between the ages of 40 and 60; 19 were between the ages of 60 and 80 ; and 1 was over 80 years of age. A large number of the cases belonged to persons occupying only a single room. The Mortuary therefore has been a practical help in the sanitary work of the District. This remark applies both to the Jewish and general inhabitants, for all classes can and do avail themselves of the advantages of the building. At a recent meeting of the Sanitary Committee a Member called attention to the good work being performed by the Mortuary Keepers. I desire to endorse the commendation most heartily. 13 In again drawing attention to the Registered Common Lodging-Houses within the District I have little to add to the statement contained in my last Report. The London County Council's Officers are carefully going over the Houses, and improving the drainage connected with them. Your Officers assist so far as to overlook the work during its progress.

Roughly speaking, another thousand persons Model have thus been provided for. Some of these new buildings Dwellings. have only been occupied during a part of the year, and so, for statistical purposes, I have made such allowances as will render the results fairly accurate. The death-rate for the whole population inhabiting Model Dwellings amounted to 18.7 per 1,000 and the Zymotic death-rate was 2.6 per 1,000. As I have more than once suggested, all Model Dwellings are not equally models of good sanitary houses. Those which are below the standard naturally attract a class of occupants who make them rapidly worse. Such buildings will soon be added to the Register of "Houses let in lodgings, and occupied by members of more than one family." Already most of the "Furnished Rooms" have been placed upon the Register, and I hope during the current year to be able to proceed with this special work. When all the new Model Dwellings are occupied, 20 per cent. of our population will be thus housed. 15 The customary Tables are appended:- MODEL DWELLINGS, 1896. Name and Situation of Dwellings.

Of this number 3,748 passed at once into the Infirmary, of these over 67 per cent, belonged either to Registered Common Lodging-Houses or to one or other of the several Philanthropic Shelters of the District.

In many instances they were not accepted. And now, Gentlemen, I propose, without further comment, to leave the many Tables which I have introduced to tell their own story. Taken altogether, I believe the District to be in a much more satisfactory condition than it was in when I last reported. We must remember that so much of it belongs to the far remote, that many houses are very old, and much more supervision is required than is the case in newer neighbourhoods. The assistance of the inhabitants themselves must be invoked to bring to our knowledge nuisances and defects which would otherwise escape detection. Looking round, however, you will see evidence in new buildings appearing in exchange for old worn-out property all over the District, that improvements are being effected, and I would remind you that many more very important works have been carried out within the houses which can only be discovered by a general improvement in the sickness-rate and in the deathrate. In relation to much of our work, I have frequently to ask the advice and assistance of my colleagues, Messrs. Turner and Son, aud I take this opportunity to thank them for their co-operation upon all occasions. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant. JOSEPH LOANE.

Appointed under the said Acts, 35 Board of Works, Whitechapel District, Public Health Department. To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, The accompanying Tabulated Statement sets out the amount of work carried out by us during the past year, and it will be at once seen that a very large amount has been accomplished. It will be seen that a large amount of Re-construction and improvement of House Drainage has been carried out during the year. A good deal of time was given to inspection of Workshops during the year. Very many special night visits were made. It will be seen from the Statement above referred to that a great deal of work has been carried out in this direction. Great attention was paid to the question of uuwholesome food. Particulars of the Articles seized and destroyed will be found at the foot of the said Statement. Sixty-six Summonses were issued under the Public Health (London) Act. The Fines and Costs recovered amounted in all to £31 4s. Od. A detailed statement of these summonses we also hand you herewith. Last year we reported that 1,074 cases of Infectious Disease had occurred, but this year we have to report an increase of 92 cases, making the total for the year 1,166. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. In conclusion, we have to bear testimony to the valuable assistance rendered to us by the two Assistant Inspectors. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, THOS. P.
